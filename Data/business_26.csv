I had the fortune of a friend treating me to the stay while we were in town for the WSOP. From the moment we walked in, it was clear that this was a masterpiece of Las Vegas. The feel, the atmosphere, everything was first class. The hand blown glass tulips in the lobby are breathtaking. There is an air of classiness to this place that seems lacking in other casinos (not all of them) on the strip. Bellagio feels like it runs at a slower, more deliberate pace. The staff were first class and very professional. 

The room itself made you want to stay and appreciate it. Everything from the fully stocked wet bar, to the view, to the absolutely gorgeous bathroom with steam shower and hot tub, to the most comfortable beds just made the Bellagio steal the show. The view of the strip is awesome. There is so much to do in the hotel\/casino that you could really just stay there; lots of high end shops, restaurants, salon & day spa, etc. can fill your day with activities.

Fortunately, I had been to Vegas twice prior to staying here so I could justify just hanging out and taking in as much as I could. Everything about the Bellagio is just dripping with elegance. I know that now, it is considered one of the ""older"" hotels on the strip, but that does not make it any less appealing. At night time, it is always an experience to go take in one of the fountain shows. 

Yeah, it's pricey, but it's doable if you're visiting off-season and work your magic on the internet to book a room with them. The room service is flawless. 

On the casino floor, they are very aggressive to make sure you have drinks while you are gaming and even if you are not. I came down the elevators early one morning around 5:45am to grab a newspaper and a coffee. A very attractive young waitress approached me as I walked out of and asked me if she could get me a drink. I told her I was just looking for some coffee and a newspaper. She told me she would go get me one and asked me if I would like Bailey's with it, to which I happily accepted. I wandered over and grabbed a newspaper, and she was waiting for me with not one, but two cups of coffee with lids on them.

Bellagio will always hold a special place in my heart. Great memories and I hope to be back one day. Without hesitation, 5 stars.",5,0,0

Went to the pool as well, hard to find anywhere to sit, but 3 - 4 pools so loads of space to swim and relax.
Right in the centre of the strip so great location, and fountains are icing on cake. 

If I can afford it would stay here again.",1,0,1

From there you can get most anywhere on the strip fairly quickly. Of course the exterior and interior are nice as well. The building is well maintained. The staff are generally friendly and helpful. The nice lady checking me in was nice enough to print me a new Mlife card.

I do love how many elevators they have. You rarely have to wait at all. I know this seems trivial, but it is important to me. The rooms are nicely appointed. The bed was a little stiff for me though. The bathroom had a large stand alone shower. This is another one of those small things that are important to me.

There is a conveniently located shop adjacent to the elevators. This makes it very easy for you to pick up water and snacks on your way up. Also there are a couple of cafes just a short walk from the elevators. This makes it fairly easy to grab a coffee in the morning.

While this is not my favorite casino to stay at on the strip. It is one of the nicest and certainly worth consideration.",12,9,10

I truly don't get this place (or Vegas for that matter).

I have a friend that had some comps,who gave me a gift card to take my elderly aunt and sister to the buffet here ,but they quit giving out line passes.

What that means is that at lunch or dinner,there are about 200 hundred people in line and about an hour to two hour wait .

When you've got a cranky 86 year old it's not much different than a cranky 3 year old,except the 86 year old can dish out f bombs at a higher rate than the 3 year old.

I ended up trying to use the credit at some of the other eateries in the place by myself,but the prices at these places were just atrocious.

Even if you have a $150 buck credit,you notice how much of a rip off these places are when compared to places in the bay area.

Danko's and Masa's seem cheap in comparison.

But as the locals say,if you want to lose money,the strip is the fastest place to do it.",2,4,0

As some have mentioned, I began to feel as if I were being nickel and dimed more than I should considering the overall cost of staying there. I'd guess that my standard King room might have cost me on average about $325-$350 per night. It was fine but relatively small when compared to other rooms I had stayed in on the trip (e.g. Delano). I had a minor problem at check-in that was not sue to them and they handled it reasonably (two prior hotels had run my charges through on my card and it had pushed me over some daily card-use limit I had not known I even had and so they were unable to run an incidental's charge through in advance). They waited until day 2 to run it and all was fine). That said, they do some things that are irritating. First off, the cabana process is not friendly. You make your request and IF they decide you get a cabana they call you around 8AM the day of and you need to go down and pay for it then. This makes it very difficult to make solid plans with friends and family for the day when you simply do not know if you even will have the cabana. That said, the cabana was quite nice.  Unlike others I rented on this trip, your fee does not go towards food and drink purchases (the base charge not including tip and taxes etc was $300). You get a fruit plate and some bottled water and soda but any other purchases are additional but if you only plan on say $200 worth of food and drink then it is comparable to the other locations I experienced (Monte Carlo and Delano). I found the bar-staff to be quite good - a little stand-offish until you have spoken to\/with them a bit but quite friendly after that. I have a platinum Mlife card which made some things less frustrating than they may have otherwise been (e.g. you can get relatively quick access to the Buffet and a couple of other eating places) but still I just had this sense that if they could charge or over-charge for almost anything they did. For example, after spending close to $3k on room, cabanas and food charges they still wanted $7 to print out a damn boarding pass for my flight out - I mean really? Come on...  Food options were exceptional. I only tried the buffet, the cafe, Lago and Noodles but all were fine with Lago and Noodles serving some of the best food I experienced on my trip. Noodles in particular was well-priced and very good and Lago was the best meal I have had in many years - a must-experience if you like quality cuisine. 

 The hotel itself is quite crowded and traffic flow through the casino often suffers from obnoxious souls who never seemed to learn the rules of walking down an aisle or corridor... I also noticed that regardless of the time or table minimum, the pit bosses could care less about your card unless you are dropping a minimum of $25 as your ante\/initial bet. Table staff were efficient and only snooty a couple of times though more than I saw at other casinos. 

 All in all it was a fine place but I think they may be close to jumping the proverbial shark. With new and nice places opening all around it ( Aria Cosmo etc.) it is no longer the single sparkling jewel it once was though it is still quite nice.",0,0,0

What happened to the robes that were in the rooms ? What happened to extra towels and amenities ? What happened to the great service ?  Things have changed drastically. I was very happy with our suite but took some extra phone calls to wash my long hair every morning. Check in lines took around 20 mins ; should have had more windows open knowing the holiday rush.

The first time I stayed there I was blown away by the decor and the service. They seemed to have thought of everything, and more. 

Now I stay at the Bellagio regularly when I am in Vegas. Recently I have noticed a change. The staff is still friendly and helpful, but the standards seem to have slipped. I've noticed the cleanliness in common areas, like the casino, hallways and elevators, isn't what it used to be. 

The only reason I only give this review 4 stars is because my last trip was cut short, when our flights got screwed up by a hurricane at home. I either had to stay longer or leave early. When I asked at the front desk to extend my stay two days they said they were completely booked. The lady at the front desk kept suggesting I try another property. It almost made me feel like they didn't want me there, especially when people I was traveling with were able to extend their stay without a problem. 

I still like the Bellagio the best of all the hotels I've stayed at in Las Vegas. Their rooms are great and comfortable. I just hope they pick up their standards a little bit more to match how they used to be when I first visited there.",2,0,0

The dealers are typically very lively, even though it's a ""fancier"" place than other joints on the strip.  Friendly, and not stuffy at all.  It's of course very nice, even though it's about 15 years old now.  It has held up very well and remains one of the nicest places on the strip.  

The rooms are of average size, with very comfortable beds.  The bathroom is large for a standard room.  Good-sized shower and a tub that most can soak in.  Maybe my favorite bathroom for a standard room in Vegas.

There is delicious food: Jasmine, Prime, Olives, etc.  But, my one complaint about Bellagio's food is there is not much in the way of middle of the road casual dining.  If you don't want a fancy lunch, your only options are snack bar type places or the Cafe Bellagio, which is Bellagio's 24 hour coffee shop (a must at all Vegas casinos).  Even places like Yellowtail and Fix are pricier than a typical casual place, and these are not the top places at Bellagio.  

Bellagio's long running cirque show O is worth the (high) price of admission.  Also, the pool is large and service is excellent.  If you spring for a cabana, you won't regret it.  Excellent service.

Will definitely stay at Bellagio again.  The casino hosts and front desk employees are also fantastic.  Customer service clearly means something to Bellagio, and the employees demonstrate this.",1,0,1

My favorite place to dine inside the Bellagio is Yellowtail. It is located near the valet on Flamingo Rd. There are other amazing dining opportunities all throughout the hotel. There is also a great bakery over by the shopping area where all the flowers are.

The rooms and suites are amazing. They have great views of the Westside of the Valley and of the Strip. The food from room service is better than many of the restaurants that I have eaten at on the Strip.

They have an amazing fountain and light show at night that you can view from the strip or from any of the surrounding area.

The casino itself if very large and they have a very nice high limit room with a very comfortable high limit lounge. There are also a couple of nightlife Venus to choose from.

I really like the fact that you can actually walk out the back of the hotel over to City Center (Vadra).

I highly recommend frequenting the Bellagio.",12,1,5

The Good Things:
We had a fountain view on the 23rd floor for $159 per night. I felt that was a good price for the view we had. The view was wonderful! We really enjoyed tuning into the TV station to watch the fountain and listen to the accompanying music. The room was nice but not over the top opulent like the Venetian. 

Housekeeping staff was very nice. I like getting chocolates at bedtime.

Coconut gelato at the gelato shop on the way to the pool--FANTASTIC. Yes, it's $7.50 but it was actually worth it.

Lots of shade around the pool. Plenty of chairs\/loungers.

The Bad Things:
On Tuesday, Friday and Saturday nights the disco over at the Paris Casino is so loud it actually shook our windows and thumped in our room until 3:30 a.m. We complained at the front desk but the response was ""there is nothing we can do about it."" It is incredible that the city of Las Vegas allows that much noise. Really, this is a shame because the fountain\/lake view is so nice.

Front desk staff smiles but basically they do not really do anything special or try to accommodate. The other couple we traveled with thought they had booked a handicapped lake view room. Unfortunately, that didn't exist; all handicapped rooms look over the pool. She wanted to view both rooms to decide which to pick and it was almost impossible for the hotel to accommdate this.

There's nothing cheap to eat there. We had lunch at a crepe shop and each savory crepe was about $13 and barely filled with anything. We ended up eating at other casinos. Actually, right across the street at Paris is a fantastic bistro with outside seating.

Way too much smoke in the casino and lobby area. 

Lobby & casino too crowded--you are always bumping into people.

Overall:
To me the conservatory isn't that special but I know it's a big attraction for most. 
The hotel lobby is jam packed, the casino is jam packed...it's just so crowded.

I would only stay here again with a lake view and I would make sure it's not during the disco days at the Paris.",3,0,0

Sure Steve Wynn went on to bigger and arguably better things at the Wynn and Encore. But when it comes to classic styling, the Bellagio takes the crown.

There are several reasons why the Bellagio still tops my list. One huge reason is the awesome fountain display out front. It's easily the best free entertainment we have on the strip. Whenever I have friends visit from out of town, I always recommend they catch a show or two. My favorite, hands down, is Con Te Partiro (Time to Say Goodbye), but anything from Frank Sinatra satiates my appetite for dancing water. Heck, I'll even take some Celine.

I have also stayed in one of their suites. This was years ago right after Ocean's 11 came out. Some friends were intent on experiencing the Vegas depicted in the film and pretty much showed up to the front desk and paid for the room. It's one of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in. I've seen the suites at the Venetian and Palazzo and they are very nice too, but there's just something about the Bellagio.

Don't forget the always changing Conservatory and it's seasonal botanical garden display. They don't seem to change it out as often as they used to, but it's always worth checking out.

Of course, you also have the hand-blown glass flowers that adorn the ceiling of the foyer. I didn't fully appreciate them when I first saw them, but they've grown on me. Just the amount of work that went into all that art - it's truly amazing. In fact, that was the reason I went there today and consequently, that's pretty much the reason why I'm writing this review. I snapped a pic for my daily photo blog and I needed an excuse to share it here on Yelp.

Sure other strip hotels have outdone the Bellagio. Sure it's no longer the place to be on the strip. But class never goes out of style. And the Bellagio has plenty of it.",5,2,3

Although I've given this a 3 star rating, it is almost a 4 star -- no thanks to their service.

I booked a suite at the Bellagio and checked-in in their exclusive lounge. The lounge was pretty and the lady that checked me in was nice enough, but she was working at the speed of slow. She was banging on the keyboard like she was writing a dissertation -- what on earth would you need to type into a computer to check a person in? 

After checking in, we walked to the suite and we very pleased with it, the room looked great, the view was spectacular.... until a member of my party stepped on a broken needle. We called down to complain and to get housekeeping to come re-vacuum the room since we had kids with us. Some guy in a red suite came up to take an incidence report, and when he asked if there was anything he could do for us, we asked for some room slippers. To which he told us that this was house keeping's duties and we were to call house keeping directly. Really?  Passing the buck like that? 

I had also asked for a roll-away that never showed up, I called again before leaving for dinner and was assured that it would be taken care of. When I returned at midnight, it wasn't around and I had to call  a 3rd time -- the person answering actually said ""oh it hasn't been taken cared of yet?"".

After the vacation I was sent an email asking for my comments. I laid out the issues and clicked on the check box saying it was okay for them to contact me to resolve issues I might have. 3 months after I have not even had an email from them.

We love Bellagio for several reasons, and they all showed themselves during this recent stay: 

1) Breakfast buffet, which is the BEST breakfast buffet I've ever seen, is only $18.99. That is one of the best-kept secrets on the strip. Even at Bellagio, you're going to pay at least $18 for a decent roll at Yellowtail. 

2) The game floor is simply organized and very comfortable. during our entire weekend, we only heard ""insanely fat screaming craps winning guy"" one time. The rest of the time was chill, because honestly most Bellagio guests could not possibly care any less about losing money.

3) Outstanding rooms. Bellagio is the best bang for your buck. At the end of a long, stinky day in Vegas, it's so wonderful to see that stone walk-in shower, and, this is one of the few Vegas hotels I've enjoyed where the climate control actually works right.

4) Service. From the front desk to the towel girls at the pool, Bellagio does service well. It's a travesty there are idiots on this Web site that would rate this place one star because he couldn't get his stupid handbag charged to his room bill. It's really, really sad. But in good news, attention to detail is NOTICED. Look at the pic of what they gave my baby, for example. Cute!

When we arrived we stood in one of the lines for check in and when the other representatives were done with a customer, instead of calling us they would take people that had just walked in, so we were ignored.  After calling several ""Excuse Me's"" and being ignored for about 10 minutes, our line moved and we actually got to the front of the line.  This same thing happened when we were checking out.  Were we being ignored because we are hispanic?? Hmm, it makes me wonder, and THAT is sad.

ALSO, we got our room and I went in the shower, well I was in there for about 5 minutes when I noticed the water wasn't draining...eww, it was just pooling at my feet.  This is a shower where it's detached to the tub and the shower is in a stall with a glass door.  Well the water started to pour out of the bottom of the shower door, so I had to hurry up and get out.  The water was not draining, so my husband wasn't even able to take a shower.  I called the front desk and had someone from maintenance come and look at it, and then it was fine after that.  But for a high-priced hotel like this, you should not have to have experience that.

To top things off, when we checked out, we had charges that were added to our room that weren't hours.  After talking to the representative and her manager and explaining that we were in other hotels during the time of those charges, and we had proof, they credited our credit card ""temporarily"" while they investigated.  Someone charged all kinds of drinks and food to our room.  How easy it is, just say, please charge this to our room, and it's someone else's.  I would stay at The Mirage next time.",0,0,0

The interior décor is enchanting.  The lobby is always whimsical and the garden area in front of the Bellagio Café changes to different creative themes nearly every time I'm there.  I always stay in the Spa Tower, so I can't speak for Casino tower but the rooms are very nice, updated, and the housekeeping staff does a great job making the room spot less day after day.

The dining options available at this hotel tend to be more upscale, so if you're looking for a more casual location you will probably want to go elsewhere.  I do like the night time bar options, there are many different atmospheres and most people will be able to find one they enjoy.

I look forward to my next Bellagio trip and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a visit.",1,0,0

The beautiful hand blown glass flowers on the ceiling are hard to look away from.  I had the desire to lie down on the floor and take a picture of them.  Good thing I didn't; Michael Jackson (yes THE MJ) was in the hotel and his fans were in a frenzy to get pictures of him.  Hotel security did a grand job of cocooning him and moving him away from the crazed fans and those of us just trying to check in.  That was the start of our 10th anniversary trip to Las Vegas.  The hubby and I wanted to ""class up"" our annual sojourn to Sin City and decided to go for broke on the hotel scene.  We'd checked out the pool the year before (thank you Mr. Security Guard) and decided this was the place to be to celebrate 10 years of wedded bliss.  I mentioned to the check-in gal that it was our anniversary and she graciously upgraded our room to a full fountain view.  The room was oversized and gorgeous.  I loved the button on the bedside table that controlled the curtains.  Super cool!  The linens on the bed were sumptuous.  The bathroom was very large and the shower was big enough for 5 (we only tried the two of us).  The velocity of which the water came out of the showerhead was that of a fire hose.  It rinsed my long hair in record time.  I loved that shower and miss it daily.  The pool - wow!  It is really a treat especially when you rent a cabana.  The hotel gives you a dedicated minion that checks on you to make sure you are watered and fed and have fresh dry towels.  The restaurants in the hotel were okay; nothing show stopping about any of them in my opinion.  We've stayed at the Bellagio on three other occasions since the 10-year anniversary, most recently for our 15th.  There are a few of the same restaurants; quite a few have changed out.  Next time I'm there (hopefully this summer) I'll make an effort to try a few of them.

On the plane ride home after our first stay at the Bellagio, my husband looked at me and said ""we can't ever stay anywhere else when we go to Vegas, huh?""  I gave him the ""you gotta be kidding me"" look and then smiled.  I've stayed at other hotels since our first Bellagio experience with girlfriends and constantly compare each hotel with the Bellagio.  As far as I'm concerned, none of them come close.

 The conservatory is a must see, which is to say if you havnt seen it, you must! Be ready though, cant take two steps in there in the evening on the weekends without ruining someone picture. So be creative (since youre going to be in them anyway) 

The conservatory is changed for several seasons - chinese new year, spring summer\/4th of July , autumn, Cmas.  

The water show is a great free attraction and is best seen from the dead center, in front of the hotel on the strip. (Although the bestest view is from any of the middle suites (the big round ones with the balconies on both sides of the living room).  Show is every 30 min (i think) at night. Go at night if you can - makes for better pics and its just not the same without the lighting.

Also, check out the lobby (front desk) and the upside down glass sculptures\/umbrellas\/chandelier thing by Dale Chihuly.

If youre down on the strip, walking , the last thing you want to do is go into a hotel and .... walk. But this hotel is worth checking out. Or grab a seat at the Petrossian Bar (right off the front desk\/lobby area), order a drink and nurse it cuz its a great place to people watch.

To the left of the hotel, under the giant sign is the moving sidewalk. So you can take a break and ride in. Drops you off near the front entrance. Youll just be an escalator ride away from the front doors and the Petrossian Bar and that umbrella sculpture thing.

The pool area is very nice but its just a pool. That is to say its not a lazy river (MGM) or a giant wavepool (Mandalay Bay) just a pool. Kind of a disappointment  there.  

The typical rooms are.... typical. Not the greatest. Suites (even the small ones ) kick *ss. If youre going to get a small suite get one on the end and strip side so your view wraps around.",0,0,0

The room was not up to par for most standards.  If you book a smoking room try to put more then one ashtray in it.  The most disgusting thing is that my girlfriend found a USED CONDOM WRAPPER IN THE NIGHTSTAND DRAWER ON THE BIBLE!!!!
Yes that is not a misprint, a condom wrapper in the drawer!!!

Th check in lines take forever. We got in line about 1pm and it took nearly an hour until we were able to check in. 

The hotel hallways are very elegant, but the rooms could use major upgrades. I think I liked the bathroom better than the room itself. The major plus is that we had a lake view room which faced the Bellagio Fountains. I loved waking up to the view of the fountains and the view of all the other hotels. There is a channel on the TV that you can turn to so that you can listen to the music that is being played on the street level. 

Keep in mind, this is not a modern day hotel room. Bellagio wants to keep their hotel looking elegant and European. The bathroom has a seperate tub and step in shower. There is a mini bar and fridge stocked up but of course, the prices are steep. The lady at check in warned me not to open the fridge or else it would charge us! We were able to snag a complimentary mini fridge to be put in our room. Go over across the street to the ABC Store in Planet Hollywood to stock up on some water, enery drinks and alcohol.

I appreciated the box of Bellagio chocolates that were given to us. The chocolates were so delicious!

Some of the staff were pretty snotty and rude to us on some occasions. One of the cocktail waitresses never asked us if we wanted a drink but gladly asked the guys next to us. Why? Because they had hundreds of dollars in their machine. 

And when I went down to the front desk to ask for our free passes to The Bank nightclub, the lady at the front desk rudly told me that the concierge was closed for the night and that they didn't have any passes to give to us.

I am basing my review solely on ambiance and casino alone. 
Everything at this casino is so extra and glamorous and it makes the ideal place to visit even if you aren't able to stay at the hotel. 
The most important thing to see at the Bellagio are the fountains. 
The first time I visited Vegas I didn't know that the fountains turned off! The Schedule is 
Mon-Fri 3:00 PM-8:00 PM every half hour, 8:00 PM-12:00 AM every 15 min
Sat,Sun, Holidays-12:00 PM-8:00 PM every half hour, 8:00 PM-12:00 AM ever 15 min
They have a list of songs on their website if you are wanting to share a romantic moment with that special someone. They have everything from Bruno Mars Uptown Funk to Luck Be a Lady by Frank Sinatra. 
It is best seen at night and its amazing how cool the air feel after the show. And there will be a ton of people in costumes and people with coolers selling beers.
Another thing to see at the Bellagio is the Chihuly glass ceiling, you literally can't miss it. After seeing the museum in Seattle, this is amazing how many there are. It takes a lot of work!
The last but not least mandatory thing to see if the Bellagio gardens. They exchange out every so often with different themes. I have been lucky enough to see the underwater theme and fall theme which features 500 lb pumpkins! 
There are shops and an art gallery that require the purchase of tickets but still fun to see.
Bellagio also house the ""O"" cirque du soleil which is an amazing show! But the most expensive of all the shows. The stage is amazing.
The casino is just as great as the hotel! It is massive and have a ton of different theme slots. 
There doesn't seem to be any low dollar table games but with the amount of people that are in the casino, it is probably because they don't have to.

We pull out the Expedia confirmation and show her. Puzzled for a moment, she then chirps back, ""Oh, that's just a request.

The room only had a old CRT TV.  And the internet is not included.  $19 per day.

The pool was cool,... but the water was not very well heated compared to other hotels like the Encore for example.  And they don't have free bottled water there, just a fountain.

The casino itself is very crowded.  The staff not very friendly most of the time.  And they look like they distain you if you don't gamble with $25 or $100 chips.

The Fountains Of Bellagio, very simply put, is a $40 million dollar water show. There are over 1,000 tubes of compressed air that take in the water from the lake and, with different pressures, patterns, and locations, rocket the air through the water, making the water in the ""lake"" jump to dizzying heights.

Though MGM Mirage Resorts has done a better job of keeping up the Bellagio than their other previously Wynn owned properties, you can see her beauty has faded a bit. 

All of the elegance that Steve Wynn put into this hotel is still there, just like I said, faded, a bit dated, and somewhat empty feeling - many of the machines and gaming areas could use an update as well but they do their jobs, which is to take your money while you wait for your complimentary beverages while trying to outsmart a video poker machine that was new and technologically advanced in 1994.",10,9,8

Attending an annual conference at Bellagio, and each time I have problems that don't seem to be able to correct. It is mostly around staff and lack of training. Last year it was casino issues and lack of waitstaff (I spent well over $1500 in the span of a couple of hours and could not get a bottle or glass of water). Numerous staff passed by and said they would get someone to help me. Never happened. After 2 hours, I had to get up and go spend $5 in the gift shop for a small bottle of water. This is how you treat your gambling customers? Spoke to a manager, and she told me I needed to be patient. Lacked any sense of professionalism for a hotelier of a 'premium' hotel. Didn't offer to reimburse me for the water.

This evening, upon returning to my room for the evening, I stopped at a vending machine for a water and bag of pretzels. Machine would not dispense pretzels. I tried to get them out, but the machine was jammed. These things happen- I get it... I went to a house phone and after explaining to the operator, she told me she had to transfer me to front desk. After standing in the hallway after a 12 hour work day, wait time for front desk was 12 minutes. Agent advised me there was nothing she could do, as mini bar staff were gone for day?!?  Then told to take 1 snack from mini bar and 'my account with be noted'. Snacks are super expensive from mini bar (again to be expected at a premium hotel.  Choices were not what I wanted. Was trying to get some healthy nuts or pretzels and room mini bars are just candy.

Agent lacked any empathy, which is my issue for which I am writing this. She barely spoke English (again, no problem with that, but a cultural difference in trying to explain my situation. It's called customer service.

So, I just find for a hotel charging $300-$400 a night and not be treated with any respect, like I was bothering her, was disturbing.

I tweeted several msgs last year after my casino experience and never heard back from anyone at Bellagio.

I travel often for work, and last week was at a Hampton Inn (mid\/average class hotel). When checking in, Staff asked me what time my flight was on departure day. I advised mid afternoon. Response ' would it help if we have you a late check out so you don't have to sit at the airport'. Excellent customer service at a hotel costing me $129 per night.

There are various reasons that lead me to that decision including the classic decor, the stunning glass sculpture in the lobby, the serene pool area, the sports book, upgrades when available, the fountains, the shops, Olives, the location and convenience of getting out and about to other great spots and on a personal note it is where we stayed when we got married.

I actually almost missed my wedding because I fell out of my pedicure chair at their salon and fell right on my ass but they helped me up, made sure my manicure and pedicure made it through the ordeal and off I went.  

We received an upgrade for our next trip over my embarrassing act of incoordination which wound up garnering us a higher floor basic room - not a great upgrade but I appreciated it all the same.  On a previous trip we had been upgraded to a gorgeous corner suite simply because we checked in late and that was all they had left.  I work in the hotel industry so I understand completely that based on availability actually means exactly that.  It is unfortunate that so many people get upset when they cannot get a late checkout or early check in and think that the hotel is giving them a hard time or is being inflexible.  Those same people would be upset if their room was not ready at check-in time.

I knocked off one star for the je ne sais quoi want to seem wealthy feel that oozes from the guests here.  They have some great deals on their room rates so not everyone there is as uberwealty as they purport to be.

Amenities and service is always top of the line and the view from most of the rooms are gorgeous. Views ranged from overlooking the water show which plays ever hour in the day than every 15 at night. I believe the water show ends at 11pm\/12
Other views were with a private pool and garden along with the view of the Eiffel tower. And the basic room had a view of the pool.
4x a year they have a wonderful garden area in the main lobby which always blows my mind: sea horses made of flowers, a walk through 20 food aquarium. Beautiful and wonderful flower arrangements and my favorite is the Christmas special with thousands of poinsettias and a large (100 foot or more- who knows) Christmas tree.
The only bad occasion I've had here is with Bernardo at the front desk. And it was nothing Bernardo did. Bernardo had excelled superb customer service! This experience by far was by no means his fault. 
Story: I went to visit a friend on a Saturday night and left some luggage and a Bluetooth JBL speaker. He left Sunday morning and I was unable
To grab it. So I asked him to drop it off which he did. 
I'm here on Tuesday- 2 days later where I head to the front desk and I am told that all items regardless of if they are know to the owner get sent to lost and found. Bernardo and I called lost and found 2x which I was told it was not there even though my name was associated with this expensive item and piece of luggage. 
When I asked if I could come down there they said I couldn't because it was in the employee lounge. After asking and calling repeated times to go down there because I knew they had the girl looked 1 more time and found it because someone at the front desk didn't write my or my friends name and also wrote the wrong room number. So unlike the bellagio. They always pay so much attention details. After waiting for more than 20min for security to bring my stuff up- Bernardo went out of his way again to call them again to which I waited another 10min for them to pick up- to which they said the item was en route. 
A total of almost an hour later- I was greeted by a pleasant sweet man named Stephen who made me fill out paperwork and told me that no one had told him. He sincerely apologized and was so-so so sweet about it.

The facilities are nice but nothing to rave about - I mean where are the yummy healthy snacks like dried fruit and nuts? I will probably never book another appt here again. I'll just stick to the hotel accomodations.",1,0,0

Admittedly, the design of the Bellagio is a bit too gaudy and flashy for my minimalist taste but, it IS Vegas folks and everything is OVER THE TOP in Vegas! 

It definitely has some of my favorite designer shops a la Miucchia Prada as well as Tod's and so I like it already! We checked out the pool area and it seems really tranquil with many separate pools instead of just one central pool area unlike the Mirage where we stayed at. I like that their pool area is broken out to allow some peace and quiet for those wanting some respite from the masses and partying.

I love the palazzo design and layout of it as well which is different from the other hotels we explored. It's definitely tasteful and not only looks rich but feels it as well.",1,0,0

I prefer to gamble at the smaller casinos where the dealers actually smile, talk to you, and help when necessary.  I felt the staff at the Bellagio are asked to be aloof, which is OK, but I require a bit more attention.  Yeah, I know I am just saying that I am high maintenance.  The wedding we went to in the Bellagio was totally awesome though.


Since I can't find the spa I will up my rating - the spa itself is fantastic and beautiful, but the treatment I got was great.   I got a seaweed bath with a mini-facial.  I think the bath was better than a massage all these wonderful jets working on your tired muscles.  Yummy!  So that's the upside.  Here's the down side - 1.  I get there and spend about 1.5 hours in the spa area.  I am told to go to the ladies lounge 5 minutes before my scheduled appt.  which I do.  I am there and just relaxing when  a loud-ass woman and her loud-ass daughter walk in.  They are pretty much screaming, which is totally killing my relaxation.  Also the woman's voice is annoying and is grating on my nerves, but of course that's just me. What did I expect you ask?  I expect a staff member to shush noisey lady and noisey ladies off spring.  2.  They check you in while you are sitting in the lounge area the girl tells me you will be in the spa area.  She checks everyone else in and makes an announcement - ""If I have just spoken to you, please come with me"".  So I get up and I walk with her.  I sit in another lounge for 10 minutes.  She comes back and says to me - oh I told you to stay in the spa area.  I say no you didn't you told me my treatment was in the spa, which means where I am currently.  What did I expect?  She should have been clear and said the following people follow me to the massage rooms.  If you are having any other treatment stay here.  3.  Here's the kicker.  We bought our friends who were getting married a nice spa package.  I created a specific package for them, by talking to one of the salon package coordinators.  I set this up at 1pm via phone.  With the understanding from the package coordinator that a letter detailing the package would be written out on Bellagio letterhead and would be given to me when I arrive to the spa.  I get to spa at 2:45 - letter is not complete, but they assure me that I will have the letter the minute I walk out of the spa.  OK - 6pm, wedding is at 7 - I am showered and 1\/2 way ready.  I need to put my dress on and also put my makeup on.  I get to the front desk - they have no idea where the letter is.  Plus the people that know about it are gone...  I start getting agitated.  I have 30 minutes to put on my face and get dressed.  No one can help me.  I stand around for another 10 minutes - I am assured by the manager they will find said letter and would deliver to my room before 6:30.  I go to my room wait until 6:45, no one shows up.  We head out  'cause we can't wait anymore.  I run into one of the spa girls as we are walking and luckily she has the letter and everything is OK.  I am upset, because I had this wonderful treatment I paid for and they totally killed the relaxed feeling I had by losing the letter.  So annoyed!!!!",0,0,0

Besides being front & center for the Bellagio fountain show, you can program the TV to sync up with the music that's accompanying the water show outside. It had been years seen I've seen the water show and seeing it from that perspective was great. 

The room had a sizeable bedroom area with full master bath and spa\/sauna room, jacuzzi tub and the living room had a good sized couch, 4-seat table and it's own bathroom.

CASINO: Nice dealers though Lady Luck was not on our side. Good free drinks at the tables while you gamble though somewhat slow drink service

CLUBS: Actually went elsewhere for our clubbing experiences but heard the Bank was a hit although the boys said they ""dropped off all our money at the Bank""

This review comes to you as a working American who isn't checking in under VIP status. 
Yes, their display in their hallway is fantastic. Yes, they have the iconic fountain show. You can see those things without staying there though, and I would highly recommend you do so. 

Rolled up to valet in my rental, which is a baseline vehicle. Valet doesn't seem interested in assisting us since we weren't in a Bentley or Maserati, but other 5-star hotels were perfectly friendly to us, and of course we tip well along the way. 

Front desk was polite but lacked ATTENTION TO DETAIL. It was my birthday, and had the resort agent noticed on my ID, that would have been a nice acknowledgement as every 5-star property on the strip always asks if you are celebrating something. The Aria did last year, and they sent up a nice warm welcome with a box of macarons for me. 

Regular resort rooms lack ATTENTION TO DETAIL.  I really should have taken pictures of all of this as it sounds ridiculous in a review.
- Regular resort rooms are just PLAIN. They are NOT special, fancy, large, or particularly pretty.
- Towels are BEYOND OLD for a 5-star hotel. They are raggedy and need replacement. Fine if this was a 3-star Hampton or Drury, but even they have nicer towels than the Bellagio. 
- Bathroom shower head was green with hard water build up. 
- No power plugs near night stands without you digging around.

You can pay the same at the Venetian and have a large SUITE with more dining options.
You could stay at the Aria and be welcomed with bedside chocolates, curtains that magically pull apart when you walk in, and the TV softly plays music with a welcome screen for you. 
You could stay at the Encore and get free upgrades for a special occasion. 

For ""commoners"" like me, I recommend you make a field trip to the resort display and fountain at night, but go stay somewhere else that is more of an indulgent experience and not just a place to sleep at night. If I wanted to do that on my birthday, I would have stayed at the Tropicana.",15,6,8

The hotel gets too crowded with tourists coming from other hotels to look at the garden. The casino is rather small and is over crowded as well.

I got a little annoyed because they would always call when we had room service! My husband didn't mind though. He thought it was great.

The rooms are well appointed and feature fantastic amenities. For some strange reason I am drawn to their bath soaps and shower gels. If possible, I do suggest getting a lake view room so that you can take advantage of watching the water show. If not, the views of the mountains isn't bad, and to be honest, you are hardly ever going to be in your room anyway.

The shopping is higher end, so if that isn't your thing..skip it. I pick hotels to stay at for the location and the rooms anyway! So the shopping is simply an added plus! Great restaurants and fantastic show options.

Location: The location of the Bellagio is convienent. It is located on the Las Vegas Strip and is close by to many restaurants and shopping malls. 
Check In: The check in process was long but worth the wait. We had all of our questions answered about rooms and what not. The receptionists were very nice and apologized for our long wait which was very much appreciated. When we asked about what was in our originally booked resort room, they explained it. Also, since we decided that the room wouldn't meet all of our needs, they offered us an upgrade to a suite. So we accepted and they gave us a map of the hotel and our room keys and off we went.
Room: We were in the Spa Tower on the 28th floor. When we got to the elevators that would take us up to the room, I was glad to see that there was a security guard on duty to make sure that only Bellagio guests were going in the elevators. Also, for the suites, you have to slide your room key to go up to your room or you wont get anywhere. 
So, we get up to the room and walk in and I was immediately in love! There was a living room area with a mini bar, unfortunately you couldn't take anything from it or else they will charge you. There were 3 bathrooms. 3 BATHROOMS! That's crazy! One of them was just a bathroom, one had a shower, and the other had a bathtub. 2 of the bathrooms in the bedroom had mirrors that had a TV in them as well. You could watch TV while you're getting ready. Thats insane! We got offered turn down service every night of our stay, and even though we said no 2 times we still got the chocolates which were awesome!
Pools: The Bellagio has many pools! I went swimming in the main pool and it was refreshing! Considering it was hot outside, I needed to cool off. The pool was not freezing, but it wasnt boiling hot either. It was just right.
Cafe Bellagio: We ate at the Cafe the first night. The food was so good. I had pasta and I dont remember what my parents had, but we all enjoyed our food greatly! The good thing about these restaurants in the hotel too are that you can charge the meal to your room and they just add it on to your bill.

I was on hold four forty-five minutes.  Then walked down to the front desk which, in Bellagio's defense was very busy.  I ended up calling another property, and we just packed and checked out instead.  

I feel like no matter how large you are if you don't want my business, then I'll be glad to take it somewhere that does.",6,3,1

Being our anniversary and Valentine's, we decided to take them up on their offer.  We've always loved the Bellagio, the grandeur, garden area, restaurants, let's not forget the fountains, mesmerizing, the over all good feeling we get. So, to stay there was a real treat for us.   From the moment we  checked in and checked out was perfect.  Customer service at the registration was so nice and eased us right into our beautiful room.  We were given a choice of the Spa tower for the other one closer to the fountains.  The lady checking us in recommended the spa tower because she said it was quieter and a complete NO SMOKING tower.  We chose the Spa tower.  Our room was very nice.  Amenities to the king size bed made the stay even nicer.  Bathroom was big as was the shower (glass).  

We dined in Olives (excellent as always), The Prime (stunning and wonderful), the chocolate\/pastry\/crepe shop (can't remember the name of it), (delightful).  Sat at a few of the bars (great bartenders) So, we did spend our money at the property.  There is something for everyone.

Also, I made a hair appt.  The lady that styled my hair and did a bit of a trim was a n excellent hair dresser besides being a lot of fun to talk to.  I told her I wanted to have my make up done but, was told by the front desk that there were no more appts. available. She made it happen.  Great guy did my make up, air brushed, mascara, and I walked out of the spa feeling very pretty!  Funny thing was I told my husband I had my make up air brushed.  Later that evening he says, ""so are you going to you get spray painted again"".  I laughed so hard...'no dear, spray paint is for cars, NOT MY FACE!!!"" 

The only problem we saw was on the gambling end of it .  You don 't get points playing table games on your player card unless you bet a minimum of $25 per hand.  The minimum for the game I was playing was $10.  I certainly questioned that with the dealer and supervisor and the only response I got from them was ""that's the way our system works"".  To me it's a rip off!  I gamble, lose money at least give me points!  So, on that note, I stopped playing the table games.  Stayed with the machines, I want my points!

This trip to Vegas (we make them 2-3 x's a year) was the best one over all so far!  Hope the Bellagio keeps sending us more comp offers on rooms ( hint, hint)   We had a wonderful time at the Bellagio!",2,0,0

So I got into bed and felt sand and dirt so I pulled off the covers and GROSS!! Dirt and sand and hair!! Ended up sleeping on top of the bed.

Although this is a bit biased since I did stay in the Presidential Suite the first time I was there.  Since I didn't have to pay for it, it was even better.  2 flat screen tvs, and the bathroom bigger than my room in Torrance (and I have the master), it says a lot.  In room Sauna, jacuzzi, and shower, it was da shit.  

Anyways, besides all that, the rooms in Bellagio were really nice as is the hotel itself.  Many times we'd just go to check out the decoration shown inside the hotel and I have to say they make one of the better drinks when you're gambling on the tables.  Make sure watch O when you're there, I know I plan to again, since I was piss drunk the first time and don't remember much (not very smart, and a nice way to throw away $150).  Bottom line, great hotel to check out and gamble, and don't miss the fountain show, especially at night.  I love the 11:55pm show, where the Star Spangled Banner is played.

The pent house suite is definitely worth booking at least once!!! We had the pleasure of staying there for the weekend a couple months ago and it was gorgeous. The view of the fountain at night was lovely. 

I would highly recommend staying at this hotel when visiting Las Vegas. It is conveniently located in the center of the strip. The Miracle Mile Shops and The Linq Promenade are just a hop and a skip away which makes walking to them a breeze. 

At night, Bellagio hosts a free water fountain show for pedestrians on the strip. It occurs every half hour on the weekdays and every 15 minutes on the weekends. It's perfect to watch and a picture worthy moment! Bellagio also has a beautiful garden with a different theme every couple of months. The current theme incorporates Chinese New Years' decorations. 

The only complaint that I would have about this Hotel is the noise level. No matter where our room is located, regular to pent house, you can always hear the music all the way from Drais up until about 3AM in the morning. I know that it's Vegas, but I haven't had this problem with other hotels. 

Overall verdict: I'll be back!",4,0,1

 From the moment we checked in, it went downhill from there. The service upon check in was horrible. We dragged, rolled and carried our luggage miles from the parking structure to the lobby to be treated as though we were part of a cattle call. We barely had our luggage in the door of the room, door wasn't even shut and there was a housekeeper asking if we had towels, I wouldn't know haven't been in the bathroom yet.. I guess I should have dropped my bags to check as later I found we had no washcloth's or hand towels, ooops. 

Our bathroom door squeeked so loud I bet the entire wing could hear it, in the middle of the night our sink pipes started bubbling and creaking,. Had to close the drain, close the bathroom door and put in ear plugs to be able to sleep, not only that, two lights in the bathroom were burned out, I just don't understand the lack of service in what was once a beautiful hotel. 

Beware! The in room internet fees are $14.99 for a 24 hour period. There is no quick place to grab a light breakfast. I wanted to use the gym only to find there is a daily $25 fee, unless I wanted to book an overpriced spa treatment then the gym fee is waived.

 We were booked into the hotel for 3 nights. I was then made aware that MGM\/Mirage was considering selling either Bellagio or Mirage due to financial issues and Steve Wynn was interested in buying Bellagio back. Please MGM\/MIrage, sell it back NOW! Bellagio would then be a great hotel once again! Staying onenight at the hotel was one night to many so, we checked out and made our way back to the hotel where we stayed the previous night, life was then good for the remaining 2 nights.

I've stayed at Bill's on the same intersection, and the rooms at the Bellagio, worn by years of use and in dire need of updating, aren't much better. They aren't even much bigger. I normally stay at the Wynn, and there's no comparison. The two hotels are not even in the same league when it comes to standard room size, bedding and beds and bathrooms, so I don't see how Bellagio can charge what it does, except for pure reputation. Its location is both a blessing and a curse. Yes, it's convenient and central, but that also means it's constantly stuffed to the gills with wandering tourists, which strips it of any sense of exclusivity or luxury. Check-in and checkout feels like a cattle call. Here's the real hint: With the exception of the pool, the best parts of the Bellagio can be enjoyed by non-guests. By all means enjoy the excellent restaurants, beautiful fountains and incredible lobby and gardens. Just don't bother overpaying for a sub-Hampton room to do so.",1,1,1

1) The hand blown glass flowers adorning the ceiling of the lobby. If you are a lover of glass art it is worth walking over to the Bellagio just to check it out. It is truly spectacular.

2) The Conservatory is STUNNING! They change it every season with different flowers, plants, bridges, and other amazing exhibitions. There is truly nothing else like it in Las Vegas.

3) The restaurant Noodles. The decor is amazing and the food is delicious. It's funny how many different ways noodles can actually be cooked.

4) Of course, the  Fountains in the front. Definitely something to behold at night with all the lights and the musical accompaniment. Now I would like to share with you a story that will live in my heart forever. One evening I was there with my boyfriend. We had been waiting for the fountains to start for about ten minutes, so we were close to the front. There was a woman in a visor (I don't know why I remember that) and her husband in front of us. The fountains and lights began to the horrific tune of ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion. Oh well, the fountains were still cool. But then I start hearing more singing. My boy notices it at approximately the same time and we kind of look at each other. Then we realize that Visor Lady is emotionally singing along with Celine. We grab each other's hand for support in not busting up laughing. Seriously, this woman was so into it, she practically had tears in her eyes. So did I, but for very different reasons. I thought I was going to pee myself from trying to hold the laughter in. It was one of the best Bellagio Fountain experiences of my life.",0,1,2

The bed cover didnt look like somebody was trying to create a new human being on it - the bed looked and smelled clean).  The tile in the bathroom was the cheapest beige tile but it was matched nicely with the rest of the items. 
The hotel has several restaurants  -most of them looked very nice (we didn't try them all) and 2 of them even have Michelin stars.

RESERVATION IS A MUST! for all of the restaurants for Fridays and Saturdays in particular.
The hotel has several nice stores: Hermes, Chanel, LV, Dior  - Thus, I think the collections  in these stores are not the latest ones. The Sales tax is less then in CA so I recommend to everybody to check out those stores.
Right next to the lobby there is a beautiful garden with Butterfly house (real butterflies!! ) they garden is beautiful too - perfect place for pictures!

The redo on the rooms was done a few years ago so things are still nice and fresh.  Bathrooms are spacious as is the case in most of the big casino hotels on the Strip.  Toiletries are pretty standard.  You get what you need though it isn't L'Occitane or anything to write home about. 

If you're staying during the week or off-peak, you may be able to wrangle a fountain view without paying the premium. 

The garden beyond the lobby keeps the building fragrant and welcoming.  Brightly lit throughout.  Tables limits are reasonable and slots can be generous enough to keep you entertained without doing too much damage to the bank account.  I've seen some big jackpots and I've seen periods of time when the hits have been smaller $75-$200 wins.  Personally, I've had better luck here in the last 2 years than other casinos.  That's just me.

Michael Mina is a great restaurant right in the front of the casino near the lobby.  You can get a whole roasted foie gras lobe there!  Todd English's Olives is a good lunch spot as well as The Buffet should you want to gorge.  Plenty of high end shopping in the walkway to Caesar's.  Nice fitness facility.

Myself and a few friends stayed here for my 30th birthday this past November.  Our room was fitted with 2 queen beds.  The service at the Bellagio was average.  The room was very average and compared to Mandalay Bay was sub-par.  We had plumbing issues where the faucet would drip and not drain well.  The shower and tub were very average, there was no flat screen TV's or anything fancy.  

The plus side to the casino is the art.  The famous glass ceiling is astounding and the walk through art items are a delight.  The fountains are beautiful.  The night club at the Bellagio is called The Bank and is very average though the DJ was good.  We ate at Yellowtail sushi and it was good but not great.  The Bellagio buffet is tasty but doesn't hold a candle in the wind to Wynn's buffet at the Wynn resort thanks to the fact that he sold the Bellagio a few years ago and it is now corporate owned.

Prices for rooms are going to vary widely, of course, but in general, the value for money perception is going to depend more on what you immediately want from your hotel: in short, Bellagio is perfectly placed on the Vegas Strip and is ostentatious about its luxury. The lobby is gorgeous and expansive, with beautiful overhead artwork looking like glossy flower petals, and the balloons behind the receptionist staff is always impressive. I especially loved how the garden is centrally located and, a 1 minute walk from the check-in area, smells fresh and alive with changing displays and landscape architecture. There was a piano bar and many (albeit expensive) options for food around.
Be sure to read the fine print about what is defined as ""spa services"" here. This hotel has a ""resort fee"" that is similar to other M-Life hotels (MGM, Mandalay Bay, The Mirage to name a few) in that it covers nothing other Wi-Fi, a swimming pool and complimentary boarding pass printouts from the Concierge, and that's it. You must pay $30 a day, a PERSON, to use the spa that has bathrobes and steam rooms, and then of course, if you purchase a massage service or something along those lines, it becomes complimentary. However, after stating our case to the spa people, we both got 3 days complimentarily! So we definitely felt hooked up, but it took some effort.
The room itself is beautiful, maybe overhyped as far as space and amenities (for example, you have no way of using the fridge as it is there to merely provide a store for overpriced refreshments), but the view of the fountains, especially at night, is worth it. You will hear ""Luck Be a Lady"" over and over at night, but the first time you see it will be a true joy only available in Vegas. 
Another thing you should know about, which applies to Vegas in general, is the extent to which you will need taxis. If you choose to walk and avoid the expense of taxis, your feet will pay for it, and the heat will be an additional burden. Leaving the Bellagio from your hotel room to make it to the next closest hotel, perhaps Caesar's Palace, will take you a full 15 minutes of fast, intentional walking---and that's just LEAVING!

I flew in from CA and arrived at noon.  My friend was coming from the north and her flight was delayed 8 hours.  Because Expedia did not have my name on the itinerary, Bellagio was not going to let me check in.  They finally relented when I pulled out an email addressed to me by my friend (who booked the room) with the reservation attached.  Customer service?   Terrible.  
In addition, the hotel is dated, dumpy and has the worst wall art ever.  
We had 2 free buffet visits listed on the Expedia itinerary\/reservation.  At check out, we had to pay additional fees ($13) as they said the 'free' visits were only worth $60. Nowhere on any of our documents did it list the cost of the buffet as %60 or as anything else.  Cheap, cheap, cheap trick.  The food at the buffet sounded grand but was mediocre at best. Cheap cuts of meat and pre-frozen, thawed shrimp. 
We had breakfast at Cafe Bellagio and paid cash. It was $60 for 2 for a Denny's quality meal.  However, at checkout, we were also charged $18.99 for breakfast.  No explanation was given.

Perhaps I am but a Vegas buffet noob; I've tried Planet Hollywood's Spice Market, the buffet in Caeser Palace, Rio's Carnival Buffet. I've also tried MGM's buffet, but that was quite a while ago and not fresh in my memory. In whatever case, I found something lacking in each of these buffets -- something that I could not grasp quite what it was, the je ne sais quoi that these buffets desperately needed. Everything that was missing, and then some, was found in the Buffet at the Bellagio. 

I vividly recall our long journey there. We set out from the Palazzo, preparing ourselves for the cold, bitter winds of the desert. Our stomachs growling, our limbs fragile from our fatigue...but we kept our eyes on the prize, focusing on the glowing lights that was the Bellagio.

After what seemed like an eternity, we set foot in the Bellagio. But our hopes plummeted when seeing the line that snaked around the wall. ""NOOO,"" we cried in devastation. ""We'll NEVER get to eat!""

But we had made the long journey there, after all, so we sought to see it through. The minutes seemed like hours, ticking by at a snail's pace.

1.5 hours later, on a Sunday night, we reached the front of the line. $29.95 for dinner buffet! Not bad, not bad at all. We split our group of 8 into two small groups to avoid the mandatory 18% gratuity, and off we were!

I almost plowed the waiter over in my haste to collect my prizes. ""Whoa, calm down there, miss!""

I threw a hasty, ""sorry!"" over my shoulder before continuing onto the beauty I would soon behold. I piled mountains of smoked salmon, crab legs, sashimi (I have never, ever before found sushi at a buffet good, but Bellagio is the exception to this rule). At the table, my friends and I ate in silence, only pausing to say one of the following sentences:

""This is good.""
""Is that good?""
""You should try this, it's good.""

Less than an hour later, we laid in our chairs, breathing heavily. I had to mentally tell myself to breathe, or else I'd forgot to. I believe I ate every single thing in the buffet...

Unter anderem waren noch das Wynn, das Venitian und das Cesars Palace mögliche Alternativen. Die ersten beiden schienen mir preislich etwas überzogen, vom Cesars Palace habe ich leider sehr viele schlechte Rezensionen gelesen. Meine Entscheidung für das Bellagio mag sehr subjektiv gewesen sein, ich habe sie allerdings nicht bereut.

Da nur für eine Nacht gebucht, haben wir uns für die ""Bellagio Suite"" mit einem separaten Schlafzimmer, zwei Bädern und einem Wohnzimmer entschieden. Der Preis von ca. 600 Dollar scheint mir gegenüber dem Wettbewerb und dem Komfort angemessen. Wir wurden im 32. Stock des Nebengebäudes (Spa-Tower) einquartiert.

Der Blick aus dem Fenster war sehr beeindruckend, wenn auch nicht auf den Strip, sondern auf den Highway und das etwas abseits gelegene Rio Hotel westlich. Doch schon der Weg in die Räumlichkeiten inklusive Fahrstuhlfahrt hat schon sehr viel über das Niveau des Etablissements verraten. Der Spa Tower befindet sich von der Lobby aus in entgegengesetzter Richtung zum Casino und der Via Bellagio, der exklusiven Shopping Mall.

Es zählt nicht zu unseren Angewohnheiten, regelmäßig in Fünf-Sterne-Häusern zu nächtigen. Deshalb haben wir die Annehmlichkeiten natürlich sehr genossen. Neben dem eigenen Whirlpool und dem in der Dusche eingebauten Dampfbad wären da zum Beispiel auch der in den Badezimmerspiegel integrierte TV, die Surround-Anlage im Wohnzimmer sowie die elektrisch bedienbaren Vorhänge und Gardinen zu nennen. 

Leider hatten wir keine Gelegenheit die Pool-Landschaft in Anspruch zu nehmen. Anlässlich einer kleinen privaten Feier haben wir allerdings die Gelegenheit genutzt und in einem der vorzüglichen, direkt an den Fontaines befindlichen Restaurants (""Olives"") gespeist. Auch im hauseigenen Casino waren wir dann später noch, jedoch haben wir relativ schnell den Automaten gegen eine gepflegte Bar-Atmosphäre auf der gleichen Ebene eingetauscht.

Das Haus ist irre hoch frequentiert sowohl von Hotelgästen als auch sonstigen Las Vegas Besuchern. Es gibt im ganzen Haus kostenfreies WLAN, das Parken ist ebenfalls gratis. Frühstück gab's in der Jean Philipp Patisserie, fussläufig die erste Gelegenheit einen Kaffee zu greifen und wieder zurück aufs Zimmer zu verschwinden.

First off, I've always preferred the CET (Caesars Entertainment) casinos. MGM Resorts seem second class compared to CET, but nevertheless I had a friend who wanted to explore Bellagio. Having various friends come to Vegas throughout the years I have become somewhat of an expert on where to dine, where to go for entertainment, etc.

I planned out for us to see the conservatory, for us to dine at Bellagio Cafe, and for us to attend the Hyde Nightclub! Now, I had never been to the cafe or nightclub so I was learning more about this casino as well! We had a beautiful lunch at the cafe. The food was delicious and priced well (for Vegas). It provided a beautiful view of the conservatory which of course my friend loved!

After lunch we went back to my house (eight minutes away from the strip) to relax and get ready for the nightclub. We were told it was free open bar until 12:30am. One thing led to another and we were heading back to the strip around 11:30pm. Not wanting to waste more time I opted for valet parking. We then proceeded to the nightclub where we had a fabulous time -- beautiful view of the fountains!!

Everything about this night was amazing!! Until we went to pick up my car. I was out of town when MGM Resorts started to charge for parking so it completely slipped my mind! $18 to have parked for roughly three hours. That is ridiculous!!! Marriott in other cities charges $15 a day valet parking, in and out privileges.

I'm fortunate that being a Las Vegas local I can do self-park free of charge. I will do this in the future. However, being charged $18 for valet rubbed me the wrong way and ended what was a 5-Star night on a low. I was ready to recommend Bellagio to several friends, but because they would have to pay to park, I strongly recommend CET casinos over Bellagio or any MGM Resorts casino. The two exceptions would be if they're with me, meaning they would not have to pay to park. The other exception is them park at the nearest CET property and walk to the MGM Resort of their choosing.

Bellagio was fabulous that night, but CET casinos could've been just as fabulous, if not more fabulous! Those casinos charge $0 to park. Bellagio\/MGM Resorts charge $18. Seems like a no-brainer where to go.",1,1,0

Regardless of which floor you're on, don't expect service - requests are divided among **thousands** of guests... Rooms and amenities on par w\/ any basic Hilton or Marriott property. If you can swing it, the only rooms worth considering are $6k per night - 20ft ceilings, waterfalls, dining rooms, baller furnishings, a butler\/personal assistant for an extra $500\/day.

These virtual towns (the B. had 3000 rooms, 10000 employees) included new diverse and even ""destination"" restaurants.  Some time ago, hearing about this booming restaurant scene (and seeing people like able sommeliers leave the SF area for Vegas careers), I organized some food-centric Vegas visits with several friends, using Bellagio as a base.  We checked out all its restaurants (and many others in town), stayed in various Bellagio accommodations, and by request I got a complete facilities tour, for planning possible future visits or events.  I could tell you more detail, from more experience, about the Bellagio complex's restaurants than most other Yelpers.

I got to know the Bellagio well, warts and all -- the warts finally became excessive.

The Bellagio brought some pioneering, classy eateries to Vegas at a wide range of prices.  Many are independently owned.  They and other Bellagio features added elegance to the Strip, offset by occasional false notes -- reminders that Las Vegas isn't just about elegance or good cooking.  Still, our food experiences were worthwhile, so 2 stars here instead of just one -- for the final incident that forced me to write off the Bellagio as a hotel.

I'll skip over smaller gaffes, like changing suites twice in one stay from quirks like endless big gypsy-type moths emerging from an air vent (""they live here!"" chuckled a maid); or on another visit, finding many room lightbulbs dead, implying no one ever checks them.

On the third, which unexpectedly became the last, Bellagio stay, one friend, arriving from out of town, complained of raucous construction noise through his wall, making a much-needed nap impossible.

I contacted the front-desk manager (Mgr1), who explained that the room next to my friend's needed repair after a guest ""trashed"" it.  (Good old Vegas.)  As amends, she invited my friend to visit the hotel's fancy fitness center and spa, waiving the usual fee.  My friend was satisfied.

On departure, contrary to Mgr1's offer, the bill had a charge for the spa (something like $30).  I explained this to Mgr2, checking me out.  In a suspicious tone suitable for addressing lying children, Mgr2 claimed no knowledge or record of Mgr1's offer, and did not try to check the history of raucous repairs.  (Mgr1, naturally, was off-duty.   If I get a chance to check the trip notes, I'll add both managers' names here.)

What clinched the unprofessionalism was Mgr2 seeming never to stop and consider that I might be honest, and what that would imply.  Nor show awareness of how serious broken promises are in a hospitality business.  Maybe some Bellagio guests, besides ""trashing"" rooms, do pull petty hustles like that (if so, it's another Bellagio reality worth knowing).  But this ball was in the B's court.  I insisted Mgr2 remove the mistaken charge -- the hotel, after all, had my California address (and credit-card info) and could always bill me later, were such a charge ever legit!

Be aware, therefore, that you might well spend thousands of dollars in the Bellagio lodgings and restaurants (including hundreds just in tips), and still be stubbornly accused, via employee screw-ups, of cheating the hotel of $30.  Nor will you get any apology.  (Mgr2 possessed enough information to confirm my explanation and to follow up, if she gave a God damn about customer service and the Bellagio's image; she did not do so.)  It left a bad taste in my mouth.  $30 was zilch compared to the later business that the B lost after that episode.

I've stayed at all sorts of lodgings around the US and elsewhere.  Even those much more modest than Bellagio would consider Mgr2's attitude unacceptable.  Yes, I could have invested more time to complain, written a letter.  Yet Las Vegas's hotel industry is highly competitive.  It was simpler just to warn people away from the Bellagio, and take our later Vegas hotel business to competitors, still within easy walk of the B's worthy restaurants.

All part of the constant reminders of Las-Vegas-Strip priorities.  The touts and pimps out on the strip itself remind you pretty quick, if you take a stroll.

It was a rip-off because we had great trouble connecting to the Internet every day. 

However, the service at the Bellagio was great. Daniel, the concierge, was very helpful when we needed to have our plane tickets printed out. The buffet at the Bellagio was also great.

The Atrium is so unique and so beautiful, you could spend a lot of time just walking through it and looking at the plants and flowers.

Great restaurants on location.  You really don't need to go anywhere else (that's the idea). Buffet is one or the best in town.

So I go for a quick drink and return at 11 to see if there's any rooms available and there was. We get on the elevator and walk into a gorgeous room with a wonderful view. Before I even finish checking out the whole room I get a knock on the door and there's my luggage. Talk about a great start. Mini bar had a great selection and we also ordered breakfast from the menu and my steak and egg was delicious and it also came with a complimentary newspaper of my choice. 

Then It's off to the gym. They have a midsize fitness room with a great view of the pool area and equipped with enough water, towels and headphones for everyone there. The equipment is up to date and very clean. The gym personnel was very friendly and pointed everything out for us that was in that place.

The gambling is also great at this place. They have tons of table games with friendly dealers and like everywhere else, buy-ins change accordingly. They have tons of slots and the sports book is also very nice.

It came from their huge indoor garden display that showcases hundreds of flowers. It's one of my favorite places in the hotel. When you walk in the lobby you are greeted by friendly staff and a clean environment. The smoke smell wasn't super strong which is rare for Vegas. 

When we got to our room we were treated to a clean, enjoyable space. The was no smoke smell and it had a bed, desk, chair, mini bar and a huge bathroom. The coolest thing about the room was the view of the fountain. We watched it go off all night and they have a tv channel that lets you listen to the music it's choreographed to. I also loved the automatic curtains (they opened and shut with the press of a button). The only minor downside is that we could hear our neighbors through the wall.

We used the spa at the hotel and got a couples massage. I was in heaven. If you pay for a service you can use their gym, spa room or indoor spas throughout the day. If we had more time I would have lived In there. The staff was very attentive and helped you every step of the way. 

Later in the evening we saw the O show. I don't want to say too much about this show because it might ruin the experience for you but Go! I strongly recommend this show and know you will love it. I didn't like it as much as Ka but they are both wonderful in their own way.

Bellagio is located between The Cosmopolitan and Caesars Palace. Everything about this Hotel is simply gorgeous! Right when you put your toe inside the Hotel you just smell luxury and sophistication. Their shopping mall is just to die for. You can find any luxury brands possible there. Made a few perfect purchases at the Hermes store, Chanel as well as Louis Vuitton (Mother three brands in my opinion).

From our first stay here in late 1998 to our visit a few weeks ago there are many things to love. But there are also flaws to keep this well shy of five stars.  

Still, our advice would be if you're making your first or only trip to Las Vegas, spring for a room at Bellagio on the fountain side in the Resort Tower (not the Spa Tower), making sure you're on the 17th floor or above in this 36 floor property.  We did this this on our first stay.

If you're not interested in seeing the fountain and lights on the strip, a room overlooking the pools (with the same advice about floor location) is also a good choice.  Same rooms with lower rate.  We chose these on the 22nd floor this time.

GOOD THINGS:

1. AMBIANCE \/ DESIGN PUBLIC AREAS:  From the breathtaking Dale Chihuly glass sculpture Firori di Como (flowers of Como as in Italy which was original Bellagio owner Steve Wynn's inspiration) on the lobby ceiling to the seasonally changing garden in Bellagio's glass enclosed conservatory to the artful woodwork in public spaces, this is for our money the most beautiful and tastefully restrained of all Las Vegas casino hotels.  We love walking through the shopping plaza and looking up to see glass elements that change seasonally and are suspended overhead.  Public spaces are nicely accessible to folks using wheelchairs or pushing strollers.

2. GUEST ROOMS: The 2011, $70M update of the Resort Tower guest rooms was much needed but these have always been some of the best sized rooms on the strip for the price paid.  They are appointed with comfortable chairs, a desk, wifi that is fast (but not free), top end electronics and lighting, the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in at any hotel anywhere and large bathrooms with lovely bath products. 

3. GAMING:  Casino is big enough to have all the gaming tables and machines laid out in a way that makes it easy to get to them.  From $10 blackjack tables to high roller rooms, they have it all covered. 
 
4. STAFF:  The valet staff, bell staff and housekeeping staff have always been very helpful and friendly. Same with staff on the casino floor. .

5. SECURITY:  Room card keys are checked by security staff before guests enter elevators to the rooms.  Security personnel roam guest room halls in the evenings. 

6. LOCATION:  At about mid strip, the location is perfect.  An easy walk up to Wynn or Palazzo or Venetian. Caesars is roughly next door on one side and Cosmpolitan on the other with Paris across the street.  A tram connects Bellagio to City Center shops and to Aria (also owned by MGM as is Bellagio). 

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:

1. $25 ""RESORT FEE PER DAY: Applied to all rooms, hypothetically for wifi and access to the exercise room but is simply a way to up room rates.  

2. ACCESSIBILTY ISSUES -  GUEST ROOM LOCATIONS:  Bellagio has not put wheelchair accessible rooms on the best location fountain side of the building even though the  1990 Federal Civil Rights law of ADA requires accessible rooms to be distributed in all locations so people with disabilities can enjoy the same inclusion as do all others.  MGM, Bellagio's owner, has been sued for similar problems at the MGM Grand to result in compliance.  They know better.  But some hospitality entities hold a strategy of waiting to be sued at each hotel property before ADA compliance.   It was a nosebleed for my friend when she needed an accessible fountain side room for her father in law here this year.  Just a ""heads up"" if you need an ADA compliant room and want fountain view.  However, all rooms and bathrooms have lots of clear floor space for accessibility if you can forego grab bars and seated showering. 

3. RESERVATIONS - CHECK IN - POST CHECK OUT PROBLEMS:  All three couples in our party this time had problems making and revising reservations as online systems weren't working,  Neither were the systems when we called to do this by voice.  Check in took a very long time, again due to systems problems.  In each event, the staff involved acted as if they were doing us a favor.  And when my friend discovered after check out that he'd left a piece of luggage in his room, customer service staff was indifferent about helping him.  That luggage was gone for good.

THIS N THAT:

FOUNTAIN: The music choreographed water fountain in the 8 acre sized lake that fronts Bellagio goes on about 2P every afternoon  at maybe at 30 minute intervals, and the last show is about midnight.   Street level viewing is great and a good place to also watch is from the outdoor patio of Mon Ami Gabi at Paris across the street.

JEAN PHIILLIPE:  The main location of this pastry, chocolate and gelato purveyor is at Aria and worth the free tram ride there to indulge. But the smaller location off the Bellagio lobby has many of the same delights. Worth standing in line here to buy them.  The calories consumed in Las Vegas don't count!",19,12,12

Everybody knows it's 5 star as soon as you walk in from the lobby and glass decor hanging from ceiling to the garden they spend millions on changing four times a year. Don't forget the restaurants and lounges along side the bakery. For me and my family that's where it stops. That's why the three stars. Growing up in Vegas and visiting three or more times a year. I kinda know Vegas. 
I have been waiting to stay at Bellagio for years. Now I get to stay with someone else paying. I thought I was going to be so stoked. Well I wasn't stoked at all. Actually very disappointed in our room altogether. Don't get me wrong there nice but compaired to the rest of the casino, not even close. The marble looking deep tub\/combo shower was the highlight of the room. We did have a great view of the fountains and the strip. But the nights stands were all scraped up bed wasn't very comfortable. My number one absolute complaint and reason for three stars. A 20 year TV worth about $5.00 on a TV stand dresser worth about $4000 and no free wifi. It's the 2012 wifi should  be free in a place like the Bellagio. I know it seems like a silly complaint but, it just annoys me they spend  millions changing the garden four times a year but can't afford a flat screen.
My second complaint was the pool area. I was extremely disappointed by the layout to the lounges to the funky spell in front of the cabanas and lack of customer service. I was out by the pool three days in a row and had one waitress come up to me by the pool and ask me for anything. I had two pancakes at the restaurant by the pool it cost me $18.00 with tip. High prices is no surprise to me but that is just ridiculous considering they weren't even hot. On top top of that ice cold butter. How's the butter going to melt if the cakes aren't even warm. Butter doesn't go bad you can keep out and soft and it won't spoil. 
 Over all we had two great dinners at there restaurants and spent some romantic time in the lounge. Oh, we saw Cirque DE Solie 'O' worth every penny. Get balcony seats FYI. And of course the fountains and the location are totally awesome. I probably won't stay here again unless it's free again and even then I not sure. Good luck and thanks for reading.",5,1,1

Last month, it was finally my time to stay at Bellagio. I booked dinner reservations, fabulous seats to O, and even reserved a poolside chair at the swanky Cypress Premier Lounge.

The luggage service attendant came over when we pulled up and was extremely friendly and kind and helpful, had a great time telling us about the hotel and gave great recommendations.

Check in had a 20 minute line, but once we were speaking with agent, it went pretty swiftly and the agent was polite.

Cafe Bellagio- stopped in for lunch. A bit of a wait but expected at lunch time. Sadly, food was mediocre, and bread was not brought out to our table even though we ordered lunch and other tables were brought bread. Then, we had empty drinks x 15 mins, and the waiter was nowhere to be found. We tried to flag down someone, arms flailing and excuse me x2, no response... hostess was coming from behind seating another table, smiled... came right over after seating other party, refilled our drinks for us herself with apologies. We had finished and our friends had arrived and were waiting at the bar, so we were ready to leave. Waited another 10 minutes. Finally the waiter appeared with the bill. He dropped off bill and disappeared again, for 10 minutes was nowhere to be found again. We tried to pay at bar, barternder said she could not process payment. Waiter came by looking irritated and processed payment. Unfortunately the staff was inattentive and aloof. Food was bland. Complained to front desk, but never heard anything further.

When we arrived in the room- we found crumbs on the bedroom floor. I called the front desk and they stated they would send up a vacuum. A couple minutes later housekeeping walked in without knocking- thank goodness we weren't changing or something, but she was there for a different reason. She had stated she was not finished cleaning the bathroom. This was within 15 mins of us arriving in the room at around 3:30, after check in time. We asked if she could also vacuum the crumbs. Odd to not have room cleaned by check in time. 

Our luggage attendant that brought our bags to the room was very friendly and helpful. He ran to get us a bucket of ice and let us know about the channel that plays music to the fountain shows. He was very informative and helpful. (Luggage Services was excellent. Friendly and helpful.) And the view was spectacular. 

The bathroom sink made an odd gurgling noise, even when the sink was not in use (woke us up Sunday morning). Intermittent, about 5 seconds each time. Happened several times while we were in the room. Disappointing to have bad plumbing wake us upon a Sunday morning.

As stated above, we had reserved chairs at Cypress Premier Lounge. Upon arrival, I was taken to a chair with a large tear in the cushion. I pointed it out, and asked if they could change the cushion. The attendant went to ask someone and came back and said no, they can't change the cushion, but could put a towel over the torn cushion. Very disappointed for this at $100 a chair. Also, ordered poolside lunch at Cypress; my salad was served warm. However, our wait staff was excellent, attentive, friendly, and kind.

Cafe Gelato definitely worth stopping by- cashier was all smiles, very sweet and friendly and helpful. For coffee, stop at Palio. 

Of course, O was a spectacular show. 

We went to Prime for dinner. The service was fine; my husband threw an absolute fit though, because he ordered a bottle of wine, and the staff that brought the bottle presented it to me and poured me the taste instead of him. He insisted that they are supposed to present the bottle to the person who ordered the bottle. He gets funny about little things like that lol But anyway, the food was very good, the service was fine (except for the wine incident, according to my husband lol)

My overall feeling was disenchanted, in a word. I dreamed of this vacation for years, and after the trip I was just not impressed. When you drop that kind of money, you expect individualized, attentive, and excellent service, but it was merely adequate. I will save a great deal next time and go to MGM or Mandalay for good service. Maybe at least there will not be crumbs on my floor from the previous guest, plumbing issues, warm caesar salad, and arrogant and inattentive wait staff. 

My hope is that Bellagio seriously revamps their training and development to improve customer service so that people like me do not also have their dreams kinda dashed. It is hard to think that so many issues are one or two bad apples- it seems to be a problem across the board. Especially if the cost is so high, service needs to be unsurpassed and individualized. I am sad that I have had to tell people about my experience and that people state they no longer wish to stay here.",1,0,1

I want to start off by saying I loved the service that Brandon Beach, Front Office Director, gave us to start off our stay here. This was my first time staying at the Bellagio using the American Express Platinum Card. We had $100 credit to spend on spa, salon, food and $60 credit for breakfast the next day which we spent on the buffet. Brandon was kind enough to upgrade us to the suite with the Bellagio fountain view which was amazing! 

What was not amazing was when I found blood on my blanket. I was shocked that they do not wash nor clean their blankets. For $300 a night I expected better. I walked outside of my room and gave the bloody blanket to the cleaning lady and asked for a new blanket. The second blanket was given to me in it's plastic wrap but when I opened it I found a very torn blanket with tattered cloth and cotton coming out of it. I honestly felt so disrespected that no one inspected the blanket before they would give it to a guest. I went outside again and gave the ripped blanket to the same cleaning lady in the hallway and asked for a 3rd blanket. At this point I was livid and called the front desk. I spoke with Megan, a manager, and she apologized and offered to have chocolate covered strawberries brought up to the room if we would be in our room for ""a little while."" An hour later I attempted to call Megan back but she  was unable to talk. The front desk lady reported that Megan said my chocolate-covered strawberries should take another 10-15 minutes more. It was a total of 2 hours until the strawberries arrived. I did not like the service from the cleaning staff and am in awe of the hours I have wasted waiting for multiple blankets and for the apology strawberries with no follow up.",2,2,0

Also, the casino was really nice.  See my review of The Bank for my thoughts on the nightclub.  Hint: I had a great time!",0,0,0

Mobile check in. Mobile checkout. I love it! This was greatly appreciated so my last memories of Vegas wasn't of me waiting in line. There is always a monstrous line at every Vegas hotel which is not very pleasant. 

I used the mobile checkin before my flight. When I landed over four hours later, I had received the email stating the room was ready. The mobile checkin line to pick up the room key had one person in line vs the 40 in line at regular checkin. The checkin guy was great and warned me about the hackers convention. 

The room was very nice on the top floor (28th floor). It's an older hotel, but very well kept. We had an adjoining suite with the other girls in the group so that was really convenient. 

This hotel is located in the middle of the strip and is central to everything you would want to do\/visit while in Vegas.",4,1,2

This was my fourth trip to Las Vegas and my previous hotels were Wynn, Venetian, Caesars and MGM.  MGM was my first trip and from there on decided to test out higher end hotels and have not been disappointed until now. I don't mark down the Bellagio because of the mass amounts of people that flock through the lobby ( there are a ton, so if you do elect to stay here be ready for lots of in the way people taking photos ) or around the fountains or higher limits in the casino, as it was expected. The appearance of the Bellagio is great i.e. Lobby, fountains, displays. My rating was based off the thing you paid for...the room and  pool. The fact that there was construction and seasonal display being set up was an large inconvenience. 

You do not have to pay the higher room rates of the Bellagio in order to watch the fountains, go into the lobby or see any of their displays. You pay them for the rooms. Which at the Wynn was absolutely amazing and the Venetian and Caesars was great. However, at the Bellagio it felt like a run of the mill Vegas hotel, much like the room quality at MGM. Which makes sense since they are owned by the same company, but this should have been luxury. The pool at Bellagio at first glance seems nice. Large area, didn't have kids or a wild party scene to it, which is nice when you want to relax with some drinks and just get a tan. The problem with the Bellagio pool is that the building blocks out the sun at certain times of the day around certain pools. The areas where the sun is, is jammed packed and you can't get a chair to sit. You're left sitting in the shade, waiting for a spot to open in the sun. This wasn't a one day thing, it happened each day I went down to the pool. 

The room was standard in the spa tower. The only thing I liked about it was the view of the strip and the fountain. The bed was not comfortable and the pillows were not to my liking (extremely soft as if there is no stuffing or it had been worn out over the years). The bathroom had a nice look to it with double vanity sinks, however the standing shower had low water pressure. What made one shower even better, was having the water shut off by the hotel mid shower ( shampoo still in my girlfriends hair) because of construction they were doing. Took around an hour before it came back on, so she could finish the shower, which in  turn cost us to miss our show, wasting the tickets i purchased.

The construction was fun being able to hear it on the 17th floor. Not even sure how that was possible, but in the early morning you could hear it. There were points when trying to walk from the elevators to the lobby, we would be stopped so that the crew could drive fork lifts and use pallet jacks to carry cargo around. You would think that guests would get priority especially guests trying to get to JPP and the spa to spend money within their property.

After experiencing this on the first two days, I went to the front desk to explain what we were experiencing and asked if anything could be done. They apologized for the inconveniences but stated there was nothing they could do. The seasonal display would be finished by the Saturday and the restaurant shouldn't cause anymore problems. I politely asked if there was a room not in the spa tower that I could be moved to. Which they said sorry but we can't move you to another room, we don't have anything available at the moment. So I asked if they would be willing to waive my resort fees for my trip. Which they said they could not. I understand that there are a lot of people out there who take advantage of the service industry and try to complain their way into free things. This was a instance where I felt I should have been compensated. A resort that ranks in the top on vegas's list, should make you feel like it was worth the money, even it if was a standard room (which is what I had at Wynn and Venetian). You shouldn't have to stay in a suite to experience that. 

Everyone will experience things different but if you read through this whole review, you are trying to see if its worth the price tag to stay at Bellagio. I would advise that it is not. Stay at another high end hotel or spend the money on a suite at Paris or TI ect it will be worth it. You can still visit Bellagio and see the architecture and art that they have on display, without having to stay there.  

Between work and softball I go out to Vegas about twice a year. I don't think I will be booking an MGM hotel again for my team or myself, unless it was free, but I don't see that happening. I am sure Steve Wynn is loving that his old property is not insuring every aspect of the hotel is luxury, as it makes his other properties seem so much better in comparison.",4,2,1

I'll start with my favorite parts of this hotel:  There is a nice big soaking tub in every room, the pool area is very relaxing, and the hotel itself is pretty.   

Otherwise, we waited 45min to check into our room.  It was 11pm at night and the hotel staff was not very friendly.  Be prepared to have a $600 holding fee placed on your credit card that will be removed when you leave.  The TV in our room was old and most of our channels were either in Chinese or were Bellagio advertisement television.  Our sheets were stained with self tanner and they had cigarette burn holes in them.  The shower door would not close and the air conditioner didn't work well.  We were even in the main building on the 24th floor which is supposed to be the nicer rooms.  The cleaning staff woke us up every morning aggressively slamming doors.  In order to keep the doors open while they cleaned they would open the lock latch and let the door slam on the metal as they went in and out.  This makes a wonderful BAM!! noise all morning long.  The television was supposed to have a nice express check out option for early check outs but the feature would not work in our room.  Also, do not be tricked by the computer room there for your ""convenience"" in the hotel lobby.  We wanted to print our plane tickets (which was supposed to be an amenity and apart of the reason for the $22 daily resort fee) but the concierge had left for the night.  An annoyed Bellagio employee told us to use the computer room.  It's $1 per minute to use the internet with a $10 minimum charge.  The internet was nice and slow and it cost us $1 per page to print our tickets.  

After staying at the Bellagio I feel that there must be a big ""Sucker"" sign stamped on my forehead because they nickel and dimed me to death.  Please make sure to ask what everything costs or you will be paying $14 for two small glasses of orange juice or $16 for a mixed drink in a plastic cup by the pool like we did.",0,0,0

The Hotel has also been able to kind of keep up with all of the newer competition on the strip.  It seems to be a mecca for foreign visitors, like the Venetian.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe their travel agents promote these properties.  The beds are very, very comfortable and I really enjoy my sleep here.  I can't  give the Bellagio 5 stars however.  Here's why.

1.  Customer Service.  Its spotty.  The really good customer service comes from those who routinely get tips.  I guess you could tip every employee if you wanted to, but you would still get so-so customer service.  Their Customer Service does not match the image they put out.  The Girl at Check in was an arrogant Bitch (no tip), and I don't know why, she is on the other side of the counter.  The Bell hop was super (tip).  The waiter at the Bellagio Cafe, slow but friendly (tip), the ladies doing traffic management at the Cafe, annoying and curt (no tip).  The only employees that gave good consistent customer service was the Housekeeping staff.  All of them were friendly, would look you in the eye when passing by in the Hall and say ""Good Morning"" or at least ""Hi.""  Whether they were morning cleanup or turn down attendants, Housekeeping had to be the absolute best.  The Pool Staff, second.  The rest of the crew, from Gift Shop to Concierge, so-so and Hot\/Cold.  I do understand that because of the thousands of people moving through the place every day, how can you really get good customer service.  There are kind of overwhelmed by the crowds.  Fine.  But that doesn't mean that being bitchy, rude, put out, and sighing at every question needs to be inflicted on the customer either.  The customer allows them to keep their jobs.

2.  The Pool.  I really like their Pool.  It can be hard to find a place to sit because of the crowds, but at least the crowds are Hotel Guests.  I really like the fact that only Hotel Guest are allowed to use the Pool.  This isn't the case at other Hotels, like the Monte Carlo, and maybe Caesar's""s Palace.  I wish there was more seating available at the Pool, and there is a lot, but not enough for all Hotel Guests.  Also, when we were there, the Pool was sometimes like French Rivera Poolooza.  Don't get too excited.  The topless women were not like swimsuit models, but more like androgyny.  You stare because you don't know of it's a he or a she, a ma'am or a sir.

3.  The Crowds.  It's very crowded.  I like the Bellagio, but its not my favorite Hotel.  You pay a lot for a standard room with nice finishing touches.  I will say, that the rooms have been clean and kept up.  Amazing considering the amount of people the sift through the place.  The Hotel can thank their Housekeeping staff for that.",1,0,0

Before arriving at the hotel, I inquired about airport transfer through the phone and lets just say that the agent on the phone wasn't pleased to talk to me. She seemed like she was doing me a favor by answering my questions. I thought that since I was paying $600 plus a night for a one bedroom suite penthouse suite they would maybe have airport transfer. Well no problem if one bedroom didn't have airport transfer, not a big deal. During check in and check out I experienced a different kind of attitude as compared to other guests. It seems that the ladies working at the chairmans lounge were more enthusiastic and happy serving their white guests than me.  At the Chairman's Lounge during the last day of my stay, I was asked to show my room card to make sure I belonged in the chairmans lounge. Let's see if I wasn't booked for a room that allowed access to the chairmans lounge then how would I know to enter the chairmans lounge? As far as I know, entrance to the chairmans lounge are not marked so normal people wouldn't even know what room this is. I guess maybe it was the way I dressed because I was not dressed elegantly like other guests but rather in my gym clothes.

Beautiful for many reasons. The rooms are all fully equipped and we had absolutely no complaints with our view of the strip. As for the casino part -- Casinos can be very muggy, however The Bellagio definitely has a great air purification system! Air flows smoothly and prevents you from inhaling tons of second hand smoke. Throughout the hotel you can go outside for a dip at the gorgeous pool or at night wait for the fountain show which runs every fifteen minutes from 8 - midnight. It's absolutely beautiful and usually not hard to get a good spot in the crowd. As for the inside of the hotel the Botanical Gardens in the main level are such a sight to see along with ""instagram worthy"" shots to be taken. The buffet they offer is a dream. So much food and depending on how often you stay at The Bellagio you can practically skip the line to enter!

If there was any hotel that I could choose to have my first real Vegas trip at, the Bellagio was always number one.

It's location can't be beat. It's right in the center of the strip and within walking distance of the best entertainment and dining on the strip. Should you splurge for a fountain view room, which we did, you get prime views of the strip and the fountain show right outside your window. Our room was very spacious but that could also have been because our last hotel room in SF felt teeny tiny and we were happy to have the space. I was a bit bummed that I wasn't able to locate the safe until an hour before we left though since I had some valuables I wanted to store in it (it's in the bedside table drawer not the armoire).

Aside from the location, the hotel is clean, high end, and classy. I loved that there is a lot of security but it is inconspicuous so you feel that any nonsense from the strip won't be coming into the hotel and certainly not up to the rooms. The casino is large and was our favorite on the strip based on the selection of games (we visited quite a few other hotels). We also loved the many lounges, bars, cafes, and restaurants offered within one hotel. The property is huge but it is so convenient to have it all at your fingertips. 

Now as much as we loved the hotel itself, our experience in terms of customer service was less impressive. My husband is an avid golfer and he had set up a golf day through the concierge. On the website, the hotel advertises its special relationship with a handful of the courses in the area and that they offer to take care of everything for you; I would expect nothing less from the Bellagio. We called the night before his golf and were told to go to the concierge desk to get his rental clubs and meet with his driver. I also would have to come to present my credit card. We walked down and were met with a confused look before being shooed to the bell hop. Fine, we'll try this again. At the bell hop we explained that he should have transportation waiting for him for golf that was set up through the Bellagio. The bell hop checked a list and said that an outside company must have book the driver since he wasn't checked in on the list. He then proceeded to stare at us expectantly as if we had any clue what he is talking about since the hotel booked this whole thing. My husband asked if his rental clubs were there and the bell hop answered yes and proceeded to stare at us expectantly. I then asked where they were and he said ""oh, I'll have them brought over."" When our driver arrived and saw the lack of organization at the bell hop and the fact the bell hop had moved on to helping other people when we were still waiting on clubs, he stepped in and said something to move the process along. My credit card was never requested either so there was no reason I had to be there. My husband also told me when he returned from golf he had to explain multiple times that the clubs were the hotel's and not his because they kept trying to tag them for storage like they were his. And finally, at checkout, I only saw charges on our bill for the transportation and not the rental clubs or green fees. After talking to the woman at the front desk and a phone call to the course we finally figured out some outside company the course uses charged us for the fees.

I still cannot believe how unorganized this whole process was. It was more confusing then it needed to be and the entire staff constantly made us feel like just another number, not an individual guest. But I shouldn't have been surprised since my dad had warned me about this from his visit with my mom in 2015. Bellagio seems to have gotten a bit big for it's britches and forgotten what customer service means. This service they were supposed to provide my husband was executed poorly and he would've been better off setting everything up himself. I would stay here again because the good out weighs the bad, but I'm extremely disappointed that the service side of the Bellagio doesn't live up to its reputation.",1,0,0

If you're like me and don't like feeling cramped into a tiny room to be shared with others, I would recommend getting the two-bedroom penthouse suite. Each bedroom comes with a his and hers bathroom, plus there's a guest bathroom as you enter. That means 5 of you can worship the porcelain god in unison after a big night of heavy drinking and bad decisions. The beds are so heavenly that you don't want to get up once your head hits the pillow. Standard rooms are also pretty spacious compared to other hotels.

There's always something interesting to see in the conservatory which changes for each season and Chinese New Year. Definitely many photo ops when it's not too crowded from all the tourists. It's practically deserted around 4am.

You have to see the fountain show at least once amongst all your Vegas visits. It goes on every half hour during the day and every 15 minutes in the evening until midnight. Don't get a fountain view room if you need your beauty rest because you will constantly be hearing a thunder-like sound (but then again, WHO THE HELL sleeps that early in Vegas?!?)

the bathroom was amazing! so whoever posted that prior; i would agree with that comment. our room seemed to be a little on the warm side. the room seemed to be on some sort of timer system for the air condition because it was warm in the middle of the night; but it was nice and cool in the morning - we tried messing with it to fix it but we were unsuccessful. 

i was surprised at how few people seemed to be in the bellagio at various times throughout the night. one little quirk that i also saw with the bellagio was that food seemed to be a bit of a challenge and what i mean by that is that there are plenty of sit-down places in the bellagio (especially dinner and after dinner-drinks) but something as simple as a starbucks is nowhere to be seen. i thought it a little silly that you basically had the bellagio buffet or the snacks area next to the sports book to grab a breakfast. 

overall - i am really glad that i stayed here but i will definitely take a look at others the next time around. i think that renovations are a must for this place to not become a dinosaur...i mean our pool-view room didn't even have flat screen tv's in the room.",0,0,0

Checked in with a business associate.  Reserved two penthouse suites.  We checked in in the VIP check-in area that they referred to as a ""lounge.""  There was a small area where wine and snacks were available, but there was also a seating area which was occupied by a number of people who appeared to be either nursing a hangover or were only there for free food.  The atmosphere suddenly had the charm of a bus station as the lounging party seemed fixated on us checking in.  Not really the type of experience I had expected from a VIP area or for the price of a penthouse room.

We were never asked if we needed assistance with getting our luggage to our room, so off we went with our luggage through the casino to the elevators.  Again, not exactly a VIP experience when you drag your luggage through the casino.  A better experience would have been to offer to take our luggage for us and to have someone escort us the considerable distance to the elevators.  For a luxury hotel\/casino, the customer experience is more suited to a Holiday Inn.

Getting to our penthouse rooms was another challenge.  Again, a better customer experience would have been that during check-in in the VIP Lounge, the desk agent should have explained that as the two of us were traveling together, would have a problem getting to each others rooms on different floors of the penthouse section.  A room key is required for the elevators, which is fine, but conducting business became a hassle when having meetings, when you cannot get to the other person's room.  We should have  been offered an explanation and the option of offering a traveling companion an additional key to each others floor.  Not a great experience.  

Trying to get your key to work in the elevators was another challenge.  It took four or five tries before the elevator recognized the card keys.

Later in the day, after a meeting, both of us experienced having our keys no longer working.  After speaking to the security guard at the elevator bank, we were told to go back through the casino to the VIP Lounge for assistance.  A better example of customer service would have been for someone to call the VIP Desk and have two new keys dispatched to us rather than rudely ask the customer to travel the considerable distance back to what is not really a VIP Lounge check-in.  

The rooms were large and spacious, but not really worthy of a ""penthouse"" label.  My room was somewhat tired with stains on the sofa, dirty carpet in the bedroom that needed to be stretched and repaired to remove the large wrinkles in the middle of the room.  The bed leaned to one side and the mattress needed to be replaced.  Both rooms had a wonderful ""penthouse view"" of the hotels garbage dumpsters below.  

For penthouse prices and business customers who frequent Las Vegas, it would be unlikely we would stay at the Bellagio again if this was the best they have to offer.  Service was basically nonexistent, and what little service we encountered was jaded, coarse and unenthusiastic.

Very disappointing and unprofessional.  The staff lacks basic customer service skills, business processes either do not exist or are not followed.  No problem solving skills among employees and no attention to detail or basic customer service.  

Would not stay here again.",22,1,0

My husband and I stayed at the Bellagio for 3 nights a few weeks ago to celebrate our birthdays. I booked directly from mlife for a king nonsmoking room.

We ended up not getting the room type and the front desk told us they would put in a room change request for us and we could be moved (upgraded) the next day. 

By the next day when we called the front desk, they told us there was no room change request and no notes on our record about that at all. They also said the hotel is totally booked and no upgrade would be available.  I have to say we were pretty disappointed in the communication break down. We did eventually get moved when we walked up to the front desk in person again later on in the afternoon. We didn't get the upgrade we were promised (which we didn't mind, consider it was just a kind gesture anyway), but it was still an upgrade to a higher level room and finally in the room type we reserved. 

Other than that we were very happy with our stay. I always sleep very well at Bellagio. The rooms are very quiet (and I'm a light sleeper who travels with ear plugs) and the bed\/linens are so comfortable. I would say the decor isn't my personal taste but it fits the theme. 

The pool area is spacious, and there are many different dining options. We grabbed a quick breakfast at the patisserie, and enjoyed their buffet (which is a separate review) more than the buffet at Caesar's, or cosmopolitan's. 

Location wise it's extremely convenient as well. It has a tram that can save you some walking\/taxi. And it's pretty central on the strip. We easily walked to Venetian on one side and MGM on the other. 

The O show is amazing as well and we received a discount on the tickets for being a hotel guest. You need to get your tickets early if you want good seats as they do sell out fairly quickly.

Even though it's not as new as some of the new comers on the strip, the hotel has maintained itself very well. The air is always clean smelling when you walk into the lobby, and other than some of the decor and lower ceilings you really can't tell how old this place is.

For me this is one of the top picks to stay for convenience and quality of stay. I don't think the rooms are the most luxurious and\/or spacious from some of its' competitors like Wynn or Venetian so if that's what you're looking for you might be slightly disappointed.  Also I think the atmosphere here is more mature.

Whereas other casinos and other gaming configurations may be more subtle about taking your money, the sports book at the Bellagio can be comfortable, adrenaline-pumping, and not a horrible strain on the wallet.  

The book has impeccable, comfy leather couches.  On an off-peak day, just check the odds, get a few tickets, and watch sports while the friendly waitress rewards you just for being you (and for holding those tickets).  Vegas sucks, but this room, it does not.",1,0,1

She also gave us some other tips - a pleasure to talk to overall (5 stars for Lexi for sure!) 
However, housekeeping, pool area, and check-out process did not impress me...

- Bathroom floors were not clean (I wiped them with a Clorox wipe and grey\/black residue came off) 
- very noticeable water stains on the counter surrounding the sink
- holes in the pillow cases and a couple of small stains on the sheets 
- the closet mirror was had was dirty upon our arrival (looked like a child smeared their hands on it)
- the closet had a musky locker-type smell to it
- the shower head was not clean  
- the tub spout was also dirty (thank goodness I always bring Clorox wipes with me)

I did not expect to do this much of my own cleaning at a luxury hotel - I feel disappointed. 

I was also annoyed at the fact that bath salts\/bath bombs were only given to those who stayed at the suites. Why provide a bathtub in the run of the house of room without bath salts? I appreciated the other toiletries, but even when I asked the front desk for bath salts at 2 am on our last night (we did lots of walking that day and stopped by the front desk for some unrelated question) they still said, ""no, sorry that's for suites only"".  

The pool is ok but the music was too quiet. Not enough chairs in the shaded area and the drinks were VERY weak and VERY overpriced...also, the attitude from one of the bartenders was a buzzkill. I would only stay here again if there was some amazing dining promotion with a stay or maybe a suite stay, otherwise, the half-assed housekeeping and mediocre pool aren't worth the money!  To make it worse, the computers at check-out were very slow and the staff seemed confused.

MGM properties are the only hotels on the strip where this is required, which is nuts. Additionally, our room had numerous scuff marks and stains on the sheets.

The bathroom was perhaps my favorite part. Everything in the room was nice including all of the surfaces. The bathroom was really nice and big, and featured a stand up shower and a tub. 
Out of all of the hotels I've stayed at, the biggest room, biggest and most comfortable bed, best location on the strip, and best bathroom hands down. Staying at a hotel with a good location on the strip is key if you don't want to shell out a lot of money on cab rides and the location doesn't get any better than the Bellagio (in between the Cosmo and Caesar's Palace and across from Paris).

I've stayed here twice now and enjoyed both visits, although next time I may choose someplace smaller, less crowded and more personal. Our check-in clerk was very personable, but after that we were just cattle in the herd for three days.

The rooms are elegant, clean and comfortable. My favorite thing about them is the oversized bathtub. Be warned that it's a very long walk from your room to anywhere. The pools and hot tub are lovely; however, they close at 4 p.m. The Bellagio fountains are delightful, but less frequent than they were last time I visited -- it's now one song every 15 minutes. Also, the fountain shows are canceled if it's windy. 

Cirque du Soleil's ""O"" was excellent, if ridiculously expensive at $180 each for average seats. Everything here is extremely overpriced: $20 for a mediocre fast food burger and stale french fries at Snacks; $15 for a cappuccino and pastry at Palio; $20 for a glass of champagne or cocktail at Lily Lounge; $50 for a holiday dinner at the buffet. I don't recall things being nearly this expensive when I last visited Vegas in December 2008, when the town was seriously hurting from the recession.

As other reviews and our check-in clerk mentioned, the minibar items are on sensors, and just moving them will result in charges.

So I've been going to Vegas since I could learn how to walk. I remember the buckets of quarters and the endless stench of smoke lingering through the casinos and hallways. With that said, I have stayed at a good amount of the hotels on the strip and off. 

I've always had this high regard for the Bellagio. It seemed to have this prestigious feeling, glamorous and just thought that with this hotel -- there would be this beautiful ambiance. I can't say that I feel the same way now. Upon making a reservation, I made comments that my boyfriend and I were celebrating our anniversary. I commented that I would appreciate any accommodations that they may be able to make for us. When I called to confirm, the lady on the phone seemed short and a bit rude. I always call to confirm just because it gives me the peace of mind but this lady seemed as if she wanted to just get through her day. Pft. When I asked her about the process of checking in and if there would be a possibility, she said that I would need to check with the front desk when I arrived. I know this is procedure but I feel that it could have been worded in a better way such as, ""If you can give us a call the day of arrival, we may be able to assist you."" When I asked about the complimentary upgrade to one of the new renovated rooms, she repeated herself and said that I would have check with the front desk. Instead of a sterile response, I would have wished for more warmth. I mean, this is suppose to be THE Bellagio. 

Anyway, upon arriving, we checked in the front desk. It wasn't great and it wasn't bad. It just was procedure. Again, lacked warmth and any type of real customer service. It wasn't busy at all so it made me wonder if this cold service was what we were going to experience throughout our stay. One perk was that she was able to check us in a bit early and she did honor the complimentary upgrade to the new rooms. 

We went to our room and the security is fantastic. There was always a person viewing Bellagio check in cards to make sure that we belonged to the hotel. When we got into our room, I have to be honest -- I was incredibly disappointed. For the amount of money, the reputation and expectations, this room did not live up. It was nicely renovated, I give them that. However, the room is probably one of the smaller rooms that I've stayed at (in comparison to Encore, Mandalay, Palazzo, Planet Hollywood, MGM and Luxor). For starters, it was just so basic. The greatest amenity was that where the TV was mounted, there was a input board of USB, USB CHRGR, etc. I didn't use it but I could see how this would be useful for many people. The bed was comfortable. The closet was a decent size. There was a table for working and two seats. The bathroom didn't live up to my standards. The shower needed a deep cleaning. The edges weren't the cleanest. The bathtub was just okay. It was deep but not that large. It didn't seem ""renovated"". The vanity area was just whatever. The biggest issue for me is that there were no double sinks. Overall, I want to say that the room was going to be a four or five star but I really want to give it a three. 

During our stay, I can't say that there's been anything that's made this resort stand out. The pool was beautiful but you must get there when it opens for a chair together. Thankfully, I wake up really early so we were okay. The lounge pool area seems a bit over priced but worth it if you have the money to splurge. The pool cafe was good and great service. 

The buffet really is NOT worth visiting. We went before we left to head back home and for about 50 something, it was not worth it. I would have been happier elsewhere or even going to the cafe for something. There were a good amount of choices but being the Bellagio, I felt that there should be more. All the desserts were mostly sugar free or fat free. Some weren't even labeled correctly. The food found here were just things that I felt could be found at any buffet which disappointed me. The service was just okay. Actually, a bit lacking but it's a buffet. 

Lastly! The most important thing that brought us to the Bellagio was the under 21\/children policy. I thought that this hotel was more strict about their policy but it seemed that there were plenty of children around. To be honest, it was one of the first experiences that I encountered, walking to get ice, seeing a 2 year old running down the hallway. At the buffet, there was a baby crying and then a family of 10, 6 children\/babies. I was a bit shocked. I know that people have children but it just seemed as this was no different than any other hotel. 

So even with paying for more to hopefully experience a wonderful vacation, I don't think I got what I paid for. I wish I could say that I'm coming back but I'm probably not. So so sad.",2,0,0

The only cons are that the hotel is. so. freakin. big!!!!! It takes 10-15 minutes just to get to the strip, before you get to the crosswalks that take five minutes every way.

We stayed for three nights in a 'Fountain View' room on the 28th floor near the center of the complex overlooking both the fountain and the main strip.

If you do not feel like reading my complete breakdown, my summary thoughts can be found at the bottom.

--Day 1
Our flight arrived early (730am) so I did a pre-check in and the whole process was a much larger chore than expected. 

The desk staff were rude. After a back and forth with a few agents, I was pointed to a young lady who gave me keys to the hotel, but with no directions on where they could be used

Going outside with our luggage I see the bell hop station with no one present, I thought 'no big deal' should be just a minute. 5 minutes later a guy did arrive and was the first person to say 'hello  and welcome.' It caught me off guard given my earlier interactions. 

I realize an early check may not be common, but given the reactions received you would have thought I was trying to check in weeks in advance as opposed to a few hours.

Our room itself was a letdown. The view is absolutely amazing, but everything falls rapidly after that. 

The bathroom has a tremendous amount of unused space and a toilet that even for my wife who is 5'6 seemed really low.  It is like they got a deal on elementary school fixtures and chose to install them.  Wasted space aside it is well lit and the water pressure is outstanding.

The mini fridge is completely sensored so if you move make certain to look at your account to see if you were charged. There is zero room for any personal items. They actually have a label that if you are found to have stored personal items in the fridge you will be charged a $50 fee. If you would like to store drinks you can rent an additional mini fridge for $20 a day.

The decor throughout is very dated. It definitely looks like a room from the late-90's that has not been updated. The carpet hard, the desk space is OK, and the main outlet box under the TV was broken leaving us with few outlets. The hotel really seems to appeal to AARP members, not really much in terms of modern amenities or quality finishes.

-- Day 2
We were awakened around 3am with a fire alarm going off at a building nearby. This loud siren sound continued for about 30min. The windows are far from soundproof and a lot of the exterior noise can be heard (EMS vehicles, cars revving\/racing, airplanes departing, etc.)

Went to Jean Philippe for breakfast. A little pastry shop located next to the garden area. Prior to ordering breakfast we wanted a soda and snacks for the conference, conveniently there is a shop just across the hall. I bought a soda and travel snacks. Upon checking out I once again received the rude behavior that seems common here. No greeting or hello, just the total charge. So, our bill at the all-purpose shop was $9 ($4.50 for soda and $4.50 for a bag of chocolate) and I paid with a $20. I asked for two $5 bills as part of my change and received a reaction that not only caught me off guard, but the others in line. The lady snapped and in a raised tone said ""I only have one $5 and you are not going to get it. It throws my drawer off.""  Having no clue what she meant, I asked for all singles and with a loud exhale she agreed. 

The staff in the pastry shop was very polite and did their jobs well. The food was not great ($11 for an omelet with one slice of toasted bread), but when you need breakfast at Bellagio with a short line this is it.

-- Day 3
Awakened around 3am again to an alarm and the pipes in the building starting to rattle with a loud 'burp' sound constantly emanating from the sink. Fortunately, we did not have to start as early as previous days so we ate at Café Bellagio. The breakfast helpings were very large and tasted good. I ordered pancakes ($15) and she the bagel with salmon capers ($15). If you are not an MLife member (we are not) arrive early.

-- Day 4
Same as the night before, alarms going off and the responding EMS vehicles woke us both. For the burping pipes, I closed the seal on the sink and shut the bathroom door which helped.

Tonight we ate at Olives restaurant. Food is average, what you are paying for is the view. You are sitting on the fountain edge. We had a 5pm reservation and to be guaranteed a balcony seat to see the show we had to stand in line by 4:15pm. The waiting in line is with a reservation. Our total cost (1 appetizer flatbread, 1 pasta dish, and 1 steak, and water to drink was $110 pre tip.)

SUMMARY
There are several places along the strip where you can experience better amenities and a nicer staff for less money. Much like the stores that inhabit the hotel, you are paying for the name as much as anything. Unfortunately, where Chanel, Hermes, and others have maintained their quality for their price point, Bellagio has fallen well behind and needs to undergo a pretty significant renovation.",10,6,3

I don't know if you've walked back and forth between the guest room to the front desk area before, but we had to do the round trips more than 3 times because of their mistakes and errors!  We're also concerned of their security because they gave us the room keys to an occupied room where there were bunch of luggage laying around!  There were a lot more to our nightmares at Bellagio!

7pm: Called the front desk to let them know that we'll be checking in late, and they said there will be no issues.

11:30pm:  My family and I were rear-ended by a Bellagio employee in front of the Bellagio Employee Parking lot.  

11:30pm-12:30am: Called Bellagio and explained the situation since the Bellagio employee was unwilling to cooperate and would not give us his information.  Yet, the hotel was not willing to help either since it technically happened outside of their property and the accident did not happen during their employee's work hour even though he was on his way to his work (Bellagio) in his Bellagio uniform! In the meantime, the police just drove by and told us to wait for another cop, who never showed up.  

12:30am: Called Bellagio again and their security manager finally came by and convinced the guy to show us his driver's license and insurance information.

1am-1:30am: took about 30 minutes for us to check-in.  When we walked into our room all exhausted, we found their other hotel guests sleeping in the beds! 

2am: They ran out of the room. The manager went to the backroom to find another room at sister hotels.  

3am: 30-45 minutes later, the manager came by to tell us there was no room left.  So she gave us a villa, which only came with one king size bed and there were 5 of us!

3:30am: We're all exhausted and in pain from the whiplash from the car accident.  The paramedic came in to check our vitals.  In the meantime, hotel brought 2 roll-away beds for us to sleep on.

4:30am: Everyone was finally able to take a shower and rest.  My parents (This was supposed to be their retirement trip from Japan to the U.S.!) slept on the bed.  My 11-year-old nephew (his first time in the U.S. and Las Vegas) and I slept on the tiny roll-away beds and my bf slept on the couch!

8am\/9am: Hotel manager called to check up on us.  That was a nice gesture, but be more thoughtful!  We didn't go to bed until 5amish!  Let us sleep!

11am-12pm: we packed our luggage.

12pm-1:00pm: We were in the long line to switch our room.  

2pm: When we finally walked back to the new room, we found out that 4 out of 5 room key cards didn't work.  So we had to walk back to the front desk and get them all changed again.

3pm: went to the police station to report the car accident, but found out that they were closed on Sunday.

4pm-6pm: We were all exhausted from all the nightmares happening one after another.  So we decided to take a nap.  

6pm: Decided to take my nephew, who was in the U.S. for the first time for his early graduation trip given by my parents, to a swimming pool.  No one had told us anything and just gave us towels to use.  When we were about to soak into the swimming pool, the guard stopped us and told us that we couldn't go into the pool because of the lightning.

We traveled to Sedona and Grand Canyone, and Vegas was our last destination for our trip.  I wanted to take my family to see some shows, enjoy nice meals, go rides a few coasters at the stratosphere, and go shopping while we were staying at Bellagio for 2 nights, but we couldn't do any of that.  

I don't know if they realize that the rest of our trip ended terribly because we were so tired from all the mishaps happened at Bellagio and busy from getting treated for our injuries, contacting insurance companies, taking my car into a shop, getting a rental car, and etc. Because of that, I couldn't even take my family to shopping on their last day in Los Angeles (U.S.)!  

It was the WORST experience my family, bf, and I EVER had at any hotels in the world!  I cannot believe that giving us a complimentary room for the first night and $100 food credit and removing $30 resort fee would suffice to make us feel okay!  If you don't want to have a nightmare like we did go through or don't want to worry about your safety\/security, you should probably stay somewhere else!",11,5,0

I played poker in the poker rooms which a must (for any poker enthusiast) and the dealers\/poker room manager were all first class. The buffet was good along with one of the restaurants we visited. 

I do have one complaint, and even the dealers at the poker room were surprised to hear this and couldn't believe it happened at the Bellagio.

I was playing blackjack at one of the tables (and I'm a a great tipper) and I started to bleed from my nose (nose is sensitive to altitude changes...might have been the smoking). The pit boss gets me kleenex and I'm clogging it up but then asks me to leave and ""wash up"". No offer to help or watch my chips as I go take care of the situation.  I thought he could have been a little bit more friendly and just his tone of voice I thought was very un-professional especially for a venue like Bellagio . I stopped playing blackjack at the Bellagio and I personally don't like the blackjack machines they use there to deal anyways, I'd rather take my money to the Venetian or Wynn.

The rooms are wonderful.  We stayed at the double penthouse suite...and it was def worth it.  Two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a huge living room, and wetbar!  The beds were wonderful from soft covers to fluffy pillows.  The bathroom was a gem, truly.  I like the comforts of a bath, so to see it all at my disposal was a def highlight.  Showers offered steam options and baths soothed sore muscles with jet options.

Anywho, beyond the rooms, there were other aspects of the hotel that I truly enjoyed.  When we first got there, service was excellent.  We were led to an obscure corner to enter the VIP checking.  We waited, snacking on chocolate dipped strawberries, ripe pears, cookies, coffee, and tea.  After checking in, we unpacked and were ready to explore the rest of the hotel.

You have an avenue of high-end shops featuring Gucci and Christian Dior.  There are top-notch restaurants to dine at.  And the ceiling of hand-blown glass flowers are not to be missed.  Really, you can't get bored of this place.  Okay, I think I've said enough.",1,0,1

I wouldn't be so upset about it but we caught the red eye the night before and of course we had Logan (1.5yrs old) who was not loving the time difference and lack of space to lay out. When we got to our room we asked for the mini fridge to be locked because once again, we have a 1.5 yr old FULL of mischief and they didn't lock it the entire time. Even after we brought it up to the bellhop, the lady at check in and one of the house keeping ladies. THEN we didn't know this til I almost died, but our toilet was leaking. I found out the hard way! We were gone most of the day and I came back alone with Logan and attempted to grab his tooth brush there goes my foot slipping on the pool of water near the toilet. Gross I know, but I ended up slipping and luckily I grabbed the counter before I slipped back. The distance between the shower and the sink is super close too! We called it and the guy came up pretty fast to fix it. 
The maid service is very punctual and there were a few times I wasn't even able to stop her from barging in. She'd knock and say house keeping and just walk right in lol. 
I loved our room since it was right off the elevator and there was no smoking in the area we were in. It was kind of nice not walking back to your room smelling like cigarette smoke.

Had an upgraded corner room in the Conservatory Tower and had a great view of the fountains, the strip, and Rio\/Palms.  Place is ultra clean, well kept, and surprisingly smells smoke free.

So what's keep it at 4 starts?  They are minor, but enough. 

For starters, they do not have a quick service grab and go place.  Sometimes you just want a slice of pizza to go.  They do have Snacks, but they are kind of slow.   Plus they aren't open 24 hours.  For my 1am snack, I took the tram to Monty Carlo where they have a food court.  While I don't want Bellagio to put in McD's, would love to see more 24 hour places besides the Café.  

The next one is mainly for me and other low level gamblers.  They are $10 min bet for most tables all the time.  I get some casino's that start at $5 in the AM, and move to $10 when it gets busy, but they are always $10.  This makes me visit another casino.

The last is as lovely at the fountains are, they are LOUD!  This tends to keep you up, or wake up, when you want to afternoon (or late morning) nap.  This is one reason to ask for a room on the opposite side of the fountains.  

Oh yeah - one more - no Starbucks??  REALLY??  Although, they get bonus points for having Coke over Pepsi.  Seems like Vegas is a Pepsi town.  They also had bottles of Sprite Zero in their gift shops.  Something super hard to find!

So I gave the Bellagio Salon a call and they scheduled us in at the same time on Sunday with no additional fee.

The salon was nice.  Fancy enough to impress, but still unpretentious enough to be comfortable.  We were both given a beverage and they sat us in big squishy massaging chairs next to each other.  My sister's pedicurist was Marissa and mine was Heather.  Marissa was super nice and chatty, but Heather barely said two words to me the whole time.  I resorted to asking her how she deals with people who are ticklish just to make a little conversation.

The lobby is absolutely gorgeous, and walking in towards the registration desk and concierge you definitely get that awe-inspiring feeling of being in a beautiful, grand place. The flowers on the ceiling above the check-in line are gorgeous; you can ogle many people standing underneath this square of ceiling and awkwardly craning their necks upwards to get a good look.

I've only stayed at the hotel as a guest once. My impression is that while the rooms are nice, it's definitely time for a facelift. Mattresses need to be upgraded, furnishings refurbished or updated, and in general the outdated-feel needs to be addressed. HOWEVER... the views are amazing. We had a fountain view room, and the view is unbeatable.

For those not staying as hotel guests, the Bellagio is still my favorite hotel to walk around. I try my hardest to make time for a stop here every time I'm in Vegas (which is too often) because it offers a much classier, more refined and relaxed atmosphere than most other places. It also is a great place to entertain yourself for free!

I love, love, LOVE the Conservatory at the Bellagio, a atrium-style flower and fauna wonderland. The conservatory scenes are changed seasonally; most recently they have had a fall theme (pictured below) complete with a walkway through arches, a very lethargic-looking tree, enormous pumpkins (500+ pounds) and moving squirrels. Previous scenes I've seen were Under the Sea over the summer (complete with a whale made of flowers), Chinese New Year with more red flowers than I ever knew existed, and a winter wonderland style scene with a flower-made Polar Bear jovially outstretched on his back. It's one of my favorite places to stop and wander\/rest for about 20-30 minutes each trip, mostly because it feels so non-Vegas-y. A must-stop for a moment of peacefulness to appreciate the work of the minds behind the conservatory, it's absolutely gorgeous.

Fountain shows every half hour from 12-7, and every 15 minutes from 7 pm - midnight (winter hours according the concierge). The show is usually about 3 minutes long, and set to a variety of different music selections. The fountains are famous for a reason and really are spectacular - don't be tricked into thinking it's over-hyped, because they are definitely worth a stop.

Overall, not my favorite hotel to stay at, but my favorite hotel to wander around during the day for gorgeous views and the fountain show.",1,0,1

There are 2-3 casinos which I really enjoy walking around in due to it's theme and quality: Wynn, The Venetian, and Bellagio. Bellagio Casino is beautiful and very elegant. You definitely feel a higher quality of casino when you step inside to the place. They have an awesome fountain show out front which is free, and inside they have a botanical garden that is also free to visit.

Overall this is one of my favorite casinos to visit. I would definitely recommend this place!",0,0,1

We ended up going to other hotels for their clubs & bars. 

The room was a bit small but we had two queen beds plus they were nice enough to let us check in early.  Linens and bathroom were great - but the shower was all glass, so one couldn't take a shower if someone was using the toilet.  Big mirror and lots of counter space - perfect for getting ready! The Cafe was nice but the buffet was pricey so we didn't check it out..  

Pool area is nice, not too much chaos, very relaxing, no loud music or dj. 

My sister and I did splurge to see O and OMGosh what a great show! Very entertaining. Check it out if you can. 

The sculptures, garden and decor are really nice.

Minus one star just for it not being hip for our tastes - just sayin'.  Cosmopolitan looks like that's where we need to be next time!",0,0,0

No safe in the room (I've never been to a hotel that didn't have a safe). No fridge for storing your own stuff. If you put stuff in their minibar fridge, they charge $50 a day. Trump and other Las Vegas hotels offer complimentary bottles of water and they are replenished daily. Not at Bellagio. Bought a bottle of MLife water (not even Fiji, which is apparently the ""thing"" in Las Vegas) for $8.88. My friend bought a crepe from Jean Philippe and asked if they would cut it in half so she could share it. The woman's response? ""We don't do that. You can cut it yourself."" Umm okay. 

Left my nice Calvin Klein jacket in the closet and remembered an hour after check-out. Called them and they said their supervisor would go and get it and store it at the front desk rather than let housekeeping take it down with their bins of lost and found stuff. Yeah that didn't happen. Had to wait around and almost missed my flight because they were ""looking through the bins."" I called the next day and they found it and offered to ship it...for $58.

We thought this would be such an awesome place to stay. The only plus side to Bellagio was its central location. Next time I'll rent a car (like we usually do) and stay at Trump.",7,1,0

Upon returning to our vehicle in the parking garage after checking out. We found our vehicle covered in thick black run off that had leaked into our covered spot. It rained briefly and the garage is not safe for your vehicle. I immediately informed multiple departments of the issue and was told I would be reimbursed for my cost to detail the exterior. I was never followed up with. I was never called back after being Instructed to have my vehicle cleaned. I was told to fax an invoice to an out of service number.

He surprised me by paying extra to upgrade to fountain view deluxe because I mentioned I loved their watershow. Saturday night we stayed in the room from 6 to 8pm waiting for the show. But nothing happened. I called front desk and was told there were technical difficulties but will be fixed the next hour. Due to dinner reservation we couldn't wait any longer. We decided to ask the lady at concierge desk if there was anything they could do about the situation. Her answer was ""well the show wont be back on until tomorrow. But it is a free show for everyone so we can't do anything for you."" She emphasized FREE and EVERYONE. How she compared pedestrians to paying customers was beyond me.... that's like paying more money for front seats at a concert but getting pushed to the far back without a refund.. 
No apologies, nothing. This lady represents Bellagio? We thanked her for doing nothing and went to check-in desk. There they kindly waived the extra money we had paid for the room and apologized.

WHAT I LOVE

Dancing fountains but who doesn't. But more shows and less predictable music. Put up places to sit down outside for elderly and disabled too.

WHAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

Take away the lake and you have dated elegance. 

Longest walks in Las Vegas

I am a well heeled and well dressed and groomed young man. But have never felt welcomed or my gaming was appreciated. I talked to other guest and they agreed.

Add a VIBE. It is not Paris and no one wants it to be. It's main mission is a Casino. 

On the Casino. One big boring box with no drink service and an atmosphere that screams ""find spaceship and escape""

Never rented a room but have stayed with new male friends and family. The renovations make the rooms feel like a claustrophobic  funeral home! Must not talk or get comfortable.

Staff is professional and well groomed but seem to have an invisible sign that says do not approach.

One downside for a cost conscious person is that the casino floor has expensive table games (nothing less than $10-25 minimums) and you won't find nickel slots.
     If you're not gambling, the conservatory is a great place to walk through and enjoy the sights. They change the theme every couple of months so there's always something new to see. At the time of this review they are showing a Chinese New Year theme. Near the conservatory is a really cool chocolate fountain that starts at the ceiling and works it's way down to the floor.

Bellagio is understated and elegant.  I don't need the over the top disney circus crap that Vegas is known for.  Really.  I don't.   None of it amazes or impresses me.  What I'm impressed by is beauty, service and quality and that's why I like this hotel.   They do have the occasional hiccup but when they do, they will do their best to make it right, asap.  I also like that you must show your room key to a guard before you can go upstairs.

The rooms are spacious and the beds are luxuriously soft and fluffy.   I do wish they better bath products in the rooms.   They're not bad, but some Aveda or Crabtree and Evelyn or something would be perfect.

The Spa is wonderful and I'm in love with all the cucumber scented hair and skin care they have there.  Right down to the cucumber infused water.   They also have complimentary juices, sodas and coffees.. and you can use the spa all day with purchase of their services.  

The steam room and sauna are nice, but the jacuzzi could be hotter.   However, the showers are an event in and of itself... with changing colored lights and lovely serene music, plus four different faucets including a rain shower and body wand.  Beautiful.  I need one of these in my house. 

The same peaceful music and lighting is in the massage rooms and the services are pricey but worth it for a splurge.   Special thanks to my best friend from high school for talking me into a pampered weekend away .. I needed it.   

I did not have a chance to check out the pool, the caviar bar or clubs (I've heard good things about Caramel) but next time...   The shops are, of course, fabulous (Chanel, Gucci, Tiffany, Prada, Dior, Fendi, Hermes etc...) if somewhat busy.   

Room service is quick and efficient with an excellent selection of items.  The steel cut oatmeal or egg white frittata and nine grain toast  are tasty and will make you feel better about yourself after a night of overindulging.... before you head out to overindulge again, of course.  ;)

The Corpse Reviver cocktail (also on the room service menu) is a must try for anyone who likes anise.   They also make an excellent Bloody Bull and the bartenders on site do actually listen to you when you ask them to stir your martini instead of shaking the hell out of it.  

Don't miss the fountain shows.. they're beautiful, especially while dining at Picasso.  One final tip, be sure to tell your driver to drop you at the North entrance if you are a guest at the hotel... that way you will avoid having to walk all the way through the lobby and casino in order to get to your room.

For example, I often try to stay in Ritz-Carlton resorts when available (e.g. in Maui, St. Thomas, Amelia Island, etc.) or Grand Hyatt resorts, and so on.  You get the picture.  The Bellagio belongs in the same ranks.  I've been in casinos throughout Nevada and the Caribbean; the casino in the Bellagio is in my top three, easy.  I don't know what else I'd put up there, but the Bellagio is definitely one of the best.  

I only stayed in a standard room, but it felt much larger than a standard room in other hotels.  The bathrooms have both a very large tub (the size of a Jacuzzi tub, but without the jets) and a shower, which doesn't sound like much, but makes a huge difference in a cramped room.  I found the automatic window coverings to be a nice touch, albeit unnecessary.  My only complaint about the rooms would be the lighting--there simply wasn't enough.  I found ironing shirts after dusk to be quite difficult due to low lighting.  Personal taste, I suppose, but not enough to go below a five-star rating.

The place is decorated beautifully; I stayed around Christmas, which provided additional aesthetic bonuses.  Also, there was a spectacular cafe in the hotel with some of the best baked goods I've ever eaten that (Stephanie M. mentioned this as well).  If I can get the name for it, I will insert it here.  When exiting the casino to the elevators to the main rooms, stay in the main hallway, pass the gift store and it's on the left.  Great for breakfast and the wait is nothing compared to the buffets and other nearby eateries.  Seriously, it had the best croissants I've ever eaten, and I've had my share of them, albeit not in Europe... yet.

My wife and I have stayed here four times, and it's our favorite place in Vegas by far.  Location-wise, it couldn't be better.  It has easily the best outdoor show on the Strip.  I've probably seen the fountain show 200 times and it never gets old.  The complexity is astounding; just when you think you've seen everything the fountains can do, they surprise you with something new.  Booking a lakeview room is well worth the extra money they charge.

I've stayed in some pretty nice hotels in my years, but this is the only five-diamond one, and the difference is evident.  Notably, when you pass a maid or bellhop in the hallway, they always greet you with a smile and a ""good morning"" or ""good evening.""  This is unspeakably rare.  The hotel, despite being ""old"" in Vegas years, is beautiful, from the Chihuly in the lobby, to the ever-changing conservatory, and even the back hallways that only convention-goers see.  The casino is spacious and comfortable, and every corner of the premises exudes class.

The pool is the best part about Bellagio.  It's absolutely beautiful.  In four visits, I've never seen it over-crowded.  It's always clean, peaceful and quiet, with piped-in music softly setting the mood.  There's greenery everywhere.  The hot tubs are massive.  You're handed two big, fluffy towels as you enter.  My wife and I have spent practically every morning we've stayed at the Bellagio in the pool, probably to the chagrin of the bookmakers.

The rooms aren't spectacular, but the beds are very comfortable, there are enough TV channels, and the glassed-in showers are neat.  My wife loves the deep soaking tub.  

Most of the one-star reviews here are complaining about customer service, but I don't think I've ever had better.  During our last visit, just a few weeks ago, we were placed on the 9th floor.  We wanted a higher room, so we called and were told there were none available, but we could move up the next night.  That's exactly what happened, and we were placed on the 28th floor, which I believe is the highest non-suite floor.  Through all of this, we were treated with the utmost respect and courtesy, rather than the thinly veiled disdain you often get when asking for special requests in some businesses.  The hotel also refunded our money without argument after a pool waitress brought us the wrong drinks, and when I had a problem printing my boarding passes in the lobby, someone helpfully took over and did it for me.  Those are just a few examples of how Bellagio makes regular folk like me feel like kings.

Did I mention the smell?  From the moment you step into Bellagio from the parking garage, you'll notice a heavenly aroma.  Not sure what it is or how they perfume the entire hotel, but it smells great, and certainly brings back good memories each time I encounter it at the beginning of a vacation.

If I had one wish, it's that Bellagio had a food court where you could get a less-expensive meal.  The best option now is the small restaurant called Snacks, which has sandwiches and the like; it's really good but not at all cheap.  There's also a fine coffee shop and a gelato shop; other than that, the rest of the restaurants are upscale and pricey, many with suit-jacket requirements.  I understand they want to keep up the ambiance, though, and it's no big deal to cross the street for a burger.

I doubt my wife and I will ever stay anywhere else in Vegas.  I've heard great things about some of the newer hotels, but Bellagio is ""our place.",6,0,0

1. Wireless internet access costs almost $15 per 24-hour period.  For the price of the room, wireless internet access should be provided to hotel guests for free.  
2. I took advantage of the hotel room tub.  (Yes, I watched the maid clean it, so I felt confident that it was clean.)  It would have been really nice to enjoy a small television or even some music while relaxing in the tub.  
3.  The television in the room is quite outdated.  Surprisingly outdated, actually.  A nice, inexpensive flat screen TV would be more appropriate in the room than a small, old-school box TV.  And there were very few decent channels with relatively shoddy reception.

Expensive for the hype compared to other MGM or Bally properties.  We have stayed at several other MGM properties including Monte Carlo, Luxor, and New York New York.  Bellagio is the ""fanciest"" although not sure if the value justifies the increased prices over the others. Walking around Vegas and other resorts and shopping areas saw more diversity of food and beverage at lower prices.  Enjoyable stay and glad we did it although we won't be staying here again based on the over all perceived value as compared to the competition.  The nickel and diming and very high prices compared to equivalent options prevent a 4 star or higher.

Pros: very nice pool area, lots of high end shopping, very nicely decorated, even basic ""run of the house"" room was incredible, bathroom large spacious including walk-in shower, very clean, several high end restaurants, easy to get to Paris, Caesar's, or other MGM properties via walking or tram system, quick wifi

The location (mid-strip) is superb, and since it was so hot outside, it was nice to have so much to do without having to walk too far out in the desert heat.  
The hotel is just beautiful. The room was comfortable, and housekeeping was friendly and professional.  We stayed in the Spa Tower, so while it was a ways from the casino, we were closer to the conservatory and pool.  The elevator there takes you poolside!
Cafe Gelato, Jean Phillippe, and the Buffet were definite pluses.  The unfotunate minus would have to be Palio; the employees there were borderline rude, messed up my order once and overcharged me another time.  Good thing Cafe Gelato is right across the way, and sells some of the same pastries and yogurt parfait (YUM!) since I had it for breakfast every morning I was there.

Even though there are newer places on the strip (Wynn, Venetian, etc.) the Bellagio still stands as the overall best of breed. It is visually stunning, starting with the Fountains of Bellagio on the street with the water and sound shows multiple times per day. As you enter the lobby\/front desk you are overwhelmed by the current display of the Chinese theme: Year of the Pig, carried out in the conservatory with thousands of flowers & plantings, a huge statuary of a Chinese god, a pagoda, animated pig, etc. Fabulous!
Throughout the facility, the decorator touches are all well done. The casino is extensive, spreading out as you walk toward the designer shops or a performance of ""O""- a water production of Cirque Du Soleil.
The rooms are nicely appointed and beds are comfortable. As is the current trend, almost everything used in rooms may be purchased new for your own home.

Have to mention the patisserie located in the walkway to the Spa Tower. Features a chocolate fountain with multi layers of spill over liquid chocolate. Also have a crepe chef working right out front.

Casino: As a Californian, I'm really spoiled by the smoke-free indoors, it took me a while to get used to people smoking indoor. But compared to other casinos, Bellagio has a higher ceiling and better ventilation. Dealers are friendly and willing to teach beginners.

Buffet was the best part, lots of food items to choose from. A little over priced ($50?), but worth it.

We went to vegas for a one night stay.. basically just to do some shopping, enjoy the water show, eat some good food, and get away. I was SO SO SO excited to finally stay at the Bellagio. It's one of the hotels I have on my luxury list of places to stay in Vegas. 

I've always believed the Bellagio was a gorgeous hotel, and actually staying in it just reiterated that fact. Their check-in\/check-out system is the craps though. There is no real line, it's all just like a mob in front of the desk and you kinda just have to choose which one you think will be the fastest. Pretty dumb, but I guess it works for them. Something else I wasn't a fan of was how far the guestroom elevators are from the front desk. You have to walk all through the casino and make a left down past the buffet to reach them. No easy feat, especially when there are tons and tons of people walking around. I think I ran over a few toes with my luggage actually, oops. We got a lakeview room, and so I could not WAIT to see the water show from our room. The view was absolutely fantastic! Our room was around the middle and halfway up the hotel, so it was perfect. We could see everything on the strip, and the water show at night with the lights was mesmerizing. Now, on to the room itself. I loved how big it was, lots of room to jog around and do some yoga if I wanted to. The bathroom was a piece of art, huge bathtub and HUUUGE sink counter! Wonderful, since my man always makes such a mess at the sink haha. The bed was super comfortable, and we contemplated stealing a pillow or two to take home (but we didn't, don't worry.) What I was kind of surprised about was the tv. It was one of those older tvs, not a flat screen. I get that no one really comes to vegas to stay in their room all day and such, but when I come back to rest, I want to be able to watch tv on a nice screen. I thought that was kinda weird, but it's true what everyone else says- you pay not for the room, but for the view.

I have loved the Bellagio fountains since the first time I saw them probably 8 years ago. This was the perfect surprise and we had a room facing the waters. The man thought of everything! The furnishing were gorgeous, bedding beautiful and the bathroom was spacious. Check-in took awhile but it was late night in Vegas so what did we expect? Didn't exactly like walking through the casino floor with our luggage to get to the elevators but that was the only way to get to our room. We didn't spend too much time in our room (it is Vegas after all) but when we did, I spent the majority of the time watching the fountains. One recommendation would be to have the music piped through onto one of the tv channels so we could hear the music from our room. We could barely hear a tiny bit of the music as we were on a high floor and I assume the windows are somewhat soundproof. If you want a luxury getaway, don't wait.

We usually stay at the Palazzo or Venetian because we get good prices there - the Bellagio is always more money.  

We originally had a king fountain room, but had to change our reservation to 2 queen beds because we ended up taking our daughter.  She's 12, but they charged us an additional $50 per night.  We ended up changed to a room in the spa tower - we could still see the fountain but it was not a full fountain view.

I was not impressed with housekeeping.  We arrived to a toilet that had a huge brown smudge on the back of the seat...gross!  One of the pillow cases had make up stains.  

Aside from that, the room was lovely, but not nearly as big as the rooms at the Palazzo or Venetian, where we regularly stay for far less than we paid here.

I came here recently and stayed for half the week for an onsite conference. If it was not for my friends room who wasn't even part of the conference, I would not have been able to see the fountain show from my room at all.

Upon check in, after waiting over 10 minutes in this horrendous line, I was given a room where the bathroom was still uncleaned. It was so disgusting the toilet seat had some unknown smear on it and the shower stall still had remnants of hair and other people's soap. 

I had to leave to check in to the conference so I hurriedly found a cleaning staff in the hallway and requested a reclean of the room. I don't really know what they did exactly but it was definitely not up to my standard. The smear on the toilet seat was still there and I had to clean it up myself. 

Overall the room was dirty, not check in ready, and most of the fancy curtain trickery did not work since CLOSE actually meant OPEN ... somebody's bad wiring job!

The TV and its remote were half functioning, half of the time, and the whole room was dirty, dusty. You can tell it's already becoming run down, rough areas on the carpet and slightly unclean (stained but probably washed) sheets. The bedding was not great and their ""majestic"" headboard had so much dust on top you wonder when it was they last dusted the whole room.

For a place that prides itself in ""luxury"" and high quality service, there was no follow-up to my complaint and the whole stay just made me feel dirty. In comparison to the long list of choices of luxurious accommodations on the strip for around the same price, I am shocked Bellagio still has the audacity to charge the kind of rates it does. I've had far cleaner rooms in the Cromwell, Vdara, Aria, Cosmo, Paris and Planet Hollywood just to name a few where in theory the star rankings don't add up to what Bellagio is supposed to be.

Every room has a safe, which is nice.  However, our room (and supposedly most of them) had a 22"" CRT television.  It's not a big deal, but what's up with that?

The big, big drawback is the wifi.  In an era where McDonald's gives you free wifi. Bellagio charges $15 for 24 hours of wireless access.  Really?  There's not even a 3 days for $25 or such.  I had to get online to do some work, so I didn't have much choice.  My 24 hours ended, and I wasn't going to pay again for the few hours more that I would use before leaving.

Another annoyance is the unapologetic gouging in the sundries shops.  Does this really need to be a cost center?  $4 for a liter of Dasani?  I might have gambled in the time I spent walking over to the ABC store across the street.

My main complaint was the number of people who ignored the no smoking signs and were smoking in non-designated areas. There was a large number of foreigners in the hotel so maybe they did not read English or perhaps they are used to smoking wherever they want. The casino is a smoking area but it was not as bad as Ceasar's Palace which was by far the worst we visited in terms of number of people smoking and getting a headache from all the pollution.

I was quite excited to finally get to stay at the Bellagio but was a bit disappointed.  The room was rather small and I had a fabulous view of the building generators.  Lucky me.  Beware - if you get an odd-numbered room in the spa tower, you will not get a view of the strip.  PRAY FOR AN EVEN-NUMBERED ROOM.

I did not appreciate that my hair-dryer would not turn on periodically and the toilet paper roll tube thingy would constantly pop out.  To my horror, I also only got a few good TV channels.  I was pissed that there was no MTV, VH1, Bravo, or Food Network.  So not cool.  Also, the shampoo and conditioner left my hair all tangled.  Although, I really liked the olive lotion.  Oh yeah, the internet connection was crappy.  

I however really enjoyed my in-dining experience.  I had the breakfast wrap with scrambled eggs, rice and refried beans.  YUM!  And the orange juice was truly FRESH squeezed.  I felt like a princess having breakfast in my wonderfully comfortable king-size bed.

All in all, I would recommend staying at the Venetian\/Palazzo instead.  You get a huge suite for probably cheaper...with a TV in the living area, bed area, and bathroom.  lol.  The Bellagio totally did not compare although it is a BEAUTIFUL hotel.  I love walking through it, but I would only want to stay there again if I got a nicer room.",3,0,0

Extremely overpriced. Nothing is complimentary, absolutely nothing. Came during MLK weekend and was hoping to get an upgrade for my wedding anniversary (passed my good friend Mr.Grant to the girl that was checking us in) but supposedly nothing available. In all fairness I was granted a higher floor with a more centered view of the fountain. 

The carpet, linens, furniture was clean. The pillows and bed were comfortable. The bathroom was nicely sized but the caulking alongside the shower edge was moldy and needed to be changed. I found a hair, a plastic wrapper, and a bandaid wrapper on the bathroom floor-but whatever.

The walls are paper thin and my room neighbor decided it was okay to turn on the TV at 2:30 in the morning. I noticed a lot of 'girls' & guests that can't handle their alcohol at 6:00 am!!!
Long walk through the casino to reach your room and the smell of cigarettes is overwhelming but the smell of cigars is worse and nauseating. The ventilation on the guest floors is bad-smokey, musty, moldy.

The overall decor and ambiance is nice but I most certainly wished I had booked in the Venetian or Mandarin Oriental. For the amount of money I paid, I would've gotten a far better deal + the crowd there is much classier than what strolls into the Bellagio.

The Bellagio cafe was my favorite place to eat whilst we were in Vegas. The wait time was not terribly long and, being in the conservatory, it had a beautiful view. We ended up eating here three times during our stay because the food was good and the prices were reasonable.

The Bellagio is part of the tram network that goes from the Aria to Bellagio with one or two stops in between. It's free and runs every few minutes so it's definitely a transportation method of choice.

I can say the room is not too bad. It was comfortable. For the price I'd have expected more though. I would not stay here again for a few reasons. 
They have a very high resort fee. 36.00 after the tax added to the 32.00 fee. They don't want guests bring this up in question. Since it's not part of the rate, it's added on checkout. Very frustrating regardless if it's in fine print. And they claim it's for the ability to make room calls (who doesn't own a cell phone?), wireless and the use of their printer for boarding passes. All well worth 36.00...
Also the lobby is consistently crowded beyond belief- Long lines for checking in or even getting oriented. The elevator for the rooms is location on the opposite end of the lobby so a long walk anytime you want in\/out of your room. That was also very annoying.

It's a beautifully water themed resort Inspired by the Lake Como resort of Bellagio in Italy. It's most notable feature is the 8 acre lake between the building and the Strip, which houses the Fountains of Bellagio, a large dancing water fountain synchronized to music. See my review of the fountains for more info on it. 

Bellagio was conceived by Steve Wynn and built by his company, Mirage Resorts, Inc. following the purchase and demolition of the Dunes hotel and casino in 1993. Bellagio was designed by DeRuyter Butler and Atlandia Design. Bellagio opened October 15, 1998 and had a construction cost of $1.6 billion. 

In 2000 it became a MGM Mirage property when Mirage Resorts was sold to MGM Grand Inc. for $6.4 billion by Steve Wynn to create MGM Mirage. After the sale of Mirage Resorts Steve Wynn started a new company, Wynn Resorts. 

All in all I love Bellagio! It was Steve Wynn's crowning achievement until Wynn Las Vegas was built. The atmosphere, fountains, food, shopping and service are all 5 stars. Tons of great shopping like Armani, Chanel, Dior, Fendi, Gucci, Prada, Tiffany and YSL in Via Bellagio! I have never stayed there so I can't compare the rooms but the hotel and casino are almost neck and neck with Wynn Las Vegas and that's saying alot!. Forget Aria and the rest of City Center and stay either here, Wynn or Encore. You'll have a great time. 

I have added a picture of Steve Wynn's original concept for Beau Rivage which later became the Bellagio.

I wasn't impressed by the service here, it seemed what they had REALLY paid attention to here was making sure they got you touching the shit in their mini bar or displayed snack bar. Everything was adjusted with springs and honestly it was annoying because it took up so much counter space. My friends and I had booked rooms with AMEX and were entitled to perks like room upgrades and breakfast credit and other dining\/spa credit. However, they were INCREDIBLY difficult and stingy with the room upgrades, and the breakfast credit. The staff, specifically check in, are really inflexible and frustrating to work with. The concierge also becomes unavailable after 9pm which might as well be noon in vegas time, kind of useless when they're dismissed that early. We also tried to see if we could get into the clubs (hyde and the bank) at the Bellagio for free since we are guests and it is stated that way on the website. Absolutely no one was helpful, and when we finally inquired the bouncer people at the entrance, they said it was $20 for girls and $30 for guys. It was the weekend of 12\/19\/2014 and totally dead and the club had maybe 10 ppl in line at 10. It was a pitiful scene and ludicrous that they still tried to charge hotel guests. 

We had two basic rooms adjoining and one room with the fountain view. The view was cool but worth it to pay extra $$? Not really. The other rooms were also just okay, fairly small with a small tv, two chairs, one desk and chair. It was freakin annoying how few outlets there were, especially by the beds. I had to unplug a lamp near the bed to charge my phone. There's also very little counter space to keep anything, because they have a huge spring-wired snack bar that charges as soon as it's touched and you also can't use the mini fridge to keep anything cool because it's again, packed and spring wired so as soon as you touch anything you're charged. I've stayed at Mandalay Bay, the Palazzo, Trump, etc and this place was worse than all three, only better than Luxor. 

Because of the breakfast credit, we had about $30 pp. We decided to eat at the Bellagio buffet but the ""special holiday"" price was at $38 so we paid an extra $8 per person. We were a party of 11 but decided to separate into 2 tables because if we sat together there was a mandatory tip of 18%. For a buffet?! Meh. The buffet was also pretty bad, think the much cheaper Paris buffet is better.

I had to pay $40 every night in fees but never had the feeling that I was receiving anything special as a guest vs a visitor. There was no fancy water anywhere or special entrance and my biggest complaint is there was no coffee pot in the room. I did not appreciate being forced to purchase coffee from room service. The staff was all friendly and the cleaning team was excellent, even lining up our shoes. However my overall feeling was that the Bellagio simply wanted to make money in any way possible, including not having the most generic ammentity , a coffee pot. There was also extremely loud construction next to the bakery for 2 days of our visit. Also the fact that there was only one entrance for guests and visitors made the hotel always seem extremely crowded and loud.

I think our main problem with the Bellagio was actually that it was exactly what we thought it would be; out dated grandure.  The rooms were clean and everything was nice.  It was just the sort of nice that would have been super nice 15 years ago.  Not out dated enough to be offensive, just noticeable.  For instance, what nice hotel still has a crt television.   I know they have to have 3000 rooms so the $100 per room upgrade certainly adds up.  
We started out in a suite but it was next to the elevator and literally every elevator that went up or down made a loud wooosh in our room.  The next day we had to move because we couldn't sleep and the only option was to move from a suite with a king bed to a standard room with two doubles.  We also lost what seem like insignificant amenities like full sized shampoo bottles and a sea sponge but those things make a noticeable impact when they are in direct comparison.  
The second main problem (and we have experienced this with a lot of the 5 star hotels on the strip) is breakfast.  When you are out there for business, twice a year, on your own dime no option for a quick morning coffee and muffin is a problem.  The fancy pants french place is close but the ordering process with the 30 ladies behind the counter expecting you to know your pastry order before you have been able to see the pastries and then waiting another 10 minutes after that to actually pick your muffin up is so excruciating it makes you want to give up your morning coffee and breakfast habit.
If the Bellagio were anywhere else it would be the nicest place we've ever stayed but it just didn't feel up to new Vegas standards.  It doesn't come close to the Wynn, Vdara or Aria and even our rooms (especially after the demotion) in Planet Hollywood, Treasure Island, Paris and Mirage were way nicer.

Several comments toward my stay of four days and three nights:

1. After the first night, no one came to clean our room. We have to go to Walgreen to purchase tissue and travel size shower gel the next day.

2. Until the third  afternoon before we step out, we saw a cleaning lady, and asked her to refill our supply. She told us she will come back in 5 minuets, and of course she did not!

3. We went to the pool, wishing the room is cleaned and shampoo and shower gel is refilled by the time we came back. But it was still not!!!

4. I called front desk and was holding for more than 10 minuets, before I even finish my talking, she told me she will transfer me to someone who can assist. I waited another 10 minuets and the person told me she is sending someone in minute. We were wet and waiting for the shower gel :((((((the person showed up in half hour while I already jump into shower without shower gel.... 

We went to talk to the lady in bell service when we came down and she seemed to be impatient and not understanding.. She thrown me a number to call if we still not get cleaning service. WTF!! We are leaving the next day and just want to let you know...

BTW, we were charged for early check-in which was not being told when we checkin and refreshment in mini bar. We did not even open the mini bar so I argue when the lady and she agree to waive it. Make sure you check the invoice before you authorize them you charge your card!!!

I always thought staying here meant paying crazy high prices, but we paid a standard room rate for vegas and got a very nice room.

The suite is what I dream my master bedroom looked like.  The drapes are all automatic.  We had a view overlooking the fountains and there was a T.V. channel set to whatever music the fountain show was playing, so that we could watch in tune.  The bathroom even had a bidet.

I stayed at the bellagio jan 15-19, 2014 while working for a conference. I was part of a video crew and worked primarily in the room so I spent about 8 hours as day in there. There were two of us in a 2 bed average room facing caesars. The room was clean apart from the bathtub which looked like it hadn't been wiped out in a month. The bathroom door lock was broken which was awkward because I had several crew members in and out of the room. 

There were two incidents that stand out apart from the broken stuff. One was that I woke up with a massive spider bite on my face. That's just nuts. Maybe cleaning and maintenance standards are just low. The second and more troubling incident was that we went to a dinner at the conference and we were out of the room from 7pm to 1am. When we returned the door was open. The staff that had done the turn down service neglected to pull the door closed after they finished in there. We had tens of thousands of dollars of photo & video equipment inside and while luckily nothing was stolen it was still very worrisome.

I'll be first to admit, I'm quite difficult to please, and they did the job. Got a nice upgrade for a minimal feed at checkin. Suite was very nice, and Surprisingly clean for an older hotel. Hallways leading to room were very classy. 

Room had a steam shower, which was incredibly nice, even had a subwoofer for the tv in loving area which was awesome. 

NOTE: don't book the ""run of the house"" they stuff you in whatever room them want... Bad view, smoking room, no bed choices, etc... So of course we paid for the upgrade after not knowing that.

Gaming cashier cages were ""in-conveniently"" placed wayyyy out of the way to make it extremely difficult to cash out. And they maintain a long line so it discourages you to cash out (was a 15 minute wait) one time.  Slots are also very tight, worst I've seen in Vegas after trying 20-30 machines, never won a dollar or ever got above what I bought in... Learning lesson.

The elevators are a thrill ride, LOL ZOOOOM! We walked in the room and WOW! The Eiffel tower at the Paris and the entire fountain area like a postcard!
 Best room I have every had in Vegas. Comfy bed and pillows, very clean and fully stocked (but pricey) mini bar. LOL, But vending and ice was just up the hall. 
Casino was fun. better class of folks for the most part, but still a party atmosphere. Actually didnt do too bad and came home with winnings! 
WE do tip well, so we had some really good bell & valet service. Really not sure why anyone would complain, unless nothing pleases them. It was one of the best experiences I have had traveling, and the place is JUST GORGEOUS!! The flowers alone are worth the visit! 
The resort is not for folks who want to get stupid and loud, head to hard Rock if thats your thing. It does have that high end elegance that many casinos and hotels are missing in town.
Also if you LOVE high end shopping ( even if its just the window variety) you can spend a day inside and around the resort. its located in a fun spot on the strip. The money they didnt get at slots I spent at Giardini for beautiful Italian ceramics! Better than a cheap T-shirt, LOL.
Then there is Jean Phillipes Patisserie, with the giant chocolate fountain. Not just decadent sweets, but great Panini and crepes for lunch, and we made it our go to for coffee and Brioche for breakfast. Grab something and go sit by the pool with the paper ( Only for guests) .
Awesome dinner on your checklist? We chose Le Cirque at the Bellagio.  If French food is your thing,and you like to dress to impress, its one of the best.

From the moment we pulled up in the Taxi everything was superb. Our bell guy was enthusiastic and charming. Gave us all the info we needed without asking... Where to go, who to talk to, how long it would take to get our bags etc.

Checkin in was quick. Receptionist was friendly, bubbly and broke down any upgrade options without sounding like she was selling them. 

Every security was so nice. Always an acknowledgement each time we passed them. Hello, good morning, evening, night etc. I was in the main tower and walked over to visit a friend to the Spa Tower and boy was that a looooong walk. The security guard on her tower told me without me asking since he saw my key color, about a shortcut through the pool when I went back. Now thats being attentive! 

The person I was most blown away with is someone I only talked on the phone to and never met. I woke up super sick the next morning, called in room service. I ordered my meal and my voice was almost gone, she sounded so genuinely concerned for me. She suggested i get the chamomile tea and she would ensure i had extra lemons and honey to soothe my throat. I didn't even think about it and it was just what I needed.

Pool Cafe is great. Margaritas are delicious and the salads are just amazing. 

Gardens are always impeccable and smell just wonderful.

I love their new email checkout. Very convenient and wonderful for business expenses as I was able to email my invoice to our accountant within seconds of checking out.

Mom was especially thrilled since they arrived early & the front desk was so accommodating letting them check in early. I heard about that numerous times. The Bellagio won her over on that one thing alone. Drinks at the piano bar were fine, breakfast in the Bellagio Cafe was much better than we expected. The place is lovely, clean, room was quiet but then..... We checked out. Mom was charged extra for checking in early. Did anyone tell her this when she asked if she could check in early? No, of course not. They're answer was 'it was on your confirmation letter sent at the time of booking'. Seriously, it's a standard long email that she didn't get, because she didn't book. I did. I wasn't there when she checked in. Just basic, gracious, customer service would entail informing your guest of the extra charge. Mom will never go back. Mom will tell every single friend & human she encounters. She is livid. Upon our checkout several hours after Mom & Dad, I found 4 things from the mini-bar charged to our bill. I politely pointed out the error. The nice young woman explained everything is on a sensor, 'perhaps something was bumped?'  Oh gosh that's possible I tell her. My husband put his leftover $170.00 steak in the fridge saving it for our flight. That's it she says. She's happy to remove the charges but now she must charge us $50 for using the refrigerator to store our leftovers. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?  Oh yes. Evidently there are '3 signs on the fridge'. So up to the room I go. No signs anywhere on the fridge in or out. Back down I go luggage in hand, pictures of the fridge on phone. This time I'm told the sign is on the Fiji Water bottle and basically they aren't budging. After spending thousands of dollars on their property over two days it comes down to this. I'm just appalled. I am a business owner, I understand the hospitality industry, I know good service. This place doesn't care if you come here or if you come back. There are too many choices in Las Vegas. Do yourself a favor and choose a property that values your business.",2,1,1

First time staying at Bellagio and it definitely lives up to expectations.  We arrive around 11 and were able to check in early. This is a definite plus!

Our room was super neat and clean. The restroom has a shower and an amazing looking bathtub.  Ample closet space, a flat screen, and drawers for storage.

The location here was convenient, although the hotel now looks like a little midget next to the City Center Extravaganza next door. The rooms were insanely small compared to THEHotel, Palazzo\/Venetian\/Wynn\/Area; granted that those are much much newer.

Snootiness of the staff definitely needs to be cut down a notch. I get that they used to be THE place to stay but I can get a much nicer room at other places for a lot cheaper without the attitude.

I'll admit... I love the no child policy the hotel has. Getting nipped in the ankles while walking around Vegas rubs me the wrong way. Who takes an infant to the second hand smoke infested town!?

The hotel itself is gorgeous, the conservatory is beautiful and they have huge gorgeous flower arrangements throughout the entire place. I guess that's why they charge an arm and a leg for a room that doesn't even sport flat screen TVs!

We stayed in a L&L room with a great view of the fountains and a spacious bathroom...that's always good because, ya know, I always like to have plenty of room when doing my thing in the morning.  When you're blurry-eyed from a late night at the tables, you don't want to worry about your toothbrush falling in the toilet.  Oh, and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've encountered in a hotel.

L&L also applies to their buffet.  I am not a huge buffet fan, but their brunch buffet has a huge variety of high-quality choices.  If you're trying to eat healthy, there are plenty of delicious choices that won't pack on the pounds.

The pool area is very pretty but of course gets crowded on a sunny day.  Try getting there before 11am.  The pool bar has some great drinks if you don't mind paying the prices (I had the frozen mango belini, my friend had watermelon juice - both delicious!).  If you need a cab, skip the monstrous taxi line in front of the hotel and instead go to the little north entrance where you might only have to wait a minute or two for a cab.

The little garden area with the gorgeous flowers, decor, and etc. are all so beautiful, we walked through this conservatory a few times. 

Staff: 

We had a really chatty blackjack dealer, who was kind of annoying, because she kept stopping to deal to talk to us about her days in the '80s when the hottest drug on the market was cocaine. Go fig. 

The other dealer we had was lovely -- funny, talkative, but not distracting. 

However, the rest of the staff we encountered to ask for directions to the restroom\/whatever were all super-nice, friendly, helpful, and cheerful.

Plenty of tables, at least one poker room, tons of slot machines, and many other games. 

Buffet:

I love the breakfast here. I also really like the desserts here during lunch. I haven't had dinner here yet, but I'm dying to. I'm a sucker for a buffet, when the food's delicious.

It definitely has a grand atmosphere and looks classy; I felt more comfortable walking through the casino and shops at Bellagio than the casinos on the other side of the strip. The hotel, however, did not impress me.

When I want to stay at a luxury hotel, I do so because I'm willing to pay more to be a bit spoiled, to have softer linens, and to be treated well. This hotel has so much volume that they clearly don't feel the need to treat their guests as guests; I felt very much like a revenue source. They had absolutely destroyed our reservation (it was specifically booked as four rooms all together and confirmed to be so), but when we arrived the rooms were not together. They weren't even on the same floor. Ok, these things happen at any place, from motels to five star. The difference between a motel and five star is that a five star should fix the problem with grace. Bellagio did no such thing, and their consolation prize was a miserly waiving of the resort fee. Gee, thanks - $200 off our reservation as compensation for the fact that our bonding girls trip is now an adventure in separation.

The rooms were decorated nicely. I have no complaints about the surroundings other than the fact that said rooms are PACKED with furniture. If I'd stayed for more than a couple night's it would have felt like the walls were closing in on me. Removing the sitting area would have made it feel much less claustrophobic. The bathrooms are very large and I love the huge shower. The tub is small but deep. There was, however, a distinct lack of amenities. There wasn't even coffee in the room. Isn't it standard to wake up and enjoy a cup of coffee in your PJs in the morning while on vacation? That's the thing that got to me about Bellagio - those little touches to make it more than a nice-looking room just weren't there. I expect those little touches at luxury hotels, and Bellagio did not provide.

A note on the buffet - absolutely worth the money. We ate at 10:30am so there was a mix of lunch and breakfast items, and despite the cost ($30 in January of 2014) it was worth it. The food was delicious and there was exceptional variety. The drink server was painfully, irritatingly slow, so don't expect a coffee refill. Come to think of it, perhaps Bellagio has a thing against providing coffee to it's guests?",10,3,1

This time I called and reserved a king size no smoking room. When we arrived after a 10 hour drive we were told they didn't have a king non smoking room available. We would be given a double queen. The manager came over and proceeded to explain the reservation is just a request not a real reservation. After a bit of belittling me for not checking in earlier, we agreed to stay since we couldn't go back and we couldn't see spending the several hundred extra dollars to stay in another hotel at the last minute.
We got up to the room and it was nice, except for the fact the room was not clean. By scanning the room it appeared to be cleaned. Then I pulled back the covers where I discovered dirty sheets that had been used. Then I went to the bathroom where the surfaces have not been even wiped down. I called the front desk and they sent housekeeping to change the sheets, and We cleaned the bathroom. When I ask why the room wasn't  cleaned, they explained to me that housekeeping is not part of Bellagio and it's not reasonable for them to check 4000 rooms a day. The hotel offered us a $70 meal voucher for the trouble. When we went to collect on the meal, they forgot about it. After a little complaining they did agree to give us $125 meal voucher equivilant to 2 trips to the Buffett.

This was my very first Vegas trip and let me tell you, the Bellagio exceeded my expectations! The check-in\/check-out process was incredibly easy and the staff is very friendly and helpful. We had absolutely no trouble with our luggage - a bellman helped us immediately and took care of our luggage until our room was ready. After we got to the room, it was only 10 minutes until our luggage arrived! 

From the minute you are on the Bellagio property, you can tell that you are in for a special stay. The landscaping, the fountains (AMAZING!), the lobby, the Conservatory ... they're all over-the-top and beautiful. Not to mention the location of the Bellagio is ideal - right in the heart of the Strip and close to many attractions and amazing restaurants! Check out the tram, it's a great way to get to other properties quickly and it's free. 

I'm not a big gambler, but they do have a nice casino that isn't too smokey. Drinks are pricey - $15 for a RedBull\/vodka - but that's expected. The Buffet at the Bellagio is amazing, but be ready to wait in a super long line. Luckily we got to bypass the line because a member of our party is an MLife member, but I would think the line was worth the wait. 

The pools are beautiful! Get there early to make sure you get a chair. I liked the pool mostly because people did their own thing, no one was overly obnoxious and it's not a 'party' pool. There are at least 4 different pools to choose from, as well as a hot tub (not necessary!!) and cabanas. 

We had a basic room on the 27th floor and it was beautiful! The linens are exquisite, the bathroom roomy and the views - amazing! The beds are some of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. I didn't want to move! They also have a safe in the room, which is very convenient. My only complaint is that the toilet is incredibly loud. I know that sounds silly, but when you flush in the middle of the night or early morning you are sure to wake your friends\/family. But, that's a minor complaint.

I stayed in a regular room but I got to see my boss's suite - I still dream about it.  Separate dining room for 10 or 12, a tiny kitchen devoted to THE BAR: literally, full-size liquor bottles on glass shelves up to the ceiling, huge bedrooms, luxuriously appointed bathrooms, seriously the suite is bigger than my entire apartment.  

The regular room is gorgeous too. All new, swanky-as-hell interior in lavish colors like royal purple, teal blue and chrome - together.  (I was an interior design maj for 2 semesters in college and I was freaking out by the new decor.)

we committed the cardinal sin of not booking early enough (only 1 week prior) , and
for $299 we got a standard room + we have to pay a $35 upcharge for a 3rd persons occupancy.
We thought we'd get not a luxurious but a decent Chrstmas vacation @ Bellagio.

NOT SO!

Upon checking in as we requested a 3rd bed we were met with major attitude.
Stephanie the front desk person (whose hometown is in California) 
""You are fortunate to get 2 queen beds non smoking, you may request 2 beds but we never guarantee it""
""Please Can you make somehow make it happen?""
""I can have you talk to our manager""
""We cant put an extra bed in, its against fire code.  But we can get you extra comforters and make upone bed as two.""
""Thanks, you have made my day.  Could you make sure that this happens?""
(at the moment I was wondering how that could be possible)
""Sure, the manager is doing that now""

We got to the room and found that its probably the absolute cheapest room there is.
Barely enough towels for 2, we clearly got ripped off paying $35 for the extra persons occupancy.
These rooms are probably for those ""gambling express"" bus tour package deals.

An hour passed and I asked the operator to connect me to the front desk manager to discuss with her about the bed situation.

""I have no idea which duty manager you talked to but there is no way we can accomodate that request, but we can give you extra towels and possibly an extra blanket""  Says Angie, supposedly a duty manager, on the phone.
""Are there any creative ways such as upgrading to a bigger room and we pay for the difference"" I asked.
""Certainly, I have a suite for $400 extra per night plus taxes""
Extra towels are better than nothing I thought.  After all, we PAID extra for the extra person occupancy.
Leave the suite to those who run solar companies (LDK or SOLF anyone??) or bought RIMM stock.
We thought we're better off spending some $$ at Michael Mina's downstairs.

We came back from dinner and I wanted to connect my computer.
""There's a cord @ the mini bar you can use""
$12.99 + tax for a cord, and extra for connection charges.

OK, a bit pricey but I needed to be connected so I opened the box and connected the the PC to the walljack with the cable.
NO.  It does not work.
After calling the front desk and getting routed for no less than 3 times, 
I was told ""I need to do something here... click click... you are all set""
Still it does not work.  The ethernet port shows media is disconnected.
Was it the $12.99 cord or was it the hotel system?

I called again and one person said ""Oh, I see you have been charged for the access and the cable.""
""But it does not work.""  I said.
""Sure we know that.""  
""WHAT?!?!!""
""Ugh...Let me credit your account.""  At least the lady was kind enough to do so.
I thought this kind of runaround can only be had from a certain silicon valley company.

OK, no internet, no extra bed, I decided to try my luck one last time and called housekeeping directly.
What a pleasant surprise!  I got a totally different attitude!
""We are all tied up now, sorry it might take up to 2 hours but we will certainly get you an extra bed""
About 30 minutes later a kind fella showed up with a rollaway bed.  He was justly rewarded.

The following morning I went to the business center to try to get on the net...
""Computers here are $10 minimum for usage and $1 a minute.   If you use your own it's $10 an hour""
What highway robbery is that?!?

Dont punish yourself.  You are much better off at the Venetian, Mandalay Bay, or Wynn unless you are a masochist!

We compared our experience with fellow Yelper Setareh N.'s.
Like her, we booked from Expedia.  My wife and my mother in law followed the unspoken rule of showing up to the checking counter sporting major bling bling (those are REAL, not cubic Z) but what we got was like the exact opposite.

A few days after we checked out, the credit card agency called me to inform me that $260 charge, in addition to the bill which included incidentals such as meals the meals, has been posted to my account.
The credit card company suggested I call hotel.

I was transferred to the ""head cashier"" and the greeting was
""How may I do you for?""
I quickly  responded ""What do you think you just said?""
If it's an innocent faux pas or even Freudian slip I'd let it go but it sure did not sound like so.",11,4,4

Having admired the Bellagio hotel on previous visits, when we found a deal through Jet Blue we had high hopes! 

Unfortunately, those expectations were not met... At all. Not even a little bit. 

When you arrive to the hotel, be prepared to join a very, very long queue (20 min) and then speak to someone who does not care in the slightest if it's your birthday weekend... You are just a number and they are just putting you in a room, any room. 

We were quickly given our key, signed up for the MClub, and shuffled off to our room. We had been ""upgraded"" to the spa wing... Which was nothing special, really. The room and amenities were average, definitely not 5*. There was no personal touches, nothing to make us feel like ""guests""... 

Our view was the parking lot... 

We called down to reception and after waiting on hold for 10-15 minutes we were given another room, a few floors above. The view was still the parking lot... along with some mountains and the fountain this time. 

We tried to ask the concierge about a restaurant or show, but there were at least a dozen others waiting, so we found our own way.

The pool area is a frat boys paradise, a free-for-all with no security. We entered and no one checked that we were hotel guests. There was a crazy drunk guy wandering around yelling. I told the towel boy and he laughed. Helpful! (Not!)

Check-out is done on the TV or phone (or risk getting back in that massive queue) and you don't have any interaction with staff.

I started out each morning with an eggs benedict that was cooked to perfection. The rooms are gorgeous, with beautiful views almost regardless of where your room is. Overlooking the pools and mountains or the front fountain and the strip, either way it cant be beat. For location, it is in the middle of everything, so you're never more than a few minutes walk from the next attraction.  As mentioned in other review, the fountain show is beautiful and really you can have a great stay at the Bellagio without even gambling in their casino.

I've been known to come here 10-12 times a year.  After all, Las Vegas is only 90 minutes from San Francisco by plane.  I know the people who work at the Bellagio, and people who work here know me.  I know the locals who play here, and they think I am a local, too.  I know which seats at the poker tables are best for people watching and which are best for TV watching.  Monica, Phoebe and Rachel had Central Perk, Norm had Cheers and I have Bellagio.

It's not the best poker room in the world, but probably the most famous one.  Over the years I've seen dozens of celebrities play here: Celine Dion, Brad Garrett, Nelly and Orel Herschiser, just to name a few.  You will see the new American idols here, i.e., poker superstars.  All of them play here.  There's always a mid-level limit game going on, unlike the Venetian or the Wynn poker rooms, for example.  More importantly, the poker room managers are fair and quick on their feet, so all disputes are resolved swiftly.

Sure, the poker room feels like an Indonesian sweatshop sometimes: the tables are too close to one another and people sitting at the tables look exhausted.  You will probably have to put your name on the list and wait, especially on evening and on weekends.  Your chair WILL get bumped multiple times by a fat guy who's too lazy to walk around your table.  Still, it's the best damn place to play poker in Vegas.

The fountains, the conservatory of flowers, the extravagant foyer - all those things are awesome, too, but they wouldn't keep me coming back every month.  The poker room does, time and time again.

See you at the tables!",3,3,5

We asked for an upgrade and she offered us a $50 upgrade for a room in the main tower but in a smoking room. I will definitely not be returning to a smoking room ever again. I felt like I couldn't breathe for the 3 days we were there. The stench of cigarettes could be smelled as soon as you enter the 19th floor. Extremely unbearable. I wish I would have known before agreeing to the smoking room. I've had breathing problems ever since I left! Also waited an hour to have housekeeping bring us a do not disturb sign because our room was missing it. 


The only thing I would return to the Bellagio for would be the pool area. It was beautiful but they really need to have at least two waitresses per pool.

My only complaint is that it wasn't obvious that the in-room channel to simulcast the fountain music is on channel 22. I felt like 10 years ago when we stayed here that was easy to learn, but we couldn't find that information anywhere until we just started flipping around the channels.

We stayed in a deluxe fountain view room.  The view is spectacular, however you do get some noise from the Strip which can be troublesome if you are a light sleeper.  You won't find much plastic in this room, with everything being natural wood, stone etc.  The room are kept immaculately, with twice a day visits by housekeeping if you want them.

The food, as far as we could tell, is good but frankly overpriced (I should note that I'm really not a foodie).  We had dinner at Cafe Bellagio, Fix, and Olives and breakfast at the Buffet.  Again, excellent service, OK food, and a hefty dinner check.  It seems if you want to eat elsewhere, you either need to drive or hike a long distance.

The fitness room is very nice.  Plentiful and well maintained equipment. Cold water machines with cups (no nasty drinking fountains), and the staff pass out cold wet towels to cool off with.... I'm not worthy!!

Bellagio is a large property and it requires some time to get your bearings.  The Casino is the central point and you must go through it to get from your room to almost anywhere else, so the walkways can get crowded.  Cigarette smoke usually isn't too overwhelming.

The rooms range widely in quality. I've stayed in suites in old and new buildings and regular rooms and the suites in the newer building are my favorite.

Prices vary in my experience more widely here than most of the other hotels. There are great restaurants, especially Picasso, and a devine little ice creamery downstairs. 

Lots of nice restaurants, limited but well-chosen shopping, good service, decent room service, one of the more popular pools in Vegas, easy parking and a good location for getting up and down the Strip. Oh, and they have those delightful dancing fountains too. Remember to stay in the new tower.

The Conservatory area is a beautiful open air atrium with interesting showpieces that do change once in a while. The spa is nice and the salon, while pricey provides excellent service.

Our favorite spot for people watching in all of Las Vegas is here at the Piano and Caviar Bar in the main lobby right across from reception. You can enjoy the stunning Chihuly glass ceiling artwork while sipping Champagne, savoring caviar and watching an almost incomprehensible number of people flowing in, out and around the hotel and bar.

The piano players here know their stuff and the waitresses are long-time Vegas gals with a lot of great experience to offer if you strike up a conversation with them.

The caviar is crazy expensive, but not out of line with the rest of Vegas caviar prices, and the selection is vast and delicious. Champagne prices are also on the higher side, so be prepared for $600 and higher bills for two people. 

If you don't have caviar, enjoy the cheese plate and other menu items and one of their signature cocktails. This is a great place to be any time it is open just because of the strategically perfect location for people watching.",0,0,0

An as might very well be expected, the price of staying at the Bellagio is quite substantial as well.

Why only three stars? We stayed for nearly a week and even though we had engineers come twice to our room they could not fix our air conditioning. The room was never cold--even when we kept the drapes closed all day and the AC on 60 degrees--so they supplied us with a circulating fan. A circulating fan in one of the most expensive Vegas digs.

Also, we needed to have a camera over-nighted for a Saturday wedding and we called the front desk and told them what we were doing. Despite consulting with the front desk, the camera wasn't found by the business office until Monday. We will have to pay to have it shipped home with, of course, no photos from our friends's wedding.

And by the way, you have to pay a daily fee for internet service! At the Bellagio... come on.

The wedding that the Bellagio threw--service to reception to dinner to dancing--outstanding!

The piano bar across from the front desk was a great value and great experience on three different occasions.

On the other hand, the Fix restaurant was a distaster especially at fine dining prices:  long, long wait (though they were not busy), unattentive service, small portions, ordinary food. What a waste.

Great massage. Wonderful spa and workout area. Yet...

2.  The check-in in a joke as it lasts at least 30 minutes. The staff at check-in are surly and not helpful, and a number of the desks are always unmanned.

I used to think, especially when you first enter, how gaudy that floral display on the ceiling was when you first entered the lobby. To be honest, it kind of turned us off. That turn off was my, (our), loss.

So... we got comped a couple nights and booked a couple more because we needed to getaway from the crap we were dealing with at home.

Yes they charge a ""resort fee"". Yes they charge for parking. But most of the larger Vegas properties do that as well nowadays. That is my minus one star cuz pretty much everything else here was stellar. (I mean I'm sure they are making a $hitload on the casino alone, much less the peripheral businesses).

Checkin process, while looking pretty freaking intimidating, (i.e., HUGE line), moved fairly efficiently. The gal that checked us in was super cool.

Bell service was spot on as our bags arrived almost immediately after we did! Room was well appointed and large, bathroom was large with jacuzzi and shower and wifi was free throughout.

Pool area was awesome with attentive cocktail waitresses, large pools to choose from and cabanas if you so desire... (Not me... I save my cash for booze and bets).

Machines and table games played, (and paid), fairly well, (we still lost of course), but we played well into the wee hours of the morning. So... To be able to keep my attention to one casino for as long as they did, it's a sure sign they were doing something right by me. 

My only other gripe was that there were times when we didn't see a cocktail waitress for a long, long time. One night in particular, (a Saturday night to boot), it was especially bad. So bad that a lush like me, left my machine to go get a $12 beer at the Sportsbook.

Overall comments are similar to other reviews:  great location, good dining options, great pool.  We had a fountain view room that let us see the water show with the Eiffel Tower in the background - beautiful.  

The only downside was a strange high-pitched noise that would arise suddenly for a few minutes and then disappear.  We guessed it was one of our neighbors using the shower, but -- fortunately -- it only happened during the day and not while we were sleeping.

I was going to give only 4 stars because of the noise, but something happened that pushed them over the edge.  Upon arriving home, my wife realized she forgot to check one drawer - the one with her jewelry and a few expensive items of clothing.  I called immediately, spoke with the lost and found department (clearly we weren't the only ones that had forgotten something) and was pleased to find that not only had they recovered all of the items, they overnighted everything to us (free of charge) the next business day.  

The housekeeping staff we encountered and all very friendly, but being 2.000 miles away we had little hope that we'd ever see the items again.  The integrity and friendliness of their staff in helping us through this issue (which was clearly our error) was enough to earn them 5 stars - and our future loyalty the next time we head to Vegas!",5,0,2

We spent a full day at the Bellagio spa. The spa is only available to people staying at the hotel, so it wasn't a problem booking our treatments. I've been to a few spas, but the Bellagio spa is by far the best and largest I've been to. I would definitely go back just for the vichy shower and relaxation rooms. I had a vichy shower, sea weed body wrap, facial, manicure, and pedicure. All of the services were excellent.

Our room was wonderful. We had a great view of the fountains and if you have never stayed at the Bellagio, get a room facing the fountains because there is a music channel on the TV that goes with the choreography of the fountains. It was always so nice to come home to that in the evening.

Cirque du Soleil's ""O"" is at the Bellagio, and when you book your room, ask for tickets to the show. There is a reserved section in the audience just for hotel guests. You have to pay for the tickets, of course, but they are awesome seats.

The pools are only accessed by hotel guests, so you don't have lots of people walking through there.

The restaurants are great, especially the low priced ""Noodles"". The dim sum there is great!! Picasso has a wonderful menu and a great view of the fountains. We sat next to Tony Curtis when we were there in May.

Make sure to venture over to see the chocolate fountain at the crepe place. It's definitely worth seeing. The crepes there are great too.

Overall the hotel is beautiful and the room is nice. The location is in the middle of the strip. There are many stores (Gucci, Hermes, etc) and many restaurants ranging from elegant dining to casual dining. The bars around the casino are always packed. The casino is huge and very packed as the day goes on. The casino also gets too stuffy due to smoking. So I enjoyed the casino early in the morning. 

The room is pretty standard (TV, desk, lamps, etc.). I love the bathroom. The bathroom has a standing shower and a hot tub. The shower has a little step\/bench kind of thing. 

The decor of the lobby and the garden is beautiful. I love the miniature Washington monument and the enlarged sunflower statues. The bird house as the center piece is a great touch. I love it. 

The customer service I received was professional and courteous during my stay. At one point, I managed to leave the room without the key and I told the elevator security and he was able to call in for help. Within ten someone arrived at my room to let me in. The hotel is huge and the guy came quickly therefore I was impressed. 

The only reason they lost a star is because they couldn't give us the room i paid for. They have two towers (the main tower and a side tower). I paid extra to get a fountain view in the main tower but when I checked in they did not have a fountain view room in the main tower available. But they gave me a fountain view room in their side tower. The only negative thing I can say about their side tower is that the elevator to the tower is very far from the main entrance and the lobby and the casino of the hotel.

The fountain shows are great. I love them. The water dances to the music. The night shows are much more beautiful (and much more comfortable to watch outside) to watch.

We got threatened 3 times by more racists rude security guards ""our Spanish talk was loud & disturbing"", even though it was only 9:30 pm on a Friday night.

Pool closes EARLY! and is just an ordinary run of the mill pool, nothing to write home about. 
No coffee makers in the room but they will send you up a whole pot of coffee for $25!

Many others come close - I'm looking at you Cosmo and Venetian. But there's something about the timeless classiness of the Bellagio that gets to me every time.

I will start by saying their ROBES. A lot of hotels in Vegas offer robes nowadays, but the most comfortable by far come from The Bellagio. Their hotel slippers also protect your feet from all the unknown that is on your bedroom floor. 

We had a room facing the water show and you think it might be annoying, but it actually isn't - I personally loved seeing it from a different angle for once. 

The Bellagio also has the best restaurants on site, in my opinion. We branched out this time around, but if we were feeling less ambitious, there are so many great choices right downstairs.",2,0,0

Room service is ok, do not expect luxury even though the prices in the hotel are premium. Botanic garden and gallery promoted on the website are a joke do not have high expectations, if you are with the kids they might find the garden interesting. At the hotel you can watch The O show, it is a must have, amazing performance do not hesitate, try to buy online the tickets few weeks in advance. The spa is not big, only one steam room and dry finish sauna. Ladies and men are separated. No indoor pool for swimming, only 4 small jacuzzis and almost no chairs to relax.

While staying at the Bellagio sounds like a great thing... it isn't.  Sure, the lobby is beautiful and the garden is pretty... but you aren't staying in the lobby or the garden.  

The rooms are just ok.  Bathrooms are pretty awesome.  Beds SUCK!  i hardly slept the whole trip because the bed was so uncomfortable... made my back hurt.  And what high-end hotel doesn't have down comforters?!?! are you kidding me?!?! ugh.  Service was ok, but not great.

Christmas Day my fam and I fly in and get this amazing cab chick from Bulgaria who navigates the most awful Vegas traffic I've ever sat in (she totally rocked!). We arrive at the reception desk, the lobby is super crowded, but the Christmas decorations are all out and looking beautiful.
We wait at the desk for a while. There's no obvious line or an employee directing people. Once we made it to a receptionist, we were told that we could not have a 2-bed room as we had reserved OVER THE PHONE, through the Bellagio. And this was at 2pm, not 9 at night. No apologies, no rate adjustments, nothing. (see my review on the Pan Pacific, Seattle for how this could have been handled)
Strike one. 
We make our way through herds of people standing around gawking, randomly stopping traffic flow and being general pains. We get to the room and it smells like a cat pissed in there. I'm serious. Now I've been to Vegas about once a year for the past 15 years and I've never had a hotel room that smelled like cat pee. (Oh wait, did anyone see that CSI episode......?)
Strike two.
We settle in and I zip down the hall to hit up the vending machine (it's almost worth adding another star just for having vending machines since so few hotels have them now!) and get back to my room and I'm locked out. My key stopped working. And no, I didn't have it near my phone or anything magnetic. And when I took it to the front desk, was there any sympathy or apology? Nope.
Strike three.
Then the bathroom sink started gurgling. I finally figured out that the noise happened any time our next door neighbors ran their water so luckily it wasn't non-stop, but really? You could hear it even with the bathroom door closed.
Strike four.

Where the hell was my 5 Diamond service? Where was my 5 Diamond room?? Shouldn't the ""cheaper"" rooms still be awesome?

And all of this was within the first night. I'm not going to bother dissecting the rest of the stay (read my review on the Spa if you'd like) other than mentioning that we had a non-smoking room that smelled VERY strongly of smoke starting the second day (I preferred the smell of cat piss, I think) which I'm guessing is the result of an overworked ventilation system. I've never seen Vegas this crowded, even in the summer, and the casino floor was choked with people and cigarette\/cigar smoke. I've generally found that the up-scale hotels do a pretty good job of clearing the air so was surprised our room was so bad. Anyway, let's just say that for my money, I will be staying at the VENETIAN from now on (been there twice and LOVED it!!).

On the positive side, I would like to mention:
1. The bathroom was really nice (other than the gurgling) with a HUGE tub
2. The pool was beautiful (too cold to try out this time), though I find it oddly placed near the hotel's largest restaurant
3. The hotel staff by our room - housekeeping and room service - were amazing!

Their attention to detail was stunning, and there were so many unique aspects of it that still remain today: the conservatory, the ceiling art at the reception desk, the art gallery, the fountains, their approach to dining, etc.  

Sadly, time has caught up with the Bellagio a bit, and it has lost some of its luster.  As other reviewers have noted, you might see cracks in the facade, tears in the carpet, or have the occasional bad service experience.  It's like going back to Disney World as an adult, where the magic you may remember from years ago just isn't the same now.  

With that said, pound for pound, the Bellagio still offers the most things for the most people.  It has great pools, gambling (though note that table minimums are slightly higher than most places on The Strip), shopping, shows, gelato!, and more non-gambling activities than most.  It has the perfect location, where it's in the middle of everything.  If you're coming with a diverse group of people (maybe a family gathering with lots of age groups?) who will meet for dinner but otherwise have completely separate vacation experiences, the Bellagio is probably perfect for you.  

It saddens me a bit to only give the Bellagio 4 stars... it's kind of the #2 resort on every category though.  The newer hotels have a narrower focus than the Bellagio, so they can win on dining or shopping or pool or gambling or scent or room quality etc.  They're all ""OR""s though, as newer places have probably learned from the Bellagio just how hard and expensive it is to try to be #1 at everything.",1,0,0

This last trip with my girlfriends left a bad taste in my mouth.  2 things.  When I packed up and went home, I realized that I had left a dress of mine hanging in the closet. I called Bellagio's lost and found.  I told them my room number, where i had left it and what it looked like down to the size. They told me nothing was left in the room and there was nothing in lost and found that resembled the dress. Disappointed, i left it at that. What can i do, I am more than positive that was the only place it could have been because it is no longer in my possession and I remember hanging it in the close next to the tv. 

Then I get a call from my friend who stayed in the same room as myself, she told me the following.  On checkout, we had sometime before our flight back to los angeles.  We then check our bags into the baggage deposit for a couple of hours. In my friends duffle along with her clothes and shoes was a small purse resembling an camera case.  When she arrived back home to unpack, the small purse was gone. The purse had a bit of money in it. My friend then called the Bellagio as well. She spoke to the Valet manager. They did not find it (not a surprise) and was told that it happens alot.  It happens ALOT?! That is not an acceptable answer. It should never happen esp when we stay at a 5 star hotel. That why we pay a higher rate because we believe it would be an honest establishment with out fear of theft to our belongings.

So...pretty much I'm going to assume that my dress that i left hanging was taken(not put in lost and found) and my friend's purse that was hidden in her duffle was stolen purposely.  My friends and I are sorely disappointed and will probably stay at another casino resort for next get away.

There are a always quite  a bit of people in the room taking pictures of the ceiling. If you walk forward, there is another nicely decorated themed room. I went to Vegas after the Lunar New Year, so they had a lot of New year decorations, year of the rabbit decorations up, which were really nice. 

There is also the water show in the front of the hotel, which is probably best seen at night. I didn't watch it this trip, more like drove by it while passing through the strip.

It was out honeymoon. Front desk was great. Friendly people who gave us an upgrade to a fountain view room when they knew it was our honeymoon.
My VIP host had left mail for us which was at concierge. Front desk gave us a letter asking us to take to concierge to get the mail. When we got there, concierge didnt even read the letter and said we didnt have mail. After 5 mins of back and forth, they realised it was held in the back. Its common sense. They should have read the note from front desk and actioned the request. 
We went into the room. Very spacious. Needs be revovated with modern amenities like the Wynn or Encore. Or even Cosmo for that matter.
On day 3, the concierge made the same mistake with another parcel. This really pissed me off.
On the same evening, my wife and i went to XS and came back late. At 330 in the morning i rang room service to get some food. Was on hold for 10 mins. This is understandable. However, i then rang front desk, they transferred me to another person. This guy accuses me of dialing the wrong number. He had the audacity to accuse a paying guest of dialing the wrong number and that i shoud dial room service. This was not my fault. This annoyed me. The next morning i rang up and spoke to a lady in guest services about the issue. Instead on apologising on behalf of the hotel, she then went on to say that there in nothing she could do about this as i didnt know the name of the person or the department i spoke to. For a ""5 Star"" hotel, this is a joke.

Key word: WAS. I wanted to get an upgraded room for a recent business trip to Vegas in early October. I was attending a lecture series at the Bellagio and I booked a fountain view room for 4 nights. Check in was fast. The art installation in the lobby was new and I couldn't wait to check it out. It is one of my favorite reasons for visiting the property. I was really getting excited about my stay. It wasn't until that evening that things started going downhill. I'm not sure if it is the Bellagio's club or one across the street, but the bass from the sound system kept us awake until 4am. I called the front desk to ask them if they were aware that the bass was so loud, it rattled our windows. I don't remember if they apologized or not, but they didn't have any rooms to move us to. The next day, I was so exhausted from not sleeping that I couldn't focus on the lectures being given. I missed a good portion of the day because I went to my room to take a nap. 

That evening, the bass started again. I knew my ability to pay attention to the next day's lectures would be a disaster like the first so I decided to check out in the morning and head home. The front desk was nice enough to credit me $112, which was nothing compared to the $450 a night I was paying for my room that I couldn't even sleep in, but here is where you need to pay attention people. Even though I checked out, they continued to charge my card for the next two days!! I contacted them about the charges and they said they would credit me the days back. I got my credit card statement and they attempted to steal $65 from me still!! I called and the lady at the front desk said, ""That was dumb of us to charge you for 2 days of resort fees even though you weren't here."" No apology. 

You can stay and play, but you better keep your eye on your credit card bill. After my last visit, I don't think the Bellagio is as nice as it used to be. Even the crowd seemed more down-dressed. I guess the upper class crowd has moved on to the Winn properties or other new casinos in town. Good luck!",4,0,0

I think it is the Best Hotel in Las Vegas over all, in terms of Ambiance, Cleaness, Location, Food, Service, and Shows.  Let me Brieftly describe them.  The ambiance. You can see the World's best Water Show in front of the Hotel. The show goes on every 30 mins during day and 15 mins during night, if I remember correctly.  Just walk in the hotel lobby you can see the glass ceiling which they invested over $10 million alone will give you a feeling this Hotel is something.  The flower garden is pretty astonishing. Heard they change the decorations seasonal. The garden temperture stays cool even in the hottest day in Vegas.  Cleaness- Bellagio could be the crowdest hotel in Vegas and it still manage to keep most of the visible areas spot less.  Location- this is the 1st time I'm in Vegas, but I found out it is located in the heart of the Strip. Across the street is the Paris Hotel and Planet Hollywood  is next to it.  On the left is Ceasars and on the right is The Cosmopolitan.  Food- I only tried the Buffet Brunch there, so can't give too many words.  It was ok, not as good as I thought.  For around $60 ish for two, I think the Brunch in Wicked Spoon ($50's for two) at Cosmopolitian blew them away.  Service- I requested for a none smoking, fountain view when I booked the trip, but didn't get it when I arrived. The hostess was nice enough to change our room to a Fountain view room. It was a smoking room, the smell weren't strong enough to bother us so its acceptable.  Shows-Well, not to be Exaggerating, but if you come to Vegas and HAVE NOT SEE the ""O""  at Bellagio, you haven't really been to Vegas.  Well, its just me.  I am a much bigger sports fan than a show fan, but I still fall in Love with that show.  Overall, Bellagio exceed my expectation.  Why I still give a 4 star instead of 5 then?

I know it's gotten heaps and heaps of awards and ratings and first born sacrifices (okay, maybe not the latter). And yes, their fountain show can be pretty breathtaking (with the right song that is). But dang if it isn't EXPENSIVE. 

Like 2 croissants for $8 expensive. Like paying $25+ for a day of internet expensive. Like look but don't touch expensive. I'm sure the ballers love it but for a regular Jane like me, it was a bit tough enjoying all the amenities when a lot of them came at a hefty price. There was at least one snarky cocktail waitress who definitely judged us for our age being by the Pai Gow tables. And there weren't many great affordable places to eat on the fly compared to the Venetian and other hotels on the strip. 

But I must admit, it is very beautiful to look at. Their Christmas display near the main lobby was getting the finishing touches when we arrived. Animatronic penguins building igloos, polar bears made of flowers, giant ornaments and dancing streams of water, definitely magical. Almost classic by now, the Dave Chihuly display of colorful rainbow flowers adorn the main lobby ceiling. Most of the service we experienced was quite friendly and they have a man outside who always hails you a taxi. 

All in all, I've only stayed at two hotels in Vegas and the Bellagio is definitely a classy joint. But perhaps just too posh posh for my taste. Not too many folks my age wreaking havoc here!

Stayed here five days, right before Christmas.

Rates were fantastic.  Upgraded to a fountain view room for $25 a day, and room was still only $125 a night.

That $25 a day was the best money I've ever spent in Vegas.

I never got tired of the fountains.  The classical and 'light' classical selections were far and away the best.  

The room (a regular King bed bedroom) -  bath was huge and very nice.  Lots of marble, but not super tacky.  They hide the hand towels in the vanity drawers, so look there before calling for more hand towels.

Lots of storage space in the main room.  Comfortable bed.

Old-style tube television.  Seems ridiculous, given the opulence of the hotel itself.

What others say about noise is true.  You can hear every word from people in the hallways.  So if you go, do everyone a favor and don't talk noisily in the halls.  I didn't hear much from the rooms on either side, though.

Casino and grounds are beautiful, and very clean.

Staff was friendly and professional.

Downside, as others have pointed out...... the dining options are VERY expensive.  Nearly every restaurant is some version of fine dining, with entrees starting at $35, and topping out over $60.  

The buffet is ok, but when we were there the lines were often two hours long.  It's not close to being worth a long wait.

The Bellagio Cafe is the 'reasonably priced' sit down option, with entrees around $20.  It clearly shares a kitchen with the buffet.  It was just ok.  Very pretty space, overlooking the Conservatory.  But it had a buffet feel to it.  And it's huge, so it's easy for the staff to not get to your table for long periods.  Honestly, I wouldn't eat there again.

There is a sandwich shop called Snacks which was a great option.  Only has half a dozen tables, so likely you'll have to take it to go.  GREAT fries, good sandwiches.  Very reasonably priced.  Very friendly staff.

The other 'light fare' option (sorry, forget the name, but it's in conjunction with the gelato shop across the hall), was very expensive.  Coffee and breakfast sandwiches for two was $34.

The spa and gym were $70 for a three day pass (daily rates available also).  Normally I'm too cheap to do that, but the spa was very nice.  Multiple jacuzzis, nice steam room, great lounging area with fruits and drinks.  Very good staff.

It was too cold for outdoor swimming, but their pool area is really beautiful.  Multiple pools, great landscaping, etc.

Also got a great haircut from a young blond guy (sorry, forgot his name).  Was $60, but honestly the best haircut I've ever had.  One nice touch is you can order mixed drinks from your haircut chair.

Note:  It's not obvious but if you want to go to the new uber trendy City Center development there is a tram from Bellagio to the City Center, and I believe an adjoining walkway from the tram station.  Saves you having to walk all the way around (due to limited street crossings a hotel 'across the street' can sometimes be a twenty minute trek).  Ask hotel staff how to get to it.

I'd give them five stars, but I honestly can't give any hotel that doesn't have high-def TV five stars.  And the lack of moderately priced dining options is pretty annoying after a couple of days.  

Would I stay again?  Yes.",0,0,0

No problems with maidservice, staff, or valet.  Everything was nearly flawless.

First I will speak about just the room itself, although I did get a fountain view room, every thing was just pretty basic. The pillows were also uncomfortable, it sank to the mattress, the first night I woke up with a sore neck. 

Now let me get to the customer service part. When we checked in, it was pretty packed, so they said a double queen facing the fountain is not ready and for us to wait a couple hours. I was pretty tired, and they said they'd put the request that we can change the room day after. The day after I called the front desk, they said we can move to another room in about an hour an a half, call and check back with them later. The third time I called, now I was told the room that's been on hold for us, is ""still occupied"" and that they're sorry after i've been on hold for about who knows maybe 30 minutes. I find that irritating, since they could have told me in the beginning, it's like time lost, but it went to waste. 

The first time I called a lady also told me to try to check back ""before 6pm"". The 4th time checking on getting  a room change I decided to go in person to the front desk. The lady there told me that they didn't see anything on hold, and that I ""should have reached them earlier"" which I did try to all day.. waking up since 9, and called since 10am. She said ""late check out fee would be expensive"" and that all their double queens are all full. I just couldn't get why different people told me different things, in the end I couldn't get what i wanted. 

Also at 8 in the morning, I hear a banging as I was asleep, ""HOUSE KEEPING!"" At first I thought I was asleep past 11, but it was only 8, and I have no idea if it was my room or the room next door. The knock was not polite, and it did scared and woke me up.

So everyone thinks staying here is fancy, and luxurious, everyone acting all high class, and its everyone's dream to experience a stay at the Bellagio. I finally did, and the experience, and my expectations were a different story. I didn't feel like I was at a fancy home a way from home.

Pros: 1)  Great outdoor swimming pool with real trees and shrubbery surrounding it. 
          2)  kind staff

Cons:  1) blood? or food? stains on carpet
           2) hole in bedspread

           4) no in-room coffee maker
           5) no Starbucks (or meaningful coffee outlet on the premises)
           6) $1.50 to print copies at the front desk biz center
           7) poor social media engagement..NO response to dm tweet (get with the program) 
           8) The Buffet is a glorified cafeteria with no windows and insufficient lighting

My friend read somewhere that Bellagio was the #1 spa in Vegas. Eh, whoever made that list was on some heavy crack.

New Years, apparently you don't get to use the spa unless you are staying at the hotel.  Which was disappointing, as my friend and I were really looking forward to using a spa in Vegas (our hotel didn'thave one)....so it was okay that Bellagio had that policy, but the girl working at the counter practically chewed us out for even asking to use their spa when we're not one of their hotel guests.... its like gdamn, lady, did you HAVE to give us so much attitude?  

So my other friend, also not a hotel guest, booked a massage appointment well in advance so she was able to use their facilities, but according to the same girl at the counter, ""you're lucky you got it before we made it exclusive to our guests""....

The people working here have some serious attitude problem.  Maybe because they work at the Bellagio and they've got some superiority complex cuz they're further up the Vegas hotel food chain, who knows.  So I ended up just using my friend's spa pass for that day after she got her massage, and frankly, I didn't feel bad about it.  They didn't notice either, cuz I guess they think all Asian girls look the same.  She paid $210 for her massage, the least I can do is use their facilities to the fullest.  

The facilities....NOT that impressive.  The hot tubs weren't that big, and they have cool water baths too.  Standard steam room, sauna, and nice showers and amenities, but the atmosphere and feel didn't impress me. At all.  In our search for the perfect spa, Qua at Caesar's Palace and The Bath House in The Hotel at Mandalay Bay were much more impressive and service was much more friendly.  I doubt I'd ever stay at Bellagio in the future because their service, quite frankly, sucks.",2,0,0

The Bellagio Hotel had been on our bucket list for years and we always wanted to spend a weekend here as guests. We have immediate family living in Las Vegas so we visit the Sin City at least 5-6 times a year, and until now we always opted to stay at their house. 
Since our anniversary was coming up we felt we deserved a special treat to ourselves and we decided to finally book a weekend at the Bellagio. Knowing this was a special occasion, we decided to pay the extra charge for a room upgrade with view on the famous fountains and we could barely wait to arrive. 
Unfortunately, we arrived late on Friday night and we were told upon check-in that there were no room with Fountain View available. The employee was very unapologetic and when we told him there must have been a mistake because we had booked- and paid for- a room with Fountain view, he told us that due to the fact that we arrived at 11 pm there were no more rooms available. This was the first of many disappointments. We paid an extra fee for a service that was clearly not available and would have expected more. The employee told us to check again the following morning after 11, as he would take a note and give us another room. 
So we ended up going up to a room with a very obstructed view of the fountains on the 7th floor. As soon as we entered, we felt we were in a Marriott Courtyard and not at the Bellagio. The room was small, rundown and in dire need of a total revamp. The bathroom was average. 
Both my husband and I travel extensively for both business and pleasure and we have stayed in the best hotels in the world, so we are quite familiar with the room layout and decor of the main hotel chains.
The bathroom tub even had two hair which I promptly rinsed away and needless to say we didn't use it. Another surprise were the toiletries. I mean, we booked a room costing $350 a night and the toiletry kit consisted of one shampoo, one conditioner and two bars of soap in total.
The bath towels were of inferior quality and, to our great surprise, there was no bathroom carpet. I have never before stayed at a hotel that did not include a bathroom carpet and we are talking of the Bellagio, one of the leading hotels in the world!
There was no complimentary water bottle in the room, and no coffee maker. We were too tired to go back to the reception so we decided to make do and went to bed early but our spirits were very low. The morning after, despite the no disturb sign, we were rudely awakened by the cleaning lady who, after knocking at the door very loudly, asked if we were planning on leaving early. This has never happened to me at any other Hyatt or Intercontinental. 
We then received a message on our phone from the reception, telling us that another room had been made available. We repacked our bags and went to the reception to change the room. It was around 10 on Saturday morning and there was a huge line of people checking in and out, but we patiently set to wait despite the fact that we were starving to have breakfast.
After a good 30 minutes in line, it was our turn. This is the moment when I thought I had ended up in a comedy of the absurd. 
The employee at the desk, completely ignoring me who had been waiting to talk to her, turned her back and left to take her break with another colleague. No apology. The desk remained unattended. 
We then had to wait in another line to talk to another employee and ended up wasting another 30 minutes only to be told ""Yes, we found a room but it will be available in a few hours"". Couldn't they have said so when they left the message? Because of this, most of our Saturday morning had already been wasted.We decided to give our luggage to the bell desk who told us to ask outside. This hotel is in need of improvement in its customer service. 
At this point, I was fuming and I went to complain to one of the managers. Mr Jeffery was very attentive to our complaints and appalled at what he heard. 
As a gracious gesture, he offered us a gorgeous suite on the 35th floor for 1 night and this time we did have a stunning fountain view. 
Despite this upgrade, the hotel still does not rate 5 stars.
First of all, when we went to the suite I realized that they have the same toiletries kit as in the previous room, only in more generous quantities (the kit on the suite also included a razor, toothbrush, shower cap and body wash). I know it is the suite, but I would have expected better products and felt there was an unfair treatment of the paying guests. While in the suite, we were disturbed twice by the cleaning crew. Wow. 
For those of you who have had the patience to read this long review, I am not biased. 
I felt grateful that I was offered a suite in this hotel, but I will not change my review ratings for this. Book somewhere else and avoid the disappointment.",2,0,1

I've stayed at Bellagio a handful of times and for good reason. The location of Bellagio is in the middle of the strip. It is easy to get around to other casinos without it being a serious trek. Too lazy go to Europe? Just head over here, it looks like a European villa... you even get a view of Paris, just across the strip haha... 

I love the way the hotel looks from the outside, it looks beautiful and is so classic. It just sets the standard and exudes what sexy and luxurious Vegas should be like. The fountain show is one of the nice free attractions on the strip. The seasonal decorations here are amazing. The atrium is a beautiful garden that magically changes with the holidays and they are usually quite imaginative. If you don't know which hotel is Bellagio, just think Ocean's 11 and it is the main casino where most of the shenanigans go down. 

The rooms here are comfortable, clean and spacious. Even though it's been open for quite some many years now, it is still one of the nicest hotels to this day. If you are looking for some serious dining choices, absolutely head over to Bellagio... it's home of some of Las Vegas' Michelin rated spots. One of my favorite Vegas spots, Picasso, is found here. There are also galleries that you can go see here- one of the ones I was able to enjoy was a special Van Gogh one a few years back.  At the bakery inside, you can not only enjoy some tasty sweets, but also find the world's largest chocolate fountain. In the newer tower, it has an elevator that takes you directly to the swimming pool area. Once you get to the pool area, you have like 5 pools to decide to take a dip in. Lastly, if you want to have the complete Vegas trip, go get tickets to see Cirque Du Soliel's ""O"". Absolutely worth it and your mind will be blown with the acts. Overall, really love this place. Can't wait to stay here again. Haven't had a bad experience yet nor do I expect to have one.",5,3,4

The Bellagio is not only my favorite place to stay when in Vegas, it is one of my favorite hotels from around the globe.

First, location. Located in the middle of the Strip, the Bellagio sits on THE prime location.  With just a five minute walk, you can be at the Cosmo, Caesars, The Cromwell, Paris, Planet Hollywood, etc. You get the point. And oh by the way, what better way to see the fountain show than from your room with the music piped through the TV?  Easy to get to from McCarran, if driving take Las Vegas Blvd or get on 15, turn on Flamingo then on Las Vegas Blvd.

Next, decor and amenities.  What a beautiful place.  MGM spared (and spares) nothing in making the experience as positive and enjoyable as possible. I know of no other hotel that has so many people taking photos of the lobby.  (Look up at the glass display.) A nice treat is walking through the atrium to see what the latest display will look like. Changed five times a year, I recommend going early in the morning for the best opportunity to take photos. You will see the staff changing out the plants, etc.  On the northeast side of the casino is a nice selection of shopping for those so inclined.

Restaurants and entertainment.  The Bellagio is home to my favorite Vegas restaurant, Yellowtail.  Note: See my separate reviews of Yellowtail. Lily is a nice place to grab a drink and meet up with friends, and Hyde can amp up the energy at night.

Staff.  Summed up in a single word, attentive. 

While everyone loves the Strip view, consider asking for a room in the west wing.  You will have  nice views of Red Rock Conservation area and the west side of Vegas.  The sunsets are spectacular, mountains can be snow-capped in the winter, and the lights of the city are relaxing. Another good choice for a room is a corner room in the Spa tower.  You will get a nice view of either the Strip or mountains and a view of Cosmo and Aria.

Try the Bellagio; the team there will make you feel special and the property will meet your needs and wants in a first class hotel.",2,0,0

The room size is decent. Much smaller than what we usually get. ( Vdara, Delano, Mandalay, Venetian )

Always had the beautiful Bellagio fountain view when we stayed at VDARA! I thought I will be watching the view with the fountain music. Ha.ha.. I'm right now, watching the parking lot and a bit of Caesar palace hotel while listening to the fountain's music from the t.v.

The wall is thin. I can hear the damn next room people flushing their toilet. And people walking around the front door.

Bathroom? The shower head was leaking. It shoots water to the ceiling. Called the front desk, had people over to fixed it. And tonight I want to soaked up my tired feet in the tub, the hot water faucet is leaking. Oh la..la...

This trip, I happened to be standing outside the casino on the back half of the pond where I had a perfect view of the show and also the rainbows arcing back and forth - very cool!

It's deliberately one of the more upscale hotels in the area, although slightly older, but its classical European decor is definitely my taste.  The Chihuly glass in the lobby is worth a look, and if you're a window-shopper, there's some fun stores to wander past.  

I had never gambled here, thinking that the slots would be too tight, but on this trip I had time to kill and found not only the 1 cent Texas Tea slot that I had been searching for the whole time, but also 5 cent video poker.  You can tell I like to live dangerously.  I popped some money into the video poker and was doing OK-ish, then hit 4 of a kind and I was up $30+.  Score!  I gambled a bit more at other casinos over the trip, and was slightly under but thanks to my ""big win"" at the Bellagio, I went home with an extra $40.

So, when making reservations I was told the the 3 nights here were free of charge but we'd need to pay the resort fee and taxes.. Ended up paying a bit more than just fees and taxes!!? Hopefully it's a deposit that will be returned at the end of our trip.
Got to the front desk and found out the room we were supposed to have, was not available..  Was given a room with two queen beds instead of a King..

Was told that I'd received a call in the morning when the rooms become available- no one has called yet and it 8:00 pm :(
We had a room at the farthest end from the elevator... Ugh. Then we got to listen to our delightful neighbors having an early morning argument for about an hour.. Made a compliant but.....? Nothing was done. :( We just had to wait for them to stop bickering about losing money in the casino.

the Bellagio is upscale, refined, & understated; except for the off-lobby area which is fanciful, Oriental-themed, and I bet those big goat creatures look even better if you are heavily medicated; the outside entrance is very posh, and basically this is the high-end Las Vegas experience; the fountains are amazing, but let's face it - they are mainly a free attraction for people walking on The Strip; the interior courtyard  & pool area are as fab as you would expect them to be; pretty much all of the restaurant options are quite expensive - no bargains to be had here!; there are 2 shopping corridors, if you can afford the ultra-high-end stores; the meeting room \/ convention area is huge & sprawling; much more activity at the tables than at the slots; best craft brew bet = welcome to the age of the dinosaurs; a very few at the Cafe Bellagio, otherwise it's bottles at the sundries store; as per the Wynn, rich people like to pay $10 for crappy macro-brewed beer apparently",4,2,0

- Big, nice, rooms - we stayed in the rear of the hotel away from all the chaos. The bathrooms were big and gorgeous. 
- So much to look at: Chihuly glass, indoor Botanical gardens, chocolate fountains etc.
- Several large inviting pools to spend the day.

In my opinion, Bellagio is one of those older hotels compared to all of the newly remodeled or built hotels, but it's just so classy that I feel like it can always compete with these newer hotels. The hotel is just absolutely beautiful and the location is perfect since it's pretty much in the middle of The Strip. 

Bellagio is probably best known for the water show in front of the hotel. Thousands of people each and every day watch this show. I've seen it about a hundred times already, but it always amazes me. I highly recommend watching this show if you haven't already. I have to say that watching it right next to the water is really nice since you get to hear the music playing too, but I would also suggest watching it once at night on top of the Paris tower. It provides a different view and it's just as spectacular. Also, if you are of age, go watch it from Hyde inside of the Bellagio Hotel. They have great views of the water and the drinks are good too. 

On the inside of the hotel they have the beautiful glass flowers on the ceiling. They also have the botanical garden and plenty of shops and restaurants to choose from. I've been to the Bellagio buffet for lunch once and for the price the food was really good.

Most of my trips to Vegas are for my birthday which falls during the month of December and during that time, the hotel has set up their holiday decor including a really fun display that features trees, flowers, water effects, and animatronic animal.

The overall feel of the hotel is very elegant with artwork displayed everywhere and architecture that is grand in scale and beautifully crafted. The lobby area features a blown glass chandelier that was created by Washington's own Dale Chihuly.

The Bellagio shops feature a wide area of fancy stores where piles of money can be spent if that's your thing, or you can just sit back and people watch all day both here and on the casino floor. Speaking of dropping lots of cash and casino floors, the Bellagio combines both of these options in to one handy gaming area as well as a very large sports betting area.

My favorite feature about this hotel is the buffet restaurant that has a ton of great food at a price that's not too bad considering everything that you get.",1,2,3

I have been here twice and the first time I went we got a room that was beautiful.  I man everything was wood, huge bathroom with marble floors, super nice comfy beds.   The second time we had a nice room also, but different.  It was smaller and the furniture was just average.

At night time and especially on the weekends, it is very crowded and hard to take pictures, but arguably more beautiful when lit up at night. They have a full time crew driving around the man-made like just making sure the nozzles are properly adjusted. It is really quite the site to see that words do not do justice. 

Also of note inside the Bellagio are the Botanical Gardens. If you click over on my profile, I did a full review of them separately. As for gambling in the casino, it seems that as an older venue, they don't pump the cigarette smoke out as well as in the new ones, so you've been forewarned.

My husband had never been to Vegas before, so what do I do?  Book a room at the most beautiful hotel in the city!

I was lucky enough to find a deal for $104 per night and was sold.  The Bellagio really is first class all the way.  From the helpful staff to the sophisticated room to all of the amenities, what more could a person want?

Here are some highlights:

-Free upgrade to a room overlooking the fountain show. 
-Delicious breakfast buffet that we didn't even have to wait in line for (we were hand chosen since we were a party of two and willing to sit at the bar).
-Gorgeous pool area.  A strawberry daiquiri is a must.
-The house band at the Fontana Bar.  What can I say?  I love cover bands.
-The atrium.
-Jean Philippe Patisserie!  I said that with my horrible French accent about 147 times.
-Automatic toilets in the lobby that actually give you a chance to wipe.

The rooms are now dated and this visit, I discovered that my bedsheet had a large hole in the top sheet near my feet. And not for the first time my TV did not work, and after 1h I am still waiting for someone to look at it.
I no longer feel appreciated for my loyalty to this hotel.  I belong to the Mlife reward program and one of the most important benefits to me has been the buffet line pass which circumvents hours long waits.  Last night on entering the line I was told that because it was so busy, I could not enter since the higher tier members were having to wait too long in the member line....my only option was to get in the regular line and wait 2h.  When I called this morning, I was told that this was a new policy, but no one bothered to tell me.  I was told anyone can pay extra to get a line pass...this certainly does not cut back on the potential wait for upper tier members.  And this is representative of the changes that I see adding extra charges for many things.
There are huge crowds here which affect the quality of the visit with lines and masses of people everywhere.
In the distant past room upgrades and a late checkout were offered, but this is no longer something that I have experienced unless one pays extra.
No question the Bellagio has been a quality, beautiful resort at which I have always felt special, but unfortunately as a regular visitor I have seen the overall quality of my experience here deteriorate.  I have great memories, but things have changed and are not at all the same.
I feel that perhaps one of the Wynne resorts is a better option.

The husband booked us the ultimate romance package through the Bellagio this past weekend and let me just tell you...it was splendiferous! We stayed in what is called a cypress suite which had the square footage of our home. There were private baths and a giant king size bed facing the strip and fountain show. The room included a steam shower, a jacuzzi tub, a living room with giant flat screen TV, electric window shades, and so much more.

Everything was superb from the housekeeping staff popping in to offer chocolates to the casino floor that despite being a smoke friendly atmosphere doesn't smell like smoke at all. Oh and the room was immaculately clean.  

The package we received included pick up and drop off at the airport via limo. Not only were the drivers friendly, they really took care to show you how very fancy Vegas can be from a limo. 

Of course everyone loves the fountains at the Bellagio, while we were there we saw probably 50 shows from various vantage points. The view from the room couldn't be beat and you can listen to the music on the TV. Our friends had a room without a view and in retrospect they decided that paying the extra for the view would have been highly worth it.

When I checked into my room, there was a massive clump of hair in the bathroom sink. Disgusting. I've staying in all kinds of hotels all over the world from two to five stars and have to say I've never seen a dirtier bathroom.

We had an unfortunate incident where a colleague had to have emergency surgery while on our trip. A horrible incident anywhere, but especially when one has to spend hours in a Las Vegas ER. When I called the hotel desk in the morning to ask for a late checkout so we could visit our friend in the hospital and get her returned to her hotel. We needed to make sure she was comfortable and all arrangement were made for her family to arrive before we caught a flight out of the city that afternoon. I was informed that it would only be possible if we paid a 1\/2 day rate of $70+ dollars.

If you're most interested in gambling, it is not a bad hotel to stay at, however, if you want a really nice room and a fun atmosphere, Bellagio might not be the place for you. It is definitely not a party hotel.

The Bellagio has a Chihuly moral on the ceiling, Dale Chihuly is a very talented glass blower and the artwork is a unique and innovative addition to the hotel. Additionally, the Bellagio fountains are quite the sight and while I consider them to be an essential stop for first-time tourists, you do not have to stay at the hotel to enjoy them.

The rooms are what I have the biggest problem with. They are not necessarily shitty but they are pretty basic. The last time I stayed there, my room was relatively small, almost congested. For just a little more, you could have a far more spacious room at The Cosmopolitan, with upgraded amenities.

The pool at the Bellagio is very, mellow and relaxing. It's also quite pretty. Unlike many of the hotels in Vegas, you can actually read a book here. However, I don't really find Vegas a place to go to have a mellow time. If I wanted to read a book by a pool, I'd go to Hawaii.

The location of the Bellagio is ideal. It is in the heart of the strip so getting from point A to point B is a lot more simple than if you were to stay at Palms or even the Wynn. You can walk next door the Marquee at The Cosmopolitan because you're not going to want to go to The Bellagio's club, The Bank. It just really is not the place to be.",1,0,0

One positive thing I can say about our stay at Circus Circus is that it certainly made our decision to splurge on the Bellagio for our last night feel like the best decision we ever made!

The lobby is absoulutely gorgeous!  Probably one of the nicest in Vegas.  Check-in was approximately 50 times faster here, and they had us in our room in no time!  We were greeted by a very friendly housekeeper who came in and made sure our towels, robes, pillows, and chocolates were fully stocked and showed us where everything was.  Very sweet and friendly lady!

The room was immaculate, the bathroom was amazing, the curtains opened and closed remotely, the bed was super comfy, and the view was unbeatable!  We felt like royalty in our room!

HUGE disappointment of the night:
We had decided to pay a bit more for the full lakeview room, which offered a full view of the fountains of Bellagio, complete with the music streamed live through the TV.  We got ourselves a bottle of wine, settled ourselves in front of the window, and waited for the show to begin... and waited, and waited, and waited.  Finally, I called the front desk and inquired as to why the fountains were not going off.  I was informed that they had canceled the shows for the evening due to very high winds.  I wanted to cry.  We hadn't seen the fountains all week because we had been saving it to see on our last night from our room.  I asked if they were offering any kind of discount for their guests who had paid extra for the lakeview room, and I was transferred to an extremely sympathetic and apologetic woman who agreed immediately to credit $50 to our account.  I was still very disappointed, but I thanked her and said I understood.

Queue moping.

My boyfriend suggested I have some wine and take a bath to cheer myself up, since our bathroom was equipped with a very nice soaking tub.  I dumped the whole mini bottle of shampoo into the tub and made myself a nice bubble bath and proceeded to relax.  A few minutes into my bath, I heard my boyfriend laughing in the other room.  I asked what he was laughing at, and he responded ""the fountains are going off.""  I leapt out of the tub, covered in bubbles, wrapped a towel around myself and ran to the window, but I was too late.

Queue more moping.  Please please please don't let that be the only time they go off tonight!  Fortunately, I got to see the fountains go off three more times (at half height, I believe), so I was content!  We were still given a $30 credit, since they did set the fountains off, but not nearly as much as they would on a regular night.

Overall, I felt very pampered and comfortable, and I felt that the staff genuinely cared about my happiness.  Now if only I could afford to always stay in hotels as nice as this one!",1,1,0

I stayed for three nights in the late summer during my first trip to Vegas without the parentals and since turning legal. The Bellagio was running a special promotion and I falsely believed I scored a sweet deal on my Fountain Room. It might have been my own bad for not reading the fine print (who does?), but I actually booked a Fountain Room in the Spa Towers, which only offers PARTIAL views of the famed Bellagio Fountains. You could imagine how upset and frustrated I was when I discovered this ""small detail"" when we were checking in.  Y'all really shouldn't market it as a Fountain Room then because we could only see a portion of the Fountains.... Again, I'll take responsibility for this mishap as I didn't fully read the room description when I was making the reservations. Yet, that doesn't invalidate my angry feelings of being cheated; the allegedly awesome rates now seemed like a shady ripoff. 

Our room itself was just alright. After checking in and traveling what seemed like miles to the Spa Towers, we opened the doors to our room and was greeted by dirty white towels sitting on our bathroom sink. The housekeeping folks forgot to take these with them after they finished cleaning our room. At a regular hotel, this is no big deal--but at the Bellagio, with their immaculate reputation and sky-high prices, our stay was definitely starting off on the wrong foot. We called the front desk and informed them of our situation. 

After checking out our room, we also found that the iPod docking station on our nightstand was broken and displayed the incorrect time. As someone who is always punctual, this drove me nuts! My boyfriend tried for 15 minutes trying to adjust the time but to no avail. Other than that, our room was fine. It wasn't super extravagant or posh; but it had nice marble floors in the foyer, mood lighting, a 40"" LCD flat screen TV, an in-room safe, mini bar fridge, automatic drapery, and one stand-in shower and jacuzzi bathtub.

We didn't experience any other housekeeping issues during our stay. They were actually very good in cleaning our rooms and leaving us chocolate. The Bellagio is one of the older hotels on The Strip and having The Cosmopolitan as its neighbor did not help their case (we spent more time there than at our own hotel). Although its prime location is a plus and the service was great. 

I don't gamble so I can't comment on its casino. There are plenty of dining and shopping options (ranging mostly on the pricier end). The hotel is truly gorgeous and elegant with lovely European architecture and design. However, traveling to and from our room took extremely long because the Spa Towers aren't located at the main tower. 

All in all, we had an ehh experience. What I ultimately took away from my Bellagio visit (besides carefully reading the fine print!) is that the next time I play in Sin City, I'm going to stay at The Cosmo.",10,9,8

A little side note for whoever is in charge of this catastrophe: why are you even charging for parking now?

-Rooms aren't as nice as the hotel itself. The beds weren't as comfy, the TV was constantly glitching, and the bathroom was average. I've stayed in better rooms at cheaper hotels.
-Despite the above bullet, rooms are still pretty pricey.

Overall: Go to the hotel and look around, but I wouldn't recommend actually sleeping there.",0,0,0

I stayed there for free on the 40st floor, I must say, this is one of the most relaxing vacations in Vegas! 

Rooms - great, specious, beds were beyond comfortable, bathroom was huge as well. 
Pillows were so good, I actually grabbed few home! (I Paid)

Buffet - Pricey but very good! 

Service -  was nice, yet, they carded me every 5 min.
I felt harassed! Yes I was 17! 
but my ""international"" DL worked well!

Cleanliness - Spotless, always smells good (they put air fresheners inside of the central AC, actually there's a company which provides an individual copyrighted fragrance to each hotel).

Public - Defiantly way more upscale, somewhat on the older side, more dressy couples & Asian people, I don't know which but Asian. 

I love Asian people! I love all people!

Spa - was great seeing totally nude men in an American spa.
No I'm not a pervert, but I think men should unite & stop being weird about nudity!

- They had a fridge right near the jacuzzi filled with ice cold water, coke, red bulls & V8 cans, All for FREE, which felt great drinking while cooking my butt in that hot tub!
As a teenager I did not have boundaries (or may be b\/c I'm Israeli but that's another story) so I grabbed like 12 red bulls & 5 V8 cans... 
It's free (Hey I payed to get in!). A lil self humor.

A big jacuzzi, 2 saunas, wet & dry, nice exchange rooms, got a rope.
Caesars is way nicer though.

The hotel guests are being charged for spa which is wrong in my opinion! 
Entrance should be free if you're a guest! 
Specially for boys my age who came to gamble & waist all of their money on strippers, cheap drinks, slot machines & happy endings in this nasty awesome city!!


Themes \/ special attractions - The fountain is breathtaking, specially when its dark, indescribable!
Gotta check it out but you don't need to stay here for that.

The flower garden - Is really pretty, it's a garden in a closed area near the lobby, put together in a very organized neat way, flowers comes in many kinds & colours. Very interesting.
For 10 minuets.

Bottom line, come here if you are filthy rich & over 40yo (if younger go to the Wynn or Venetian), you're old loaded schmuck.
Or stay if it's free.

This place is more mellow & less crazy, yet wealthy & classier. So if you don't want too much going on & don't wanna take a vacation from your vacation, come here.

SO GLAD SIGNATURE SUCKED!!!  I couldn't believe how beautiful the entire hotel was.  You walk in and instead of the stench of smoke, you smell sweet, pretty flowers...all coming from their own botanical conservatory!  They have a greenhouse where pretty little butterflies live. YES, even in Las Vegas, smoke capital of the world!

The shops are all top class - Hermes-category and our suite had this UNBELIEVABLE view of the Bellagio fountains.  Turn on Channel 22, and you can hear the music which the fountains are dancing to.

The Suite was HUGE!!  1000+ sf of pure glamour.  Bellagio does NOT skimp on details.  There were 3 bathrooms! 1 - 2 - 3!!!  We put baby in bathroom 2, and our nannys used the 1st bathroom, while my husband, older daughter and me used bathroom 3.

Our shower had a STEAM function!  So nice to be able to come home after a smoke-induced day in the casinos, and the extreme dry-ness of Vegas, and sit in your own private steam room in your Bellagio Suite overlooking the fountains, with a view of the fake Eiffel Tower.

The only thing that I need to note is this hotel is NOT child-friendly.  Most children under age 12 are NOT allowed in the restaurants after 7pm, and before 7pm, they STILL have to be at least age 5.  THIS MEANS NO HIGH CHAIRS and NO BABIES.

We were completely blessed to have been checked in by a woman who has kids - otherwise, I am sure we would have gotten crap treatment.

Other than the fact that they publicly frown upon children in Vegas, this place really spoiled us.  And the location is awesome - right across from Paris, smack dab middle of the strip.

One is the price and two is the snootiness.  We stayed in a VIP room with a private check in service and complimentary snacks\/alcohol.

Seriously, I hate how money rules Vegas.

That said, once we were labeled, I had an amazing experience at the Bellagio.  Our room was very spacious, and felt the bathroom was the same size as the room itself (which is probably more important since we spent more time getting ready than sleeping).

Although pricy, the food was delicious.  Room service, the breakfast buffet downstairs and various restaurants, everything was delicious and cooked perfectly.  Even at the check-in, that app bar was perfect for us to get pm snacks\/wine while getting ready for the long night.

I arrived at the Bellagio overlook area about 5 minutes before the show and had great place to watch it from. Perched on the wall, with few people about.  I have seen the show many times but was absolutely floored by the effect of the water and lights playing to what could be the best ever song to accompany the show - ""Time to Say Goodbye "" by Andreas Bocelli and Sarah Brightman.  They do mix the songs up so it may be hard to time it just right but either way I hope they play a song that gives you the same effect.  Good Luck and enjoy.",0,1,0

Cons: 
-Immediately upon check in, I was let down by the customer service. The woman at the front desk gave off the impression that checking us in was the absolute last thing she wanted to do.
-The deal we found online stated that upon check in we would be upgraded, free of charge, to a suite or a room with a fountain view if available. After bringing up the deal ourselves, we were upgraded to a ""Junior Suite."" Despite the lack of good customer service, we left the front desk with smiles on our faces and high anticipation to see our room. We finally arrive to our room, absolutely not impressed. I've stayed in nicer standard rooms...this was supposed to be a suite??
-The shower allowed a good amount of water to escape, soaking the floor.
-The desk was made of some type of wood and granite. Beautiful, except... The drawers on the desk were missing the granite, as if someone had pulled it off? Definitely an eye sore in what you would expect to be an elegant and well-kept room.
-When pulling up to valet, the staff just stood in a circle laughing and chitchatting with one another for a good amount of time AND THEN proceeded to come assist us.
-There are two lines for their buffet. One of the lines is labeled ""invited guests"" however that doesn't include any guests of the hotel. So even if you are paying to stay at the Bellagio, you must wait in the longer line.
-The line for checkout was RIDICULOUS! Although they do offer a checkout option from the television in your room.

Pros:
-Botanical gardens, obviously! Huge tourist attraction and there's no guessing why. It's breathtaking.
-The Jean Phillippe cafe had amazing service, delicious chai tea and scrumptious chocolate covered strawberries.
-Pool area is absolutely beautiful, from our room window I was able to count 4 pools, although there may even be more! The architecture is just pure perfection.

My first time ever staying at Bellagio and I was disappointed. Have stayed at all the nice hotels in Vegas and I thought this would be nicer. However, I was not overwhelmed. It's very nice but not 5 star. Nothing majorly wrong but little things (and they say it's the little things that matter) like an issue with the plumbing in my room and a rude bellhop.

The good:
Huge gym with nice staff. It's included in the ""resort fee."" LOL. Why have a resort fee. Just raise your price by 20. Anyway, nice gym and it was really huge. Busy but tons of machines available. They could use a couple of standard exercise bikes as they only have recumbent. However, great staff, water available all over, tons of equipment, nice view of the pool area, etc....

The pool area was very nice. I only spent a little time out there but they had good pool service, lots of chaises, and several pool options. A few too many smokers but it's Vegas so what you gonna do. 

The hotel is really huge. Several restaurants to choose from. Many stores. Obviously a big casino. Lots of extras like the art gallery and flower garden. Overall, a very impressive hotel and, considering how big it is, it's run pretty smoothly.

I will most likely keep away from this specific hotel for a while... I had an issue with their Roulette table scamming me.  I sat at a $25 table and asked for $1 chips.  The dealer said this is a $25 table and I had to have $5 chips.  That was a lie because I've done it before at other casinos.  This was a cheating way to get me to waste my money.

I've decided to stick to a 2 star rating, however, overall the service wasn't too bad.  I had some issues with their Jean Phillipe Patisserie charging someone else's room and the supervisor messed up and didn't refund properly... I am still dealing with their Guest Services for all the issues they put me through.  Having to speak with hotel and MLIFE is a bit annoying since they are separate departments.

Concierge was extremely helpful with assisting me with my tickets for the Cirque show because we had to swap something.  The buffet had amazing service.  

Bellagio is rating quite high among the other hotels (5 diamond\/star?), however they had failed to provide that experience to me this time.",3,1,1

Service: Everyone, from the check-in to the engineers to the restaurant staff is friendly. Housekeeping only provided turn down one night, however. which was odd.

Rooms: 

-- We were lucky to have the most phenomenal view of the fountains and Eiffel Tower. 

-- Our room was huge and for the most part in good condition. Furniture is starting to show wear and tear. The bathroom was dirty when when we checked in though, which was gross. 

-- Biggest problem was that the TV didn't work the entire time we were at the Bellagio. 4 engineers and 48 hours later I gave up. Knocked off one star for the inconvenience of hosting the hotel engineers and lack of a TV.

Price: Here's where Bellagio loses another star - this property is not worth the $325 per night I paid. They also overcharge for other things (e.g. $6.50 for a bottle of water in the gift shop, $7.50 for a glass of orange juice at breakfast, etc.)

Overall: I've stayed at the Venetian, Four Seasons, etc. and found those to be a better value due to the condition of their rooms, their far more reasonable prices for things like orange juice, etc. I won't be staying at the Bellagio again, unless I can get a much better rate.",3,1,3

My reasons for not giving 5 stars was we wished the pool didn't close at 6. We went sept 29th.  It would have been so nice to after all that walking to get into the pool.  The weather was in the high 80's.  When we went during the day, The water was too cold to get in. That was around 11 AM and the pools were in the full sun, so they must not heat those.  We were able to go into some of the pools that were in the shade, which must have been heated because we were able to tolerate being in there, but they were still chilly.  

Staying in a room that had a view of the fountains was worth it though.  some have said it was better to watch it from the street.  We disagreed. We were on the 25th floor and you could see the design that the fountains made better from the higher view.  The center ring, the water would go out to the side and then down. it looked like a flower opening up.  You couldn't tell that from the street, so we preferred watching from the room. But another complaint, our windows were dirty. Maybe it is hard to keep the dusty dirt off the windows in the dessert, but it was noticeable.  I don't think there is a big difference between the premium fountain view room and the deluxe. I would pick the deluxe and save that money.  

The conservatory is beautiful, and the glass in the lobby.  There are some nice shops, that aren't cheap, but are cheaper than the Armani, and Dior, etc. that are also their.  They have a great pastry, crepe, and chocolate restaurant.  We wished they had some more quick bite places there besides only expensive sit down places and sandwiches in the pastry shops.  I don't mean McD's, but places like in New York, New York with delicatissens and different places to get a quick bite and get back to site seeing, yet also be more reasonably priced.  The Venetian had a food court as well.  it was just a noticeable thing that would make Bellagio have more of the conveniences we saw in some of the other hotels if it didn't have only sit down restaurants, or sandwiches in the bakeries to chose from.  

The staff was okay.  The bell service were exceptionally polite, of course, they are wanting that tip. The staff in the bakery with the crepes, were rather surly.  They were very busy, so they had to work hard, but ... there wasn't much smiling and friendlieness, so I can't say they were excellent.  

Overall, I would stay here again if I planned to spend more evenings in the hotel watching the fountains, but might stay at some of the cheaper hotels next time and just go to Bellagio to see the conservatory and shops.",0,0,0

I think any hotel in Vegas is gonna work extra hard the first few years to establish themselves amongst the competition. Here we are several years later and all those things that impressed me the first time around just went out the door after this visit. 

Aside from everything in it feeling dated, our bathroom shower flooded within the first hour of being in the room. It took them almost 45 minutes to send someone up to fix it. Maintenance came and no one ever came up to pick up the sopping wet towels we used to prevent the spillage from going into the carpet. 

And don't get me started on the lack of ice in the ice machines and no water in the vending machines. I remember the day where the turn down service would leave chocolate on your pillow and now you can barely get them to bring you a towel. 

fail. I don't know how they get off being a 5 diamond hotel cause in comparison to the Venetian or Palazzo, whose rooms are much better, the Bellagio is falling short. I don't think I will be staying there any more.

The good points. This hotel is certainly impressive, and the accommodations are top notch. It is certainly in keeping with the root Italian word of this Hotel's sobriquet, which is Bella! Something extraordinarily beautiful that it is unforgettable. You sigh at beholding such beauty.

However, my sigh comes from the extravagant price of the suite that did not quite deliver on our expectations.

We arrived during a very busy holiday weekend, and the only room available was a Private Suite at $600 \/ night. I politely asked what type of amenities came with this room, and I was provided with a well written brochure outlining the impressive size and view of this quite expensive room. 

Needless to say, we were quite impressed and handed the lady my American Express Card.

As we were escorted upstairs, we had very high expectations as to what this room would be like. 

We have stayed in many suites in many hotels in Las Vegas, and we were informed that this was going to be better than any of them.

When the door swung open, we were greeted with what amounted to a nice comfortable suite whose description did not align itself with what we saw, and summarily experienced. The suite was smaller than what we expected, and it's layout actually was not as functional. There were too many hidden corners. Instead of a nice expansive view, we had a room that was like a maze. 

Honestly, in all the times that I have stayed in LV, this was the most disappointing experience I have ever had seeing as that I was paying a lot for this room.

Needless to say, I will not be staying in another Bellagio Suite ever again. 

Not for even half what they charged us for this Suite.

My philosophy on trips to Vegas is to have as much quality fun as possible on as little money as possible.
So for that philosophy, I have not stayed at the Bellagio until this summer when they made the rates so very reasonable.
I glad they did ....
What an absolute great experience.
As a ""low roller,"" I got to experience the vegas experience as a ""high roller.""

First, 
there are no other hotels on the strip that have a comperable to the collective beauty of the lobby, the atrium and the casino of the Bellagio.
Second,
 there is no more romantic experience than watching the fountains of the Bellagio under the pines and listening to Andea Bocelli.
It does not get better than that ......

One of the really enjoyable aspects of the casino is their drink service. Most casinos bring you watered downdrinks in small glasses. 
The Bellagio brings drinks just as you would get in the lounge 
and they come in glasses that are reasonable in size.... 
I asked for a gin and tonic 
and the server asked if I wanted it made with Tanqueray. 
I am not sure what the well gin is for most casinos, but I expect that it is not Tanqueray.

What an amazing choice of enjoyable venues for lunch and dinner.
Once again, the summer tasting menus made eating affordable.
An excellent lunch at Olives was something I did not expect to do while in Vegas.

The Cirque du Soleil evening show, ""O"" is the best in vegas. There is an amazing sculpture collection of Richard MacDonald in the lobby of the theater.
Art abounds everywhere in the hotel and casino.
The shopping is upscale, an amazing set of boutiques

Finally, the five pool swimming area is just an expression of class.
They have fountains in the center, the architecture is amazing.
I understand that two of the pools are heated or warmed, but the pool I used was very nicely cooled due to the heat of the summer.
A wonderful afternoon experience.

Our room window stretched all the way from the floor to the ceiling. Gorgeous. The bathroom had a walk-in shower, separate from a big tub that you could soak in, plus 2 sinks (his & hers). Gorgeous.  The entire room was gorgeous -- you really didnt want to leave the room.  As for the rest of the place - casino, restaurants, lobby, whatever ..... GORGEOUS.

There were no clear lines so we just got in line behind a couple that was already checking in. When the couple finished, and walked away, we looked at the desk lady and she called us over. As we were walking up, some douche bag who worked there zooms in front of us, puts his arm out in front of my boyfriend and gestures for another couple to come over and be helped by this lady who already called us over. When we told him we were waiting in line and that the lady had called us over, the guy than said oh I didn't see you there. But I will find you a line as he walks off to talk to other people.. No apology at all, and the couple he rushed in front of us had walked in behind us. 

I turn around to look for my sister, and she was with another desk clerk checking in. I walked over to her and let her know if the guy she was working with, if we could get two rooms on the same floor. The guy than said, the rooms were not ready and they only have one room ready with a king bed. WTF what happened to reservations we made two months ago?? I know we're ten minutes early to the 3'o clock check in time but that shouldn't matter. So I asked when the second room would be available and he said he didn't know. But could offer us two rooms with two queen beds instead. We just took that, it was raining out, I was tired of the hotel already. 

The rooms were ok, nothing fancy, not worth the hype of Bellagio at all. My room had chocolates left or us, but my sister's did not. Inconsistency. 

I didn't find this out till the last day, but my sisters room reeked of smoke and she definitely does not smoke. But she just got used to the smoke of Vegas so she didn't smell it in her room.  But I did and I know for a fact that we reserved two non smoking rooms. 

Ah, and upon getting home, we find out the hotel charged my sister an extra 100$ to her bill. She had no extra services at the hotel, barely even spent time in her room.

Would have been nice if he did the following:

1. Smile & introduce himself
2. Ask what we would like to drink
3. Tell us about the specials and soup of the day

To be fair, the food was delicious. Just our waiter really sucks.  He did not refill our water glasses.

I would have totally been fine with that. I've never been to Vegas before, so what did I have to lose, right (well except for my life savings at the penny slots)?! 

Well to my gosh darn surprise, he tells me nonchalantly, ""yay, Russ booked us at Bellagio."" 

Well hot damn. That sounds mighty nice. And indeed it was very nice. When we arrived in Vegas at 6 am Saturday morning, our room was already prechecked in the day before so we could take a much needed nap and shower as soon as we passed the massive casino floor. 

We stayed in the main tower, deluxe suite. It had such nice appointments thought out that I honestly did not want to leave. But since it was around 45° outside, I wanted to soak up some winter chill while I was here. Khai and I really liked the jacuzzi bath tub and all the bath products associated with it. They really left nothing to chance. There was even a razor and shave gel for me in there. 

I think the best feature of the whole room, besides the automatic curtains, was the bed. definitely one of the best I've slept on. I should've checked what brand it was since I may be in the market for a new bed myself. 

Although we didn't have a view of the fountains, we had a nice view of Caesars from one side of our room and the Palms out the other. Those fountains are loud anyways and I probably would've been up all night watching them in awe. 

I enjoyed my stay here and would recommend it to anyone who is probably going to spend more time in the room than in the casino, which was particularly ashey.

When reviewed, they were for drinks in the fridge.  I advised them that we didn't have any drinks from the fridge.  We'd looked at a few, but the fridge was left as we found it.

Apparently they have sensors on the item, and just removing it causes a charge.  There's no such notice on the fridge, or on any check in paperwork.  They obviously make extra money on this from anyone who doesn't check their bill, and it struck me as almost unethical not to warn people that merely removing an item to look at it will cause a charge.

I loved having a big room with a view of the fountains and access to great shops. O was also fantastic and worth seeing. 

I hated the tremendous amount of noise and super packed lobby that had more rude and obnoxious people than I've seen at any other hotel in Vegas. They also nickel and dime you with Denny's caliber food at 5 star prices. The steaks were worse than your average Vegas buffet.

Yellowtail had a great environment, view and presentation but the quality was like a conveyor belt (read Blue C Sushi) place with premium 5 star pricing. 

I enjoyed getting a chance to stay, but if I had to do it over again I'd probably stay at Four Seasons Mandalay Bay, MGM, or the Venetian. 

Check in is horrible and takes forever, so just plan to waste an hour doing that. Knowing that up front and planning for it will help save a lot of frustration. 

Service was terrible - it's the ""we've got you now, so we don't have to try hard"" attitude and you get nickeled and dimed for everything. Fees, fees and more fees so you should expect that your hotel room price should be a minimum of 50% of your daily expenses - assuming you DO NOT gamble.

Olives was really really bad and overpriced too.

The pool is too small and crowded - Mandalay Bay is the place to be if you care about pools

I was so proud to be here and perhaps I expected too much, but I felt like MGM was significantly better for 1\/2 the price - and I'm not a thrifty person. I'[ll gladly pay a premium price for premium service. i just don't think that is what I got here.

The saving grace for this hotel is the fountain and the selection of restaurants that rank among the best in town (here's looking at you, Prime). In the end, this once grand hotel is simply showing its age and should be priced $100 cheaper per night than it is. Back to the Wynn I go.",1,1,0

The buffet while a sprawling cornucopia of consumption, it really disappointed.  I love buffets.  I plan for at least three rounds, and so help me if someone fills their plate with something as useless as fruit.  The seafood was just awful.  My friend warned me beforehand saying ""well where do you think it came from?!  Certainly not close to here!""  Serves me right I guess.

It's classified as a ""5 star"" hotel, and I think they mean it.  The rooms are so comfortable, elegant, and modern.  There's so much to do in the Bellagio including food, shows, the casino, the pools, etc.  The Bellagio has the best restaurants in Vegas; Three of them (Le Cirque, Picasso, Michael Mina) are Michelin star rated (and worthy of the rating).   I've also been to the Yellow Tail, and it's an amazing sushi spot. The Pool Side Café is great for a late morning brunch while recovering from the night before.  

The Bellagio doesn't have the swanky, young, and modern feel of the Cosmo - another hotel which I love.  But, every time I'm stumbling back to my room, the Bellagio feels like ""home"".  The location can't be beat either, and the staff there treats everyone like royalty.  I can't recommend this hotel enough.

PRO TIP:  If you want to stay at the Bellagio, I HIGHLY recommend you use Hotwire.  If you use Hotwire and do your research to pick the venue with the right amenities, then you have basically a 50-50 shot of landing either Bellagio or Aria for $100 a night (a steal).",7,0,1

The rooms are nice and everything at the hotel is very clean. The check in process is the only area I would say needs work. Took us over a hour to get checked in when we arrived. We got to the hotel around 12:00AM and there was quite a long line. Being a holiday weekend I think they should have had more help at the front desk. The good thing though is everyone working at the hotel was super friendly. They were able to help me with any questions I had. The gym at the bellagio is the best I have been to in Vegas. First off they have dumbbells that go up to 100 pounds. Many hotels only go up to 50pounds. Also they had all kinds of different equipment. If you like to workout on vacation this is the place to stay.  There are plenty of things to do right in the hotel as well. Many great places to eat. I really enjoyed the cafe' Bellagio and the Buffet. They also have higher end options if that is more your thing. The Casnio has lots of different machines and tables.

Well maybe it was 8 years ago.  We stayed in the main tower with a deluxe fountain view.  The first thing we noticed is 1.  This lobby and casino are always crowded;  like super SUPER outrageous crowded where it is almost like a fight to get out!  2.  It is dated and has seen better days.   

We get to our deluxe fountain view and it is a smoking room. In fact it smelled like someone smoked about 10 cigars in it the day before.  It was almost 1am but I still called and they said they would switch us to comparable room tomorrow.  It was so awful we got up early the next morning and headed straight to the front desk.  We were told that our deluxe fountain view was a 'free' upgrade and therefore the only comparable room was in the back tower and they showed us the view;  we could see fountains but our current view was beyond awesome!  We were right above the fountains.  The desk clerk said...I can send somebody to clean it with a serious spray and air purifier.  We said okay...we will try it.  We return to the room 90 minutes later to see a small air purifier.  They picked it up maybe 30 minutes later.  It may have helped reduce the stench by 15 percent.  But we didn't want to give up view so we went to Walgreens and purchased some air freshener.   Had to spray it every time we walked in the room.  Was sad we had to choose between great view or no smoke.  Shame they don't tell you a free upgrade is to a smoke filled room.  :(

There were some good points;  the view of the fountains was amazing!   The bed was super comfortable.  The pool and pool service was awesome (very pricey drinks though). 

Sadly this wasn't enough to make up for the room debacle.  I won't be back Bellagio.  And my disappointment continues to linger.",0,0,0

It is indeed quite luxurious in the resort and in the room. The room was beautiful with a large entrance that you most often see in master bedrooms in multimillion dollar mansions. The bathroom was nice and large with a huge soak tub.

We splurge on a fountain view, but we were located in the side building not the main building. I'm sure that would have even more of an upgrade. It's nice that they reserve a channel to play the music while the fountain show is going on. The Internet is free and it's unlimited to the number of devices, which is great!

The lay out of the resort was nice. From the front desk to the elevators, there is the seasonal room where they change the design monthly. You'll also pass the spa, shops, and a coffee shop. Near the coffee shop, there are some tables with a couple of chairs for you to sit and enjoy your drink. They line the windows so you can see the well manicured grounds outside.

The elevators to the rooms to the side building is tucked away, which we appreciated so there isn't a crowd pooling in the middle of the walkway.

The one downside was that the check in line was really slow, but once you get up there, you get the staff member's full undivided attention.

We got there on a Saturday at 7:30 PM with a reservation for fountain view room and a two queen beds. The guy at the front desk, David, sent us to our room. When I discovered it only had a king size bed, I called the front desk. The girl at the phone said something that I was to hear four times that night: ""Sorry but the reservation is not a guarantee of the room"". 
Cool. So you pay like 300 dollars in advance, and you just get a second or third best. 
I decided to go to the front desk in person. They tried all types of strategies: ""For 100 dollars more we will give you a suite"". ""For 30 dollars less we will give you a room that overlooks the back"". ""We can send you a small bed with wheels"". I could not believe it. 
After so much stress, the guy sent a very small, very uncomfortable twin size bed to my room. Next morning, we decided to change rooms. Luckily, they had one two floors above. When we got there -in a non smoking floor- it stunk like cigarettes. It was awful. Another change, two floors below again. We got what we wanted, 15 hours later and with no apologies.

You can valet either at the front lobby or off of Flamingo near the shops but if you're walking you'll be sure to enjoy one of Las Vegas' main attractions...the fountains! Gorgeous at night spectacular during the day-its a free show to see and enjoy before you even walk in the door.

Bellagio is one of my favorite hotel\/casinos on the strip. It's so beautiful inside but my goodness it's always crowded.  

You'll be greeted by a spectacular hand-blown glass chandelier. A sculpted massive arrangement of flowers adorn the ceiling and you'll see camera's flashing before your eyes since everyone will be ""blown"" away by its beauty.

A fabulous little lobby bar where you can rest your tired feet is always a favorite. I remember having cocktails there with my in-laws but since ""dad"" is no longer with us, every time I pass by I remember the time we enjoyed some great martinis!

When he was here we also went to see the amazing popular ""O"".  A water-trapeze spectacle show which is shown year-round.

For my anniversary I had dinner at Olives-where the food is amazing but the hostess who didn't sit us outside on our special day gets a big BOO! 

The nightclub I've heard is wonderful but years ago we enjoyed drinks and live music there with a great balcony water view.  Not sure if you have that option now, but on that occasion when you just want a nice view and a drink -this was the place to go.

The buffet can be hit or miss but for me it was a miss.  It's not my favorite on the strip but for some it could be enjoyable.

The main restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner was also a fail-sadly the food and service was not that great.

I've visited the museum which hosts various art exhibitions including exceptional historic artists, so if you're in town check out the Fine Art Museum so you don't miss your favorite collection.

The casino is beautiful and full of action, I don't play the tables much so me and my guests usually have fun at the slots but always walk away winners.

Shopping shouldn't be missed even if you're just ""Looky-Looing"".  Pop in the Chanel store and buy yourself at least a little bottle of perfume, you'll at least smell like a high-roller.

The conservatory shouldn't be missed. Every season they change it up and you'll find huge fun displays made of flowers!

One thing to note before I write my review.  The Hard Rock, Luxor, and Bellagio, are all charging ""Resort Fees"" while staying there to use the internet and other things. Each hotel was a different fee.

We checked in after midnight on the day of our reservation, so they used our room for someone else.  They gave us a smoking optional room and said that we could change in the morning.  When we got to the room, it smelled like smoke, so we let them know that we wanted to change in the morning.  We woke up and called at 9am, and they ask my wife to call back at 11am, because no one had checked out yet.  When she called back at 11, they gave us our new room number, and we didn't have to go to the front desk for anything.  We headed straight to our new room, and our old keys worked without issue.

The room was big and the bathroom was large.  It had a stand-up shower, and a full tub.  The bed was very comfortable.  The curtains for the window are controlled by two control panels located beside the bed and the entrance to the room.  The one minus for the room is a smaller old style TV.  They need to change over to Flat Screens.

We ordered room service two days, and both times the food arrived in like 30 minutes.  The food was hot, and good.  It was a bit pricey, but worth it. 

We checked out the pool area one day.  It was huge and nice, but the day we went, it was in the low 70's and windy, so we didn't stay more than a couple of hours.

First, the parking garage is easy to maneuver around and the lobby isn't too far from the garage. We were staying on a Sunday night and the figured the line to check in wouldn't be too bad. Well, we were wrong. Their system was down. Which is understandable. I don't mind waiting but when we finally got to the person checking us in, I tried to be friendly and spark some conversation considering she was probably having a bad day due to the system being down... No response. She just clicked away at her computer. Alright, so I guess it was a REALLY bad day. We got our keys and our room was a little ways away.. No big deal if you aren't lugging around a lot of things but we had a lot of stuff so it was kind of annoying. There was security checking to make sure you had a room key before going up which was nice. When we got to our room, it was nicely decorated but not entirely clean. There was still some hair in the bathroom and the bed linens didn't seem to be changed. There also wasn't a mini fridge in the room. I have never stayed in a hotel where a mini fridge wasn't standard. There also weren't any outlets in the bathroom.... Uhm what? The walls were also super thin. We could hear everything around us.

At first glance the hotel is gorgeous what's missing in my opinion is the extra nice touches one expects with a 4, or in this case 5 star hotel. The room and it's care was by far the biggest disappointment.  It's been hit and miss with the staff, the girl that checked us in was great to say the least however staff is inconsistent,  I wouldn't have expected to feel as if im bothering someone if I ask a question.  This happened on several occasions.  Bottom line is we won't be staying at the Bellagio again. Not for the price, everything is priced high however it's my opinion that management seems to think high prices somehow automatically translate to high quality or high end service,  in this case it just means high prices. I was so looking forward to staying at the Bellagio, unfortunately the past few days have progressively diminished that excitement.  I've reached out to the front desk with either no results or sarcastic  answers. Sad really. There are plenty of other options,  I suggest you explore them. Remember this is a corporate hotel and I'm pretty sure they own a ton of high end hotels here. We did visit Mandalay Bay hotel today which I'm sure is a sister property of the Bellagio  and we were impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel and the service and pleasant staff, better management maybe, slower pace for sure.

Why?  

Because I got engaged there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Two days after I graduated from college I went there for another ""vacation"" and to celebrate my release into the 'real world' with my boyfriend (husband now).  Little did I know he had about ten million tricks up his sleeve.  Checking in, you'll notice how incredibly gorgeous the lobby is!  Checking in was a breeze and the lady who checked us in was so beyond helpful with questions we had and did with a nice pearly white smile too.  The concierge was super helpful too (as I would later find out)  Our first nite we had there was spent relaxing in the room with room service! The bed was super comfortable, plush, and oh-so inviting.........  Ahhhhh, that was the life..........

The second day, my husband shuttled me out the room to the spa which he had set me up with a whole day of treatments; massage, facial, mani\/pedi\/sugar back exfoliation, the works.  The spa (which was just redone at the time) was gorgeous, spacious, quiet, peaceful, with all the spa amenities you could ask for, water, juices, tea, coffee, lotions, plush towels, THE WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  When I had called him to come get me downstairs ( i didn't have the key), he told me we got upgraded to a suite!  We got back upstairs to our suite and  I find from the entry way, all through the hallway to the bed, to the second bathroom (there were 2.5 bathrooms in this suite!)  was a trail of red rose petals, a chilling bottle champagne, chocolate covered strawberries in a white chocolate edible dish, and a plate of imported and domestic cheeses, fruit, and bread.  On the oversized bed scattered with rose petals was a velvet box......... Of course, you know how this fairy tale proposal ends.........................................  :)  

The concierge I later find out, expertly coordinated the perfect proposal with my husband.  They timed my spa schedule perfectly with the setup of the suite and knew what time I had checked into the spa.They helped my husband decorate the room with the rose petals, had the lunch setup and ready to go so the food would be up in time and made sure everything was coordinated so when I made the phone call from downstairs there would be no rushing or panicking.  They were all so incredibly helpful with my husband that he still acknowledges how nice they were almost 4 years ago.  The suite was beautiful, spacious, comfortable and oh-so fit for a princess!  The food we had at the hotel was awesome and even though you'll drop a dime, it's so worth it!    


We didn't eat at any of the really upscale restaurants while we were there, since he had made other plans, but we did eat at the buffet, and the 24 hour cafe and we were NOT at all let down.  The food was so good, fresh, and very well prepared.   


Am I biased to this hotel because I got engaged here?  Probably.  But it is really one of the most beautiful and romantic hotels in Vegas.  Everytime I see it in a picture or go to it on one of my many trips there, it always brings a smile to my face...........",2,0,3

I generally tend to leave a job having less respect for the establishment than prior to my employment since behind the scenes usually reveals a not so lovely side of the establishment.  This was not the case for me after I worked here.  I actually had more respect for Bellagio after my employment.  They treat their employees well and maintain a very high level of professionalism behind the scenes.

Everything at the Bellagio is top notch, granted as a guest you will pay a pretty penny for things but, you will not be disappointed.  I would also like to add that what they use as ""well"" vodka in their complimentary drinks served to their gambling guests is Grey Goose, or at least that is what they served when I worked there.  For you non vodka drinkers, many places consider Grey Goose top shelf so it's sort of a big deal that Bellagio serves it in their complimentary drinks.

Anyway, I have stayed at Bellagio many times since my brief period of employment with them and have always had a great experience.  The last time I stayed at Bellagio was when my fiance and I came to Vegas to elope over the summer.  Other than when we actually left the hotel to get married and take photos, we basically stayed in the hotel the entire time.  There is great shopping, amazing restaurants, awesome sights (fountains, conservatory, etc.), and let's not forget the people watching.  One of my favorite cirque shows, ""O,"" is there as well.  I think the best part of our stay over the summer was the pool experience.  We had a great private cabana over looking the entire pool area.  The service was great and we had a blast people watching while we were able to still enjoy a bit of privacy.  The ""cabana boy"" treated us like royalty and the cocktails were delicious and fresh.

I would by no means describe Bellagio as an inexpensive establishment, but if you have the money to splurge a bit while you are in Vegas, you truly can't go wrong with Bellagio!  If you tend to be cheap or bitter about prices, this may not be your favorite place, but I personally think their prices are justified considering the level of service and quality.

P.S.  ""The Bellagio Cocktail"" probably ranks among the top 10 things I miss about living in Vegas:)",6,1,3

Picked bellagio cause I love the casino and I got a great rate. The hotel is beautiful, the fountains, conservatory, restaurants,etc. Also the pool is beautiful! Perfect if you want to relax by the pool, not good if you are looking for the daytime party. A few other annoyance occurred during my stay. Checking in is brutal, tool for-ev-er, completely lost my champagne buzz from limo ride in. They need a quicker system. One night we were out at the clubs and were ready for bed but my key wasn't working. Called the front desk to send someone up from my cell and she was the rudest employee I have ever encountered in Vegas and then we sat in the hallway for 20 minutes while we waited for a staff member to let us in. The next morning in order to get my new keys after they were deactivated by my cell or credit cards(not sure where I'm supposed to keep my key since it doesn't mix with anything in my pockets) I had to wait in another 30 to 40 minute line just to have her give me a new key. Other than that the location and hotel are great and the housekeeping staff was SO friendly when walking passed them in the halls. The room was standard, bathroom, comfy bed, and automatic curtains were best part but nothing really set it too far apart than other rooms. Also the lighting is SO dim, made us tired while pregaming. Overall I recommend the hotel if you get a good rate, but think for the usual price they charge maybe check out another one of the top hotels on the strip cause the room was kind of blah and dirty (stains on ceiling) and those few bad encounters I had with front desk staff made me forget about some of the greatness of the hotel",0,0,0

One time it took almost an hour just to reach to the person at front desk for checking in. They sure should come up with a better way of checking in by hiring more people or opening more counters or something that hasn't been looked into yet. The buffet at Bellagio is world famous and it has all the reasons to be , their variety is amazing however it has come down a bit compared to the past. They have some cool deals time and again which again is a great thing. Overall I give them a 5 rating as I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with them- no complaints .

But the Bellagio did not really impress as a whole. I suppose it is too much to expect premium service (while paying premium prices!) at a resort when its mission is predicated on quantity over quality, but the reception we received at the front desk was really shockingly indifferent and rude. I found the reception area and front desk to be a morass of chaos and confusion at all hours of the day (even midweek!). And the property itself, though not without its charms, is aging. Our standard deluxe room was surprisingly roomy...it was as large as some junior suites we have stayed in. The decor was nice, understated and tasteful. The bathroom was quite luxurious, with a separate shower and tub, and acres of travertine and granite. Nevertheless, although the toilet had some sort of turbo-jet flush (I swear I was almost sucked in!), the water pressure in the shower was poor. To compound matters, the shower head was leaking from its attachment at the pipe and so water was sprayed everywhere on the ceiling and out to the floor. The shower head also was half-clogged with mineral deposits, so no more than a trickle of water was coming out. A call to maintenance quickly addressed this, however. I must say the phone operators, etc were quite courteous and helpful, in contrast to the front desk. What was particularly annoying was a strong whistling sound through the windows (we were only on the 10th floor, but it was particularly windy during our stay). When I brought this up to the front desk, I was first met with apathy, then a ""we can't do anything so you should suck it up"" attitude. Frankly, when I am paying these kind of prices, I find this unacceptable. Finally, we spoke to one of the managers who offered to find us another room. Nevertheless, this kind of behavior soured me on the whole property. We'll try the Wynn next time.",2,0,0

Bellagio is absolutely one of the most classy hotels in Vegas and has aged very well, setting the standard for future casino resorts that have been built in Sin City. From the moment you enter the lobby, you will be blown away by the ambiance of the resort and the staff treats you like they truly care about your business. 

Although it is rather pricey (both the room and the amenities on site), it is worth the money spent when you are looking for a luxurious getaway.  

The rooms are well furnished and clean, as you would expect them to be. The bed sheets, linens, etc are all of the highest quality and you will enjoy a great night sleep here.  The pool is large and has many available seats to enjoy your afternoons with a cocktail.  There is one large main pool and then many smaller, less crowded pools in the area. 

The casino itself is very nice with a large variety of table games and slot machines.  

From a location stand point, this place cannot be beat. It is in the middle of everything on the strip and a quick walk to Caesars, Cosmopolitan, City Center, and Paris\/Planet Hollywood. Quick tip: be sure to walk across the street to Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris casino for an incredible strip view breakfast. Be sure to catch the fountain show from here.

The only thing holding the casino back from being 5 stars, is that in comparison to the Palazzo\/Venetian (where I have also stayed) and the Wynn (next on the itinerary) it is one small step below. Considering every room at Palazzo\/Venetian is a suite, that puts it ahead of the Bellagio.

We decided to be fancy even though we're pretty non-fancy, since this is our first ""family"" vacay. It's definitely fancy. Our room bathroom is huge, with a fancy-shmancy glass shower and even a full size tub! The room itself has a king size bed with tons of pillows, which are obviously shows how fancy we are. (Can I use fancy more times? Probably. But I think this is enough.) No complaints about the room itself. There's even a digital scale inside the room if you want to make sure that the constant buffet dining isn't killing your waistline! (Ours was hiding underneath the counter--didn't notice it until day 3, so not sure how it compares to the scale # at home).

The housekeeper assigned to our room is like a stealth ninja--we leave for a few hours, and come back to a room that looks exactly the same but cleaner. How she cleans without moving our stuff? Not sure, but the room has been spotless our entire trip.

Amenities:
-The mini-bar and mini-snack-bar are ridiculously overpriced and way too tempting at 4am. But I guess if you have more money than us, it's super convenient.
-The hotel room is super super super far from the lobby. And you have to walk through all the tourists in the conservatory\/lobby to get there. At 4AM, it's maybe a 5 minute walk from lobby to room. At 10pm, it can take up to 20 mins because the group of 50 people in front of you are going at 1 mile per hour because they're taking pictures of the ceiling for no apparent reason.
-The gym is really nice and equipped with all the latest cardio and weight training equipment (no squat rack but they have a huge set of nice dumbells). Unfortunately, you have to walk through crowds of people to get there, so if you're self conscious, you might not want to go. Protip: the gym is inside the spa and is only open during the day, not 24h.
-There is a heated outdoor pool (yes! I know it's December! But we're from Boston and it's kind of warm-ish here and also, pool! How can you NOT go to a pool when it's there waiting for you?!?!) but only 1 pool and 2 hot tubs were open and they were on the opposite side of the courtyard from our hotel room. This was only a problem because it's the middle of winter and our feet got cold when we walked over. They have a full time lifeguard, which was silly because the pool that was open is only 3 ft deep and it would be embarassing if you needed saving there.

The entire hotel (casino, lobby, walking into the lobby, etc) is extremely crowded all day and most of the night. This is worse than any of the other hotels I've stayed at or have been to in Vegas. This also means that all the hotel restaurants have 2+ hour waits during peak times, so if you are lazy like us and don't like to leave the hotel, make reservations before your trip or stay somewhere else.

Get a mlife rewards card and link it to you room--you get points for your room stay which you can use for discounts at the restaurants.

I almost want to dock a star because the front desk called us around 8AM (who gets up at 8AM in Vegas?!!?!) because apparently there was a leak below and wanted to make sure it wasn't coming from our room. It wasn't. We went back to bed but 8 AM! On the other hand, for the people below us who had the leak, I guess it's awesome that the hotel tried to solve it ASAP.

Overall? Great hotel, but super tourist-packed so probably not the most convenient to stay at!",1,1,0

Although the place was nice, it wasn't anywhere near as nice as the Sky Suites at Aria. 

The bathroom that was for the room we were staying in with the two queen bathrooms was nice, but old. The shower seal leaked and flooded the bathroom because the shower door wouldn't stay closed. The tub was kinda small and not very nice. 

My cousin and I used the bottles of shampoo and soap as bowling pins and bowled in the bedroom with a roll of toilet paper was the ball. Ha! They give a ton of freebies, including individually wrapped natural sea sponge, but this might just be for the suites, rather than the regular rooms.

I was a little nervous booking a slightly ""older"" hotel, but I am so glad I did.  While we loved the new hotel we stayed at for our last Vegas trip 3.5 years ago, I wanted to do something different, and the risk paid off.

We had a fountain view deluxe king room on the 25th floor.  The moment you walked into our room, you were greeted with a center view of the Eiffel Tower and Bellagio Fountains. Could not have asked for a better, classic Las Vegas view!  The room was renovated and we had the beautiful blue & green swirls color scheme. 

The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable.  The laptop safe in the nightstand drawer was a nice touch  There was only one sink in the bathroom but I knew that before booking and it honestly was never a problem.  

We went to the Bellagio Pool or the Cypress VIP pool every day of our stay.  We were there to relax and enjoy, and we did!  The food and drinks at the pool were delicious.

We watched the Bellagio fountains from our room as well as outside at night.  A must-do when you are in Vegas.

The hotel was gorgeous and very clean, I loved the conservatory, the free tram over to Aria that we used for a show was very convenient.  We went to the Bank nightclub with some friends and that was fun.  I had a promoter stop me while we were walking around the hotel to offer me VIP entrance with free vodka til midnight.  If only he knew I was a 33 year old mom!  

Staff was always very courteous to us.  We dined at Fix for dinner once with excellent food, and the Bellagio Buffet on our last morning and the food was great for a buffet. 

Overall we loved our stay and I cannot say enough positive things about the Bellagio.  My husband had been pushing me to stay at Wynn or Encore, and I'm not a Wynn\/Encore fan so I'm really happy we were both thrilled with the Bellagio.  We would definitely go back.

**TIP: The Spa Tower, while technically ""newer,"" is unrenovated and therefore cheaper.  It is a much farther walk and I don't believe the fountain views are as nice.  Try to book in the Main Tower if you want to spend a little extra!  It's totally worth it.",3,0,1

The room was comped to someone in our group, so I mean I guess I can't really complain,but the room was so small and jam packed with stuff. Overall, It's nothing special. It's like an average room you would get maybe at Harrahs. ‍

Now, as far as the casino goes... I usually never gamble at the Bellagio (because I never win many hands here for some reason lol) but the dealers were so rude this time. No one smiles, and out of all the tables I sat at, only one person was smiling and making jokes. Everyone else for some reason had attitude and make snarky remarks.

You stay at the Bellagio for the experience, and I can promise you we got one. From trying to buy a bathing suit with poop stains in it by the pool, to being told the dinner was on the hotel, and when asking for a bill so you could give the waiter a tip, you get told that if you weren't lying they hotel would have given us a card to give them for the comp, and that we were making it up. Even though Liz the manager, who took the charge off our  bill explained that she had explained to the concierge that this was  a meal they were comping to try to make up for all the other issues we had. The room was never cleaned, and even after Liz put in a request the head of housekeeping was like oh yea we got a request to do your room early but we have so many rooms to clean why do you think you should get it done sooner. I might add this was 3:00pm and Liz had requested the room be cleaned at 10:45 that morning so that we could get ready for the dinner at Fix (the one where they called us liars) at 5:00pm. I will say we did VIP for O and is was AMAZING. But I will never stay at Bellagio again, nor would I ever recommend it and I would actually make sure to tell people why they should never ever ever, in a million years ever come to this hotel again. The valet when we were leaving actually stood to the side and watched my husband put the bags in the car. We had to use the smaller valet since thats where we had come in we couldn't get the car from the front lobby we were told. So yea he stood there and than had the audacity to put his hand out for a tip. My husband handed him a scrap piece of paper and said remember this moment and why you didn't get a tip. Like I said, we certainly got the experience of a lifetime while trying to celebrate my 30th Birthday and 5th wedding anniversary.

- smoke everywhere
- ""Hotel"" aspect is mediocre.
- fountains, shows, pastry shops are nice.
- would not return for the price, better options elsewhere.



Details:


- A non smoking room means 'maybe non smoking' because people disregard the smoking rules all the time.

- Even a non smoking room gets you covered with smoke every time you leave or enter your room, because you have to walk through the casino.    Book the Spa tower to avoid.

- The restaurants, though 'no smoking', will have cigarette smoke if it's near the casino.  Yellowtail for sure has cigarette smoke everywhere, Le Cirque can also have cigarette smoke (depending on if they close the door).  Sensi is far from the smoke, but we saw somebody smoking in the restaurant with no enforcement of the law.    Michael Mina's is pretty smoke-free.  

- Overall, smoke is better than Harrah's and Caesar's, but worse than the Venetian.

- cleaning staff is top notch, our room was sparkling clean every day.

- Concierge staff is not as top notch - we asked for a lingerie store.  There's like 4 in the area, but they had to think hard to come up with one.  Other similar examples.

- Pool closed early (4P?) all the time.  They don't want you at the pool, they want you gambling.

- asked for tailor service, they didn't have it.  Not a big deal, but it's not the Mandarin Oriental or anything.

- Workout room is $25 a day 

- No wireless but they do have wired for $15 a day.  But they charge $15 if you need an ethernet cable.  Bring your own.

- if you touch the snacks, you get charged because they are set to charge on weight change.  Seriously.


- JP Maury Pastry shop is one of the best (if not the best) in Vegas.

- Fountains are the best free show on the strip.

I've stayed at Mandalay Bay, Venetian, New York New York, Paris, Hard Rock, but have to say that the Bellagio is a cut above them. Sure, it has tons of tourists in horrible and gaudy outfits, but the restaurants and shops are more luxe (and it's next door to Caesars, which has more of the high-end brands in their Forum Shops). The Bellagio remains one of the nicer Vegas casino hotels, it's definitely one of the more family friendly places as well (if I'm here to party, I like Mandalay Bay, Hard Rock).

The pool, unlike others, is austere and relatively peaceful. Since I'm not here for a raucous bachelor party, I like that. Very relaxing, a small pool, but still plenty of people watching (a Vegas staple for me).

Expensive, but these days you can find some amazing deals, relatively speaking, online.

The rooms: I'd give them 3 stars, the maid service was sporadic, and we had to check out at noon, even when we asked for even 30 minutes of an extension. Also, the bathroom products were only ok, and I'd expect more from the Bellagio. Finally, I don't care what you say, but I want a coffee machine in each and every room I stay in.",1,1,2

It's located in the center of the action so you don't have to walk far. The Miracle Mile Shops & Cabo Wabo Cantina are directly across the street. The Michael Mina restaurant was delicious. The foyer was done in a stunning oriental theme. Room service was prompt and very friendly. The club Hyde overlooks the fountain and at night offers a spectacular view. The room was immaculately clean. I hate cigarette smoke and I barely noticed it in the casino. Check in and out was a breeze. I personally don't think it's priced too badly for what you get. Three night stay with room service (coffee only) came out to $401 per day. 

Downfalls: Not having coffee in your room means you have to order room service, I expect this is by design. Higher end hotels mostly have a Resort Fee. No matter where I stay it still bugs me, for this charge you get ? They say it's for using the amenities, like the pool, which they promptly tell you to leave at 4:00PM. Otherwise a great experince.

My complaints... Don't really have any, there was a charge on the bill for something I never heard of but they took it off with out hassle.  
  The pool area here was great too the drink service was extremely slow though, man were they hard to get a hold of, even after you ordered your drinks.

I stayed at this place with the bf and this is by far the cushiest (is that a word) place we have stayed at on the strip, thus far.

The lobby was an amazing place to walk into, the shopping was great, the service was quick and friendly, the rooms were immaculate, and the casino was *gasp* CLEAN and on the quiet side.

What made the lobby so great was its super-tall ceiling and its look of ""cleanliness"" (as compared to the cheaper hotels on the strip). I also liked how the public bathrooms were supplied with two-ply toilet paper. I know it sounds funny, but hey, in my opinion, that's how you rate the grandeur of the place.

As for the room, I loved the SIZE of it, the fountain view, and the never-been-touched look of it; it made me not want to touch anything for fear of moving something from its place! The look of the room also made me feel like it was okay to sleep on the bed because there was no evidence of raunchy lovemaking or anything of the sort. =) 

The bathroom was as immaculate as the room. This was one of the first hotel bathrooms in which I was not afraid to take a nice long bath in the tub.

All in all, great room, great price. I definitely recommend this place to everyone!

It's always the little details that impress me.  The turn down service at night was always on point, after a long day of walking in the 110 degree heat in Vegas.  The chocolate mints next to my bed, were perfect for when I had a sweet craving but was too lazy to get up and search for sweets.

Not one of those carpets that you want to line with towels before you walk across it.  The room, in both furnishings and cleanliness was a A+.

- Super nice staff.  From check-in to cleaning people to Concierge to Checkout.  A couple of semi-crazy people checking room cards at the elevators... crazy in a good way, making the guests who didn't speak English laugh.. felt uniquely American.  Personality over formality.

- I could use a little more transparency on what the room is going to cost.  You think you are paying $161 per night then along comes the Room Tax, the Resort Fee and the RESORT FEE TAX.  The Resort Fee is kind of bullshit anyway... but a Resort Fee Tax is kind of like finding out the alien's anal probe is ELECTRIC.  That $161 just became $215!

- when did hotels stop putting coffee makers in the room?  I just want to get my day going without dropping $40.

- most of the blackjack tables were minimum $25. That gets expensive quick (or in this particular case, you win a lot of money quickly).  I'd like to play a ten or fifteen dollar table to at least enjoy a couple of ""free"" cocktails before I go home crying.  (On the other hand, if you are in a hotel with $5 BJ tables, you're rubbing shoulders with chain-smoking tank top dude who is trying to find the perfect 99-cent shrimp cocktail so...)

- the blackjack dealer.  Bob or Dave from Glen Falls or Great Falls, New York. Within 8 minutes of sitting down he was spending more time talking than dealing.  And you were quite clear what his politics were.  ""We keep paying into Social Security and they tell us that it's going to run out!  But they don't run out of welfare money, do they??""  I really enjoy bullshitting with a blackjack dealer or bartender... but you're kind of a captive audience so when they go all Rush Limbaugh on you, they kind of have your attention.  But at least deal the effin cards while your irritating me. It was like playing Gai Pow at the Republican Nation Convention.

- the gym location.  Super great gym.  Best gym I've ever seen in a hotel.  Almost the best gym I've ever seen OUTSIDE a hotel.  But that morning trek to the gym is a private thing.  You're in your work out clothes, no make-up on (wife), sweaty on the way back to the room.  And the only way there is down long rows of blackjack tables and right through the lobby where there are billions of people trying to roll luggage and you just want to get to the gym.  Also, do you really want your visitors' first view of your wonderful lobby to be people trekking through on the way to the gym?

But, overall, really nice place and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.",5,4,1

How wrong I was! Upon entering the driveway it was just 'wow' all of the way. The reception was massive and they had plenty of staff ready to book you in. The only one downside was that we had to go into a smoking room which did have some smell left to it but was gone in a matter of hours and reception did tell us we could change later that afternoon if it was still bad.

The room was very spacious and the bathroom was huge. The resort is massive and trust me it will take you some time to explore. The gym had a great setup and has plenty of equipment- no waiting like at the gym back home!

We gave the buffet a go and just like everyone said it's a must visit. They make just about anything there and have heaps of options to choose from.

All up well worth the stay and couldn't believe the price compared to other hotels in the USA.

Our room had a spectacular view of Vegas (at night, the view was awe-inspiring), very soft and plush bedding, a mini bar, bathrobes and slippers and decadent little chocolates on the nightstand every morning. 

The bathroom needs it's own review on here :-). Our bathroom was almost the size of our room (seriously!!) Separate glass-enclosed shower, mammoth whirlpool tub (big enough to sleep in), double sinks with granite counters, huge mirror, makeup mirror, a phone (haha) and designer toiletries fit for a king or queen. 

I'm talking 20+ bathroom items (razors, shave gel, q-tips, mouthwash, shower caps, hairspray, lotion, combs, 3 toothbrushes, hair gel, sewing kit and more, ...on top of all your standard items). My friend was floored by the bathroom and spent 20 minutes getting acclimated to all the wonderful features, amenities and products.

The views of the fountains and the Strip (and the mountains, for that matter) were unbeatable. I wouldn't have thought I'd want to sit in a hotel room to watch water be shot into the sky, but sure did. Over and over.

This isn't a negative per se, but I have to admit that although the fountain view room was 100% fine and the penthouse enormous, I kinda like the Venetian more for the ""over the top holy crap how much marble can you have in one place is the phone gilded you know you're in Vegas"" feel. 

I think Bellagio caters to folks who have money and so aren't looking to be ""overwhelmed"" by opulence because they're used to it. Which is fine, I just like being bowled over.

Was oddly underwhelmed by the spa. Well, let me restate. Totally blown away by the size of it; getting from the locker area to treatment rooms involved what seemed like a quarter-mile walk through an uber-contemporary series of hallways. 

My body scrub and mini-facial was fine but--and this is due in part to my choice of services--I feel like I paid a heck of a lot to have someone rub some salt on me, for me to take my own shower to wash it off, then coat me in goo. And when I heard the telltale ""beepbeepBEEP"" of a Clarisonic face cleaner, I was like, ""Seriously? I'm paying you to clean my face with the same exact gizmo I have sitting on my bathroom counter at home?!?""

The buffet is AMAZING. Just typing that made me drool. I ate my weight in sushi. Which in no way stopped me from also eating lamb, sea bass, goat cheese, mousse, key lime tarts, peach sorbet...

Cirque's O show. Come ON! It's stupendous. Sit a ways back from the stage, though, and you get to actually see more (like the underwater action). You can't swing a dead contortionist without hitting a Cirque show in Vegas, but THIS is the one to see.

My most recent trip here was to go see Ciruq Du Soleil O but unfortunately the tickets were too expensive and I had waited too long to get them. I had seen the offers online but even then the tickets were expensive. I will have to get them way early in advance for my next trip.

Aside from the shows this casino is fairly nice. I think the have the second most shops behind Caesar's Palace. There are multiple levels for shopping which is nice but it is easy to get lost if you don't know where you are going. Trust me, you can see the look of confusion in the eyes of people as they walk from level to level.

The gambling is fun here. There is a big sports betting area that is wide and spread out at one corner of the casino and then there are several machines to play throughout. One of the things that I noticed early on with the table games is that the buy ins are a bit higher here than at some of the other casinos on the strip. 

Lastly, the restaurants are really GOOD. GOOD like celebrity chef status cooking your food good. And the pool area is FANTASTIC. The pool is AWESOME and was packed when I went over to check it out. Be advised that you need your key card to gain access to the lower pool area.

It's one of the nicest hotel's in the whole world. How many places can say that? It has more quality diverse dining than anywhere else in Las Vegas. Nothing about the Bellagio is overlooked in your stay, the room service is to die for. I'm so addicted to the Bellagio waffle and freshly squeezed orange juice. If you wanna go out to eat you have Fix, Yellowtail, Noodles, Sensi, Prime, Micheal Mina, and so much more.

I could spend days outside in the pool, it feels like you are in a castle. 
Yummy strawberry mojitos. Warm towels and Evian spritzers. I feel so much relaxation there, almost a sleep like coma. Definitely good for my tan.

Shopping, shit. If I won the lottery I will move into the Bellagio faster than you can say 'congratulations.' There's a lifetime of shopping, Chanel, Gucci, YSL, and so much more! 

The rooms here are off the chain. Amazing views in the executive suite, the spa tower is large and luxurious. Everything inch of this place is grand, fabulous, all around Italian Palace that still feels like home. 

Watch an unreal show like""O"". If you decide you wanna get a nightcap, go to the Carmel lounge drink some whiskey or aged tequila.  Get even crazier at The Bank nightclub!

It's a nice, upscale hotel perfectly situation on the Strip. It's extremely close to the Cosmopolitan and Aria, which means you're a very short walk from even more dinning options.

The hotel is clean and the service is excellent. The casino smells less smokey and is less seedy than many hotels in town. There are a lot of restaurants to choose from and a number of high-end, luxury boutiques. I did not have time to go to the spa but I liked the fact they offered a day pass at an affordable price.

The Fountains of Bellagio are a ""must see""  as the water is choreographed to move to a concert of opera, classical, Broadway and pop tunes. It may sound a little cheesy, but it's definitely worth checking out either from outside (facing the hotel), from the hotel terrace or from the window at one of the restaurants.

Given it's Las Vegas and a luxury hotel, the prices are not cheap. You'll be hard pressed to find a glass of wine under $15 or a coffee under $5.

The rooms are comfortable and offer black-out curtains, a bathroom with both a shower and large tub and flat screen TV. My only complaints are the pillows all were lumpy as if they were stuffed with cotton balls, and I could hear the guests talking in the next room and doors closing, but that's pretty standard for most hotels in Las Vegas.

I am a frequent Las Vegas visitor, I have stayed at just about every major hotel\/casino on the strip.

First off it is a perfect location located smack dab in the center of the strip and all the action. The lobby is beautiful, the entire resort is beautiful and clean. All that being said I still have a hard time giving this place more than 3 stars based on my own personal preferences and experiences. Check in lines were a joke, I waited over 35 minutes in line to check in and then waited another 30 minutes for my bags from the bell desk once I got to my room. I requested and paid extra for a room with a fountain view, about $30 a night extra. When I got to my room all I really had was a view to their parking deck and a corner of the fountain pond, what a joke. When I called down to the front dest to ask about a different room they could not accomodate me.  As beautiful as this place is it feels a little stuffy to me, I like a more upbeat vibe in a casino.  IMO opinion this place is more suited for an older crowd, I think my parents would absolutely love this place, I prefer the Cosmo next door and that's why when business ended I grabbed my bags and checked in next door to the Cosmoplitan for the weekend.

I did extensive research before our trip... Being from California I always used to drive to Vegas for the weekend but usually stayed at Circus Circus( a cheap yet comfortable place) This time I decided to  splurge and we booked the Penthouse Suite. It was wonderful! We arrived after a long (delayed) flight. Check in went very smoothly... I do wish that we had booked a fountain \/Strip view though. I wrongly assumed that all of the Penthouse suites offered them. That being said, the view of the mountains was very nice as well. Next time! The room was amazing... huge, with his\/her bathrooms, great raised bed... basically everything you can think of. Considering the size of the hotel I was expecting service to be slow and impersonal. Just the opposite actually... we were always greeted with a smile, ""no problem"" to our requests, quick room service( hour) and personable staff.

We ate room service three times... dinner on first evening(bad jet lag!), and breakfast on the last day. Quick, efficient and reasonably priced. 

Yes... the lobby\/restaurants\/bars\/casinos are filled with tourists from other hotels and well as the Bellagio. And what do you expect? It's Vegas! All of the hotels are like that... we visited other hotels as well during our stay. One shouldn't miss having a drink at the Fontana Bar to watch\/listen to the fountains. Then we hit the Blackjack tables.

We tried the breakfast buff on the second day. We had received ""line passes"" but when we arrived there was no line and wondered to ourselves why one would need these passes. We found out when we left breakfast and saw that a huge line had built up! The breakfast was astounding... great selection of choices. I ate so much that I was still not hungry at lunch time.

They do nickle-and-dime you..., . However, we had no troubles with our mini-bar. I have stayed in hotels with overly sensitive mini-bars and experienced problems. At the Bellagio we used the mini-bar a few times... and wrote down exactly what we took. During the check out, only the items we took were on the bill.

Walks within the hotel (point A to point B) were long... you almost always had to walk through the casino (of course). But that just gave you a chance to people-watch in my opinion. The corridors looked long, but we lucked out: our room was just a few feet  or so from the elevators. 

Tao was ok... great service, but the food was only so-so. I wish we had stayed at one of Bellagio's restaurants. But we wanted to see as much of Vegas as possible during our short stay. Next time...

Key issues:
- We had a Fountain View room and the windows were not cleaned on the outside - so when you went to enjoy the view that cost an extra $80 per night, you instead got a view of a bunch of dirty spots from a window that hadn't been cleaned in months. As such, it was impossible to get photos of the view from our room because the camera picks up on the crud on the window.
- They don't comp your drinks when you are playing video poker at the bar - Excalibur does, without question. The bartender did not communicate this policy to me before asking what I wanted to drink, so fine, I guess I'll pay for it - but a Maker's Mark was $18! Are you joking? It's a shot that cost you $0.50 to pour. In San Francisco, one of the most expensive markets in the US, this drink costs $12. When I complained to management about this, they very reluctantly issued the refund as if losing hundreds to them in gambling wasn't enough to pay for their liquor cabinet.
- Our check-in agent, Lexi, was rather rude and condescending and sounded like she hated her job or at minimum, hated us - and this was before we realized Bellagio was a huge waste of money, so we were actually quite pleasant at check-in.
- It was impossible to get in touch with my host after the initial reservation booking. I tried three times and each time he was either out of office or on the other line, and when I left a message for him, he would never return my call.
- @Bellagio never responds on Twitter, and neither does the Twitter handle for MGM Resorts International, so they have very bad customer relationship management.

Worse yet, the responses from Guest Relations to other people here with complaints contain very empty promises to fix things (yeah, right) and only expects you to come back and try again (Edit: See?). I won't be back again, and I think I'll take some matters up with my credit card company unless Bellagio wants to grant a credit back themselves for a lousy room and lousy service.

Despite having a confirmed reservation for a room with 2 queen beds, the Bellagio did not provide me with a room with 2 queen beds as promised and instead informed me upon check in that only rooms with a single bed were available. Despite leaving a confirmed deposit, the hotel gave my room away to another guest!

In addition to failing to provide me the room with 2 queen beds I left the deposit for, the hotel promised to provide was acceptance of an electric wheelchair rental prior to me checking in and delivering that wheelchair to my hotel room. This is an important promise of the hotel, as the wheelchair is essential for mobility and to accommodate a disability. The hotel promised that it would accept the delivery of the wheelchair before I checked in, and then have the wheelchair delivered to my room and waiting for me and available for use upon check-in. Despite the hotel receiving delivery of the wheelchair prior to my arrival, the hotel refused to provide the wheelchair to me when I checked in, and did not provide the wheelchair to me until the next morning. This is because the hotel gave to another guest the room that was reserved for me (where the wheelchair was supposed to be waiting), and then the hotel staff informed me that the hotel transferred the wheelchair to a locked storage room, and that nobody at the hotel would have the key until the next morning.  Which means that when a wheelchair was needed the first night, we would have to call security and request they would temporarily loan me a manual wheelchair on an emergency basis -- and have a watchful security guard escort my group the entire time the wheelchair was being used to make sure we didn't go off property with it and so that it was returned to the hotel.  It was such a humiliating, unconscionable, and demeaning way to treat a handicapped customer.  

Shortly after check in, I spoke to a supervisor at the hotel and was informed they would move me to a room with 2 queen beds the next day. But the hotel subsequently refused to honor this because the hotel gave away to other guests my promised room type A SECOND TIME. It is inexcusable and unconscionable a hotel the quality of Bellagio would refuse to honor a confirmed confirmation, give away a guest's room not just once but twice--and then also deny a guest access to their electric wheelchair necessary for accommodating a disability.",0,0,0

The front desk was very helpful at check in. I booked a package that had early check in if available so they called to get me a room that was ready for us before the normal check in time. We ate at Cafe Bellagio for a late lunch\/early dinner and it was really good. I had the burger and it was good. My dad had the turkey burger and like it. We went back for breakfast. We check out the pool area briefly at it was very nice. We sat up on a patio overlooking the pool having a drink. It was a great spot to relax in. This was one of the best stays I've ever had at a hotel anywhere not just Las Vegas. However I was not happy when I went to my room a half hour before my late check out to take care of some work that popped up and saw housekeeping in my room. She looked shocked that I was there and seemed to have no idea I was going to be there. The room was a wreck. The bed was pulled apart and she didn't believe me that I was supposed to be there. She had no idea what to say when I told her to open the closet and see that my bags were still there so I had to go back in. One only nice thing about this bad experience was that she asked to to put my key in the lock to see that it was my room and I could be there at 3:30. I always like that when they ask you to use your key to help keep you're belongings safe. Although it worked the first time she made me do three times before she let me get my stuff. I had told the front desk I would be using the late check out when I checked in the day before and verified it on my way to breakfast this morning. Still it didn't get to housekeeping. I also told her when she asked if we wanted service when she saw us in the hall in our way to breakfast. I wasn't super surprised that she went in but the state of my room was a shocker. I read online that a bunch of people who booked the same packed as me had housekeeping go in but promptly leave when they realized they were using the late check out. I'm not aware of anyone having their room torn apart while it was still theirs. I don't know but I suspect that she figured with a half hour left before I was supposed to check out I wasn't coming back and wanted to get my room cleaned so she could leave. What a way to sour an otherwise perfect stay. I'll be back and give the Bellagio another try but I hope I don't have the same issue because then I won't be back. Its not worth the hassle and frustration.,0,0,0

Our hotel, Aria, offered a shuttle service that ran to the Bellagio which was nice because it was a quicker and easier way to get more towards the middle of the Strip. We had looked at staying at the Bellagio and if we return I would definitely consider booking a room here. The casino has an old Italian style with lots of similar art and design. 

Overall, the hotel seemed to be a little more on the upscale side than some of the other casinos I visited. Everything seemed extra clean and the staff were very friendly. 

The Bellagio also offers a free attraction out front in the form of the Fountain Show. Every fifteen minutes or so the show starts in the giant lake and lasts for the duration of a song. The fountains and lights are all synchronized to the music and makes for an entertaining show. It is really surprising to see how high some of those fountains can shoot. This is definitely a must see attraction!",5,0,3

The quality of the gaming area and restaurants remains the same, although I was disappointed during my last trip where the single large baccarat table in the general baccarat area was either closed or failed to get a game of more than one person going.

Finally, with a more particular gripe, I don't like the fact that they discourage people from cashing out their baccarat chips at the regular casino cage.

I've always had it pegged in my mind as one of those ""pillars of the Strip"" or however you want to phrase that, but I really felt like these guys were resting on their laurels. I toyed with 2 stars, but ultimately decided 2 would be a little harsh.

Pros: I was able to check-in pretty early when I arrived....like noon....and my room was clean and ready to go - bonus! Always nice not having to wait. I also got a room in the Spa Tower which was pretty nice as I guess they had been recently renovated? Spacious room + comfy bed + roomy bathroom = happy me.

Cons: no coffee pots in the rooms. I know that everywhere in Vegas is just trying to get you to ""spend spend spend,"" but seriously - no coffee pots?! Am I expected to go wait in a long line downstairs for coffee at 6:00 am? That sounds like a terrible way to start the morning. I also can't stand how crowded the Bellagio gets, but I don't see how that's really their fault. People really start crowding into the place around noon-ish, and it only gets more congested as the day goes on.

On account of the crowds, I'd probably choose to stay elsewhere on the Strip if it were up to me.",2,1,2

First off, hubby and I had high expectations of Bellagio.  Five star, fountain hype, and overall presentation would have expected that.  When we travel, we do travel very well, and Bellagio has fallen short on a few areas.
We reserved a Deluxe Fountain View room.  I love the fountains.  On an earlier trip, watching the fountains was a highlight, and I was looking forward to a good book, curling up while hubby was at a convention, and gazing away from my comfy perch at leisure.  Well, deluxe fountain view rooms start at floor 9, and we got put on floor 9.  That means my view is over the roof of the lobby and accompanying spires, and yes, I can see it - but disappointing.  There is a premiere fountain view, but I didn't think I had to upgrade to the very most expensive room.  I was wrong.  It's just frustrating to think we were the next to the highest price room there is, and then getting on the elevators for the lowest floors there are every time depressed me a bit (28 floors I think, divided into 4 elevator lobbies).  And they don't do the fountains during the day, and I didn't realize that part, either. Enough of that.
Dining options were fine, enjoyed breakfast in the Cafe and had a good panini at a little cafe near the pool.  The pools are nice, but hitting them just after 10 am on a Tuesday morning there were no chaises with umbrellas or shade available.  I went to the farthest pool a(there are like 5 pools) and was perfect for about an hour until the sun shifted.  Lots of options, but 4,000 rooms = a lot of sunbathers so be warned.
Casino is huge, but we're not gamblers.  To me it is a hassle to have to walk a million miles from the parking garage or breakfast to guest rooms elevators thru the maze of casino - but I know they are all that way.
Check in was fairly easy for us, but the concierge has had what I consider too long of a line the whole time we've been here (3 days as of now).  We had ordered O tickets and the box office line was 30 minutes for pick up, again disappointing.
The room is a good size, but not plush.  The linens are not really up to par for our expectations.  Bed is the same, OK, but not really 5 star.  Shower is generous size, but water pressure and temp was only OK.  Tub is neither oversize nor jet in my book.
Housekeeping has been fair, day 2 our room did not get vacuumed so we returned to pretzel crumbs.  I did not use the tub, but saw evidence of hair in the drain that they missed.
And night 1 and 2 there was no chocolate left on pillows, but night 3 housekeeping came knocking around 5:30 rather insistently and handed me chocolates in person, then a few minutes later a second housekeeping came barging in obviously unaware we were here.  Odd, on many levels.
It'll prob be here 10 years before we return to Vegas, and when that happens I'll do my homework on hotels and not pick one because of a favorite memory of fountains.",1,1,1

We live in Dallas and frequently go up to Choctaw or Windstar. Both have their pros and cons- but we thought the Bellagio might be a bit more special. The double queen is mediocre, if you even lift a snack off the tray to look, you're billed. The bathroom has mildew and mold in the shower, peeling wallpaper and the cheapest toilet paper any hotel could buy. This is the Bellagio right, not Best Western?

The toothpaste we brought with us was dried up, so I  called down to the concierge to ask if they might bring us some toothpaste. Bear in mind, for us and the staff that work here, the hotel is huge. Usually you might trot down to pick it up, but as it's the 'Bellagio' we figured customer service would be great. NO.  The concierge actually seemed incredulous that I would ask. He asked me if I wanted 'delivery'??? I know it's a long way, that's why the onus is on them to provide customer service- Am I mistaken? Does EVERYTHING here have a price? 

The rooms have no amenities other than what you would get in any hotel room, BUT there is no space for anything in the fridge, there is no coffee maker, there's an iron, hairdryer and an ice bucket. Woo hoo. So, can't brew a cup in the morning, have to order it in, minimal bath products, didn't expect to have to beg for anything here. But as the concierge put it so nicely, we COULD pay to have anything 'delivered'. 

Maybe they don't have to work that hard to keep customers coming, personally these are just a few small things that mean I don't consider this hotel any better than a Best Western.

Not a fan of the resort fee concept. When your coloring is something like Conan O'Brian's, one resents paying for a pool. I did manage a visit or two, but the rest of my time left no room for using the pool, and it was cold, so it was a waste of money.

It was something pretty amazing and daunting to see at the same time... people putting together this massive\/expensive project.

Since then I had always wanted to stay and be an alum of the Bellagio experience. This was the first time I was able to do so and it was all thanks to Travelocity which put my 3 night trip for 2 people, round trip tickets and 2 shows at just over $1000. Of course this meant that I was put in their least expensive rooms.

When you walk it, you can feel the luxury, the grandiosity of it all. Truly spectacular and everything in the lobby is what you would expect of the hotel. However once you get into the rooms it's something of a different story.

There is nothing inherently wrong exactly, but we had 2 rooms. The first room had bad air conditioning. When you come in from a day of walking up and down the strip you really want to relax in a room that is nice and cool. They then moved us quickly to a different room to accommodate us which I thought was very professional of them.

The next room had a good air conditioning, but the lamp in the bathroom had a busted bulb. During the afternoon, their concierge is often quite busy to the point that you're on hold for 5-10 minutes. But once you're on the phone with them they are polite, nice and never seen irritated or annoyed. 

Without the problems we encountered, I would say that the rooms are what you would expect from a hotel like this... that would put the number of stars at 3. Nothing mind blowing or awe-inspiring, but not necessarily anything negative (even though I was a little peeved about the little things wrong with our room).

They do have room service and claim to ""fulfill your every need"". Apparently if you are craving some type of food, they would find it for you if they don't already offer it. However, I'm sure you'll be paying a pretty penny!

Communication between housekeeping and front desk is definitely having some issue. Otherwise there wouldn't be an issue of checking into a non-smoking room smell like ash, or keep asking guests to leave like we are being kicked out.

The nicer restaurants were pretty good, while the others were pretty average.

We reserved a fountain view room, but the room they placed us in actually had a charming (not) view of the parking garage, with a teeny tiny view of the fountains out of the very left of our window. Come on. If you didn't have a fountain view room available that's fine, but at least let us know. We paid extra for absolutely nothing. We called down to the front desk and they were very unapologetic and unhelpful. I expected much better customer service. Besides that, the room itself was very disappointing. It is expensive to stay here, and I would have expected a really wonderful room, but no.

There was this really creepy dude checking us in. He hardly spoke and what he said was odd and cryptic. We both felt rather sketched out by the experience. We got a corner suite. The hotel is pretty nice. Lots of marble. The room itself felt dated. The lighting wasn't organized very well. You had to run all over the room to turn off lights. The shade near the tub wouldn't go down when you pressed the button. You just had to wait until it was ready to go down. The sofa was stained in places. Our bed had deep indentations because the mattress was clearly OLD. The service was subpar at best. I arranged to have flowers delivered to our room while we were out during the day. They dropped the ball. I had to call down to the bell stand to get them and was admonished because apparently, I did something wrong. I ordered the flowers through the concierge, they set the expectations and I followed their directions. I'm not sure what else I should have had to do. When I called the concierge I asked if there were any romantic things to do, just hoping for suggestions. She sounded like I had asked her to save my relationship or something. It was odd. I felt like the question was out of place. What else are they there for? We mostly ate out at other restaurants during our trip but one night we decided to keep it simple and try the buffet. HUGE MISTAKE. It was simply horrible. The food tasted old and what was fresh, was not good. The place smelled and the staff was embarrassingly disorganized. We played $40 each to eat and barely ate a plate of food it was so bad. I wouldn't stay here again. The service didn't meet my expectations for the price we paid for the room. Based on the reputation of the place we were horribly disappointed. I would have given it one star but we had a really nice bellman on our way out and one night this really cool and sweet person helped us print our O tickets.",1,0,0

Two things to love here:
- Water fountain show (which can be seen outside of the strip)
- Garden of flowers 

What I love about Bellagio is their garden - how they change the atmosphere every season. And every time a different décor. I love the use of the flowers and pieces. Everything is so colorful and this is what brings in the tourists and crowds. 

I don't blame them! I am forever a fan!

This is the best casino floor in Vegas: fantastic people watching, lively Vegas vibe, big gaming action, and the home of poker outside of LA. In the fountains, they have the best (free) attraction in town.

Bellagio is a great casino resort, from A-Z. The newly remodeled rooms are a big improvement & the amenities are all you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Steve Wynn built the Bellagio & his legacy definitely remains. But he's been gone for a few years & nowadays the Wynn\/Encore property trumps all.",0,0,0

We eventually starting taking the ones we found with us from game to game. At one point, I asked someone who worked there what was up. Where were all the ashtrays! So, if you want to gamble at Bellagio, take your own ashtray, or do what we eventually did, which was just ash on the ground, which made it VERY dirty. Not sure if that's the intent of Bellagio, to hide all the ashtrays so that customers just ash all over the place? I dont feel guilty about doing that, and leaving the butts at the machines.

I stayed here the third weekend of August with three of my best friends for a send off before one of my buddies from college headed off for the Navy.  Although I've stayed all along the Vegas strips on my frequent trips, I stayed at the Bellagio the very first time in March of 2012, and based on my first experience, there was no way I was going to pick another hotel to stay in August.

The service was second to none--valet service, bell desk was phenomenal.  Check-in was fast, despite the lobby being slightly crowded. I had originally booked the basic room, though the resort was busy, and the check in rep was able to give me an upgraded room, overlooking the gorgeous pool.  

The room was again, in excellent shape.  Big rooms, clean, and somewhat close to the elevators (my preference).  

Service is all about the Bellagio.  My friends and I were ridiculously drunk, and yet, they met our expectations when it came to room service.  No mistakes, like I've had gone thru with some of the other hotels.  

Let me also point out--so my friends and I were getting really drunk before we had plans for the night, and so after taking like 5 shots or so of Gentleman's Jack, we were slightly late in getting to dinner at Paris--Mon Ami Gabi.  The concierge called the restaurant immediately, and didn't have to worry about being late.  Honestly, it's the little things, esp with service, that makes a big difference when staying in a 5-star hotel, like the Bellagio. 

Their casino floor is pretty nice--classy Vegas looks all around, and the staff on the gaming floor is once again, amazing!   Prompt service--had won a small jackpot, but really didn't have to wait too long for them to bring the forms out to me.

The pool is to die for!  Well, to me, it's pretty nice--three or four different pools, quick service once again, and oh yeah, did I mention, cute girls too! hah  Although it was slightly crowded, didn't have any trouble finding chairs--plenty of space.

Whenever I return to Vegas, Bellagio will be the hotel I'll be staying at.  Although I am interested in staying at other resorts, such as the Cosmopolitan, Wynn, or Palazzo, I am forever grateful for the effort and high-quality service that the staff provides me.  Again, it's a big A+ in my book!",1,0,0

We booked this hotel because of a deal they had to get a discount on Ka. Overall, the bellagio is a nice hotel but not quite worthy of its reputation. It's age is beginning to show and there are simply superior alternatives for ""5 star"" vegas luxury. 

Do not stay on the top floor of the hotel (26th in the spa tower)! There was a fairly loud and annoying buzzing sound not just in the room but the entire hallway. I'm not exactly sure what it was, maybe the central heating system? At any rate, I went to switch to a room in a lower floor (16th) and it was much quieter there. The first really cool thing I discovered was the power curtains. They have controls for them built into the walls at 3 different spots in the room. Now I realize this is probably nothing special to many people but it's the first time I've ever been in a room with this feature. The view was nice also. In the morning we could see the mountains in the distance and at night the strip lights up. One nearly inexcusable fault is that the standard rooms still aren't equipped with flat screen tv's! I was impressed with the availability of chinese channels. That made my parents happy. The furniture was a mixed bag. The chair's were very soft and comfortable but the drawers and tables looked kind of old and don't stand out from those in any other hotel. The bed was nice and firm, but the blankets were a bit too heavy and the pillows too soft. The closet was small but it had its own light. The safe was too small because it is taller than it is deep, so we couldn't even fit a netbook in unless we propped it up vertically. I really liked the bathrooms. It was a double sink with a separate tub and shower. The shower had a place to sit and the tub was large enough to fit my whole body. The makeup mirror was small but had its own light and was double sided, one side was a normal mirror and the other side was a magnifier. My only minor complaint was a little bit of cracking and peeling in the corners, but it's not something I would have noticed if my mom hadn't pointed it out. Check in and check out was a simple and painless affair. We checked in around 6pm and there were plenty of lines so we didn't wait that long. Check out can be done from the tv, very neat.

I didn't actually go swimming since it's december, but I did walk around the pool area and it's fairly nice. The scenery is pleasant and they have i believe 5 pools although only 1 or 2 were open due to it being winter season. There were plenty of seats and since the bellagio is a more expensive hotel I would assume the pool won't be too crowded even during the summer. Be sure to bring an extra towel to cover the chairs though because they were surprisingly dirty. The only other downside is that even there main pool isn't particularly large so tough luck for those who like to race and swim laps. 

I won't spend too much time on the rest of the hotel since it's available to non-guests. The conservatory is perhaps the best thing about the hotel, it's beautiful, a perfect picture spot and best of all, free. Be sure to go early like I did, though because it gets insanely crowded. The casino is decent, although of course the table limits don't exactly cater to poor college students. I did find one $5 blackjack table at around 5 am though. When it's busy the $10 tables are usually filled up so most people will have to play at $15 and up. Took a peek in the high roller section and lol'd at $500 slot machines. Amazing that there are people who can afford to blow more money every 5 seconds with the push of a button than some people make in a week. The atmosphere in the casino is alright, not too crowded but not too empty, and the clientele is older than average. In any other city, I'd be very impressed with the shops at bellagio, but this is vegas and it's pretty ordinary when you consider all the other great places to shop on the strip. I didn't try any of the restaurants or spa since that stuff is ridiculously expensive.

The quality of the staff was a mixed bag, but mostly positive. The majority of the clerks, dealers, security, and housekeeping were friendly and attentive as expected from a hotel like the bellagio. Unfortunately there were a few real sourpusses who were rather curt and seemingly annoyed with their jobs.

All things considered, the Bellagio is a good to very good hotel, but definitely not great. I probably won't be staying here again since there are just so many great options in the vegas strip.",1,0,1

As a MLife platinum card person, I was in the guest line which was very short.  The lady behind the counter was super sweet and professional.  She asked the reason for our visit and I told her it was for our anniversary.  She quickly called someone and got us an offer for a Suite.  We agreed to the low increase and took the upgraded room.  

Our room was clean and well decorated.   Felt like home because one of my living rooms has the same color scheme and coffee table.  

The shower was a steam shower as well which was fantastic!  The jacoozi tub was incredible!  They had little packages of Epsom salt, loofah and bath gel.  The comfy robes that I love were in the closet.  It was like being at home with my comfortable things around me.  

As far as the hotel, it was cleaner!  That really worked on the ornaments\/decor and brought back the shine luster of the glass.  The staff were all super friendly and helpful throughout the resort.

Room service at Bellagio is on my top 5 in Vegas list.  It's always delicious, quick and easy.   There are great options to pick from.  Over the years, we've had everything on the menu and were never disappointed.

As far as restaurants, they are all amazing!  I'll writee separate reviews for those.

I think they have such a huge reputation that I was expecting there to be unicorns and red carpets and free personal assistants. 

The check-in was easy enough, and the flowers and decorations were really very nice. They also have the casino machines turned down, so there was no loud ""ding ding ding""...I guess this is a positive, but that sound is just synonymous with Vegas so we didn't get that adrenalin rush. 

We got a complimentary upgrade (MLife) to a lake view room, which was a lot of fun to watch the fountains and listen to the choreographed music that played through the TV. 

But speaking of TVs...seriously it was an old tube! And small at that! I agree with other posters that this is just weird. The room was pretty standard, nothing too special. The turn-down service was nice, though, and the shower and tub were very spacious. 

If you go, request a room near the elevator or you will be walking for miles. The other nice thing is the tram that takes you to the Aria\/City Center....still, though, this hotel is so spread out, you will be walking a ton no matter what.

The fountain show is amazing. Totally worth a stop by here. My brother and I stopped by one night, and then we stopped again with my mother a couple days later. We all loved the fountain show, with the lights and the music to go with it. 

The casino is quite large. I think we lost my mother once or twice inside while we were there. We managed to find her without much problem. But it was definitely easy to get lost inside.

Upon check-in I was less than impressed. We arrived prior to 3 which is actual check-in time. They informed me that I'd need to come back or call around 3 to see if they were ready for us yet. I found that to be irritating, especially when the Wynn called us when our room was ready on our previous trip. However, I obliged.
When we finally got into our room, it was very basic. 2 queen beds, TV, the usual. Our 'mountain view' as they informed us was really just the view of the freeway.
The pools were very nice. We decided to splurge one day and pay for the cypress VIP pool. This was a nice option with no kids. The fee was $150 & that literally bought you a comfortable chair. Needless to say, we won't be doing that again! 
Also be on the watch for their $20\/day resort fee. They don't totally disclose it to you. 
The stay was comfortable. I was expecting to be blown away, but wasn't at all. The location of the bellagio makes the rating 3 stars vs 2. We will not be returning to the bellagio! We'll stick to the Harrah's hotels!",4,0,1

The downstairs public areas are 4 to 5-star, whereas the rooms and everything else were more befitting of a 3.5-star hotel.  Our stay was comfortable, but we weren't as wowed by it as we were by other hotels. The man who checked us in was somewhat dismissive.  However, the man who checked us out was fantastic.  The hotel was beautiful, but the room was a little disappointing.  It can be a crapshoot here.

Pros:
-beautiful downstairs: front desk, garden exhibit, shops
-huge gym with tons of equipment
-relaxing pools
-Bellagio Fountains
-moving sidewalk and escalator takes you directly from the street to the hotel entrance
-old-school feel
-central location

Cons:
-small casino (I struck out, but others in my group were hitting it big)
-standard hotel rooms are small
-not enough plug outlets
-toiletries: shampoo & conditioner were poor quality
-no coffee maker, no laundry bags
-boring place to be, especially compared to other hotels' multiple attractions

I recommend staying at other hotels.  This one was nice and comfortable on its own, but so-so and boring compared to other properties we stayed at, like Mandalay Bay.  Besides, the main draw is the Bellagio Fountains, which you can view just by walking by.",6,0,0

Everything was perfect from the white glove door to door service of the bellhops to the overly accommodating concierges, to the finely appointed suite....my God, the shower! Typically I judge a hotel room by the comfort level of the bed and the type of sleep I get, but in this hotel I was just enamored by the bathrooms. My posse and I stayed in a standard suite, nothing fancy, but if this is what not-fancy looks like then I'm sold. We had a great deal through vegas.com for my 25th birthday and figured ""go big or go home"". Sure it's pricier than other hotels on the strip, but indulge, I beg you. For special occasions, or those with expendable income, do yourself the favor and splurge on a cabana rental and see ""O"". The tickets may be more expensive than any other Cirque show, but you will never be able to see it anywhere else and come on, you don't even have to leave the compound.

 If you're looking for free stuff to do after blowing all of your money at the $50 buy-in tables, look no further than this hotel for it's beautiful Chihuly glass both on it's signature ceiling and located throughout the casino floor, the fountain show out front that will leave you feeling like you're on the set of Oceans 11, or the beautiful indoor conservatory and botanical gardens.

After that, we went and hung out at the blackjack table. Must have spent a good hour or two there just hanging out and betting low. You know, sometimes it isn't about winning. We had a really good dealer. She was really charismatic and had some sort of accent I couldn't place. The wife and I would switch out so we weren't hogging two seats.

When I was younger, I've envisioned staying at one of these hotels to be like a vintage palace but only to find that wasn't the case.

The rooms were just okay and it was just a standard room.  Really, I was holding my breath before opening the doors thinking yes! a high ballers dream stay! when we opened the doors and turn the lights on then I thought hmmm...similar room like TI's but just slightly above average from that.

We had the fountain view room which was cool, you get a good clear view of the fountain along with the music playing when you have it at a certain channel though your TV. The bed comfort level was okay, spacious bath with tub, decent closet space and of course a flat screen tv.

The biggest cons that bothered us was the room temperature! We set the room control temperature at the lowest setting but we ended up with a not so good night sleep man, we had a warm night! I had to do away those comforters.

The casino level is in decent size, the club atmosphere that friday night was bumping with hoochie mamas waiting to get in The Bank (Club). Next morning only to find no more hoochie mamas but many golfer types and football fanatics during that Super Bowl weekend who were looking to eat or gamble.

Maybe I'm just spoiled from staying at many different hotels, hip, vintage,boutiques, motels you name it, but to pay for a high rate here for me, nah! I'm just glad we stayed here it did satisfied my curiosity and there goes one for my list of collection hotel stays in the Vegas Strip.",2,2,1

PROS: 

1.)The overall condition of the facilities is very good. Clean, but kind of dated

2.)The casino was great. Huge, with great selection of games, with the dealers having a great personality.

3.)Unlike some other previous reviews, I thought the check-in process was very easy and they took care of our requests rather painlessly. 

4.)The housekeeping was decent, but came at odd times. If you need anything extra, though, it almost seems like they're taking inventory. Kind of strange.

5.)And overall, the hospitality of the HOTEL service staff was EXCELLENT. (Everyone saying hello, Food service, different story)

6.)The pool has a fantastic ambiance, but nowhere near the size, or quality of Caesars.

7.)And of course, the fountains!!


CONS: 

1.)Given the reputation and what the hotel is trying to market themselves as, the ""elegance"" of the rooms were disappointing and very plain comparable to others. (I recommend Caesar's, Palazzo, or even Aria, if looking for bigger, better or comfier rooms)

2.)The choice of foods were so-so if not spending $100+ per person. The buffet was less than stellar (food=bland, selection=no bueno) as compared to the Wynn and Caesars. The fine dining restaurants are excellent, the rest? Not so much, very, very, very plain, and overpriced. 

3.)The Bellagio Cafe put us (girlfriend and I) on a 30 MINUTE WAIT late night, with about 6 tables in the restaurant (about 5% full restaurant), and sat a party of 7 before us, who arrived 15 minutes AFTER we did. To the point where the party apologized to us, and the couple in front of us, who was there 10 minutes before us, as we watched them get sat.

4.)Wi-Fi is the horrible (included in Resort Fee). No matter where on the resort you are.

5.)There never seems to be enough taxis at this hotel. The line is relatively short, but you will wait, because taxis seem to not like the Bellagio. Unless ""O"" is showing.

Overall, not a bad resort to go to, but for the Guest base that they are looking for, there are so many better options such as Caesars, Wynn\/Encore, or even Venetian\/Palazzo. If you are going to Vegas to strictly look at the fountains and no other reason to leave the resort, then stay here. But I guess Bellagio has seemed to rest on its laurels and chosen to not make significant improvements to try to keep up with the likes of Cosmopolitan, Aria, Caesars (classic, yet updated luxury), or Wynn\/Encore, which are a much better ""bang for your buck"" luxury resorts with so many higher quality amenities.",0,0,0

And I got to stay in a gorgeous 1-bedroom suite on the top floor! The suite comes with a free line pass which allows you to cut in line at the Bellagio Buffet and Café Bellagio restaurants at any point during your stay. I love the Bellagio Buffet, since it's a pretty good value for the quality. Just remember to charge everything to your room so you can get Hyatt\/MLife points for it. :)

Speaking of points, be sure to have your Hyatt number AND your MLife numbers ready at check-in, so you can earn points on both loyalty programs. Who doesn't love double-dipping!

The suite was awesome. Our suite had a gorgeous living room with lovely furniture and a half bathroom, which I presume would be for visiting guests. The desk is also out in the living room.

The bedroom has a nice comfy bed and 2 full bathrooms. One bathroom seems to be for the woman (hairspray, etc included) and has a jet whirlpool tub, while the other bathroom seems to be more for men (has shaving gel and a razor) and has a standing shower with a built-in wet or dry sauna!!!! I cannot tell you how much my husband and I loved having our own bathrooms. The ""woman's"" bathroom is also significantly larger than the ""man's"" bathroom. :D

Both bathrooms also have built in mirror TVs. Meaning, the TV is part of the mirror, and when the TV is turned off, it becomes a mirror. So cool. Because of this, the suite actually has 4 TVs (one in each bathroom, one in the bedroom, and one in the living room).

I have stayed at other MGM properties and this one was next on my list. Our stay was great until the morning of checkout. I stayed at the Bellagio with my mother and my baby daughter and we had a pretty long night. I was under the impression (based on my hotel booking info) that check-out was 11am and we had time to sleep in a little before hitting the road. At 9:16am there was a knock at the door. It took a second to recognize what was happening and get out of the bed. Then a second knock and someone (from housekeeping) was opening our room door. Luckily the bolt lock was used, otherwise she would have walked right in. The unfortunate part is the knock and the subsequent attempt to enter the room woke up my mother and my baby who were both extremely tired. When I poked my head out the woman was speed walking down the hallway and did not offer an apology. If it is hotel policy to check guests' rooms prior to check-out, I get it...it is just bad policy. The reason for the score is not because of the entry into our room, but for what happened when I called Guest Services to understand why this happened. When I called, the young lady did not identify herself nor did she say ""Guest Services,"" so I had to ask if I called the right department. I began speaking and she was very short with me, and was not treating me very courteously ( I did not expect that from the staff at Bellagio). I then told her that since she was being so short with me that I would like to speak with a manger and before I could finish my sentence she placed me on hold. At that point, one of the managers Chris came on the line. I explained what happened and his response was, ""Well I don't know what their process down in housekeeping is, I'd have to call and check."" No apology, or empathy. Then when I mentioned that the young lady who answered the phone initially was very curt and did not speak to me in a professional manner, he said, ""Well there are six girls up here, I don't know which one you spoke to."" So I kindly informed him that I would be writing a review and sending my feedback to corporate. It wasn't until that point that he offered an apology.

I don't know if I agree with people who say this ""isnt a real 5-star hotel"" -- it's at least 4.5*'s in my book, and Im very particular about hotels.  The most important thing for me is the decor of the room -- most hotel rooms just have dark, dingy decor -- especially after staying at NYNY, MGM grand and Planet Hollywood, I know this for a fact.  That or the rooms are super outdated.  This was one of the prettiest hotel rooms Ive stayed in.  Nice and spacious, with beautiful modern deco decor.  I had a pool view which was gorgeous.  The room was clean and everything looked new, and there were robes in the room which is always nice.

The people at the front desk were okay.  One guy was not personable at all but the girl I spoke with while checking out was better.  Nothing over the top though - Ive had better service at 4* hotels on that front.  

My main complaint here was eating.  There arent a lot of choices. Im traveling alone and I dont want anything fancy, which is the class that most of the restaurants there fell into. A lot of stuff closes early too -- Jean Phillipe closed at 11pm here but at 12pm in Aria, which is weird.  The gelato place closed early too.

 They also charge $10 for a bottle of fiji water from the mini bar which is just absolutely outrageous.

Everything at Bellagio's buffet is exceptionally fresh, nicely cooked and delicious!  The desert is simply to die for.

Eat everything in moderation and you will get your money's worth.

The hotel is classy and one of my favorites to visit.  I will never tire of watching the fountain show outside.  Depending on the time of day, there's a show every 15 or 30 minutes.  The conservatory is another must-see when you come here.  They change it up five times a year (Chinese New Year, spring, summer, fall and winter\/Christmas).  It's a beautiful display of flowers and plants put together in creative ways.

I was excited to finally stay here for the first time recently.  We were in a Resort Queen Room in the Main Tower and honestly it was a little underwhelming.  They recently underwent a renovation, but our room still looked dated. Compared to hotels I've stayed at like the Venetian\/Palazzo and Wynn\/Encore, the room didn't feel as luxurious.  

They charge $10 per day for self parking ($18 for valet) now, but on the bright side you get in-out privileges at all the MGM hotels once you've paid.  It would be nice if parking was included in the resort fee for hotel guests since it's already so much money.  They should just charge visitors.

Most of the restaurants here are sit-down and on the pricier side, so if you want something more casual and\/or affordable, you'll have to go outside the hotel.  I haven't been to The Buffet in awhile, but I remember it being one of the better buffets in Vegas.

As hotel guests, we were able to get into The Bank and Hyde without paying cover or waiting in line which was nice.  Granted, neither of these night clubs are the hottest in Vegas right now.  But if I had to choose, Hyde was the nicer of the two.

We booked a deal from Expedia, a flight and hotel package. Bellagio received $120\/night from the deal. We were there five years ago and the property has been well maintained. We received a room overlooking the pool in the main tower. 

The downsides of our stay is the housekeeping. Upon inspecting the bathroom, there was visible urine stains on the toilet seat. eeeewwww! We found this is to be unacceptable and the mister called housekeeping to take care of it. Also, found a cash ticket under the sofa seat for $1.62, finder's keepers! Another dislike was the long lines for the popular two eateries, the Buffet and Cafe Bellagio. On Thanksgiving day, the lines for the Buffet were too long and went beyond the guest elevators. We dare not to go on line that day, it would feel like being at Disney or at the DMV. I did wait almost half hour in line for Cafe Bellagio. That was torture! For dining options, I feel that Bellagio should have more casual dining options. A majority of the restaurants are high end but most are only open for dinner so that leave you with the buffet or cafe bellagio.

We got in line, where our IDs were scruntized thoroughly by a man at the door. He scratched on our IDs and examined them over and over. He then claimed that my fiancé's ID was fake. (Our ages are 29 & 28). He then said he had to take her into a back office room to verify her ID. He threatened that if I came with, I would be arrested for trespassing. (Keep in mind all I told him was I didn't feel comfortable allowing her to be alone in Vegas in some undisclosed room in the Bellagio without me.) To shorten the story, once we were escorted to the back office room, the three men asked for our personal information (such as our social security numbers - which we refused and insisted on talking to the police ourselves if we had to disclose that information. Which they did not allow us to do.), and the harassment continued. We were threatened that if our IDs were fake that we would be banned from the property along with several other properties. This is the first time I've ever been to Vegas and I'm curious why the Hyde didn't have the usual ID scanners like most other bars or nightclubs usually use. After they were gone with our identification and we were forced to wait like criminals in this small back room with handcuffed benches and surveillance cameras, they came back and said her ID was real but now my ID was fake. I asked how is it that I can fly from Florida to Vegas and TSA verified my identification but yet it fails to pass here... the one gentlemen's response was that TSAS security and scanners aren't as efficient as theirs (what!?). Finally after almost 45 minutes of this harassment, we were told we weren't allowed on the property and we're escorted towards the entrance to Caesars Palace. At no point did either of us fight or argue. We cooperated through the ridiculous situation and are embarrassed this happened to us.

Thanks, Bellagio!",1,1,1

It seemed for a ""VIP"" check in area we were waiting An awfully long time. And not once did any of the front desk say he will be with you shortly or even acknowledge us. Finally after about 45 minutes of waiting we finally get checked in. After getting out keys she said the room is a smoking room and that all of the top floor suites are smoking. What??? Why on earth would they not tell us this as we booked the room? I have severe allergies and even the scent of smoke aggravates them. So after we say we do not want a room with smoking finally the lady says well we could put you a few floors down under where you would be at originally but the view is not going to be as nice. Ok whatever. We just wanted to get to out freaking room and relax. So she then points us in the direction of the elevators through the casino floor? Huh? I just heard her telling every single guest before is to use the VIP elevators right near check in! I called her out on them and she was just like ""oh well if you want I use those they are right around the corner"" etc. what the heck? I still have no idea what that was all about maybe she was just being a bitch because we were upset about them trying to give us a suite with smoking. I'm top of that we were in one of the nicer sweets so we were paying a pretty penny so the least she could do is tell us where the VIP elevators were. The room is big but it was OK kind of not the Decour that I would have expected. Yes I've been a bit spoiled staying at the Wynn and the encore. But for the price we paid we would have expected something a little bit more upscale. Anyhow I will not be staying here anymore I should have stayed at the win again like my first instinct told me.

I am here with my husband for the weekend and have a six month old son at home with his grandparents. I am still breastfeeding and arranged for the hotel to help me send frozen breast milk home to my baby during my stay. I called a month ahead of time and was told by multiple concierges and business center personnel that this would not be a problem and that they provide this kind of service to moms all the time. The only reason I chose this hotel or came on this trip was because of how confident they sounded about being able to get this done. 

Well I am here now and was given the run around for over an hour this morning. The bottom line is they did not uphold any of their promises to get the breast milk back to my baby, in fact they don't even know how to handle such a request. They have my calls on file but they were not prepared to do what they guaranteed they could do and wanted to charge me five times more than what they quoted me to get the milk home IF they could figure out how to do it. What happened to they do this this all the time??? I am completely appalled. When I asked for some kind of compensation they said they could give me $100 and that's it. Are they crazy???

We had a water show view from our hotel room, which was pleasant, but also a bit loud. We spent most of our time in the MGM before and felt that this hotel was geared more toward quality than quantity of visitors (very beautiful botanical garden when you enter through the main doors). Much easier to navigate and a significant number of waitresses in the casinos. The location is also very convenient, as it is almost in the heart of the strip. Everything was easily a 20 minute (or less) walk from our hotel room, and we could be at Caesar's\/Planet Hollywood without breaking a sweat.

It's a great area to stay in if you're looking to be very centralized. If you book a room, I feel that it's not a big deal to have a view of the water show in your face (sure it's cool to have a view from your window and tune into the channel, but it's annoying to hear it every 30 minutes when you're trying to take a nap). Also definitely check out the shopping area if you enjoy designer brands!",4,1,1

Only complaint is that as someone with pretty bad allergies to smoking (as it turns out) it's impossible to get into your room without going through the casino. (I guess that's all hotels for ya). 

(+1) Very polite and quick service. From check-in to check-out everything was very smooth. Clean room, great bathroom, gorgeous decor. I know it's expected but I was still very pleased. We didn't try pushing our luck with the $20trick but I heard many people get bumped up that way. 
(+1) Great deal on seeing O if you book a room here. Ultimately was the reason we stayed at the Bellagio. Not only do you get a discount but you also get special seats that are in a zone you otherwise won't get. 
(+1\/-1) Concierge was very polite but overall worthless. They didn't even have other perks like buffet passes. 
(-1) As mentioned above the entrance to the rooms (elevators) is smack in in the middle of the casino. Yucky smoking people everywhere.

We stayed at the Bellagio over Mother's Day weekend and got a pretty good deal off their website (less than $200\/night for a regular room).  It's a central location on the strip and right next to the newest City Centre - where you can walk to or take the free tram that goes between Monte Carlo, Aria, City Centre, and Bellagio.

From the minute you enter, everything within is clean and gorgeous.  Check-in (and check-out) was quick and easy.  The rooms are fairly spacious and the large bathroom consists of large shower stall and separate bathtub, his & her sinks.  The shower pressure and temperature, however, were inconsistent and the toiletries were weak.  Otherwise, the rooms were more than adequate and comfortable.  We stayed on the 24th floor and never waited more than a minute for an elevator.  

I personally was not a fan of the pool area.  You take the elevator to the pool level below casino level, where you grab towels.  Then you have to wander out through a maze of poolside chairs and various pools to get out into the sunlight.  (When it's time to go back inside the hotel, there are signs pointing you in the direction of the exit.  That's how large the area is!)  The poolside area itself just felt overpacked and chaotic - not the relaxing poolside experience I was looking for on my vacation weekend.  I also noticed they didn't seem to enforce any security to ensure you were a hotel guest, and wondered if there were any non-guests utilizing the facilities.

The resort itself is gorgeous, from the lobby to the conservatory to the fountains.  There's plenty of dining and shopping options within.  It's also home to Cirque du Soleil's O (my favorite cirque show ever!).  A large casino with a good variety of games to win (or lose) some $$$.

We had a luxury room with $30 upgrade for the fountain view. We were there for only 1 night. Once we got into the room, as usual, we checked if everything was okay so we wouldn't be blamed for something not done by us. We found 2 lights not working, and 1 pillow was missing. So we called for fixing the light. One of our door card keys didn't work too. Since we didn't have enough time (just one night), so we rushed to the pool to enjoy our time, and then went to have dinner. We went back after dinner and ready for bed, and also enjoyed couple fountain shows from our view. Then I found that the pillows had stains, and my husband also found some food debris and trash between the bed and the wall, so we felt grossed out. We were struggling if we wanted to complain right away but we got too tired, so we decided to complain the other day. We didn't get the door card key fixed right away because of the long long lines at the registration desks. We really didn't want to waste our only night there with fixing this and that. 
The other day when we checked out, we told the registration desk how dissatisfied we were. She apologized and told us that they would have given us a better room if they told them earlier. But I explained to her that we only had one night and didn't want to spoil it by switching rooms and fixing here and there. So she offered to waive our upgrade fee of $30, which is fair enough for us. So it was resolved.
But I wouldn't want to go back staying at Bellagio hotel rooms again, because with that price, I could have better rooms at Aria and Venetian, and we like the rooms and everything better in Aria and Venetian too. Bellagio room is nice but not nice enough for that price. So it's okay to experience it just once and not going back again. And the beds aren't that comfy, probably because it's getting old. The shower water pressure wasn't that strong either. It's an old hotel....nice outside but not inside. We had better beds and shower at Aria and Venetians.....so.....with all these comparisons, Bellagio room wasn't that great. If there was no fountain view, there is nothing good about the room for us. We felt that the room isn't clean as a whole. I felt a bit itchy the other morning. Yes probably we could have better room if we complained earlier. But I still think that a 5 star should have every room cleaned well at their first round, shouldn't need to wait for someone complaining to clean the room thoroughly, meanwhile we felt that the rooms are very clean at Venetian and Aria.

However, it's not nearly to the standard they set for themselves. Yes, they have an awesome pool (which you get a mandatory charge for) and a well kept casino. BUT the rooms are just decent. Our room had stains on the floor, the bathtub had hair, and black spots on a towel..errr...

We checked in LATE (like 11pm) so there was only a 10 minute wait at check in. During the usually 3pm check ins, expect to wait 45minutes. 

In the event you have children, this hotel is not at all kid friendly. I was standing on the ""walkway"" not too far from the elevators waiting for my husband to come down (he forgot his phone in the room). A security came up to me and told me I had to keep walking or go back to the tower elevators since I have a kid. Mind you, I was not standing near any machines or tables.

If you are child-free, aside from the casino, there are ""the shoppes"" where you can buy designer. You can also take the free tram that connects 3 surrounding hotels.
Again, trouble with the service in the casino...We couldn't find the tram so we asked one of those people in the burgundy jacket for direction and this guy acted like he own the damn hotel.

The layout of the room was also just not great, we ended up dragging chairs in front of the window, as they have the sitting area of the room facing towards the bed. When you have the fountains outside the window?? The bed was nothing noteworthy, and the sheets had a weird smell. The bathroom had mold in the shower, and all of the drains were very clogged and drained incredibly slow. Also, you are not supposed to touch any of the items they have in the room; snacks, drinks and the mini-bar - they cost an arm and a leg and automatically get charged to you if you even move them, let alone eat them. They also have their mini fridge so stuffed full that you cannot place anything of your own in there. I would rate Bellagio 5-star for the view, 2 or 3-star for the room.

I still hold it in high regard and think it is one of the best hotels on the Strip. But after having stayed there for a weekend, the romance has worn off, it's just another hotel, and I doubt I will ever stay here again.

I wanted a transformative experience, impeccable service, and memorable experiences that confirmed what I had always believed The Bellagio to represent.

But alas, I came away with more than a couple of sub-par experiences.

Throughout our entire stay, this hotel was super busy. At any hour. The minute we got out of our elevator, there were hoards of people, of course it was worse at night. If you want a little space wandering your hotel, this is not the place to stay.

I had two nights booked, separately so I called ahead to make sure the reservations could be combined and we wouldn't need to change rooms. But we showed up and still had to have the reservations combined into one stay. And even that didn't stick. The next day we were locked out of our room mid-day because the keys for the first reservation stopped working. A 10 minute wait and security let us into our room. A call to the front desk brought a promise of new keys, delivered within 30 minutes. An hour later, no keys. Another call and the front desk said, ""you'd better come down to get them"". Worse, the front desk clerk giggled at me when I told her I'd had to wait an hour for naught. No apology. Not a big deal, right? Keys can be a problem, no? I agree, it's how it was handled.

Our room was nice, but not spectacular. The room we paid for could have been on any floor between 9 and 28. We were on floor 11. That was disappointing. The front desk clerk should have listened when I told him I had wanted to stay here for many many years, he could have provided us the best possible experience, but no, he didn't. The room was well done, nothing out of place (apart from a bag of mini bar snacks left opened). The bathroom was the best part, large with a nice-sized glass shower. I was also disappointed that our view of the fountains could only be taken in when we huddled by the window; I'd wanted to sit in bed and watch the show!

We spent some time by the pool. It was early November and not that warm, but we weren't the only ones there. Service was non-existent! Others were served but no staff ever came to ask for our order.

We faced the Fountains (Fountain Deluxe Room) and one terribly surprising aspect of our room was noise! Between midnight and 4 AM both nights during our stay, noise from the club in the hotel woke me up. Thump thump thump for a few hours. Another surprise was noise in the hallway. Both nights there were very loud groups of people hanging out in the hallway for more than a few minutes. I probably should have called the front desk. It was just surprising for a hotel of this quality that there was so much noise coming from outside (the nightclub was directly below our room) and inside (the hallway).

Our housekeeper was the same person over three days. She was very kind and gracious. We sought her out when we left to thank her for her service.

Perhaps when one day money becomes no object, I will return to The Bellagio. But for the immediate future, there are many nice hotels along the Strip that will provide just as comfortable accommodations for a much fairer price. I'd really hoped, spending such a considerable sum, that we would have been treated as special, valued guests, but we weren't, we were just a couple of other guests in a huge hotel on a busy weekend.",15,3,0

Then there is the ever-changing botanical gardens exhibit... it's currently a forest setting with toy trains cutting through the foliage.

We were lucky enough to have a buddy working at the Bellagio and he was able to get us on a list for the pool.  The poolside scene was very calm and composed... a huge difference from the raucous MGM Grand.  The landscape is classic Roman and majority of the pools are frigid fountains... but that's ok because it's 100+ out there.  Due to this fact, we found ourselves spending much of our time sipping refreshing cocktails like mojitos and their fabulous Mai Tai's... they are really amazing with fruit and topped with powdered sugar.

I had made arrangements several months in advance to ensure we had a beautiful stay for our wedding and since it was my wife's first trip to Vegas.

I reserved a resort king tower fountain view room for 3 nights, and even after being an M life member receiving 15% off entire order the reservation ran a little over $1200. Everyone and their mom praised how great the Bellagio was so the price didn't matter to me. 

Upon arrival, my wife and I flew into Vegas fairly early in the morning. We checked in and our room wasn't ready yet (understandable since it was 10 am) but they said they would text us when it was ready and in the meantime they have a complimentary bag hold so we wouldn't have to carry our bags all over with us. That was great, although almost every hotel has this. We check our bags with a man at the bag hold and since we just arrived I hadn't even had cash in my wallet. The guy that checked our bags was so incredibly aggressively asking us for a tip for just holding our bags he insisted I go to an atm- for what maybe $2 I would give him??  Completely unprofessional in my opinion. I work in service and granted a tip is nice it should never be asked for. We didn't tip him but we did give the man who dropped our bags when our room was ready $5. 

Our room was on the 23rd floor and it was truly immaculate. Every star I give this hotel is due to its beautiful infrastructure, and the hospitality the housekeepers gave us. Nina prepared our room and it was gorgeous. We took several baths because was a personal hot tub so big. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud and our view was unreal. We got to see the Bellagio fountains like never before and it brought tears to my wife's eyes. You can play channel 22 on TV and hear the music that goes with the fountains right from your room. I thought it was special that we got a relatively close view to the fountains most likely because I put in our reservation we were getting married and it was our first time to Vegas. For that whoever placed in our room, we thank you!

As far as the rest of our stay, we were fairly disappointed with the customer service aspect. My wife and I are lesbians and several times felt like we were profiled by Bellagio employees and received looks like we shouldn't have been there. Which is really disappointing as I spent close to $2500 in total over a 4 day span: including reservation, dining at Bellagio restaurants, and gambling at the casino. I'd just like to add that we are in our 20s and we don't dress dumpy, my wife and I were probably the best dressed in that whole hotel compared to the trailer trash dressing people that filled the casino. Regardless each time, when using the guest elevator we would be asked to show our room card. At night, everyone is asked but during the day they profile and as several people would walk past without showing their key we would be pulled back and asked. It felt degrading and I almost wrote to the concierge but decided against it since I don't plan on staying at this hotel again due to these small inconsistent terrible service experiences.

We ate at several restaurants that were amazing, Yellowfin, Olives, Lago to name a few. The only restaurant I would not recommend is Cafe Bellagio. Decent menu that is way overpriced and once again horrible customer service. 

I had included and requested for the Bellagio to add any extra romantic touches since we were getting married Saturday the 21st. Upon arrival there was nothing in our room. I had checked the amenities list and adding romantic touches threw there would be several hundred more so I decided to just leave it out. We got married Saturday and when we came back to our room the Bellagio sent a letter saying they were happy we chose to spend our special moment with them along with a box of chocolate. I figured they would have also left a bottle of champagne or even cider as that should be complimentary for a multi billion dollar hotel but nothing except a small box of what we thought were store bought chocolate. That was all fine but I guess I just expected more especially from what I've heard from different people. I recognize this is 2017 and everything costs $ now but I hope the Bellagio retrains their team on what customer service means. Every department but housekeeping and maybe the concierge was unimpressive. 

Overall, we loved our room and it was worth the money to see my wife as happy as she was with our VIP view of the strip and the fountains but we both agreed next time we will stay at a surrounding hotel that is equally nice but has better service and is more LGBT friendly.",4,0,0

The restaurants are great, albeit overpriced again, but the fact that we had to cross the street to Paris in order to get a decent lunch (the first two restaurants that we went to at the Bellagio itself were not great) is a shame. They need to feed people during the day as well as at night.",0,0,0

It's always magnificently and artfully displayed, so make sure you bring your camera!  Sometimes, they may even have a little bird or butterfly exhibit (I think this occurs during the Spring time).

There are also beautiful couture shops and boutiques.  Bellagio has a great selection for those high end shoppers :)

Room: I was fortunate to stay at the Salone Suite for a great price. The amenities was fantastic and more than you could ask for in a hotel. I had the corner room with 180 degree view of the fountain:

Bathroom: As a girl, the bathroom set the tone for the experience. It was a gigantic marble white bathroom that's the size of a Las Vegas standard room. The bathroom has a comfortable jacuzzi with an amazing view and plenty of counter space to do your makeup. 

Fountain: Nothing like water pulsating from the ground in unison with music through the ages gets you going :) It starts at various times depending on the day of the week and within every 30 minute intervals. It's pretty majestic and its worth to stop by if its your first time in Vegas.",4,3,3

I swore on my next trip to Vegas I would stay there. So when I decided to spend my 40th birthday in Vegas, I booked the Bellagio. I was so excited. My excitement started to wane at check in. I waited in line for nearly 40 minutes until I was finally called to check in. This wasn't at a prime time of day, it was at 11:50pm.  By the time we got to check in, it was after midnight. The clerk was nice enough, she asked if we were celebrating anything. I explained it was my birthday. She said Happy Birthday, then proceeded to check us in like normal. No other mention of my birthday. It was no different than an average hotel check in.

The room was pretty. It looked toward the strip, but the view was mainly of a large roof top. No plants or anything, just a painted roof. The cable didn't work at all. The toilet didn't work right. My biggest complaint was the toilet paper!  For $300+ per night, I expect at least quality two ply toilet paper. This stuff was what you find in road side stops... rough and useless. A call to the front desk took at least ten minutes to get a live person to answer.  If you so much as rearrange the minibar, there is a $50 fee.  Also, there was something in our room that made both my husband and my noses run as soon as we walked in. I was blowing my nose the entire time I was in the room but would stop when we left.  The room seemed clean so I have no idea the source. I'm allergic to cats and mold so neither is a good sign. 

There were barely any toiletries. There was one bar of soap which had to be used at the sink, shower, and soaking tub. The shampoo and conditioner were decent quality.  Also, no extra toiletries. I forgot my razor and was out of luck. I've stayed at chain hotels that provide any forgotten items!  The escalator to the strip was also out of order. With the hotel sitting off of the strip, those extra stairs a few times per day really added up. 

The smoke smell was extremely heavy as soon as you walked into the lobby. It clung to our clothes just walking to our room. The buffet was over priced for a Saturday brunch and wasn't impressive. We also went to Hyde night club.  It was fun, good music, but really small and tons of roped off areas.  After looking forward to staying here for years and paying a premium, I am sorely disappointed.

The next day they sold out again and we were unable to get our room because we booked only for 2 people, and only booking for 3+ will guarantee double queen fountain view. 
They gave us ambiguous reasons with no consistency at all.
Finally we were referred around several times because non of them seem to keep a straight story and we waited more than 15 minutes for the manager and got a $30 discount out of the $200+ room cost.

We've visited Bellagio for a meal and shopping, but this was our first time to stay there.  I would say that in many ways the Bellagio is the best on the Strip.  The location couldn't be better.  The interior decor and finish is exceptional.  I'm a bit of a furniture enthusiast so I notice things like the chairs.  At Bellagio you can sit in a $1,500 designer Louis XVI chair while you eat your crepes in the marble promenade.  Most of the other casinos use something more like a $200 pottery barn throw away chair and serve pretzels and hot dogs.   Walk through the casino floor and listen to Frank Sinatra and you get a classy feeling.  Other casinos?  Well, I remember hearing Sweet Home Alabama several times and I felt like I was back in college looking for someone with a beer bong.  I guess there is something for everyone but the Bellagio just feels right for us.

The location is in the heart of the strip and it has many beautiful attractions that don't have a fee (rare in Vegas).  Subsequently, it gets very crowded.  That is the major downside.

The food ranges from ""good"" to ""unbelievable"" depending on your budget.  I've seen other reviews that complain of $8 rolls, but c'mon people, this is Vegas.  They get you in with a low cost hotel room (we paid $155\/night total) and then you pay to play, eat, drink and enjoy.  

I didn't see any $8 rolls while I was there.  The food prices seem reasonable for a luxury hotel.  I would even say it's cheap compared to others.  I've paid $30 for breakfast at The Le Meridian in Munich and it is not nearly as good $15 breakfast buffet at Bellagio.  The service is good as well.  It's not great, but what do you expect at a buffet?  I never found myself needing more coffee.  That's enough for me.

The standard room is decent size and comfortable for staying a few days with two people.  It would be cramped with four.  I've had better and I've had worse.  We stayed in the Spa tower and had a full view of the fountains.  That was nice.  

I selected ""No"" on the ""Good for Kids"" rating.  There are not really any attractions or activities for kids at Bellagio.  On a personal note, I really can't understand why you would bring kids to Vegas in the first place.  It seems like a good place for getting away from kids to me.

The high end restaurants are kind of boring.  The reward program doesn't reward you.  I seem to lose here more often than the other casinos.  If the rates are reasonable, I would stay here all the time, but since they are not, I don't.  It still a must do while in Vegas.",2,0,0

Can't go wrong with the Bellagio as a solid Vegas choice, would love to come back and stay for a few more nights and really get to enjoy everything is has to offer. 

We dined at one of their newer restaurants, Harvest. A farm to table concepts, it was absolutely delicious! I order brussel sprouts wherever I can and these were hands down in the top 5 of the array of them I've eaten.

Yeah ""Dancing Waters"" is still very entertaining but...you don't come to Vegas just to see bubbling waters (well maybe some folks do.) 
There was a big reservation screw up caused by passing on my reservation to two online services and then to the Bellagio. To their credit the hotel staff did their best to rectify the problem-but it shouldn't have happened in the first place.
For those that come for the gambling the casino floor is still an attraction but there've got to be at least a hundred other places in this town just as good for giving your money away. At least the casino floor here is a bit quieter but no less congested.
As for the hotel part of this the rooms are just rooms no more no less-well maybe less as there are no outtake fans or heating lights in the bathrooms, the minibar has stopped being a refrigerator which people can use for say leftovers and things they might buy outside of the hotel (perish the thought.) The free WIFI is almost always painfully slow. The beds are comfortable if you like to wake with severe curvature of the spine.
On the good side it's centrally located so almost everything on the strip is within walking distance. The enormity of the place is still impressive although other newer hotels do a whole lot more with the same space.
So I definitely won't be staying here again next time but still I say that with the knowledge of what it was and what it meant to the town's popularity and growth.",2,0,0

I originally booked a Salone Suite, but I tipped a nice, beautiful may I add, girl at front desk to get an upgrade to Bellagio Suite.  I originally just wanted an upgrade to one with a view, but Bellagio Suite will do just fine =D  Also picked up line pass for the buffet, thank you Hilda.

I checked out the floor plans of the Salone Suite, but was not familiar at all with Bellagio Suite.  Let me sum it up with two words: three toilets.

Room service was fantastic (exceptional service on the phone and on delivery), and I have to say that it's actually worth ordering in for one night, so you can enjoy your meal looking over the fountain water show.  ""Her"" bathroom had a jet tub thing, and ""His"" bathroom has steam thing.  Sorry for my poor diction.

Usually, I don't play table games, but decided to spend some time playing a little this time around.  Had a good time talking with the dealers, getting drinks from super hot cocktail waitress, and breaking even =D  Yay!

Amenities, of course, are fantastic.  Lots of shopping + top-notch staff + must-see conservatory + another must-see fountain.  It sure is on the pricey side, but I felt that it was worth it.

As a side note, I was out by myself one night to take pictures of the fountain water show.  So I had my usual gear (tripod + camera), and I am not kidding you... at least 15 people came up to me in 30 minutes, asking me in one shape or another ""do you know when the next show is?""  And of course, I said ""every 15 minutes until midnight"" (it was around 8pm at the time).  I must've looked like an employee or something.

I stayed at the Bellagio the nights of 9\/7 through 9\/9.  The cost of this penthouse suite averaged about $600 per night.  While that sounds expensive, similar sized suites (1500 sq ft) at the Aria and Caesars were significantly more expensive.  What does one get at a Bellagio penthouse suite?  

     - comp limo service to\/from airport (tip the driver, of course)
     - private check-in area with wine, snacks and other beverages
     - floor-to-ceiling windows with push-button activated drapes
     - 4 (!) flat-screen tvs
     - wet bar with MINI-FRIDGE!!
     - powder room, men's bathroom AND women's bathroom
     - men's toiletries included shave gel, mouthwash, toothpaste, toothbrush and razor (weirdly, this was a highlight for me)

The lobby has a beautiful blown glass ceiling in a rainbow of colors. Just beyond the lobby is an atrium that always kind of seems like a piece of Wonderland.

This stay was my husband's surprise to me for my birthday in May 2011. I was thrilled we were finally going to be able to stay here and it was everything I had hoped it would be. Starting off, check-in was great. A little bit of a wait, but the desk clerk was efficient and friendly once we got there. We didn't feel as if we were being processed thru a cattle call and as an ex hotel careerist, I was impressed with the process. 

The room was spacious, clean,very classy and yet cozy. I loved the colours - not garish, not over the top, sort of soothing greens, tans and golds, actually. (My picture doesn't do it justice, really) The first sight we saw as we entered the room was the view: Las Vegas Blvd with the Paris across the street. Directly in front: the fountains! YAY! There was a channel on the TV which piped the fountain music in so you could watch the show and hear the music that was playing all without leaving your room. The view is one of the best we've seen in Vegas. Yes, you saw some rooftops of the buildings lining the fountains below, but it was minimal. I love, love, loved this room!

There is a varied collection of restaurants and shops in the complex. We did lunch one day at Olives. I had the Beef Carpaccio. (even tho' I had no idea what carpaccio was) LOVED it. And we enjoyed High Tea at the Petrossian Bar - what a lovely, relaxing experience!

When my car pulls up I notice a huge scratch on the wheel of my car and I instantly go to the valet booth so they can come see the damage. I'm approached by an upset supervisor of the valet named ""Joe"" he right off the bat said "" I'm sorry I don't believe you that scratch was already there, and made a comment on how I was being petty and must have lost when I was gambling""  I replied you have to be kidding me!!! He laughed and said we have everything on camera and I'll show you. We go to the booth and watch the footage of me pulling up, we zoom in on my wheels and their spotless!!!! He doesn't apologize, he just stays quiet and says ""let's fill out an incident report""  the Bellagio had the best customer service in the world I can't believe they would hire someone like Joe! 

I get back home upset due to the damage on my new car and the disrespectful comments made and I get a call from a regional claims administrator Named Jacob Schwoob. Now this is the ideal employee of the Bellagio!!! He listened to what happened, looked over the report, watched the video evidence of my car and made sure everything was taken care of to the best standards!

Here's a few rants and raves about this place...

I want to rave about the grandeur of the hotel. Even though this hotel is not the newest on the Strip, it still holds the dignified air of elegance that no other has come close to. The room was nicely decorated as well as the lobby (albeit crowded) and its corridors\/hallway (quiet and respectful). We had a corner room so we had more windows than usual (including one in the bathroom) and one less neighbor to deal with. The room was clean when we arrived unlike our first stay, we had a gum stuck in the menu booklet (ick!). Housekeeping was prompt, attentive and very friendly.

As much as housekeeping is part of my rave, they are also part of my rant. True, they would come and clean your room as soon as you leave (they'll ask you if they see you walking down the hall) or give them a call but they were not very thorough. After getting back to the room, I noticed the bathroom floor had not been swept.  Same thing with the shower room. One of the face towels in the drawers had a strand of hair in it! One of the rugs for the tub had a stain on it. It was a quite disappointing. Their website might describe a flat screen TV but, you can't fool me, the room had only one CRT TV. Wallpaper was peeling in the toilet room and there were plenty of scuff marks around the bedroom. The automatic sheer curtain control was not working properly nor was the vanity mirror. At the end of our vacation, we tried express check-out but were billed incorrectly. So we dragged our bags and suitcases down and waited in line to check out with the rest of the crowd trying to check in. 

This hotel is not self-contained. Lunch options and cheap dinners are quite limited as well as nightlife (The Bank is a whole other review!), you have to cross the street to be satisfied. I can't say much about the casino because we're not gamblers, although I did win a few bucks on the slots. No incessant air fresheners wafting through the public areas, just the occasional cigarette or cigar smoke. They do a good job of filtering it.

A while back my friends and I decided it was time for a much needed girls only vacation.  After doing some research, I came across a deal for a stay at the Bellagio and airfare that was too good to pass up.  Within 2 days we had decided to take a trip and made the reservations.  When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by a someone who took our bags and we walked up to front desk.  The glass blown flowers are so beautiful and can't be described by words or even by pictures (its the background on my phone).  The flower ""garden"" too.  So amazing.  We got to watch them replacing some of the flowers and got to have a few roses.  Anyway, back to the topic at hand.  Check in went as smooth as possible.  We were given a room with a great view of the mountains.  They even apologized for not having a room that faced the strip.  We all thought the mountain view was much better anyway.  
The room was nothing short of gorgeous.  We walked in to marble floors and a very large hotel room.  To our left was  one of the nicest bathrooms I have even seen.  A huge bath tub, large stand up shower and a generously sized counter top.  (only problem, glass shower and no separate sink or toilet does make it a little different for 3 girls to share a hotel room and get primped for a night on the town)  The beds were soft and cozy.  The room pretty much catered to your every need.  There were even buttons on the wall to open and close the shades.  
After we settled into the room and played with all the gadgets, we went to investigate.  We wandered the hotel and discovered the gelato shop (a theme in a few of my other reviews) and many of the other places in the hotel.  All amazing and beautiful.  The next day we stayed by the pool, all day.  We went made our way through the conservatory and to the pool.  We got a prime seat by one of the many pools to choose from.  They had free ice water with lemon but we were on vacation and wanted some booze.  The prices were NOT cheap but the amount of booze made it worth every penny.  The drink I loved was something with monkey in the title.  Basically a lot of booze, ice cream, banana, and coconut.  
What really sealed my deal with the hotel was the exceptional customer service.  After our night at the pool, we were ready for a night out.  We had passes the Bank, the club in the Bellagio.  We were told to present them at the front of the line and we get in ahead of everyone and get comp. booze.  When we got to the entrance, there was no organization.  No line, just a mob of people.  I asked someone who worked at the club what we do and he was so rude and quick to brush us off.  We decided to go to margaritaville and had a great time.  The next day we went to the concierge after a day at bootleg canyon.  We explained the situation and, let me tell you, they jumped on that like flies on ......  It was explained that they don't OWN the club but also made it clear that they were, in no way, trying to distance themselves from the issue.  They said something like ""We have a give and take with the club.  They rent from us and we will promote the club.  However, if they don't treat our guests with respect, we don't have to give them the business.""  Well put!  They went out of their way to make sure we had a good night.  Even before I got back to the room, they had called to let us know what was going to happen that night.  They had contacted Pure nightclub (we had indicated that was where were going that night) and provided us with the number of manager and told us where to go to make sure we were taken care of.  That meant no cover and free booze all night long.  Now that is service!  Top it off, an unexpected visit from room service at 9pm with chocolate covered strawberries in a bowl made of white chocolate.  Amazing touch.
I know this review has gotten a little long and I am trying to not go into every detail of my trip.  I just want to try to put into words how much we enjoyed our stay at the bellagio.  The stores, the restaurants the pool, the flowers, everything.  This hotel made the trip as amazing as it was.",1,0,0

Prior to its opening, the newer casinos were going down the whole family friendly lane, and then the Bellagio came with it's wholly adult, sophisticated feel.  

The botanical gardens alone are worth the trip.  They change monthly and have never failed to impress.  You can sometimes smell them before you see them.

The gallery of fine art was another first of its kind - the first time great works of art were brought to a predominant Vegas resort and it still remains one of the few truly artistic attractions on the Strip.

The bars and lounges are all great, but for a real treat as a tourist or for an out of town guest - have a drink on the balcony of the Fontana Lounge at night while the fountains go off.  That's pretty spectacular.",1,0,0

Amex FHR benefit, Hyatt Diamond Status, and MLife Platinum status, among others. 

We arrived at the Bellagio and stood in the VIP check-in line for Mlife Platinum members and were eventually waited to a regular attendant because of the absurdly long wait in the VIP check-in line.  I explained we'd like to upgrade to a room with a view (I mentioned I was Hyatt Diamond and was told that ""that didn't matter here"") of the fountain and the attendant tried to sell me a Penthouse Suite only. I explained I just want the ""Deluxe Fountain View"" room and that I would pay the difference if needed.  The attendant said no rooms other than the Penthouse Suite were available for our stay with a view of the fountain and they were completely sold out. I looked online and saw that on Mlife.com, Bellagio.com, AmericanExpressFHR.com, Hotwire.com and others this room type was available for me to book right there on the spot. The attendant said those were all incorrect (which I cannot believe) and that room type wasn't available and that ""next time I should book the right room"" when I asked him to clarify he said ""A room with a view I mean"".  We ultimately stayed in a room facing the convention center roof. Every room I have ever stayed in at the Cosmo has had a better view than this room we were put in.  The most disappointing thing is that there were rooms available for our quick one-night stay that could have sufficed for our needs. 

Additionally, I booked the room through American Express Platinum Travel and on the booking at says a couple things.  First it says I would receive a $100 room credit. Every time I have ever used this at any Amex FHR property it has been a room credit. I made a reservation at Olives a week in advance for dinner knowing the entire town would be packed. When I checked in I was informed the $100 credit was only good at like 5 restaurants.  This created a huge issue in terms of planning our evening. Also, for breakfast I have been able to use Breakfast as room service... With Bellagio it was $30 only at a few places. We went to the Bellagio Cafe which was buffet food plated basically... Terrible food and very expensive.  The Amex FHR benefit is a total waste for this the Bellagio.

Again, I reported to management and they didn't care.  

Upon check out I explained the entire check-in and dining issue to the attendant and manager and neither cared at all. I would have expected the manager to comp us at least the resort fee or something. I explained I stayed 13 stays for 34 nights in 2015 at the Cosmo and was using this stay as a trial to see if I wanted to make the switch. Needless to say, he didn't care.

I can say the room was spotless and the grounds are of course beautiful. My wife didn't believe Bellagio was a AAA Five Diamond resort given how much better some other resort properties we have stayed at were though.

I imagine that if Bellagio contacts me I might get an ""I'm sorry"" or ""We don't have control over the American Express FHR relationship"" or ""We aren't a Hyatt property so of course you don't get Diamond benefits..."" 

I hope to be wrong though.",3,0,0

We had booked one of the suites facing the fountain (don'y remember the name) at the price of $200 The room wasn't as beautiful as it appeared in the website. it definitely is a beautiful hotel but its casino, restaurant and the garden, like all other hotels at Vegas are open to the non-guests. The only plus point was the fountain that we could see from our room. But we couldn't hear the music from our room :(. Also, since there is so much to see outside one's hotel rooms at Vegas that we did not spend a lot of time watching the fountain from the room. The staff did leave a tiny bouquet with a hand written note (we appreciate that) by the assistant manager (or somebody important) in our room with some chocolates on our anniversary day.

The refrigerator in the room was stuffed with goodies...but you had to pay for them.Don't even think of removing anything from the refrigerator, they have sensors that bill you if you remove anything from it. When my husband went to confirm about the refrigerator that was supposed to be in the room (included in the room cost), he was told that one without the goodies could be provided at an extra charge of $50 per day.

The rate was crazy cheap, but I earned it due to my love of slots and freebies (I have a card for everything!)

Checkin at VIP was second to none.  No having to wait in line like a herd of cattle- it was refined, classy, and welcoming.  A glass of wine and a chocolate dipped strawberry along with a beautiful front desk agent and handsome bellman awaited our arrival.  I was disappointed that my touted ""comp upgrade to a fountain view room"" was not available (well, not for 2 rooms close by each other), so we settled for ""sunset view"" rooms near each other.  (Would be nice if they blocked off our rooms beforehand!)

Skip to day two and three and four.....housekeeping was fantastic (we tipped well each day though), rooms nice and clean, restaurants great, staff friendly.........except the one night when I went to the VIP desk myself and it was closed and I encountered the outright rude ""mole lady"".  (I call her mole lady because I was so appalled by her attitude (spathe story is coming!) I didn't notice her name, but rather her large mole over her lip).  I'm not making fun of facial features, that's not the point, my point is her treatment of people.....

Let me begin by letting you know that I was in the hospitality business for 10 years- worked my way up front a front desk agent in a tiny hotel to an Assistant General Manager of three large properties in one on the worlds' most famous ski resorts.  I know hotels.  I know good service, and I know outright shifty service. Miss Mole noticed I was trying to get in to the VIP area and told me it was closed.  I told her my key was acting up (probably from being next to my credit cards).  Now, Vegas has its share of female companions, if you catch my drift, and she gave me the third degree about my room key as if I was a hooker! I presented my ID, my name, my address,my friends' room number and she still treated me like an unwanted guest.  I was not dressed provocatively at all (a blouse, jeans, and boots, something I'd wear to work on jean Fridays!) so I didn't look like a hooker but she treated me like one.  I was so upset.  I know they have security protocol, I appreciate that, but they way she treated me was appalling.  I did inform the VIP desk the next day and they apologized and said they'd talk to the manager.  

Even though that happened to me, the stay was great.  What a gorgeous hotel.  You will not disappointed (just stay away from the mole lady!). And get an MLife card-it's worth it!",1,0,0

The standard king room was very comfortable, quiet, and restful. Nice large bathroom with two sinks, glass shower and jacuzzi tub.  I asked for a lower floor so I could be first on and off the elevators. The pool area gets pretty busy by 11am but still possible to find a spot after that. I wouldn't say that the pools had a real party atmosphere to them, but more relaxed. The gym was very big and had a lot of free weights, machines, and cardio.

When it's a five star hotel, there are certain amenities that you get used to or expect, and while Bellagio certainly isn't the worst hotel I've stayed in, it's not the best. 

Check-in was a bit of a wait, standing behind hordes of tourists, but the staff were pleasant enough. The foyer, with its grand Dale Chihuly installation, is admittedly rather lovely.

Our room was nice- spacious, clean, and well-equipped. Our view was of the pool and spa area, and on the 20th floor- we didn't hear a peep from any of our neighbours, which I appreciate. The bathroom, while spacious, had a shower that didn't drain well, and the shower head was small and needed a proper cleaning. I realise this is the most 'first world problem' thing I've probably ever said on Yelp, but the towels were incredibly rough and scratchy. The bed was large and a bit firm, but very comfortable.

The pool area was nice, but the temperature of the pool was borderline freezing- my companion didn't want to get in- I swam one lap in the large pool and got out shivering. I'm not certain if the pool is heated, but if it is, they need to heat it a bit more. Drinks by the pool, as expected were somewhat overpriced ($40+ for a Hendricks gin and tonic and a double rum and coke), but that's Vegas for you.

About 5 years ago, I would have given this property 5 stars, but I think that they waited a little too long on their remodel.  They finally have most of the rooms updated (e.g. Large TVs, automated curtains,etc.). I just wish that they had come up with a more creative update than copying The Aria's room design.). That being said, it is still a very nice hotel with lots of things to see and do on site.

Here are some suggestions for making the most out of your stay:

If you buy a soda at Palio, Snacks, Jean Phillipe or Gelato-- save your cup. They usually don't mention it these days, but refills are free any time with a plastic Bellagio cup. 

If you don't have a Players Card, GET ONE.  Even if you are gambling a small amount you still will qualify for at least some ""express comps"" and often there are sign up bonuses for new players.   Even mid level players often receive offers for free or discounted rooms. 

If you want to go clubbing, call their concierge and ask them to put you on the VIP list for almost any club in town. It should save you on admission price and wait time--especially if you are going to a club at any of the MGM properties. 

Use the free tram at Bellagio to check out Aria and Crystals shopping center.  You also could ride it to Monte Carlo and check out the free Blue Man Group parade-- apparently they march through the casino right before their show. 

If you want to see O or a show at any MGM property, talk to the Players Club.  If you play at all, the players club can help you reserve a seat in the VIP block for the show. The casino usually blocks certain seats in the first dozen or so rows for players.  If you don't have enough for a comp, then you pay full ticket price but you still get the best seats available. (We sat behind George Lucas and next to Channing Tatum at the Michael Jackson Cirque du Soleil show thanks to the players club at Bellagio!)",6,1,1

Pros:
-Central location
-Updated rooms
-Casino wasn't too smoky
-Pools are open all year round unlike many other Strip hotels because they have...
-Heated pools!
-Jean Philippe Patisserie right off the lobby (get the Nutella Brioche!!!)
-Always beautifully decorated Conservatory (but go early morning or late night to avoid the crowds)
-Lots of great shopping (if you happen to win the Megabucks lol)
-Check in was fast. (I have VIP check in but the regular lines weren't that long either.) Check out was easy too whether you're VIP or not as you can do it thru TV and see your charges on it as well. (We had to call the front desk to do it as we had a late check out and it wouldn't allow us to do it thru TV. But it was still super easy and quick to do it that way.)

Cons:
-Our room wasn't cleaned well. Fingerprints on windows, peanuts behind curtains, a whole chocolate chip cookie under nightstand. Wow. (But the housekeeping staff was always friendly.)
-Way too crowded over the holidays as the Conservatory is such a popular tourist attraction. Elevators for garage were often backed up.
-Driving into the casino off Las Vegas Blvd was challenging because so many cars would just stop to watch the fountain show when it was going on blocking traffic. We're still on a road, people! We have places to go...money to lose! Haha
-No real line for checking in. You just stand behind other guests waiting to get helped at each individual window but if that person is taking a long time, the person next to you who might have come after could be helped first if their window is faster. Not really fair but it wasn't too bad as lines weren't very long anyway. 

So all in all, we really liked Bellagio and would stay again but during busy holidays, we would probably stay at Aria instead as it's just a lot less busy there.",1,0,2

I am in love with the conservatory, and I can still be sucked into a good fountain show. I always drag visitors to see the chocolate fountain, and O is my favorite Cirque show without question. If there were some disaster and I had to be trapped here, I would have no complaints. I would eat crepes, drink smoothies, and occasionally splurge for a meal at Sensi. Then, I would retire to my room. 

I have few complaints about the rooms. Everything is always fresh, and the curtains are motorized. Granted, the TV is a little low tech, and there is no TV in the bathroom. But, those are minor details.

The room we stayed in was spacious and very, very clean. The furnishings had a modern touch. Bellagio staff were ALL professional, wonderful and friendly. The valet staff were fast and efficient. You can even call from your room to get your car ready. 

Everytime I call the front desk, housekeeping, concierge and valet. Whoever receives my call always acknowledge my name...""Good morning, Ms._____, how can I help you?"" They always made sure they are polite when they answer my call. AWESOME! FABULOUS! AWESOME!

I do agree with the other Yelpers about the housekeeping staff. They do a very good job ALL THE TIME. They clean our room twice a day and they always do a fabulous job! The bedsheets and pillows were so comfortable to sleep on.  I made sure to leave the housekeeper a tip everyday.

One night I wanted to use the bath tub but there were no bubble bath soap around so I called the houseekeeping office and I spoke to a lady staff, she told me that she'll send me some bath salt. After 10 minutes, a housekeeping staff brought me a little bag of toiletries, including bath salts for my bath. AWESOME!

Bellagio fountains were amazing to watch. I don't get tired watching it everynight.

Cirque de Soleil ""O"" was a must see show!

Checking in and out was very easy, they have a huge front desk to easily accomodate everyone. You can even check out from your room via the TV. But I chose to check out in the front desk because I wanted to have a receipt.

Slippers were also complimentary!  Yehey!!!

Bellagio is definitely one of the most beautiful hotel I had stayed in the Las Vegas strip!

-Check-in : was kinda confusing. There are no formed line of any sorts. Just look for who ever is gonna be done and line up behind them. 

-Rooms:
Ask for a newly renovated room. I think the smaller non-lake view rooms have been updated. New rooms have big flat screen TVs, powered blinds, big soaking tubs, and turn down service. Don't touch the alcohol or snacks u will be charged. 

-Restaurants- theres a coffee joint a short walkaway from the elevator, a chocolate\/ ice cream shop, a steak house,  sports bar etc etc... you basically never have to leave if your rollin in cash. Unlike me there r  some cheap places across the street. 

- The free Internet kinda sucks. My iphone almost never got online.  

- The location is great. As of right meow it's in the middle of the strip. Ur gonna like that when walking up and down the street.

Location - Perfect location. It's located right in the middle of the strip that it's so convenient when you have reservations and shows throughout the strip. 

Service - Excellent. Concierge. Front desk. Cafes. Shops. Restaurants. All excellent services.

Amenities - Wifi was decent speed. Not the fastest. Rooms are stocked with essentials, such as iron & board, blow dryer, refrigerator (snacks at additional cost), and shower essentials. Now the shampoo and body wash are of descent quality, but I think they can spend a little bit more. After all, this is the Bellagio. 

Atrium - Their décor changes throughout the seasons. They had the spectacular Chinese New Years décor during my recent visit with the elaborate figurines, flowers, lanterns, music, and everything was breathtaking. If my mama was there, she would have loved it and spent nights just mesmerizing over the designs and beauty.

Though expensive, it was worth every penny.  We even paid extra to secure a room facing the fountains (highly recommended).  Our room on the tenth floor was very spacious and elegant, with one of the comfiest hotel beds I've ever slept on.  And the bathroom?  Exquisite.  With a glass standup shower and a deep soaking tub, my husband and I felt like we were living in luxury.

Other furniture in the room included a large TV unit with built-in closets, a desk and chair, and two comfy arm chairs with a small table and lamp.  Upon arriving our first night at 1AM, we were pleasantly surprised to find a little chocolate on each of our pillows - a nice touch, especially after a long day of travel.  

Cleaning services were spot on, and we returned to our room each day with fresh linens and a tidy room.  And at night, we could watch the fountain shows from the comfort of our room.

The pool area was absolutely gorgeous, but unfortunately closed at the early hour of 6PM, so we never had the opportunity to enjoy it.

Its location relative to all the other hotels is practically right in the middle of The Strip, making foot travel very easy.  We had no trouble getting around to see many of the other hotels, from Mandalay Bay all the way up to Treasure Island.  Traffic is congested though, so if you are renting a car it's best to navigate via the side streets.

The hospitality here was on-point and the rooms are very beautiful. There's no wonder the check-in line was so long!

We stayed in the Spa Tower (King Suite). See my pictures for a better depiction! The suite was spacious (MUCH more spacious than the tiny suite at MGM) with a jet tub and a beautiful stand-up shower with his and her sinks. Unfortunately, they ran out of suites when a fountain view so we only had a view of the Rio and Palms casino. I guess you can't win them all. They check your key card before you can use the guest elevators, which I really liked to prevent rowdy people who aren't guests from coming in. That was an issue for us at the MGM... I'll write about that later...

Anyway, we came home from dinner with a bunch of leftovers on our last night. We were having so much fun that we had forgotten to request a refrigerator until 11:30pm... oops! But not to worry, Bellagio was great and sent one over within 10 minutes. We also went to the Fitness Center (which is located in the Spa Salon (there are no signs so it's easy to miss!).

Here is the reason for the one star:
On our last day we went down to the pool for lunch. We all left our belongings on our pool chairs while swimming, got out to order food, eat and went back swimming again. I noticed that the pair of shorts I had worn down were missing very soon after the waitress cleared our tables while we were in the pool. I had seen them last when I sat down on the chair to post some stuff to instagram, then got back in the pool after. 

When we were preparing to leave they were gone. I approached the waitress and asked if she had seen them anywhere, and she was immediately very defensive saying ""I didn't see anything."" And ""I stopped working that section at 3."" I posted at around 4:45, before she cleared our table, and my shorts were still there. I stayed at the pool and watched her continue to serve the same section we were in. I did not ask her in an accusatory manner at all and her squirrelly ""cannot confirm or deny"" attitude, and the way she was so ready with an alibi,  was what rose my suspicions that she must have taken them. I mean, why would someone who can afford to stay at this hotel be stealing random pairs of shorts off other guests chairs??? They most definitely didn't disappear into thin air. All fingers pointed to her no other explanation made sense.

Bellagio, your very short, Asian waitress with acne on her cheeks who was working the right side of the pool around 3-5pm on Sunday June 19th, 2017 is a lying THIEF.

I rented a fabulous room with a gorgeous fountain view for a getaway. The room was clean, gorgeous bathroom, flawless views! The bed was amazing! I booked the room in my name and used my California issued state I.D. instead of my passport as I'm not leaving the country. I checked in, everything went smoothly and then proceeded to get a players club card as I was going to do the majority of my gambling in this casino. The cocktail waitresses were fantastic at first, very attentive and friendly especially since I was a good tipper they came around more. 

After a few days of fabulous gambling and drinking and attending their buffet countless times I ran into an African American cocktail waitress named ""Toia."" I tried to wave her down for a cocktail several times, she noticed me and clearly ignored me. She finally came and asked me for a drink, I asked for my usual Grey Goose & Cranberry. She looked at my id, came back several minutes later with my spouses drink but refused to give me one. Toia said her Manager wouldn't allow her to serve me liquor because of my state issued ID! That's ridiculous! How many New Yorkers come to the Bellagio who obviously don't drive and how many of those New Yorkers do they deny cocktail service to? I was infuriated. I tried to remain calm but that woman was being a BITCH excuse my French. She slandered me and called me ridiculous at the same time because I demanded to speak to her manager. I waited an HOUR for a manager. Absolutely ridiculous! I stormed to the front desk and demanded to speak to higher management. 

Jill from Management a redhead who resembled Cruella Deville approached 20 minutes later. I told her the scenario and exactly what happened, she said that they can't serve me drinks because of my state issued ID that they don't accept. But she said they will gladly take my passport which was upstairs. I said how come I was allowed to check into the hotel and get a players club card then?! Jill said that they shouldn't have given me one, they want me to gamble but they don't want to serve me alcohol?! Ridiculous! Every bartender in that entire establishment before that incident had no problem serving me drinks! I was infuriated, threatened to check out to the 4 seasons or Caesars Palace and she gasped for me to stay! She said she would do some ""research"" got my number and would contact me. I went upstairs to shower then and leave the hotel. She called briefly apologizing saying that since the Bellagio has opened up they have accepted state issued ID's. She claimed Toia was being reprimanded for her clearly unprofessional behavior. She offered us two free drinks at their bar, is this a joke?! I'm at a five star hotel, get disrespected by two different managers and a cocktail waitress?! Absolutely ludicrous! The next two days I felt blacklisted by the cocktail waitresses. I spent so much money gambling and every cocktail waitress I tried to flag down they refused to come near me but had no problem giving cocktails to everyone around me like they were well aware of the situation that happened earlier 2 days ago. It's the Bellagio's loss because the rest of my stay I strictly gambled everywhere else along the strip mostly at The Venetian. My last day I was finally served liquor and I explained to the cocktail waitress what happened, she said she was aware and apologized on behalf of the staff. The entire situation was a complete joke, I doubt I will return if I'm being treated like a second class citizen.",2,1,0

I like that they have Casino War (one of the very very few casinos in Vegas that has this). Yes, that's the game that we used to play as kids where we basically have to have a bigger card than the dealer and if you and the dealer get the same card, then you go to ""war."" During the day time it's $5 per hand, but later in the afternoon and on to the night, it goes up to $10.

Wel, I recently stayed here for a weekend trip. The only reason we picked this place instead of the usual Wynn was because we got our room comped. Ok room, but Im more impressed with the Wynn suite. And eventho our room was deemed non smoking, it really smelled like smoke. 

I dont understand why people love the Bellagio buffet, but both times Ive ever eaten there, Ive gotten sick. And its average buffet fare. Bleh. 

They have a very small collection of shops, tho high end. The Bf managed to spend over $3k at Armani since he didnt look at the price tags for just 2 items. I was a little pissed but the clothes were beautiful and understated. None of the shops appealed to me so I had to walk over to Forum Shops at Caesars. 

Now for why you come to Vegas, the gambling. I only really play 2 games, Blackjack and Craps. Surprisingly, they had very affordable tables. Tons of $10 min at BJ and $10 min at Craps. My fav is Carl, a dealer at the craps table. I didnt like the dealers as much as the Wynn dealers, but they were still great. 

Would I come back to the Bellagio? Sure, since they have a bigger suite selection here than the Wynn, and if you go on off season or weekdays, their suites can be very affordable too. However, I still prefer the Wynn experience as its smaller, less crowded and less tourists there.",1,0,1

The hotel is spectacular and immaculate. Everything here from floor to ceiling was designed with great care and luxurious materials. The hotel is so large it does take some time to navigate back and forth to and fro from casino, parking, front desk, shops, etc. we got a king sized bed room in the spa tower. The room was very large, probably ~600 sq ft. Bathroom had a shower area and a tub with dual sinks. Room has a large led Samsung tv with very refined high end everything ( desk, sofa chairs, and linens - linens are very soft and comfy). Room has a bunch of snacks and drinks, and a locked mini fridge (not complimentary)

While the hotel itself, it's location (middle of the busiest intersection on the strip), and it's grandness was amazing, the service was definitely sub par. This was the biggest disappointment because I've been looking forward to staying here for awhile. My story begins with the front desk, we were given a room after we checked in late on Friday near 7pm. The place was bristling with people but they checked us in quickly. However when we finally trekked to our room, there was a couple in that entered the room with luggage literally RIGHT in front of us in the hallway.... We didn't want to make the trek back to the lobby since it was far away so we called the Desk with the phones along the floor. They put us on hold for 3 to 5 minutes, which was frustrating considering we were pretty tired and saw how they can muck up assigning rooms to guests... They reassigned us to another room on a different floor and said our cards would work in the new room. So we again trekked to the other floor we were assigned, and Lo and behold, only one key worked......at least one worked, and we were able to get in... 

After we got settled we went back to the lobby and told them one of he keys didn't work and we told them what happened..... With no apologies, the lady who was helping us said.....this isn't supposed to be your room..... We were getting very frustrated now...because we weren't going to move or change rooms again...this was getting ridiculous.... After another 5 minutes she took our old cards and issued us new cards and said it should be fine now..... Without apologizing for any inconvenience. 

Now fast forward to check out day, we didn't have change to give to our cleaning person so wanted to break change. The gift shop next to the elevators in spa tower just said no without reason and told me to go to the casino for any change..... 

Additionally multiple times I was stopped and asked for my room card going up to the guest elevators (sometimes with and without luggage and singled out amongst other guests)

For $300-$400 per night stay... its dissapointing to be treated like second class citizens and discriminated upon.

And let me be honest, the Oceans Eleven movie and fountains had a huge part in me wanting to stay here.  So my mom and I stayed for 6 nights, in a room high up overlooking the fountains.  First off, the view is absolutely amazing.  Watching the fountains anytime I wanted out the window was a major highlight.  The room itself (2 double beds) was nice and clean and well-maintained.  The bathroom had a very nice shower and tub, and was very spacious.  The TV was mounted on the wall, and great to view from both beds.  The hotel cleaning staff was great - they will come in anytime (from afternoon to evening) - which I thought was pretty nice.  Sometimes they would leave chocolate on our bed stand, but not consistently.  Within the hotel, my only complaint was there isn't a Starbucks - but honestly they have a coffee\/pastry shop that does the shop in a pinch (just very expensive!!!).  The staff overall is extremely nice and goes out of their way to take care of you.  The casino is kept very clean, and the hotel restaurants are good (ate at the cafe, Prime, and the buffet for breakfast).  I would say this is a hotel for classy adults who don't like the loud\/crazy\/modern atmospheres of some of the other hotels.

The only sort of negative (which really isn't even a big deal) is that check in time is late, so if you arrive early you are not going to get into your room anytime soon.  However, they will kindly store your luggage and bring it up to your room promptly.  If you stay here, you are within walking distance of Aria, Cosmopolitan, PH, Caesars, Paris, and probably more - but my mom and I are not walkers (and it was 100 out!) so we taxi'd most places.  This hotel is also nice because you never have to wait for taxi's like at other hotels (there is always one waiting!).

The casino is pretty nice.  Lots of bill break machines so you can get ones and fives for all the tipping you have to do in Vegas.

I did have a problem with the ice machine one night.  I ran into a guy in the hallway and he said he would bring me a bucket of ice.  He did, but he brought me ice in a rusty champagne bucket.  I wanted to chilled my beverage, not my bottle of Dom so I didn't really want to use that ice.  I have no idea if they clean those buckets.  Also, the checkin and checkout desk is kind of a free for all.  And they kind of rip you off in the store.  A liter bottle of water was $4.

Of course, The Bellagio is also home to the famous Fountains of Bellagio, where you could watch carefully coordinated and choreographed fountains dance to a variety of songs; for additional details on the fountains, see the review I wrote. Other attractions include Cirque du Soleil and the Botanical Gardens (which can get a bit crowded during summer).

With a beautiful exterior is an elegant and immaculate interior. Aside from the lobby, Via Bellagio deserves some love, too! This walkway is home to a variety of upscale boutiques, a restaurant, and is an alternative path to The Bellagio's awesome casino. From Louis Vuitton, Prada and Fendi to Harry Winston, Dior, and Breguet, you have a great selection of stores mere minutes away from your room. Speaking of the casino, it is also my favorite for a few reasons: It's huge compared to others in the area, it's organized, and there is a much larger selection of games compared to other hotels. By the way, the buffet entrance is inside the casino; see my review for the Buffet at The Bellagio for additional details.

Lastly, the staff in all areas of the property are super friendly. For instance, I had an issue with my MLife card not being accepted at any of the machines I was on, but it was resolved after speaking with a couple of representatives at the MLife counter. Should I return to Vegas in the coming months, I'm definitely checking in at The Bellagio.",4,0,1

Bellagio is now just a middle of the pack Las Vegas hotel. Check in\/out is most always crowded and often disorganized.  The worst is Fridays when the lines can be six people deep all the way across the hotel check-in area.

Although the hotel recently renovated its rooms, they still fail to dazzle. During my stay, the bathroom sink constantly made a drain noise although the faucet was not turned on. This can be disturbing if you're a light sleeper. Also, surprisingly for a hotel with such a high room rate, the shower knob simply fell off as I lightly turned the water temperature up. In addition, cable TV kept going black or picture scrambled despite maintenance trying to fix two days in a row. You expect better from the Bellagio name - disappointed.

Also, the hotel's buffet restaurant has a wait most nights of 35 minutes to an hour (this according to the person who answered the restaurant's phone when I called after seeing the line reaching out into the casino floor). Obviously, the hotel should spend some of its money and expand the buffet restaurant to shorten wait times for hungry guests. 

The casino looks like all the other middle of the pack dark looking casinos. The Bellagio can no longer be mentioned in the same class as Encore, Palazzo, or Venetian. These casinos are well lit, accommodations are first-class, and food options are plenty. Bellagio, sad to say, is an old jewel.

Bellagio is simply elegant. There are great selection of table games, slot machines to race and sports book. But imo, this casino is good for high rollers for their high-stakes table. For cheaper game play I would go elsewhere. This casino also hosts the World Poker Tour, among other tournaments.

The hotel is centrally located and close to activities and restaurants.

To book a room here, the best time for a deal is during the weekdays and right after Holidays.

4: The air condition is not over-powering like in other places: i.e you can be in there awhile and not get cold from it.

After standing in the middle of the road (not the best place to be) for 3 min we dragged all the luggage inside the hotel.  That's where we were told that we have to go back outside as the bell desk on the inside cannot take care of luggage, but only the bell desk outside has those magical powers.  REALLY???  Ok, after 10 min we finally got rid of our luggage.  No one so much as even muttered a simple ""sorry for inconvenience"".  
Service at check-in:  After the check in we were provided with the hotel map and directions to our rooms.  It was only after we went all the way to the 16th floor that we realized this could not have been the right place.

Room cleanliness:  Where do I begin???  I posted some pictures, as it is difficult to believe that one may find soap scum, hair, clogged shower and dirty sinks at Bellagio.  Well, unfortunately we found all of it.  At this point we were so tired that we did not care to move to any other room, especially that we were sure we'd find the same conditions everywhere.  We were provided with a discount for the inconvenience.  The worst part?  The shower and bath looked the same next day.  REALLY???

My last 4 trips to Vegas I have booked only Mlife Casinos.  Recently, on our way back from Los Angeles, my fiancee wanted to stop by Vegas as a spontaneous trip.  We both were excited as we figured a day in Vegas was just what we needed before getting back to the humdrum of working life. 

 We were undecided on the duration as well as where we would stay, but due to my insistence, we both agreed that it would be a Mlife Hotel.  We were having fun stopping by various casinos and hotels and gambling, when I suggested we head over to the Bellagio, hoping for another run in with Lady Luck. 

We perused the tables this time around, and was fascinated by the Big 6 table, where the dealer (Elisabeth) was so friendly in explaining the rules of the game to us.  We started playing and having fun deciding what to bet, etc.  Right around the 20 minute mark, my fiancee was itching for a drink in his hands and spotted the waitress working the tables in our area.  He tried to flag her down, but she waved him off like he was an annoyance.  She haughtily told him that she would come back in a moment to take his order.  That was the first buzzkill.  We figured she was just busy and she would come back as promised, and since we were having so much fun on the Big 6 table with Elisabeth, we decided to stick around and see if she would come back. 

About 15 minutes later, she did come back around dropping off drinks to the table next to us.  After that, she went around the Big 6 table, and IGNORED my fiancee.  He said she made eye contact with him and shuffled quickly away before he could flag her down.  About this time, there was a dealer change from Elisabeth to Tripat.  Tripat was very gracious and could see we were extremely bothered by this waitress who refused to serve my fiancee for no reason.  He reassured that the next time she came around he would flag her down for us.  So we decided to stick around.  

Having spent a good 45 minutes at this point at the Big 6 table, and running through all our cash on hand, I got up to get more cash at the ATM.  I flagged down another waitress working another area to ask her if she could let the waitress working our area to come by the Big 6 table for my fiancee's drink order.  She not only cut me off mid sentence, she pointedly told me, ""I just saw her at that table.  She just went to that table.  I just saw her go to that table.""  Speechless, I could only mutter, ""Oh, okay. Thanks.""  When I went back to my fiancee and asked, he told me no, the waitress NEVER went by our table.  At this point, our experience had gone horribly sour and we left after 10 minutes from when I got money out of the ATM.

Tripat was very nice and apologized profusely.  He explained that the other waitress didn't work the Big 6 table, but in my opinion, I didn't ask her to come service my fiancee, so what the heck was up with her brusque and dismissive reply?  Is this the example of service at the Bellagio?  At the Big 6 Table alone, my fiancee spent around $200.  With that kind of money, we could have just gone to the local CVS, bought top shelf liquor and gotten better service.  Heck, I had just gotten another $200 out of the ATM and would've probably spent it at that Big 6 table!!

We go every year to Vegas for my fiancee's birthday, and this year, I was considering heavily the Bellagio for our stay.  After this, my opinion of the Bellagio has been heavily impacted, and definitely will overlook if for other hotels on the strip.

So just a word of advice.  It's the little things that count, and just because the dude and gal looks like they had come off of the streets in a t-shirt and shorts, we still spend money and spend lots.

It was ridiculous to say the least. Finally when I got to the front, the lady tells me there's no ride to the airport - supposedly they thought it was tomorrow. At least they accommodated my request to not have to stand in the taxi line and let us get the next cab to the airport. They really need to work on caring about their guests when they leave as this experience has confirmed for me that we're not staying at the Bellagio the next time we go to Vegas as there are lots of other hotels.",0,0,0

Since watching ""Ocean's Eleven"" as a kid, I remember dreaming of staying at the Bellagio someday - in large part because I wanted to walk around and utter that cheesy Andy Garcia line - ""In my hotels, there's always somebody watching"" - to anybody that would listen.

We got a really killer deal on our mid-August stay - thanks in part to the GF's discount through AAA. In comparison to other standard room rates that we had been scouting out (Wynn, Cosmo, etc.), the Bellagio offered the best bang-for-the-buck. 

Unfortunately, due to some awful traffic on the way into Vegas (go figure, it was a Friday), we didn't arrive at the Bellagio until around 9 PM. Surprisingly, the check-in desk was still completely slammed with people - but it's a ton of fun to people watch! The lady and I had a ton of fun seeing who could count more Rolexes and Cartier LOVE Bracelets among the crowd of folks trying to check-in.

We were given a room on the fifth floor of the Spa Tower, on the non-fountain side. I'm not sure if the floor really matters when you're on the side of the hotel that isn't facing the Strip; perhaps this was a slight on the hotel's part (due possibly to how young my girlfriend and I look\/are), but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

The room itself oozed sex appeal and a sense of contemporary edginess. Being that I never got the chance to stay at the Bellagio prior to its big renovation, I can't comment on how much of an upgrade this facelift provided. What I can say is that the room's beautiful indigo trim and wood furnishings gave off a very ""new school Vegas"" feel. The free wifi, - which was very reliable and lag-free - was also an excellent touch. The wall-mounted flat screen was surprisingly large for a standard room, and families will be happy to know that the setup accommodates video game systems. The real star of the show, of course, was the much-hyped Bellagio bed. While I won't delve into details, I'll point out that I had little trouble getting a good night's sleep on this fluffy cloud of a bed - no matter what state I was in!

All this being said, there were little things about the room that detracted from these otherwise-perfect accommodations. The glass door to our shower didn't close all the way; its rubber hinge seemed to get caught in the marble doorframe. As a result, tiny puddles of water would start to accumulate outside the shower if we forgot to place on the ground. 

Also, it's a shame that standard Bellagio resort rooms are equipped with such spacious mini-fridges\/freezers - yet these same fridges provide no extra space for guests' food\/drinks (because they're filled to the brim with minibar items). Thus, this creates some problems if you're bringing home leftovers from a meal. It sorta felt as through the drive to make a profit seemed to supersede a potential opportunity to offer guests a welcome - and very practical - accommodation. I'm not sure if this is standard practice on the Strip, but I was nonetheless surprised.

Between going out to Hakkasan within an hour of arriving in Vegas and making two visits to Marquee (Dayclub & Nightclub) the following day, my girlfriend and I knew that we'd need to stay somewhere where we could take a break from the action. Thankfully, Bellagio provided that welcome sense of cleanliness and serenity that we had been hoping for. In spite of the fact that the hotel's clientele was (on average) about a generation older than my GF and I, I seldom felt as though we were out of place at Bellagio. In fact, it was kind of refreshing being able to make our way back to the hotel after a long night of clubbing and have an empty Conservatory to drunkenly wander through. 

(^ I'd highly recommend giving that a try, by the way; a walk through a tourist-free Conservatory is breathtakingly serene, and a visit during peak hours does not compare in any way whatsoever.)

Where the hotel really won me over was with the little customer service touches that made our stay so memorable. From chatting about my last trip ""back home"" with a fellow Filipino who delivered our bags to our hotel room, to being greeted with a big smile from the Newsstand (general store) clerk on the three separate times that we ventured into her shop to buy chasers, I never felt that ""cooler-than-you"" attitude that I sometimes encounter when indulging in the finer things. I appreciated the staff's down-to-earth attitude and consistent cheer. Hell, even from the guards manning the elevator lobby greeted us with a smile and a pleasant ""good morning"" towards the end of our trek back from Hakkasan.

In spite of the fact that we stayed in a standard room, my girlfriend and I felt very much at home in the Bellagio. Once we finally manage to recover from the financial gut-punch of our past Vegas weekend, we'll set our sights on our next trip - and chances are likely that the Bellagio will be playing a major role!",2,0,0

What I love most about the hotel is the consistency and quality of the interior & exterior design.

The check in process was flawless and the receptionist took her time to explain where everything is situated and what to expect from restaurants we inquired about. While we stayed there we had dinner at Lago and we didn't regret it. Gladis, our housekeeper was really nice to us and made sure there was nothing missing the entire time we were there. The concierge staff are very friendly and helped us out with the printing of our ""O"" & KÀ tickets. Both shows are TOTALLY worth it!

Our room was situated on the 23rd floor with a fountain view and it was astonishing, they did not spare any expense. We had a really big window and we enjoyed the fountains countless times. It's a totally different experience from being down with the crowd (the song is played on the Bellagio Fountains TV channel). The king bed was very comfortable. The climate controls in the room work incredibly well. A really nice touch is that all the TV ports are easily accessible and we were able to easily hook up our laptop to play music and watch some movies. You could potentially bring your Apple TV, Chromecast or Amazon Fire TV Stick. Having a room fountain view is totally worth it.

If I were to change anything, it would be the mini bar charging system. On our first day I opened it just to see what it had to offer. I saw a very nice looking bottle of coke and I picked it up just to see it and immediately put it back. I suspect the fridge is weighing each slot because it automatically charged it to my room. The receptionist handling the checkout waived the fee since I did not enjoy the beverage, so no problem there. I work in tech and I understand the need for automatization but if not done right it may be unpleasant for certain customers. It was easy for me to realize the mistake because I decided not to charge anything to my room.
Please consider this.

Thank you very much for your service! I will be booking again the next time I'm in Vegas.",0,0,0

If the Bellagio weren't in Las Vegas, or if it didn't position itself as a luxury hotel, I would definitely give it more stars.  However, precisely because the hype raised my expectations, I was a little disappointed.

Check-in was pleasant.  The lobby is certainly a knockout!  However, I can't understand why they have a separate line for each check-in clerk, instead of a single line.  It's well-known that separate lines cause more anxiety and make people feel resentful when someone who arrived after them is helped first.

The room was attractive and comfortable.  However, just two weeks earlier, I stayed in a DoubleTree, and the room at the Bellagio was not much better; in fact, in some ways, it was worse:  (1)  There was no place near the desk to plug in a laptop.  Yes, there was one outlet with two plugs, but they were already taken up by the wifi and a lamp.  (2)  The lighting was dim, with a particularly dark spot between the bed and the TV.  (3) The bed at the DoubleTree was softer.  (4)  My bed sloped slightly; the upper right corner was noticeably lower than the rest.  (5) There was Kleenex only in the bathroom, and it was cheap, undersized, and rough.  (6)  I couldn't reset the time on the alarm clock, which was running 53 minutes slow throughout my stay.

The extra-deep bathtub was wonderful, though.  And the shower was attractive and larger than in the ordinary hotel (though I've had larger showers in Las Vegas).

The water show is fun and over-the-top.  But, of course, you don't have to be staying at the Bellagio to watch it.

All told, I'm glad I gave the Bellagio a try, and I definitely did enjoy the experience, but I think you could do better in Las Vegas for the same price.",2,0,0

They seem to be trying to cure the long checkin line problem, and now have lines for people to stand, and an online check-in.  Much improved since 2014 of my last review.  I used the online check-in, and it was quick and painless. They send you an email early on your arrival day, you pick up your keys, then send you a text message when your room is ready and the room number.  I will note there were still very long lines anytime after 11am every time I walked by.  

Here is a tip - AVOID the premium fountain view rooms from the main tower because of the loud music and DJ from the Paris hotel\/Chateau nightclub (outdoor club).  You can hear the driving bass and screaming DJ thumping loudly in your room. Its not like a little noise in the distance, this is bass you can still feel.  The DJ yells through every song trying to hype up the crowd.  And this goes on to exactly 4AM every night the club is open.  Google this if you dont believe, its well documented on other sites.  I'm surprised MGM\/Bellagio management has not taken this to court to have them remove those outdoor speakers and DJ facing Bellagio.  

Another tip - avoid rooms with connecting doors.  The doors do not block out any noise and you can hear conversations and TV from the next room over.  I had a very loud group next to me that would scream and argue every night around 4am, so I know their life story now.  

By the way, I'm used to noise (live in south beach) and not an old geaser, but after about 3am i think it should be relatively quiet and not have to hear this.  Or in the case of nightclub, wait each night to 4am before I could fall asleep.  

Last tip - for Bellagio management or MGM ownership.   Its time to build some sort of food court area.  I know its the Bellagio, but so many of the restaurants dont open until 5pm, and most are super premium anyways.   My 2nd favorite hotel is the Venetian, and they have a nice, premium food court area right off the casino floor..  Its perfect to break away from gambling quickly, or to grab a quick bite before heading out for the day.    My suggestion - close down Fix and put it right there.  It appears to be the only restaurant at Bellagio below a 4 star yelp rating and its been there long enough.  Plus the food court would make money all day long, while Fix is just a few hours.  My friends and I usually end up walking to Planet Hollywood or Caesars for quick bites.  (Btw, i know you just opened Snacks, but it is far too small, was always a long line, and not enough room to sit).   

Oh and one more quirk - not a fan of the non-branded toiletries.  I like seeing luxury brands because I usually end up liking them, so I go buy them after my trip.  I liked the Lanovera shampoo, but see I can't buy it because its a non brand type of thing.   

My updated review has gone long enough, so here are some final few tips:
1. Yellowtail restaurant is still amazing.  Wait for the view.  Wow. 
2. Housekeeping people are so friendly and always in the hallways if needed. Great job. 
3. The spa is great, Ive done several different treatments here, always impressed. 
4. The Conservatory is just simply amazing. I love this feature and how its always updated. 
5. Love that MLife card gives you 10% discount in the shops (particularly for buying snacks).

Part of the reason I stay at Bellagio is the pool . . . I love to swim.  I went out to the pool area and looked around.  Almost tranquil.  I started wondering why they needed to close this area due to the slight wind.  If they close it under these conditions, it will be closed 2-3 months of the year.

I voiced my concerns and management offered free breakfasts. What a shocker.  Something not right with our place?  Here, feed your face some more.  

On the plus side, Bellagio is well-appointed throughout, as long as you don't focus too long on certain plastic-tinged areas.  Buffets are still among the best on the strip.",2,4,3

The room and bathroom are big and comfortable enough even if you want to spend the whole day in the room.

No defined lines or queue, you end up lining up to whichever front desk person you'd like. There's also no special line for M Life Gold, platinum or nior members! You can imagine my frustration when the line that we pick is going much slower than others so we end up waiting longer than some people who have just walked up! We also didn't get any room upgrades with our m life status, which was ok since I didn't mind a standard room facing the parking area. But what's the point of this status system anyway?

Next the room we got was HOT. The temperature of the room when we got in was 78 degrees. Ugh! We immediately went to turn it down. However later realized the AC system was broken and the temp was not lowering. The maintenance guy was very nice and helped us solve the issue. However this just wasn't a good start to the bellagio experience. I was hoping for much more. Also note that the rooms facing the parking area face the sun when the sun is setting which can quickly heat up your room!

The room is nice and clean. Large bathroom with tub and separate shower. It's unfortunate they haven't updated their nightstand area to include outlets or USB charging hubs. (UPDATE: There is one outlet at the bottom of the lamps next to the bed!) Nothing very special about the rooms but at least the bed is comfortable and people aren't too noisy in the hallways. I think there are plenty of other hotel options that can provide the same if not better quality and experience for the price. 

Definitely agree with some of the other reviews. You don't need to stay here,but definitely visit and check out the restaurants like Michael mind and the garden area which is always updated for each holiday and season.

Last note - for ATT phones\/customers, I had terrible reception throughout the hotel and especially in the hotel room. Luckily there's free wifi for hotel guests.",2,0,0

My husband and I love gambling here so we decided to stay here instead of our usual rooms Wynn or Palms. Another great thing about Bellagio is the location! Right in the middle of the strip. 

The rooms were a great size.. we just stayed in a standard room? Not sure what it's called. Bathrooms were perfect with separate tub and shower. We had a great view of the water show and we didn't even ask. Housekeeping was on top of it. I requested extra towels and they left me more than enough. I also got laundry service and it was on time and well done. The pool was beautiful. It was only about 60-65 out so I didn't get in, but I did get to relax and read a book by the pool which was wonderful. 

Every morning I got a coffee and brioche from the Jean Philippe Cafe. The coffee and pastries are TO DIE FOR! So good.

Of the ""older"" Vegas establishments, the Bellagio is by far the nicest. The paint may be a bit stale, but the fresh flower displays make up for it. I love the themes for the seasons. If you're in town, do not miss the arboretum. I had the fortune of seeing it installed and it really tied the impressiveness together.

Thank goodness the amazing company I work for fronted the bill bc I never would have been able to afford this opulence.

My room was great. Plenty of modern amenities (iPod dock, power curtains bed side and a mini fridge). The bathroom had lovely freebies but the water smelled like rusty pipes. Yuck! 

The front desk messed up my bill with some bogus charges but they were kind enough to fix them on the spot. I thought it was also kinda weird that I had to walk through the busiest part of the casino to get to the gym...

What fascinated me most was the glass sculpture on the ceiling at the check in area. Every time that I'm here, I have to stop by and glance at it. It's a chandelier called Fiori Di Como by Dale Chihuly. This piece is comprised of 2,000 hand-blown glass blossoms of various colors. It's just stunning.

Another showstopper that sets the Bellagio apart from other hotels is their botanical garden. It's in the front, right before the entrance to the hotel. They have a theme for every season. I was there in October, so they did a fall\/Halloween theme. They had a talking tree and scarecrows. It was the cutest. 

The most popular reason that people flock to the Bellagio is for the famous Bellagio Fountains. It starts at 3pm and runs until midnight, with a show every half hour.  It's a watershow that is synced with accompanying music. It's amazing to watch. It's as if the water is dancing. It forms shapes and goes in circles, then it sprouts high into the sky. It's even prettier at night with the added lights.",11,6,8

I have never seen as much guest traffic through a hotel in my life till I came here, but that did not matter because this hotels is HUGE with large lobbies and large walk ways to get anywhere you would like in this hotel. 

Pros: 
- great service 
- decent size room with an ok view, which was on a non smoking wing. I didn't have a fountain view nor a pool view but it was still nice. 
- house keeping reacted quick to any needs 
- walls in the rooms are thick where we did not even hear a peep of our neighbors. Yes the rooms were booked!! 
- Great restaurants, you must check out Jean Philippe 
- good service at the pools. On the weekend get your spot no later than 9am, trust me. It packs out fast!!! 
- friendly dealers at the tables 
- Good bars to hang out at, check out the Fontana bar at night, great place to have a drink while watching the fountain shows. 
- ventilation through casino floor was good, even through people were smoking it did not smell like it. 
- waitress service at the tables were fast. 

Cons: 
- shower not too quiet, can hear the water flowing to the shower through the main room 
- in order to get comp points on the players card you must bet a min of $25 
- rooms are pretty expensive and the latest to check out is 1pm.

The only one in the room is the mini-bar that is entirely full with drinks. I hope the hotel reconsiders this choice. 

On the plus side, the rooms are large and well appointed. Also, the toiletries provided are plentiful and of good quality. No need to worry if you forgot to pack something. 

Room service was great. After a long day of walking around and seeing the sights, room service did a great job with the quality of the food and its presentation. 

As expected, the casino features high minimum bets and disadvantageous rules. For example, most blackjack tables are a $15 minimum with continuous shuffle machines that pay 6:5 for a blackjack.

Let me first start off saying that I've spent many many of my vegas trips at the Bellagio, spent  money on many meals and gambled an obscene amount of money there throughout the past 10 years. 

Never in my life have I been treated badly there up until this last past weekend. I guess if you're a single woman gambling around midnight by yourself they put you in the category as doing something ""illegal"" 

I'm minding my own business after a nice dinner with a friend I decided to hit the slot machines before I headed back to my hotel. I won a few hundred dollars cashed it in and as I went to leave the cash machine I was stopped by two police officers who flash their badge at me and asked to see my ID. I replied OK Do I not look old enough to gamble? He replied with yes. So I get my wallet out I have about $1000 in my wallet after all I am vacationing in Las Vegas and he makes the comment ""you sure do have a lot of money in your wallet"" first of all what are you doing looking in my wallet? I get my ID out and show it to them ( there was 2 undercover cops) I'm clearly of age to gamble he doesn't give it back to me he calls it over the radio and asks me ""have I ever been in trouble at a casino"" I replied with a simple no a little bit confuse cause I'm not sure what he was getting at. He then asked if I was staying at the hotel I said no I was having dinner with a friend and gambling. Do I have to stay at your hotel in order to gamble here? Knowing that I don't have to. He hands me back my ID and says ""we have been having troubles with IDs"" 

This was all a bunch of bullshit he assumed that I was a ""Vegas working girl""  I guess. I was pissed off and humiliated I will never give them a penny of my money again I will never gamble there I will never stay there I will never have dinner there.

We have stayed at a number of hotels on the strip: The Venetian, Palazzo, Aria, the Trump, etc... The one hotel we had not yet stayed at was the Bellagio... As it was for my birthday we decided to stay there because well... It's The Bellagio... It's supposed to be the epitome of luxury on the Las Vegas Strip.. As it is in the dead center... 
Upon check in, we were happily greeted and check in was very fast and painless.. We went to the room which was on the 17th floor.. The room was adequate, decent in size, and on the surface it looked nice... However, upon further exploration we found that one of the closet doors was unhinged at the top which causes them to rub together and not hang evenly... The lamination on the top of the night stand was peeling up, and the bathroom molding clearly needs to be redone and the bathtub and bath fixtures were also very clearly dated.. One of the light bulbs in the lamp was out and there was this absolutely horrendous high pitched like squealing sound.. OH and to top it off there was DRIED VOMIT underneath the toilet bowl... 
We first didn't even notice the vomit.. So, We called down to the front about the squeak where they proceeded to tell us they were going to send up security to check it out.. Which we were confused by... Once we noticed the vomit we immediately called down because that's just repulsive.. During this time we were getting ready to go out for the night and nobody had come up to our room for the squeaking sound nor the dried vomit... That was about a 45 minute period of time.. 
We then went out about 745 and got back around 130 in the morning... Upon our return the squeaking was still here and the vomit was as well. So, I called down to housekeeping where they sent someone up.. That took them about 25minutes to get to us... The man from housekeeping was very nice and after showing him he came in and began to try and clean the dried vomit off... He tried getting it off the toilet bowl he also mopped our floor twice and was here for about 15 minutes... The dried vomit did not come off the toilet, but I assume it's probably not easy to remove dried vomit that has been sitting on porcelain for an extended period of time...

All in all - we were underwhelmed and disappointed by our stay at The Bellagio.. The hotels lobby is still beautiful especially he blown glass ceiling.. However, this hotel definitely needs an update especially if they're trying to compete with other comparable hotels... At this price point you would NEVER expect to find problems like these in your room. 
We will probably stick with The Venetian from now on, unless The Bellagio decides to have a renovation..

The pool\/hot tubs are my favorite part of the Bellagio. The pool has a European feel, pretty chill vibe, its definitely not a party pool, and the drinks are high quality. They also have larger, nicer, comfy, cushioned lounge chairs you can reserve for only $25, if you're gonna spend a lot of time at the pool I think its totally worth it (also, the servers pay more attention to you)-notice though, that just because the chair says reserved, doesn't really mean its reserved, just that might be available to reserve, its worth it to ask a pool attendant.

This March I siezed the opportunity, thanks to an Expedia deal, and booked 2 nights at the Bellagio. I was sure that using an online booking service would mean that we would end up with a lousy room next to the elevators and overlooking the parking lot. I was so surprised when our room was located on one of the higher floors and had a wonderful view of the pool area. The room was lovely! Entryway with tile floors, huge bathroom with soaking tub and glass shower, large marble-topped vanity, plush beds, massive lighted armoire\/entertainment center, push-button blackout curtains. 

Check-in was swift and courteous. In fact, every staff member we encountered was nothing but pleasant and friendly to us. From the maintenance man who fixed our in-room safe (it just needed a replacement battery), to the valets and bellhops, to the random employee in the halls.

One tip, if you plan on having breakfast in the hotel, do the breakfast buffet.. it ends up being cheaper than the a-la-carte breakfast restaurant near the conservatory.

Also, the pool is definitely not kid-friendly. It is very quiet and 99% of guest sun-bathing and people watching. No jumping, and screaming etc in the pool. So if you have young kids, stay away from the Bellagio.",0,0,0

Their chocolate is also WORTH the money! I grew up in Hershey, PA - chocolate, capitol of America but Jean Philippe at Bellagio's dances circles around Hershey chocolate any day!

However, with the exception of one of the housekeepers and one of the buffet waitresses, every staff member we encountered was pretty bad.  First it was the waitress that was shocked to hear I liked my appetizer since she said it doesn't look like it would be that good.  Then the cocktail waitress that wouldn't get me a drink after I got up and moved to a slot machine about 3 feet away right before she showed up because it ""wasn't her section"".  We played for about 3 hours and my husband got 1 drink and I got 0 (he was still in the ""correct"" section when she showed up, and the other sections apparently had no waitresses).  Then we finally went to the bar to buy a drink and as I was about to put money in the video poker, a guy 2 seats down said his wife and son are sitting there and he was saving them.  The bartender just stared at us and didn't bother to ask if we wanted to order a drink or anything.  So we left there in search of somewhere we could just sit and have a drink (I was so frustrated by then with the lack of customer service anywhere in the hotel that I had to hold back tears).  We walked over to the sports book bar and finally got 2 drinks for $24 plus tip.  Never had to work that hard or pay that much for a drink in any other casino.  The final straw in our customer service nightmare was when we saw they were selling passes for $15 to cut in line at the buffet.  Really, Bellagio?  Oh, I forgot about the front desk staff that were too busy bitching about a bad guest that we stood there for about 20 seconds while waiting for them to finish their conversation before checking us in.

I would like to point out that I am low maintenance and super easy to please - all it takes is a smile to get good marks from me on customer service.  After our first night at the Bellagio, we pretty much avoided eating or gambling there & even considered checking out and going somewhere else.

It's almost an annual or biannual trip for us, and we've stayed at many different hotels. More times than not, we get invitations from the hotels themselves for free nights due to player's credit. And I was so excited to come and stay at the Bellagio because this has been my favorite hotel since I've saw the water show many many years ago. So my expectations were high.

Parking is free, goes without saying like all of the hotels in Vegas. Casino is beneath all the parking levels, so level 1-2 is usually full. Registrations were readily packed but we had no problem checking in. We walked through the blackjack tables to the elevators. You must show the security guard your room key to enter the elevators.

!!! We walked down a long hallway to get to our room. Once we walked in there and within 2 minutes I noticed there were opened water bottles, wet towels, used and open shampoo and conditioner bottles in the shower- I mean the room was half-a** cleaned. Was not what I expecting from a high-end hotel. Disappointed.

There check-in and check-out lines are the same. Such a hassle to check-out when there's always a crowd of people :\

While you could not hear the music the fountains were dancing to, you could hear all the rest of the noise from their nightclub Hyde as well as the strip, sirens all night long, etc. Our friends had a room on the other side of the hotel not facing the strip and were woken up every morning by the sound of bottles being crushed at a recycling plant.

It is truly a destination within itself. Let's start from the beginning... shall we ? 
First and foremost and in true contradiction with my opening statement, Bellagio is a hotel. But not just an ordinary hotel, where come to close your eyes in a run of the mill room at night, or during the day for that matter. After all, this is Vegas Baby !
Deservedly awarded 5 Diamonds by AAA, Bellagio basks in the light of true luxury. The key to attaining such a prestigious award, basically lies in the details, and herein lies the devil. You see; Luxury is not a temporary state, but rather a consistent delivery of outstanding service, consistent being the key word here. You can expect excellence at all levels.
As for the experience and sensory overload, it is quite simple. For starters, you are hard press to walk around the public areas of this hotel and not encounter different forms of art that will no doubt stimulate your senses. From Dale Chihuly to the chocolate fountain at Jean Philippe Chocolates and Pastries.  I mean, where else in the world can you see an great display of water choreography in sync with the tunes of Andrea Bocelli. You got it ! Only in front of Bellagio, at the fountain.
Walking through the Casino, is priceless entertainment, and, given the fact that is just my personal opinion, there is no room for bruised egos, or offended souls, unless of course, if the shoe fits. Touring the Casino, watching all these dead behind the eyes beings, hoping beyond hope, or simply paying way too much money for a meaningless experience, is what amounts to nothing less than a free show.
Not being a sun worshiper, unless I am sailing atop a windsurfer, I really can't say much for the pool. Yes, I people watched at the pool. Yes, I had drinks by the pool and yes, it was all good and that's all I have to say about that.
Go ahead, tour the shops, if you have the means, I strongly suggest you acquire a piece from Hermes, it is good for the soul.
To be fair, each and every dining place in Bellagio deserves it's own review and therefore, they will not be bunched here, but suffice you to know that they are there, and they are all not just good, but rather, very good!
Don't be sidetracked by short vision during your stay at Bellagio, open your senses, and open your mind and you will be guaranteed an experience of a lifetime.
If you are at all considering a trip to Vegas, consider Bellagio and please make sure that you are somewhat sober for at least enough time to enjoy your surroundings.",1,1,1

Being heavily featured in the Ocean's Eleven remake certainly helped, but it was hardly necessary.  Not with the giant lake and the famed fountains sitting in front of such a gorgeous hotel!

While I've wandered through the hotel every time I've been in Vegas (at the very least to see the conservatory), I had never stayed at the Bellagio until this most recent trip.  Thanks to a promo code one of my friends found, I ended up splitting a Two Queen room with one of the birthday boys (there were five birthday boys\/girls in total) for a pretty good rate that included a resort credit.

Although our room was in their original (read: older) tower, everything had been renovated with an updated look.  Just about all of the standard Vegas amenities were present (mini bar, iron, ironing board, iHome, safe, and multi plug outlet board for devices\/internet but no hairdryer), but nothing stood out other than the pristine and spacious bathroom.  Still a great room to stay in though, and kudos to housekeeping for turning down our beds each night.

For what the rooms lacked in uniqueness though, the rest of the hotel's signature features made up for in spades - the ceiling at the front desk with the blown glass artwork, the conservatory with ever changing decorations and themes, the wealth of in-house shops and eateries, and the aforementioned Bellagio fountains.  

As a place to stay, I still prefer Aria and Cosmopolitan for their more modern and trendy feel, but Bellagio is right there with them as a hotel overall.

I loved staying here. Check in was fast; our room was ready at 11am. We had a partial lakeview on the 25th floor in the spa tower that had a great view of pretty much the whole fountain show and the strip. The room was updated, except for the tv, but I wasn't there to watch tv anyways. The bathroom was nice-stone counters and floors, seperate soaking tub and shower. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Loved the motorized blackout drapes; if only I could install them in our apartment.

The service was really great. Every employee we encountered asked if we needed something, especially room service. I enjoyed the casino a lot as well, it had a nice variety of slots and table games. 

Something we  were disappointed in was the selection of late night eating. They have the Cafe Bellagio, but it is sit down and at 3am you just want quick eats. Thank god for the 24 newstand shop and its selection of chips and candy...ok and selection of alcohol too.

And it seriously screams high-roller right when you step foot into the lobby.  The Italian blown-glass art is gorgeous, the atrium is always something to look forward to, and the fountain show is a must-see.

Although we got a regular room, it wasn't cramped and the bathroom was immaculate with both a shower and a separate tub.  The place is extremely clean and well-maintained, and the beds were pretty comfortable.

I really liked the layout of the casino and sports book -- it was easy to navigate and you're not forced to walk through in-between tables, as there are plenty of wide walkways throughout.  There is a variety of dining options, with both cafes to grab a quick bite or sit down at some of their finer restaurants.  (However, I can't really rave about the Circo restaurant in the hotel.  I ordered a fish that arrived extremely dry -- plus tiny to boot! --  and definitely not worth the ~$45.)  Their brunch buffet definitely could not compare to the brunch at the Wynn.  But I have yet to try their dinner buffet...so we'll see about that one.

Rooms are really nice but we were on the fourth floor literally almost the last room down one of the hallways. Pain to walk to or from our room because of that. Since we are on vacation we slept in every morning, or we tried to. Housekeeping was in our hallway every morning around 8:30AM & usually they were extremely loud, screaming back & forth one morning. So much for sleeping in. Pool was really nice but the service there was horrible. There were 5 to 1 towel boys to waitresses so if you want a drink or anything else expect to wait for it. We ended up grabbing our own drinks at the bar to avoid the wait.  We never gambled here either since the minimums were pretty high & you could literally go across the street to Paris & gamble for cheaper.",2,0,0

  Checking in was a breeze, and upon tipping the front desk person $20, I was upgraded to a strip view room that was the first stop on my elevator (which was very nice), and only a couples doors down without being too close to the ice machine. So what I would say a perfectly located room. Our view of the fountains and the strip was perfect (see the pictures) and very pleasant to watch.  

  The room although with outdated electronics  regular CD player radio (as opposed to iHome iPod dock like Mandalay had) and crummy 24"" projection TV in the armoire. They did make up for it by having power curtains, and still very nice and elegant wood furnishings. The room also came with all the toiletries you need and of decent quality to eliminate you bringing your own stuff...unless you really need that $25 face wash from home.

  The pool was very nice but sadly the weather sucked so I didn't bother swimming.  Service from everyone was very nice...but I will note...the line for the buffet took an hour to get a table and we didn't find out till later that if you ask the front desk you can get a line pass for the buffet if you're a guest...it'd be nice if they just offered it wouldn't it?  Anyway the Bellagio is a beautiful casino...and nothing beats watching the Bellagio fountain show  playing  to ""Singing in the Rain"".   

  Oh and on a side note...we played some slots...made about $15...and then I hit a black jack table..put down a $100 hand...got black jack first hand and left...that works for me.

I've stayed in Vegas 6 times before, all different hotels (PH towers, MGM, Cosmo....) ...Saving this one as my ""dream hotel"". Its really about one step up from the Monte Carlo -.-

Obviously this hotel is only famous for being famous, not because its amazing

I paid 700 for 2 nights 4 months in advance (so, deeply discounted due to pre-planning) for a Deluxe fountain view room. 2 queens & smoking.

The difference between a deluxe & a regular fountain view room is apparently the ""complimentary items"" and WiFi...Save yourself $50+ and bring your own shampoo -.-

BRING YOUR OWN WIFI HOTSPOT

Their WiFi is HORRIFFIC and you pay extra for it!! If you can get it to connect, and KEEP it connected you'll never get a page loaded with the one bar. Not good when you have to have internet to work. Be prepared to drag your laptop to a Starbucks.

I should have checked for a balcony on the listing, but I had assumed a smoking room would include one, or at the very least an opening window. You can not smoke in your room unless you intend to sleep in smoke. There is a huge pane glass window that doesn't open. it opens seriously a millimeter at the bottom. There is NO ventilation, the fan doesn't help. 

Even with a smoking room you have to go down to the casino to smoke!

The bed was comfy but the sheets, blankets & towels were all uncomfortably cheap & scratchy :\/ For the price of this hotel I'd expect not to be scraped up when drying off

The room was Small, really small! Also, disappointing for the price. The furniture closes you in even more in this tiny room.

The bathroom was big. The shower is big, all glass & tile floor so your feet are warm. The tub though is sad. Its regular sized but set back in so it's a dangerous pain in the ass to get in & out. Plus, no jacuzzi jets after all that work.

The hotel lobby is absolutely gorgeous, the casino and everything is elegant & beautiful......the rooms are drab :\/

The only upsides - I got a $100 giftcard rebate to the Crystal Shops & the pool is heated to 85. 

All in all I felt like I really wasted my money here, unfortunately. 

For the same price or cheaper you can stay in a prettier room, with a balcony or jaccuzi or a bigger room with a couch....... or all! Also, your fountain view will probably be better just about anywhere without half the building blocking it.",1,0,0

That's right First of all, when I arrived, they didn't have a vallet, or anyone to show us or give us directions to where we should park. Second of all, once we got to check in, the man at the desk said, ""ah you have such specific reservations!"" Reservations that had us looking out of the tower toward the strip, on the strip, instead he gives us a room over looking the golf course. No. We paid for the other room. So we changed it, they helped a little bit, they moved us to a room with the proper view, it had two beds instead of one. Next, we enter the room, find our view very beautiful,  unpack, hit the casino, return hours later intoxicated, I ordered room service, because I. Hadn't eaten all day, and it was my girl friends dream to have room service. So they show up an hour later than they said they would, and the food was cold, super cold, and got us both sick, even though we put the temperature to 64, we had terrible dreams and fever from some type of bad meat. We got the lamb and pasta . only to notice both the beds are broken, on each side near the center.so I called it in, too tired to do anything about it at 1am, I decided to just continue sleeping till the morning, I'm changing rooms in an hour, and I'll keep this review updated throughout the entire birthday! The continental breakfast was mostly eaten, get there early! Edit-so, after we hardly slept on a broken bed, moving to the other broken bed back and fourth all night long, a night of restlessness, we went for coffee. after we had breakfast, which was good, endless bacon and eggs, we asked about our room change. We were then informed that our change would happen soon, they were sorry but the room was dirty at the moment. So now we are in our broken room waiting on them to call us, I wish I was at the spa I'm currently paying for and not using, instead of packing and waiting for a call. I'll upload pictures of the bed so everyone knows I'm telling the truth. Edit- I've uploaded the pictures, I would like to say I really like this hotel, the employees do a good job, however I feel that I should be compensated for the terrible night of sleep, atleast with another night stay or something worth value because my back hurts terribly. this will be my 3rd room change, I'll keep everyone updated about the other room and our experiences at this hotel.update - so we finally got comped a total of 100$! Woo! Ttally not worth the comp, they put us in the next tier level room, it's a little bigger, at 929 sqaure feet, but considering we paid for 1102 square foot special, we still feel cheated. And the only thing they could possibly give us is another night free to comp us for that terrible night sleep and terrible service.

my family and I had previously requested a room with strip views when we reserved the room, and upon arrival the front desk person said that we would have to wait an hour for it to be ready.  No problem right? We could find something to do, it is Vegas after all. An hour later we check back...the room was still not ready. 2 hours later...still not ready. Finally we threw in the towel and took a regular room. Then in the middle of the night I awoke to what sounded like people outside our door. Then I heard the handle go up and down like it was trying to be opened. A few minutes later the door opened but because we put the security chain on it, it wouldn't open all the way. At that point security was YELLING AT US saying we were in a room illegally......at this point my mother started yelling right back that we checked in the afternoon before and yada yada yada. Needless to say it took multiple phone calls (at 4 am no less) before they apologized and offered to discount our room (should have gotten the night for free if you ask me!).  I guess the check in girl never actually put it in the computer that we checked in. 

Now what ""Hi End"" hotel lets their security YELL at guests or even so called ""suspicious"" guests at 4 in the morning??!?!?!  I've stayed at numerous other 4 and 5 star hotels and never anything remotely close like that has ever happened to me. We checked out ASAP (which was another nightmare due to the reimbursement on the room...just took forever and had to have at least 3 different managers sign off on it) and went over to the Mirage and had a wonderful experience there. (And since have stayed at other hotels on the strip which were just as nice!)

Just going to cut right to it. The Hotel is nice and all but I paid almost $3,500 to stay in a two bedroom suite for 4 days. When I got up to the room the first night the reservation was wrong and they gave me a single room suite with two beds. That's obviously not going to fly with my wife and co-workers that were with us. To further the issue the room was filthy, note I got there at 9pm so it wasn't a early check in. The bathroom literally had fecal matter in the bathrooms, mops and buckets in with them. Cleaning supplies and dirty towels were thrown throughout the room. There was spilled coffee on the desk where I was calling the manager to complain and used personal hygiene products from either the cleaning staff or the prior staff. 

When I called and spoke with the manager he said he would move me to another room and after expressing my displeasure with the room the manager came up and took us to a new room and introduced himself as the Hotel Operations Manager. 

Fast forward to this morning when I checked out. We found numerous charges on our bill from that morning all the way through the day we checked in. In addition to the fraudulent charges made to my room  the manager automatically opted me into a $200 a night room up charge. I never was told about this nor did I agree to any additional up charge. They tacked on Hotel\/Resort Fees and Taxes on those fees that ultimately ended up being $1300+ in additional charges on top of the $3,500 we paid for the room. 

Few Notes:
The real Operations Manager of the hotel said that they have had problems with people charging things to peoples rooms and their employees not checking ID's. 

They NEVER authorized additional charges with me on the room, restaurants and other items in the hotel. Some of these charges were made a hour before the people in our room woke up this morning. Very out of hand if you ask me. 

The hotel had a LOT of people at the check out complaining about never being told about the ""Resort\/Hotel Fee"" which was upwards of $25 a night plus taxes. Why is this not displayed or told to the consumer when putting down a credit card for ""incidentals""? If this is a standard charge as the manager stated why not put that on the room fee or ask for a credit card to put it on. Not just pop it on people at check out. 

I will never stay at the Bellagio again due to these issue. I had a ton of employees and people with us for the convention we came in town for and we will make sure not to book rooms there again.",2,0,1

It seems like awhile ago, the Bellagio was the Gold Standard... but now it's being surpassed by alot of other properties (both new and renovated older resorts) - and now Bellagio is just riding off their name.

I contacted Bellagio to see what they could do for a 10-block of rooms and while everyone else (Wynn, Palazzo & Aria) quoted lower pricing with tons of great resort credits & perks, Bellagio came in at the highest price with absolutely no extras. Hmm... I guess we're not in a recession at 3600 LV Blvd. South.

(Fortunately for them, our hands were tied because they were the birthday girl's favorite hotel.)

Rooms are fine - nice decor with decent bathrooms (split vanity, walk-in glass shower and separate garden tub - although lighting sucked... dim and fluorescent). Toiletries are whatever and on the day we checked out, Housekeeping came at 8:45am even though checkout is 12pm Noon.

And speaking of Housekeeping, while the sheets in our room were fine, our friends found BLOOD on their sheets.  Even worse, it took like 45 minutes for the maid to come in and swap them out! So, so gross.

For the clubs, we didn't go to the Bank but I do know they were charging $30 a head, even for chicks which was surprising. We got a drink at the Caramel lounge but I don't recommend... clientele feels like they came from a different hotel.

Buffet was not bad - we went for Brunch. The wait wasn't short but if you've ever been to Boiling Crab, you won't worry abou the line. $25 for regular brunch\/lunch $30 to add champagne which isn't bad. Don't eat any carbs though - french toast, waffles, bread, cheese blintz etc. They're not worth it... but I do recommend any fish (Bluenose and Salmon) and the meats were solid (Prime Rib, Hand-Carved Bacon). Breakfast sausage was terrible and dry. Desserts are typical buffet quality with the chocolate eclair being the standout.

First this is part of the MGM resort properties.  As a result it can make you feel a bit like insignificant or lost. The hotel is one of the best locations, and one of the finest hotels, next to Caesars, Mirage, Paris, and Venetian. It is arguably one of the top 10 top tier hotels in Vegas.  You can't go wrong here.  But it is a nit more money--$50-100 more than others. That buys you not only a better area, but also a better casino hotel, and better front desk staff, and better experience with other guests.  

What stuck out for us were two employees at the front desk:  Arelyn and ""Mr Wynn"" (I can't remember his first name).  They made us feel not like numbers or wallets, but like guests -- like they were there for us.  It was a really neat feeling in such a huge hotel where staff can easily dead pan. It was great to meet individual employees who just listened and responded.  The staff did a lot they didn't have to do and it made a huge difference.

Pros--
Pool
Buffet
Casino
Ambiance
Unbelievable fountains
Disneyland like vibe, resort feel
Show ""O"" plays here
Responsive front desk
Customer centric service 
No up selling noted

Cons--
Can feel a bit lost here, like you're just a number
Huge traffic flows can make simple things take time
Can be crowded, but we came on the busiest weekend in 20 years
Some restaurants can be super expensive

Ok, admit I am just now reviewing Bellagio, having just stayed at Aria for xmas. 

Rooms are getting a little out out date, but cannot complain since we were upgraded to a GIANT suite on the last visit. Yup, 3 bathrooms, living room, dining area, more flat screen TV\/monitors than I have at home (which is a few), electronically controlled blinds.  Love the security features of limiting the access to the masses to the suite floors.  The pool area is fantastic w\/ the private cabanas that you reserve (rent). The lobby ceiling with its Chahuli glass remains a touch-stone, something to experience. The garden court \/ atrium which changes with the season is always fun to see. Itsa Vegas experience. A funny thing that elevated my energy to review the LV joints was an interview of Wayne Newton (singer and LV resident) by Jay Leno. Wayne said he and Steve Wynn (built Bellagio, Wynn, Encore etc.) were having dinner and 3 ladies approached the table asking for an autograph and of course Wayne said ""of course"",  and reached for his pen, WRONG... they wanted Steve Wynn's autograph.  I thought it was big of Wayne N. to admit this, and amazing Steve W. attracts the ladies (oooops he has really deep pockets). 

Bellagio operates like a well oiled machine. Comfy, grand, stately, classy. 

Encountering many folk from all over the world. Bellegio, even when it opened has an ""old world"" classy feel. I think I will summer at Bellagio and winter at ARIA. 

I continue to find some reviews hilarious, check out the review which states that the reviewer lost their phone (never stayed at Bellagio), and states they found her camera. Maybe one of those folks who would try to use ""white out"" on their computer monitor to correct a mistake. I could be wrong but, phones don't transform into cameras, but many phones have built in cameras..... maybe that was the confusing tech thing that confounded the reviewer.

I booked this room through my Mlife and it was really easy!

That was unexpected and we were entirely grateful for the sweet gesture!  

The  room was amazing! It was so spacious, the mini bar was very well stocked (although, the beers could have definitely been a little colder. They were a tad bit too warm to fully enjoy) The bedding was super comfy, I loved that there were plenty of pillows on the bed and the bath robes they had were perfection! 

We had a view of the strip, and a side view of the famous Bellagio Fountains!!  The bell desk girl was awesome when bringing up our bags, she even let us know that if we turned the T.V. to channel 22 we could here the music that was playing live during the water show so we could get a better experience of it from the view in our room. That was a major plus!

Our second day we walked in to our room and we found a delicious box of chocolate and caramel truffles on our desk with a lovely note from the manager, wishing us a congratulations and happy stay.  I though this was rock-star! A++ for that incredibly thoughtful gesture!! 

So why the 4.5 stars instead of 5?!!! .......Cleanliness!! :\/  We didn't want to be complainers, especially since they were kind enough to upgrade us.

Upon entering we wait in line for over an hour to check in. I feel that is a little excessive for a $400+ per night room.

We finally get our key and head up to our room. The hallways (even on the top floors) absolutely reek of smoke. Ok, fine, it's a casino so we can deal with it.

The room was amazing. The bathroom was huge and luxurious. All good...then we get to the refrigerator.

The fridge in the room is full of their mini-bar products (overpriced is an understatement for what this place charges for EVERYTHING) They even have sensors on everything in the room so if you nudge it you pay for it - even if not consumed. If you want a fridge you can use in this 5 star resort you have to rent one for $25 per day...and that's if they have any available which they did not when we came.

Our friends from Australia also came to stay at the Bellagio and were charged about $200 more per night for the exact same room. I guess this hotel charges you depending on where you are from?  They weren't allowed the $80 buffet credit because they used an ""international credit card"" (even though it was a Master Card)  Odd...I can use my card anywhere in the world the same as them...

Overall this is an amazing facility but when you combine the fact that everything is ridiculously over priced, the customer service is non existent (at least for our friends and us during our stay) and the pool closes at 8pm...8PM!! IN THE DESERT!!!! It's 100 degrees until 10PM?!? These factors just make it impossible for me to give anything besides the mandatory 1 star. 

As you can see from my reviews I do not hand out 1 stars easily.  It takes alot for me to give a business such a low rating. The Bellagio earned this in spades (see what I did there?)

I also didn't like that we happened to be there on the day of a marathon but no one had warned us that the entrance would be closed and you had to come in through a different street.  We sat in traffic for a long time before we realized what was happening.   An email letting know would have been nice or even signs on the street.  Maybe a person directing traffic away from the  front entrance? Any effort at all would have been nice.  We didn't see any one directing traffic until we got to the back entrance.  But by then we had already sat in traffic for an hour and had to call the hotel to get directions to the alt route",0,0,0

After speaking to hotel staff over the phone, I was told to talk to a representative in the hotel and they would be able to assist me, while walking in the hotel I found a representative told him my situation and he directed me to the ""VIP"" check in to retrieve my debit card. 

While waiting next in line literally for 10 mins I was helped by a woman and I told her my situation  she quickly said ""We don't have the card here, nor do we carry lost and found."", and then gave me the hotel main phone number.

I honestly feel that due to my skin tone and beau car I wasn't purchasing the ""VIP"" package she treated me different from the other customers.

Thankfully one of the other staff members came and pointed me in the right direction.. 

I honestly do NOT support business who discriminates or racially profile customers. That's not called customer service.

When you charge all these extra fees at the hotel\/restaurants\/parking, cut back on customer service, change the gaming policies to be more in the casino's favor - why do you complain when the guest goes elsewhere.

Talk to the employees, and they admit that the company has instituted these changes because ""guests are gambling less"", so the company needs to make up the money elsewhere.  If they are questioned about these changes driving the customers away, they are ok with you leaving as it makes room for the next gambler........do they not see the contradiction here?
With cutting out the newspapers, the turndown service and upping the ""resort fee"", it is just too much

last straws - you are paying $60+ per person for a buffet dinner, and you have to get your own drinks.....they installed those pick your flavor pop machines around the room, laid off most of the front of house staff, while leaving the ones that remain to fight for tips while offering you alcohol
Also the parking - it is still putting peoples life at risk with the backups to get into and out of the pay to self park, and they have instituted that if you call down to the valet to get your car brought up, now when you get down there, and your car is waiting...they won't give you the keys, no, you have to wait for an attendant to be available to pull it off of the wall.

Warning and Notice of Danger to yourself if you enter this club.  My sister, who was celebrating her 21st Birthday party, and her two female friends and I were invited to enter Hyde by their representative and to have free drinks.  We accepted the invitation since we were Guests at Bellagio. We were inside the club for a couple of hours when a security guard for no reason took me by the arm and escorted me outside into the casino.  This action greatly confused me so I walked to the Hyde security outside the Hyde entrance in the casino and I asked to speak to a manager.  The Manager did not care about me being taken out for no reason and he did not care about telling my sister and her two friends that I was escorted out.  The Hyde manager had no customer relation skills and did not care about fixing their mistake.  The Hyde manager called Bellagio security and Bellagio security also had no customer relation skills.  I tried to explain my wrongful eviction and the only thing Bellagio security would do was threaten me with a trespassing charge.  I told them that was not helpful and I questioned why they did not want to resolve the situation and satisfy their customer and Hotel guest and then Bellagio security took me away.  When they took me away, several Bellagio security guards assaulted me and beat me up.  They punched me over 25 times in the head, in the eye and all over my body. They almost knocked me out and I had to try hard to stay alert.  I've never been beaten like this in my life and I've never even been in a fight; it was a nightmare.  I feared for my life. They called the Las Vegas police so I was arrested with a Disorderly Conduct charge.  When my attorney appeared in court, the prosecutor dropped the criminal charge against me.  I have since filed a lawsuit against Hyde and Bellagio.  I am intent on getting the word out publicly that you risk your safety and liberty dealing with Hyde, their security and Bellagio security.  I have been a repeat guest at Bellagio for over  15 years with my family and I was always accustomed to the most excellent customer service.  So this experience is a complete reversal and has to do with the low caliber people that they hire for security.  These security people are goons, they act like thugs, not educated with respect to customer relations and they believe that the right answer to a customer concern is to be trespassed.  If you question them, you risk being trespassed or beaten.  Fair warning to everyone, if anyone suggests going here, change your plans.

You need to be a Bellagio guest and flash your status, aka your room key, to get down to the pools, but if you're elite enough to get down here, the pool area is so peaceful and refreshing.

The Pool Cafe's menu is small, but it's full of the basics.  I had a delicious and crispy waffle and a great iced latte.  The decor is simplistic and somehow reminiscent (although I'm not sure how, exactly) of a Jane Austen-era English garden party.   The staff are very nice and friendly. 

If you think the Pool Cafe is overpriced, then why the F are you staying at the freakin' Bellagio?!  It's gonna be a little expensive, and really, it wasn't all that bad.  Perspective, people.

Pros: Very nice rooms, conservatory (live gardens), free parking
Cons:
1) Takes 1 hr to check-in. This should NEVER happen at any hotel, anywhere in the world, no matter how many guests are checking in that day. Hire more people or find better ways to accommodate.
2) NOT FOR CHILDREN!!!!! We were given a room in the main 'Bellagio' tower. The only way to access our tower, according to staff, is to walk through the smoke-filled casino (not great for adults, worse for kids), or take about a 1\/2 mile (no joke) walk through the hallway. They could have at least given us a room in the 'Spa' tower. They said they were 'out of rooms'. Haha, a hotel this size, running out of rooms by 2pm...on a Sunday afternoon? That was a lie. They said we could call tomorrow to change rooms, but to be honest, switching rooms is a hassle. Just give me the room to start. Having to walk through a smoky casino or a 1\/2 mile to the gym, parking lot, or garden is really what irks me about this stay.
3) Internet sub-par. I'm using the hotel WiFi as I type this from my laptop. I was able to connect to that without problems, but our iPhones and iPads have no such luck. The WiFi support tech said he didn't know what the problem was, and suggested I just use my laptop. Unacceptable.

Suggestions:
1) Children? If you have kids, stay somewhere else.
2) 2pm or after arrival? If you can't check-in early, book somewhere else. They seem to run out of rooms here...or so they say.
3) Internet for mobile device? If you need it, stay somewhere else. Laptops are ok.
4) Request a fountain-view room. Last time we had it, this time we have a really bad view...but I understand that some people have to have these views, so I'm ok with it. The Bellagio tower rooms don't seem to be as nice as the spa tower rooms, either.",3,1,0

The rooms are very plush and opulent but that's what I would expect for the price.  Service was top notch also.  The room that I was in had a remote control that didn't work and they brought another one up promptly.  One of my major gripes in hotels is when their showers have little to no water pressure.  I like a strong stream and for such a massive hotel, their shower did not disappoint.   The rest of the bathroom was huge with a separate shower and bath with a large sink and a huge mirror. The location of the hotel is very convenient since it is right in the middle of the strip.  Caesars Palace, the Forum Shops, PH and the Mile something shops are all right next door and you can always take the shuttle up and down the strip for free.  Combined with the breathtaking fountain shows and the classy decor, you really can't lose with this hotel........UNLESS......you eat at the buffet here.  Do yourself a favor and skip over to the Wynn for the buffet.  The gardens here are absolutely beautiful and the view from some of the rooms are amazing.  For an extra $50\/night you can have your room face the strip and the fountains which in my opinion is totally worth it.  The shopping is a bit sparse here with only the ultra high end stores such as Tiffany, Chanel, YSL, Fendi, Dior, Hermes, Prada and Gucci but with the Forum Shops next door who really cares.

Despite our reservations being for six days, beginning on a Monday, we were given a room with one of the worst views of the property. This isn't really a big deal, but if someone is spending six nights, beginning on a weekday in July, it's annoying because seriously, were there no better rooms available? 

Secondly, the wifi situation is terrible. If I were just trying to access Facebook, I wouldn't care, but I had work to do and the wireless was nonexistent at several points during the stay. I am talking about an inability to access the internet from my ROOM, not the pool or cafe.  If you are a business traveler requiring internet access I suggest you go elsewhere.  Calls to the front desk are met with an unapologetic ""sorry, there's nothing we can do!"" 

I wanted to stay someplace with a more relaxed (non clubby) pool scene, and while it met that criteria, a few things about their pool bothered me. You need a bellagio room key to enter, but the attendants don't always ask for them. If they are busy, don't feel like it, or if you're a pretty girl or are part of a group, they don't care. Also, you just have to have a room key. So if I kept my key, checked out, and returned to vegas in two weeks but stayed elsewhere they wouldn't know and I could come back as often as I liked.  So the pool is super crowded.  There aren't a lot of shaded or semi shaded chaises available, esp if you don't want to pay extra for cypress or one of the cabanas.

Lastly, and this is my fault, I was unprepared for the amount of non bellagio guests who stream into the hotel to look at the conservatory, chocolate foundation, or flower ceiling or to gamble.  I was annoyed at having to constantly navigate around people (and strollers) who would  slow down or stop abruptly to take a picture in the middle of a crowd, or to gaze at something, or to figure out where they were going.  I do realize I should've known better, but I write this only to forewarn others who might also be irritated by this and\/or who wouldn't happen to consider this when choosing a hotel.

The rooms were well appointed and clean; the check in process was quick and uncomplicated, and they have a number of decent food choices. The bellagio is also centrally located on the strip. That's why this hotel gets a 3.  But I won't likely be back anytime soon.",0,0,0

The hotel itself is still very impressive and offers you a lot.  So much so that if you spent a weekend in Vegas, you really wouldn't have to leave the hotel.

The check in area was nicely decorated.  Service could have been better than the ""I'm only doing this job until I get through college"" attitude.

The rooms were great (auto shade controls?!?!), but poorly cleaned.  There was rubbish in the trash can, wads of hair in the shower and a half used bar of soap stuck to the shower.  When we called the front desk about our concerns, they sent someone to dump the trash.... nothing more.

The pool area was the best part of our experience.  Five stars.  It's guests only, so it's not overrun by drunks from the strip.  They give you two towels right off the bat.  The mixed drinks at the pool bar are always perfectly proportioned.

The buffet was ok.  Would have been disappointed if we paid full price, but we got a special with our room, so it wasn't so bad.  Skip the unlimited drinks option, as you'll be able to eat until you're silly gross.

What can you say about the fountains!  Wynn knew what he was doing with that as it is one of the most iconic Vegas landmarks now.

Overall location and ambiance make this an ideal place to stay on the strip.",1,0,0

Maybe I got lucky and had none on the floor I was on.  For what the hotel cost I  am glad I got the quiet I wanted.  We booked a cabana for a day also.  Wow.  That was the best part.

Wonderful suites with an exceptional view of the water show, although the music can be a pain at times. It's certainly a crowded hotel, but they manage to proceed like a well-oiled machine. The beds are luxurious, the tubs are huge soaking contraptions which can bury you up to the neck. Showers can hold a wild party. Splurge for the room if you can and position yourself for more specialised treatment.

You can roll out of bed into the spa, or summon someone to your room for massage and facials. ""O"" is shown in the same facility, so there's no cab, walking or limo required. The casino is not smoky, and if you sit long enough at a table or slot machine all drinks are free.

Bring more than a few.

Anyhow, the cafes, shops, restaurants, club and atrium (with oversized sculptures and butterflies) are popular and excellent quality.

This hotel, while beautiful and well maintained, is not worth the money.  The ""free wifi"" was practically nonexistent.  I called the front desk to ask about it and they sent an ""engineer"" up to talk to me.  They made it seem like it was my device that was the problem, but when I told him that I had a Kindle, an iPad, two laptops, and three phones and NONE of them were able to connect, he kinda gave away that this poor reception was typical at the hotel.  Keep in mind, my husband was here for BUSINESS . . . he had to use his air card to get internet so that he could work while away from his office.  There is decent wifi signal in the hallway . . . .  They blame the poor wifi in Vegas on the mountains that are what?  100 miles away?  I live in the Shenandoah valley and I get good signal.  Just sayin'

All of the stores in the Bellagio are high end.  Everything is SUPER expensive!  My niece and I went to the Cafe Gelato and bought two sandwiches, a bowl of berries, and two fountain drinks and it cost $43!!!  This cafe does have some amazing desserts, though.  The little bowls of raspberry cheesecake and chocolate mousse were sooo good!  

There are no refrigerators or microwaves in the room.  There is a minibar and a shelf of snacks and water for you if you want to pay ridiculous fees for them.  Also, something I didn't know, if you take something out of the mini bar or off of the snack shelf, they automatically charge you, even if you put it back!!!  Whaattttt?? Yeah, I know.  Apparently, they have sensors that can tell when you've removed something, but the sensors don't know if you've put it back.  They tried charging me for two different things and when I called about the charge, I was told that we took cookies and orange juice.  When I said that no we didn't, I was told it was Fiji water and something else.  They didn't even know what was missing (because nothing was).  But, go figure, they charged $8 per item!!!!  After a call to the front desk, they refunded the charge, though not the tax, which I'm pretty sure is illegal.  

The maids were sweet, especially the one who came in to turn down the beds (though they were made already turned down, so she really didn't do anything other than throw a few chocolates on the beds).  I tried leaving her a tip, but she didn't take it.  So I had to put a note with the money so she knew it was for her!  Too cute!

When I asked for extra towels, it took a long time.  When I tried to extend our stay an extra night, they refused to give me the conference rate, even though we had that rate for the other nights.  They didn't even try to help us out by finding a more reasonable rate in another room.  You'd think they'd welcome another paid night, but no. 

The bellmen were great.  Since we couldn't get a reasonable rate for another night, we opted to have our luggage stored while we tooled around until we had to be at the airport by 10:00pm.  We bought some souvenirs and they allowed us to add them to our stored baggage with no hesitation.  

The front desk clerk while maybe not intending to be, insulted me upon check-in.  We checked in on a Monday and they mistakenly tried to give us a room with a king bed (we needed two queen as there were 3 of us).  He asked if we wanted to upgrade so I asked him what the rates were.  He mentioned a suite, but then looked at me and said ""That's probably . . . too big for what you need"" with a smirk on his face.  Yeah, what he meant was ""you can't afford it"".  Yeah, I probably couldn't afford it, so why bother to even mention it?  Nope.  Just insult me instead.

After their ""investigation"", they concluded that they were in no way responsible for my injuries, even though there is a coating on their sidewalks and pool decks that make them extremely slick. Really disappointed they are taking this stance. Also really disappointed that no one from their staff contacted me the day after the incident to check on me. Without accepting responsibility, they could have called and asked how I was, maybe offer to send breakfast to our room since walking was pretty much impossible.

First time at this hotel and I can tell the difference compared to lower end places I stayed at years ago. Right when you walk in, it seems grand, formal, elegant, with all the marble and gold. And a gorgeous ceiling display of colorful flowers. 

They offer mobile check-in. It may or may not speed anything up, because you would still need to wait in line and get your keys, confirm stuff, ask questions. At the very least, I think it confirms\/guarantees your room is ready for you by the time you arrive. Then the super friendly guy with an Irish like accent -- wish I caught his name because he was so damn nice! -- gave us some booklets and information about how to get around, food places, etc. Our room was on the 26th floor, and offered a decent view -- mostly highway, but we saw the Rio hotel and at night time, things were lit up. It's not spectacular, but we got a very affordable rate, with a $100 dining credit right around the Xmas holidays. So can't really complain. 

My husband and I really loved the room -- very spacious. We never felt cramped or on top of one another. We got a nice desk workstation, two sofas chairs and a little round table to make up a little lounge area, and a couch at the end of our king sized bed that had fluffy pillows which actually offered some neck support. This was always a gripe of ours at other hotels , that their pillows were so flat it was basically sleeping on an empty pillow case. There's a safe inside one of the night stand drawers, a closet to hang up clothes, and dresser drawers. Also a lot of outlets for all your gadgets chargers, etc. Free wifi as well. Could sometimes have issues but for the most part was solid. 

The big highlight was the bathroom -- we enjoyed the completely tiled bathroom, double sinks-- it was convenient to get ready in the morning at the same time so we could get our day started --  ample lighting, even a close up mirror to do your makeup. I hate having to lean over the huge countertop to get close to a mirror and then mess up my makeup. I brought my own stand alone mini mirror for this reason, but Bellagio had me completely covered on that front. The toilet has a strong flush (always a good thing, no?!), plenty of towels, a decent sized soaking tub (not sure if the actual tub was larger than standard), and a standing shower\/glass door. Water pressure was strong and it got very hot, which was perfect.Not a very big standing shower, and it's really only meant for one person, so good enough!  Air condition and heat both worked very well. 

I did notice that early in the week, the hot water was very strong. As we got closer and closer to the weekend, the water didn't stay hot long and in order to achieve the temperature, I had to consistently shift the knob, even during a short shower. 

Another thing to note -- that my husband was nearly giddy about -- that you can open\/close the curtains and blackout curtains with a button. One near the entrance, and another by the bed. Is a pretty cool feature. You want to wake up and need some sunlight, you don't even need to get out of bed. Cool way to gradually ease your way out of bed, after those late nights and all. 

On our last night there we ordered room service: Expensive, and they charge an additional $4.50 per person fee. Two 3 egg omelettes with choice of meats\/veggies, and you get potato hash and toast or English muffin on the side. When it arrived, I was surprised at all the condiments (mini bottles of mustard, mayo, and ketchup as my husband requested), and numerous flavors of mini jam jars. So cute! The omelettes weer also huge, like the size of a large forearm, and loaded with veggies\/bacon. Not stingy here at all, which was appreciate considering the price. Loved the roasted tomato garnish. 

One minor annoyance was that you always have to show your card before entering the elevators. Very inconvenient if you have a lot of bags or no free hands, and then you need to rustle around in your purse for your wallet. 

Another negative -- smelled smoke everywhere. I expect it downstairs, in the casino, but not in the hallways, in the bedrooms, under the doors. It just seeped in from everywhere. Was a huge damper. 

Also at times, could hear a lot of noise from next door or from the hallway. Usually children and some noisy groups. Doors are extremely heavy here, and when they slam shut, it's loud enough to wake you. This happened in spite of earplugs and two noise machines. Never heard doors slam quite as loudly as they do here. 

Overall, pleased with this hotel. Close to other hotels and shopping\/food. Within the hotel, enjoyed 24 hour Snacks, traditional Chinese food from Noodles, pastries\/breakfast sandwiches and coffee drinks or gelato from Palio, Cafe Gelato, etc. Always got to see the fountains as we were walking up to the entrance which was a nice site.",11,1,4

At check in, we were swiftly given our key and directed to the correct elevator banks. Valet was second to none, as were the bellmen.

So here is review  #1,170 on the Bellagio. It is based on my staycation here from March 24 to 29 2013. Due to the fact that the Bellagio is this colossal property with so many elements, what I did was separate the review into sections with ratings.

Location:  4 stars

     The Bellagio stands at the heart of the Strip where Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road intersect. It is neighbors with casino superstars Caesar's Palace, the Flamingo, Cosmopolitan, Bally's, Paris, and Planet Hollywood. Pederstrian bridges connect The Bellagio with Caesar's Palace and Bally's. From the south part of the property, there is a tram with stops at City Center and Monte Carlo. The reason that I gave the location 4 instead of 5 stars, is that peak traffic is atrocious. For this reason, I do not recommend renting a car if you are staying here. A major flaw is that the only way to reach the Bellagio parking garage is from the Las Vegas Boulevard. I would personally prefer swimming in the Las Vegas Wash than driving on Las Vegas Boulevard at peak times. I say this with such seriousness that I parked at the Monte Carlo parking lot, which has access to Frank Sinatra Drive, and used the tram to get to the Bellagio.

The room: 4 stars

   I spend little time in the room. If I did, this would be a comfortable room to be in. Being that this is the Bellagio, the room is a representation of the wealth and class that is the Bellagio image. The bathroom is huge. There is a bath tub and shower. The beds are superb. The drapes are controlled by a switch. Escaping my Henderson apartment for a couple of days, this is opulence that was above my life style. There is a flaw. There was not any closets. Do keep in mind that the resort fee includes use of the robe in the cabinet. I also want to give a shout out to the Maids for doing a great job cleaning up our mess.

Pricing: 3 stars

  The Bellagio is a high end hotel. Usually the price is exorbitant. However when the supply of rooms exceeds the demand the price could be reasonable. To get a good deal, I suggest hotels.com. Also when you use hotels.com, the practice has been that the tenth night you use them is free. When we stayed at the Bellagio from Sunday to Thursday night the room was $132 a night plus the $25 resort fee. The Bellagio did give us a $50 meal credit. 

Safety: 4 stars

   Safety seems to be a priority with Bellagio management. It was standard procedure to have a security person standing by the elevator banks.

Public areas: 4 & 1\/2 stars

   I don't have to write about the Bellagio's public areas. When Steve Wynn developed it in the late 90's, he built a hotel that was going to be the best in the World. Today the Conservatory and Fountains live up to his vision. I have learned from Steve Wynn's competitor Donald Trump that your quality of life goes up when you surround yourself with beauty. After leaving a beautiful room, I would meet my family in the Conservatory, and take in the Fountains on the walk to the Strip.

Swimming pool: 4 stars

   The magnificence of the hotel extends into the pool area. The pools are in a large courtyard. Each pool is large. The water is warm and clear. Each pool includes a hot tub that offers sufficient elbow room. The time that I spent in the swimming pool and lying on the chaise was precious.

Restaurants: 3 stars

   I am sure that the restaurants are remarkable fine dining options. The thing is that every restaurant is expensive. From my experience, the Bellagio Buffet is one of my favorites. In my early days of yelping, I rated it 4 stores. For people on a budget, the Magnificent Mile across the Boulevard offers reasonably priced restaurants.

The casino: 4 stars

     From the days of Steve Wynn's to MGM Resorts ownership, the casino has changed. In the days of the Steve Wynn ownership, the slot machines were silent. Now the slot machines make the well known carnival sounds and the music of the night clubs overflows into the casino. When my brother and I played Caveman Keno near the Lilly Night Club late at night, I was impressed by the drink service. They made my alcohol beverage of choice: the Blue Hawaiin to my expectations. They tasted far superior to the $11 Blue Hawaiin that I had across the Boulevard in Napoleons. The cocktail waitress was persistent with the drinks. Too bad I cannot say that about hitting my Keno numbers.

Chances of returning:

   Lets face it, I am not wealthy. It was a treat to have spent a few nights in the Bellagio. Unlike the Excalibur, they do not draw people in with discounts. I would like to return to the Bellagio one day. Chances are I will be staying in another Strip property before staying in the Bellagio. I am just happy that I had the chance to have stayed there.

First, room maintenance. The bathroom sink wasn't cleaned well--there was left over toothpaste from the previous guests. The sink also drained slowly and made odd loud gurgling noises at random times. The carpet looked a bit worn in places. The room had minor paint damage in places. The door's peephole was smashed. -1 Star.

Overall, the basic ""deluxe"" room in the Bellagio is about average. Not too big, not too small, nothing spectacular to write home about (considering, again, this is Vegas). 

The employees here are friendlier than average. Not as friendly as the Wynn's, but better than, say, MGM Grand's (who would much rather you just didn't bother them). 

Something the hotel can't control is the clientele, but it does affect my stay as a guest. The--ahem--douche factor is pretty high here compared to some other hotels (but not as bad as others like Planet Hollywood). I about fainted in the elevator from one guest's thick coating of Axe body spray.

But, overall, you won't go wrong by staying here, but there are better places... if you fit my demographic, I guess. If you're a low-to-mid twenties douche nozzle that loves to see and be seen... and party all night... Bellagio for you!",0,0,0

Long e-check-in line and a chaotic, overcrowded check-in area. 

Room location was okay, but way overpriced for the quality and lack of amenities - $39 resort fee plus taxes on the resort fee!! 

Room service menu was not in sync with what they had available, although they apologized that our room had an outdated menu. Food was cold and dried out by the time we got it.  

Next morning, housekeeping was making the rounds quite early, so I told them we won't be needing anything at the moment. They told us to call when we were ready. We called three times, they never came! They apologized, again, and said they thought we didn't need anything for our entire stay! On the last evening, we had arranged for late check out the following day. By 8:45 in the morning, housekeeping was knocking at the door!! So much for sleeping in and late check out!

Pool service was non-existent. We lounged at the pools all three afternoons, and not once did a server stop to offer us drinks\/food. We went up to the main bar, and there was only one bartender for 8-10 people waiting to order. He did a wonderful job and kept a great attitude, but he clearly should have had help as it took about 25 minutes to get our drinks. The only time we saw help at the pool was when they corralled everyone to leave! The pool closes way too early. 

There was a problem with the billing, as the in-room TV app didn't reflect our paid deposit\/credits, so we had to take time out of our stay to speak with the front desk to straighten that out, but it was done to our satisfaction.  

Positives were the hotel was beautiful, clean, and most employees we encountered in the shops, at the front desk, at the casino, at the M Life desk, and from housekeeping were friendly and courteous. 

Overall, not enough bang for the buck in our favor, so we'll probably stay elsewhere next time.",0,0,0

If you are not a VIP, they put motion sensitive AC in your room and it turns off when you sleep.  I had no idea what the heck was happening.  I would wake up feeling like I was suffocating in the middle of the night and move the covers.  I would then be freezing.  This repeated all night.  I called in the a.m. to have the AC looked at because our room never really cooled down.  When the repair man came, he told me about the VIP air.  I could not believe it.  If I had known there would be no AC at night in the summer I would never have stayed there.  I am sure this hotel is fine during the winter, but avoid it during the summer unless you are a VIP.  Not sure what that entails . . .  but it is the only way you get the AC at night.",2,2,1

I have been an M-Life card member since 2007 and have visited LV and this hotel as well as many others in the M Life group multiple times. This was the first time I have really been to LV with a child. My spouse and I were in line at the M Life desk with our child to redeem comps we had earned with the Bellagio. The woman at the desk was very rude to us about our child being on the ""gaming floor"". My child was NOT on the gaming floor or near any tables or machines. In LV the carpets are generally well marked as gaming floor and pedestrian traffic. We were definitely not on the gaming floor. She told us we needed to leave and we explained to her we were in line to redeem comps at her desk. She still insisted we leave. My spouse went up to the desk to talk to her. I told her we were not on the gaming floor and she called security on me! I've never been treated so rudely at a casino or hotel or anywhere in the hospitality industry, ever!! She finally agreed to let my spouse bring my ID to her and redeem my comps for me. While I was getting my ID out to hand to him another person came by and told me I couldn't stand there. I explained to him what I was doing and he was rude also. I was really disappointed with the way they treat rewards members there. There was NO reason to be so rude. They could have informed us kindly or inquired as to why we were standing there but they didn't. All casinos have the same rules in LV but none were rude to us or to any other families that we witnessed there.
The buffet at Bellagio is amazing and well worth the money if you're going to splurge for a $25+ meal. They offer Gluten-free options and have a variety of food for both vegetarians as well as others. The service staff was kind though not overly-friendly.

The buffet is incredible! The pool is heavenly, and the the Pool bar and grill is a hidden gem.

I like the walkway through the mall to Caesars Palace.  You also have access to the Vdara beyond the spa and conservatory. While there, you can access the tram which can take you to the Monte Carlo, Excaliber, Luxor, and Mandalay Bay.

The free valet parking is a perk, but it's not difficult to self park, provided you can find a space.

Con - CASINO SMOKE \/ The casino smells horribly of cigarette smoke. You will discover this the moment after obtaining the room keys as you must go thru the casino to arrive at the the room elevators.

Con - ROOM SMOKE \/ Our ""non-smoking room"" smelled of smoke. In fact, the entire floor did. MANAGEMENT, how about having NON SMOKING FLOORS VS. placing non-smokers next to smokers on the same floor? 

Con - DRINKS \/ The 'complimentary drinks' served while gambling is juice and ice. Just maybe they add a drop of whatever liquor you ordered.

Con - HOTEL RESTAURANTS \/ We found the restaurants are far over priced and didn't end up eating at the hotel.


THE BIGGEST CON - Upon leaving our room after our two nights stay we left a $5.00 tip for the housekeeper as we have the day before. Well, after checking in at the Trump for a one night stay,  we realized that we left behind our toiletries in the shower stall at the Bellagio. We called lost and found and were told that our things were not turned in by housekeeping. They asked that we call back the next day which we did however once again was told that our belongings did not appear. So... the Bellagio staff basically stole from us. In our desire to leave this smoky environment to stay at the non-smoking Trump property where we could breath as we sleep, we left our nearly new $30.00 shower gel that was an X-Mas gift, $18.00 shampoo, and a newer $9.00 razor. 


Pros - Check in was smooth and the rep was very friendly. As a matter of fact, all employees we encountered were kind.

Pros - Our room was very nice and well appointed. The only problem is that it smelled of smoke.

Pros - The property is beautiful. The art gallery is grand. The pool area looks really amazing.

My niece stayed here on a bachelorette weekend in mid June. 
Their room was robbed whilst they were out of the room for lunch, for about an hour and a half. When they got back to their room, neither of their cardkeys would work, and they had to get Security to let them into the room.

Their room had been robbed, and their laptops, jewelry, credit card, and some cash were stolen, along with my niece's passport and visa, and work ID. 

The hotel told them that the Risk Management team were gone for the weekend, and nothing could be investigated. The hotel lied and told them the police had been called on the day of the robbery.  They were not called, and did not come to talk to the women until the next day.  

The Bellagio managers were NOT helpful at all, did not call to check on the women, offered them no compensation, and in fact, CHASTISED them for talking about the robbery in the halls where it was overheard by a maid.  ""Is there still a problem?""  Yes, asshats, there is still a problem! 

The Bellagio told them that a man (whose name they know from HIS card key, supposedly), tried to access their room ""several times"" while they were gone for the hour and a half, but he was ""unsuccessful"" in getting in. They say that no one entered their room.  Really? Then where is all their stuff? Did the maid take it (doubtful)? Why did their card keys not work when they got back?
 
The Bellagio has claimed NO responsibility, despite their knowledge and admission that there are cardkeys out there that can access rooms.  They have offered no help, no compensation, and say that nothing happened as there was no record of anyone entering their room. 

DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL. This robbery was not the only one on the weekend of June 15th.

Nevada done right, that's how to describe a stay at Bellagio.  This was the third time that my wife and I have stayed here, and they truly to understand how to do things correctly.

The room was in great shape, and it was maintained that way the whole time that we stayed, although not by us.  Housekeeping visited our room at least twice each day, and the afternoon visit included chocolates on the night stand.  The turndown service is a dying thing, but it is truly appreciated, and we enjoyed the fresh towels as our trip to the pool exhausted our supply.   

Beyond the hotel room that we stayed in, the property looks like it's brand new.  If you really looked hard you'd be able to find some faults (I think I saw some missing grout in the shower), but now being something like 18 years old, it's astonishing how nice the hotel continues to look.  The art is incredible, the glass is breathtaking, and the place is dust free, making it all the more inviting.

There are some great places to eat here.  Over time I've gotten to eat at Prime and Olives, and I'm looking forward to eating at Michael Mina.  When we arrived we were hungry, and so we pounced on the buffet, and it included a plethora of fresh food items.  The smoked salmon was some of the best that I've had in my life, and my cut of prime rib was about ¾ an inch thick, and that's truly the tip of the iceberg of my consumption at this buffet.

The table games limits looked high to me, but I don't game and so it's not a problem, but you should know that the minimums I saw were always $10 and higher per hand.  Maybe I wasn't seeing everything, but that is what I saw.

The water show continues to be incredible.  I've seen it several times before, and I continue to think it's one of the best free events on the strip.

Great hotel, maintained nicely, comfortable environment.  There is not a lot more to ask for, and so the extra money is well worth it.  We'll be back.",6,1,3

As for the actual hotel itself, I will discuss here two types of rooms I've stayed in: standard rooms with the two queen-sized beds in the Main Tower versus standard rooms with a king-sized bed in the Spa Tower. 

The number of beds doesn't change the overall quality of the room; which tower you stay in does.

The Spa Tower is newer and shinier but a bit of a walk from the casino floor. I personally didn't care because I needed closer access to Vdara, Aria, and Cosmospolitan, and the Spa Tower's entrance is fairly near the tram and walkway. I remember the Spa Tower rooms distinctly having closets.

In my opinion, the older Main Tower does not have as nice a bathroom as the Spa Tower but is at the heart of the hotel and much closer to the casino floor. The actual beds are probably equal in comfort in either tower.

Obviously, if you can score a room high up and with a view of the fountains (in either tower) that would be the best case scenario. Note, however, that you CANNOT hear the music that accompanies the fountains from the Spa Tower.

Non-fountain view rooms pale in comparison; get the upgrade.",3,2,2

During Memorial Day Weekend, we booked two queens, only to be told upon check-in that only rooms with a single king bed were available. We entered our room and were greeted by an extremely strong smell of what seemed to be some sort of fragrance used to cover up the smell of cigarettes (this was a non-smoking room). The smell was unbearable, so, I adamantly requested another room with two queen beds the following morning. They reprogrammed our keys and gave us the new room number. I went to the new room and found out that they gave us another room with a single king! I called the front desk again and finally got a room with two queen beds. Everything should be smooth sailing now, right? Wrong! Our sink had a plumbing issue that caused it to make loud draining noises every hour or so.  Definitely not what I expect from a top tier Vegas hotel, and I've stayed at quite a few of them.

Now for gambling. One thing I like about Bellagio is that they have a good number of Pai Gow tables. Most casinos on the strip only have two tables going. The Bellagio has about five tables going in the Asian section, next to Noodles Restaurant (talk about segregation!). The table minimums during holiday weekends are usually $25-$50, versus $10 on normal days. I also wanted to play Baccarat, but the two tables they had going were both $100 minimums.

With a simple and easy reservation system and a planned visit to Las Vegas, I finally got my chance.  The room was described as deluxe and was it ever!  Enormous, with two queen beds, a large, well-appointed marble bath, and a fantastic view of the fountains below.  I won't say how much I paid, but it was far less than some pretty ordinary hotels in some pretty ordinary places.  All the staff was professional without being cloying, even with a staggering drunk friend traipsing through the lobby with me at 3 am  -- my one complaint was that our ""tower"" was so far from the entrance - they couldn't have been nicer.  I liked the fact there was security at the elevator entrances, something I missed at other Las Vegas hotels.  The spa and fitness center is the best I've experienced in Las Vegas, and unfortunately the policy now is that it is reserved for guests only.  I guess too many people caught on to a good thing!

1) Bobby pins on the carpet next to the bed
2) Clock was more than two hours off
3) Number plate for the room fell off the wall in the hallway
4) Door handle to the bathroom was falling apart
5) Shower valve handle came off
6) Shower head caked with minerals
7) Bathroom vanity covered with water spots
8) Dental floss on the carpet in front of the bed

I reported the first two issues on my first morning, and the clock was correct later in the day. I mentioned the remaining issues to an assistant manager at the front desk on my last morning there. She offered to adjust the room rate or provide meal vouchers, neither of which were useful to me since I was staying as part of a convention where all of that was covered. I just asked that she make sure the issues were fixed for future guests.

Back in my room, waiting for check-out, I got a call from the ""amenities department"" as they had a delivery for me. Turns out the front desk sent an apology card and a nice assortment of snacks for my troubles. Since it wasn't a chain hotel where I could request points as compensation I figured this was good enough and I'd be on my way.

When I was on my flight home I got an updated folio from the hotel showing a single charge: a tip for $1.61 for delivery of an amenity to the room. Yes, that's right. They charged me a tip for the delivery of the apology gift they sent me.

I e-mailed the front desk and the charge was reversed, but no apology was given.

What did I love? The elevators were close to the pools. What did I really really love? I loved Cypress...the pool area where you pay extra ($75 when I was there, but it varies) and you are in an area that is ultra high service with great lounge chairs and towels. LOVED IT...best $75 I've ever spent and Jennifer and Joseph who worked the area were terrific.

Upon arrival I tried the $20 sandwich trick at check-in (except I did it with a $50. Hey, it's Vegas.) The gentleman checking me in tried to upgrade us to a suite but was unsuccessful. Said the best he could do was move us to a higher floor. We took it, and that's when things went south.

The first night in the room our air conditioner didn't work and was frozen, constantly dripping condensation onto the vents. I called the desk the next morning and they said the would send someone up to fix it. That never happened, and after we returned from lunch, I called back and asked for a new room of comparable or better quality. The gentleman said he had moved us up 7 floors to the 27th floor, a room identical to the one we were in.

Unfortunately, our room keys didn't work in the elevator, and we spent half an hour just getting to the room, which caused us to be late for our dinner reservation -- but it gets better. When we finally got to the new room, it was a double queen -- not a king room.

At this point we'd had it. I called the front desk perturbed, and was told by a clerk the only thing she could do was offer me a $50 food and beverage credit and transfer us to a room on the 10th floor. I told her that simply wouldn't do, and after haggling back and forth, said I needed to speak to a manager.

The manager proved to be helpful, as she moved us to a fountain view room in the main tower on the 25th floor and upped our food and beverage credit to $100. In the end, they tried to make it right, but for $250-300 per night, I shouldn't have to deal with switching rooms twice, a broken air conditioner and rude hotel clerk.

All things considered, the hotel itself is very nice, the rooms are clean, the view is marvelous and the location is perfect. Smack dab in the middle of the Strip next door to Caesar's Palace and equidistant to pretty much everything.",0,0,0

For the thousands I paid to stay here for my husbands birthday, I expected great service, great amenities, and a luxurious room but not so much what we got. I was thinking - This is the Bellagio! It will be all things magical - come to find - all sluggish and bland. 

I paid for two rooms, both connected to each other. Both rooms looked like they were designed in the 60's. They were a mustard yellow, with dirty sheets that were picking up dust. Even the hallways looked so drab and muggy. It could have been a room taken from Motel 6, just cleaner. 

The front desk attendants were friendly and helpful. They concierge - not so much. The guy had no idea where our room was, regardless of the fact that we told him three separate times and he nearly lost our bags! They couldn't find our ticket stub and when we called the concierge service, they acted as if there was zero explanation - luckily after calling twice and describing every item on our cart, they found it and brought it to our room - 45 minutes later! 

Unfortunately the two best things about the Bellagio were the robes in our rooms and the pool but too bad it closes at 5 PM.

So basically at the Bellagio in the pit everyone hates upper management.  They all are disgusted by the stupid policies the crappy treatment and the shitty benefits.  The company made the worst mistake in the history of US construction.  (City Center) and they are billions in debt but the upper echelon continues to pay themselves bonuses.  The front line worker is just a cog in the big machine.  They waste money, they cut a nickel and lose a dollar.  It is so poorly managed that most of the old time customers long for the days of the mob run casinos.  At least these guys knew how to treat people.  They were neighborhood guys with big hearts looking to make a buck and feed their family.  So they skimmed a little.  So a few people got killed or beat up.  What the current corporate structure does is loot the place at the expense of the shareholder.  Jim Murren is the leader of a band of ivy league educated fools.  guys who dont know the first thing about dealing with a pissed off cuatomer.  The only thing they care about is preserving their job and bonus.  Here is a good stock tip for ya.  Short MGM it is behemoth that is going to crumble...destined to fail.  The door will never shut because it is ""too big to close"" but it will be broken up and reorganized.  This I guaruntee and all the corporate turds running the show will all be looking for jobs.

I was there for a bachelor party.  We booked eight rooms.  Expedia put on a request -- not a demand, but a request -- that the eight rooms be situated near one another.  When we checked in, the front desk said that they couldn't get the rooms all next to each other, or even in the same hallway.  But they might be able to get them on the same floor.  I said that was fine.

When we checked out, we learned that for the ""courtesy"" of trying to place our rooms on the same floor (an attempt that failed, by the way), we'd be charged $30 per room, per night.  And that's on top of their $20 per day per room ""resort fee,"" mind you.  Because we'd never been told about such a ""room guarantee"" charge -- not at booking, not at check-in -- we protested.  How can we be charged something that we'd never agreed to, or even been notified of?  Well, because nickel-and-dime Bellagio says so.  

Is the hotel ""nice""?  I guess so, but not nearly as nice as it was five years ago.  Are the rooms nice?  Sure.  Are they so much nicer than other hotels that this nickel-and-dime BS is defensible?  To quote Jack Donaghy, ""Absolutely not!""

The room we had was EPIC, although it was at the end of an extremely long, never ending hallway. Let me tell you about our room: we had a living room, dining room, a spacious bar area, and THREE bathrooms, one fit with a STEAM SHOWER. There were TVs in 2 of the bathrooms. Our room was a smoking room, so we could watch tv, use the bathroom, and smoke AT THE SAME TIME. Where in the world are you able to do that besides at this hotel? 

Compared to other hotels, the Bellagio has the best floor plan. Caesar's Palace and the Venetian seem like it was built haphazardly. Like there was an original floor plan but as the hotel became more successful, the managers decided to build extension upon extension, making a maze. Bellagio is very straight forward, and even if you have a terrible sense of direction, there are plenty of signs that will guide you. 

Another thing that's great about this hotel is the location. Across from Planet Hollywood where I can get Fat Tuesdays and Earl of Sandwich, next door to Cosmopolitan for Marquee, and a connecting bridge to Caesar's Palace? That's all I need in Vegas.",1,0,0

It's classy, well decorated and has a stream show in the suite. But of all the amenities there are two that are must haves for me. Soap & coffee. They had soap, so well done there. But no in-room coffee! A crime against humanity in my book. 

You can keep the extra bathroom, giant sitting area, and dinner table. Where's the coffee? I don't need a TV built-in to the mirror in the bathroom, I need coffee. I don't want push button shades; I want coffee. It doesn't even have to be good coffee. Third world countries have coffee. This is a massive oversight on the managements behalf.  

With as many choices as there are on the strip, I can find a place that's quality and has coffee. If you are a coffee addict or just want tea in the morning to get going, choose another hotel.",4,5,2

But if you're younger and looking for the club scene and the beautiful people, go elsewhere.

The Bellagio is upscale, but also a little retro in my opinion. The rooms have antiquated decor-mahogany armoires, heavy curtains and 1970's lamp shades. The bathrooms are large with vases glued down around the edges of a deep bathtub (very proactive Bellagio, very proactive). And of course if you fork up the big bucks, you're going to get a great view of the strip. 

But again, if you're twenty or thirty something, go blow your wad (of dollaz) in another hotel with a cool club attached to it (free entrance for guests typically). In Vegas, you probably won't even be spending that much time in your room. So, no matter where you stay, enjoy your friends and the ability to drink on the streets!",8,7,5

This visit, however, we decided to spend the extra $ and stay at The Bellagio. 
The Bellagio hotel is quite beautiful. We had a fountain view room and absolutely loved it!
The reason for the 4 stars is because my teenaged daughter got stuck in a Bellagio elevator with 3 other guests for 10-15 minutes and the circumstances that happened afterwards....
After the Bellagio staff got the elevator to work again, she was met with a guest services employee who asked her numerous questions. And she was promised a $75 dining credit to a restaurant of choice on the property. About 10 minutes after her return, I received a phone call to our room from an employee asking how she was doing and if there are any questions or concerns I have for them. 
The employee never offered the restaurant credit!!
After hanging up, I thought that this was wrong (because they had offered all the ""stuck"" guests a dining credit, but never offered it on the phone or how it works.) So I called back and mentioned their promise. The employee was apologetic and gave me the $75 credit as promised to my daughter.
Our choice was the breakfast buffet at the Bellagio.
At checkout, it was awkward. 
We were charged and I explained.
The wait time was unsatisfactory.
Luckily there were notes, but it seemed like an eternity for the man at the check out counter to expedite the process...
In summary, it was an enjoyable stay. A beautiful hotel, but I think I will stick with the Mirage in the future. :)",0,0,0

However, one thing I was not pleased with was the fact that our AC was broken over the 2 nights that we were staying there. Not to mention, our boss who reserved the room is a gold member. My speculation was that either the AC unit was frozen over or perhaps was missing freon to keep the suite cool. To ""rectify the issue"" we were given a standing fan to use as an alternative as the AC was down... Let me elaborate on the maintenance tech. The technician came into the suite (housekeeping was also there assisting us in that moment) and went straight to work. He cleaned the vents\/air filter and did a few other things which took him a total of 30 minutes or so to take care of. When he left, I checked the thermostat and surely enough my temperature was set at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. WHAT?! Anyone knows that bringing down the temperature that low will freeze over the AC unit. For this being my first time in Vegas, this was not enjoyable. Not to mention Vegas is HOT enough.

We opted to splurge a bit for a premium fountain view room, and...wow. Check out my picture for the view from our room (room number 27052, if you're curious).  This was one of the highlights of the trip for us -- watching the fountain show with the music synced to it on our TV in the room never got old.

Anyway, we were both Vegas first-timers, and from a location standpoint the Bellagio is pretty much perfect. Take note that the strip is much longer and more spread out than you'd think, so no matter where you stay there will be quite a bit of walking involved. That said, the Bellagio is in the center of it all.

The property is beautiful (did I mention the fountains?), the room was gorgeous and spacious, and all staff we encountered were top-notch.  Special shout-out to our server at the bottomless mimosa brunch buffet...suffice to say, we had a little difficulty staggering back to our room at 9:30 am because she never let our glasses get empty.  

Walking through the hotel lobby will usually be a chore because of the huge crowds gawking at the glass sculpture on the ceiling, but that was fine with us.

Note to gamblers: play blackjack at the Bellagio! Blackjacks still play 3:2 (unlike 6:5 at lots of other Vegas casinos) and I was able to find $10-$15 tables at all times with relative ease.  Dealers were generally friendly.

We ate the Prime Restaurant -- fantastic. See my separate review for that. We also ate at the buffet -- pretty good. See my separate review for that as well.

Our only issue was the pool. Plenty of other reviewers indicated that there are always plenty of chairs at the pool...we didn't think so.  I hate to dock a full star for this, but we were planning on spending a good portion of a day poolside, and weren't able do that because the only available chairs were in the shade.

Well anyways, in the lounge of the suite you get an unlimited supply of chocolate covered strawberries, soda, juices, water, cookies, pastries, and alcohol! I think I ate about 20 chocolate covered strawberries over the period of two days. =]

The buffet is okay, not all the food is good. They should get a better sushi chef and a better cook for the chinese foods. Other than that everything else is great. I would say the cafe near the garden has better food than the buffet.

The Bellagio Spa is the greatest! I had a 50 minute massage and I thought I was in heaven. The spa area has the usual spa stuff. I am only 21 years old and I was about 20-40 years younger than all the people there! They looked at me like I was lost, hhahaha.

We drove up to the Bellagio, and signaling a bellhop was simple. Raised my arm and looked directly at a gentleman who came running. This was Julien. He immediately welcomed us to Bellagio.

A long history, winding back many years when my World of Warcraft guild was going to have a meet up there, but the guild split before we ever could get together in real life.  But from that time, I was intrigued by the Bellagio.  I have been to Vegas before but never splurged on the Bellagio, because it is rather pricey.  Then I started worrying that there was no way it could live up to my rather high expectations.

Fear not!  It really was THAT awesome, and it was worth waiting for.  And now I'm spoiled, and worried that I can never go to Vegas again without staying here, because there's just no way to top this.  

I followed the advice of a fellow poster and got the fountain-view room.  It was a bit more expensive, but so worth it.  You can listen to the music and see the fountains from the comfort of your own room, and then post pics on Facebook and make all your friends super jealous.

The room looked like it had been recently renovated.  Big screen TV, tons of outlets to plug in all of the essential geek devices.  Modern and comfortable decor.

Oh, and the bathroom.  I must dedicate a paragraph to this.  Spacious stand up shower, and a bath tub.   I didn't want to get out, it was perfect for soaking my sore legs from all the walking.  I want to redo my bathroom at home now!

We went to a couple of the restaurants.  Olives was amazing.  Get a seat on the patio and you can have a front row seat to the fountains (I couldn't get enough of them).  You may get a little wet though depending on how the wind is blowing.  There's also a 24 hour convenience store type place right by the elevators.

The pools were nice.  A bit crowded, but this was EDC weekend.  I like that there are fountains in the pool, so I could play in those as well.

There's a beautiful botanical garden and tons of high-end shopping if that's your thing.

The staff was all very attentive.  Check in and check out were very quick and easy.  Seems that there's always a free taxi waiting at the front, we had no wait at all.

My last review was on the Aria and I found the Aria an outstanding resort.  My stay at the Aria was July 2012.  The stay at the Bellagio was November 11 to 15, 2012.  I was travelling on business and had a confirmation that needed to be amended.  I tried the 1-877 number on a number of occasions and was never successful getting through.  I arrived at the hotel on the 11th and proceeded to the front desk to check in.  I explained to the checkin lady (Jodi) that I was frustrated with their 1-877 number and she did not care in the least.  She advised that she was going to place me in one of the ""newly renovated"" rooms.  I obtained the keys and lugged my baggage across the entire casino.  Enter the room on the 16th floor and commenced unpacking.  Part way through I went to enter the bathroom and found the light switch snapped in half.  This meant I could not turn the light on.  I called the front desk and advised them of the issue.  Again I was met with someone that did not care.  She said I would be moved and tried to swap my keys to the new room.  She could not do it so I was told I would have to wait at the room for the bellhop to arrive.  It was at this point that I would have expected a typical Vegas ""upgrade"" for my troubles.  Instead I was met with person after person that did not care in anyway.  The bellhop arrived and said ""I guess I am here to help you move rooms.  I took the keys to the new room and moved myself....I did not see the need to endure his poor attitude why I moved.  They also ensure the move was convenient by making me move to a room on a separate elevator bank.  This meant returning with bags in tow to the lobby then into another bank of elevator and up to the new room.  Once at the new room is was as average as the other.  Simple room with a view of nothing.   The rest of the trip was as I should have expected....packed Casino with very impersonal service.  While I know both resorts are MGM properties let me clearly state...if you want a great experience with friendly service head to the Aria.  If you want to be treated like crap and be just another customer in the land of packed casinos...take the Bellagio.  Aria is 5 stars and the Bellagio needs to be downgraded to a 3 star at best.

I'm not into gambling and basically only visit there to celebrate special events with friends and family, as was this most recent trip.  I will however fairly review the Bellagio and its amenities based on other resort experiences and not on the fact that they're located in a city I do not like.

Hotel - Our suite was incredible - well-appointed, sparkling clean, spacious, great views, top floor. By booking a suite, guests are entitled to free transportation (via limo) to and from the airport, private check-in (Chairman's Lounge), and some exclusive discounts and comps (free meals, spa credits, etc).  There are keyed elevators and suite guests can also utilize a private elevator system away from the main elevators.  There are also designated concierge and guest services reps, however we found them to be less than helpful or knowledgeable.  My biggest complaint is that smoking is allowed, even in the suites, and that is the main reason I cannot score the hotel higher.  I'm very sensitive to the smoke and feel miserable around it.  There is an ozone system to clean the air but my eyes and sinuses were still bothered by the smoke.

Casino - I really don't feel equipped to review or rate their casino as I don't participate in gambling and cannot be around the smoke.  It seemed to always be crowded when we'd pass through so I guess that's a good thing.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay here but it is not cheap and you really have to pay attention to the time if you want to get into certain restaurants or shows.  Research discounts and deals before you go.  Several hotels and resorts belong to larger corporate groups and they give loyalty bonuses and discounts to their guests.",1,0,0

We visit Vegas regularly, but usually stay at The Wynn. These past couple stays, we decided to try something different. We'd heard good things about Bellagio, so off we go.

First stay review:
We booked 2 rooms directly. We asked for non-smoking & joining rooms. We called the morning before we left to confirm our reservation. Again, non-smoking, joining rooms. The lady we spoke with confirmed this was not going to be a problem.

Upon arrival, not only were we checked into smoking rooms, the rooms were on different floors. In fact, to go up to our rooms, we had to use separate elevators. The front desk confirmed the rooms were non-smoking, but as soon as the elevator doors opened, we were greeted by cigarette smell. We asked to be reassigned. One of the rooms was assigned right away, but we were told that was the only non-smoking room available at the moment. But,  if we checked back in 2 hours, the other room should be ready. Fine, we went out, did out things and we checked back in 5 hours later, only to be told, no, there was no more non-smoking rooms available. WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO THE ONE YOU PROMISED US 5 HRS AGO? I asked to speak to the manager, only to be told, oh wait a second, we would upgrade you to a non-smoking suite. Okay, that's more like it. We weren't asking to be upgraded, but who would say no to an upgrade? 

We ended up with one suite and one deluxe room. I don't know why anyone would want to pay extra for the suite. The difference between the two rooms were only the ""nicer brand"" chocolate and slippers they provided you in the suite. The rooms themselves were exactly the same from what we could tell.

Besides the problem we encountered with our rooms assignment, our stay was uneventful. The hotel is smacked in the middle of the strips, so location wise, it's great. Giving it 5 stars for the location if I must. 

Second and last stay:
Despite our problem with our previous stay, we decided to give Bellagio a second chance. This time, we booked one King deluxe non-smoking room. Again, I had requested for non-smoking. I understand that it's normal thing for indoor smoking in Las Vegas. However, just because I like Las Vegas, it doesn't mean I want to smell cigarette first thing when I wake up.  We were told by the booking agent this was not going to be a problem and she had noted it in our reservation. Again, we called that morning and the reservation agent confirmed our non-smoking king size deluxe room.

When checking in, again, I asked specifically to be assigned to a non-smoking room. The lady at the desk told us, they only had king-smoking room or double-non-smoking room available. We chose the double room. We're assigned a room in a different tower as previous stay. As soon as we got into the elevator, I noticed that in the elevator, all the non-smoking floors had ""non-smoking signs"" on them, and guess what, our floor didn't have that sign. I should have gone back to the front desk, but didn't.  Just as suspected, our room was smoking room. In fact, the whole floor was a smoking floor. Our room reeked of cigarette smell. We thought the girl must have had assigned us to a King-smoking room instead of double-non smoking, but the room had double beds. 

We marched ourselves back down asking to be reassigned. This time, we didn't get lucky. A different person helped us and pretty much told us that it was our fault that we didn't get the room we had requested because we came late (FYI, we checked in around 5pm. We had checked in later in different hotels and never had such problems!) They didn't have any more non-smoking rooms available, not even a suite (we had agreed to pay the difference if they had one available). All he could offer was to send housekeeping over to our room and try to get the smell out (FYI, it didn't help). We had no choice but to take the room. We did ask to be transferred to another room the next day, and there was no problem with the transfer.

So, that pretty much summed it up. The hotel itself is beautiful. Again, great location. However, the staff were rude, not accommodating or professional. For supposedly a five star hotel, we expected more. Customer Service is very important in our book, and they failed greatly at that. 

After my review was posted on a travel review site, I was contacted by one of their Guest Services reps to resolve the problem. I did  try to contact him back, but never heard back. So, do they really want to resolve the problem? I think not.",3,0,1

A couple of friends and I made it to our room around 3am on a Friday night, 2 minutes after entering our room filled with smoke.  We called the front desk telling them about the situation and they told us they'd send someone up.  We sat outside our room for over 30 minutes waiting..  If it wasn't for a housekeeper to walk by we probably would of never had anyone help us.  Long story short their heaters were the cause of all the smoke.  They were not apologetic about the situation AT ALL.  We complained multiple times about the fact that no one came up to help.

Since they were giving me a 3 day comp. with $200 freeplay I couldn't pass it up. I was checking in around noon time on a friday and was a bit to early I thought. But the manager went out of her way and upgraded us to the 26th floor corner suite. They really did a good job remodeling the rooms from a year ago. First thing I noticed was the 55"" 3D TV on the wall. I remember last year it was a 27"" tube TV. Next I noticed the curtains were all automatic just like Aria! The bathroom was all marble from top to bottom. 
So after I finished unpacking I went to the buffet. WoW $20 only before 4pm. Thats pretty good for a  5 star hotel. The buffet was as good as Wicked Spoon and Aria Buffet. Almost identical menu. Lots to choose from Italian, Asian,American etc. Love the smoked salmon and desserts. Only thing I really didn't like was the prime rib. It was almost well done and dry. Other than that everything else was perfect and great service. 
Lot's of choices in the gaming area but not as much as Paris,Venetian or MGM. But the machines were loose. Won over a grand within 2 hrs of play on the slots. Didn't care to much of the carpet. It's kinda dark in the gaming area. One thing I can say about Bellagio. Out of the 12 Hotels I've stayed Bellagio is the ONLY Hotel where I don't get shocked!
So all in all my 3 days here was awesome. Can't complain when it's free. I would never pay $500 a nite for these rooms. lol 
My only Con was the $600 they took from my debit card for deposit. But returned it back to my account 2 days later after I checked out.

The pool area was so majestic and I felt like a princess, it was so relaxing. I only ordered room service for breakfast and it was good--not the best, but not bad for the $30.00 @ the Bellagio. The room service delivery lady was nice and upbeat, definitely much needed after a crazy night out. The room was nice, but the closet was really small...

This would have been a 4 or 5 star review, except for an issue I had with the little shop (before the elevator near the conservatory). I bought an iPhone 6s charger because I had forgotten mine.It went for $26 and you could tell it wasn't the best quality, but it did the trick. The next day, it stopped working. I know the receipt said, no exchanges or refunds on electronics, but I figured they'd make an exception--since it was clearly a product defect. I went back twice and the ladies said no! I even went to the concierge and asked, they said they knew it was the USB port. Yet, nothing happened. No refund or even a loaner charger. Come on Bellagio...I was really feeling this place.

Will I return? Eventually yes, it's a beautiful and classy place. But the search continues for my Utopia in Vegas!",0,0,0

Good points:
:: Bathroom ~ Love the large bathtub and the ambiance.  The bathtub was so relaxing
:: Closet space ~ Thank you for split closets on the sides of the television.  The split closets also had individualized spaces for shoes, so you could separate them without taking floor space.
:: Chocolate.  2 milk chocolates are left whenever they clean the room.
:: Late check out.  Thank you for allowing us 1.5 hours to relax before our flight.  Nice!

Bad points:
:: Full length mirrors.  Really?  The only full length mirrors are inside the closets that DON'T swing open all the way?  The angle of the two rooms I stayed in were facing away or towards the sun.  Not good Bellagio.  Back light or direct lighting is no good when getting ready.
:: Lighting.  Very sexy and relaxing during the evening.  But if you're getting ready for nighttime clubbing or dinner, then it's not so good.  It would be nice if there was a brightness gauge.  
:: Chocolate.  Boo.  The 2nd room we checked into did not have chocolates.  You forgot =(
:: Shampoo and conditioner.  Could it get any cheaper?  I did bring my own, but thought I would use it one night.  My hair has never felt drier or with the least amount of body before.  Could Bellagio not get a deal with a better company?  =(

The hotel itself is pretty awesome.  Beautiful Christmas decoration set ups, the night life is fun ~ hung out at the Fountain Bar with a live band, ate okay food at the Bellagio Cafe, and okay food at the Snack bar.

I'm a frequent Vegas visitor because not just for some gambling fun, but I love the city itself for being such a fake tourist destination!  What that means is that if I wanted to see the world, all I have to do is drive 4 hours from LA-LV and I'll get to see all there is to offer.  From Tuscany to Paris, New York to Bali, Dingy to Magnificent, you name it, they got it.  It's such an awesome town not to mention the buffet situation that they got there!  No wonder why I love this city so much!

Bellagio!

It's a beautiful name and the hotel itself is magnificent as well.  I still remember back in the days when it was completed and how awesome it was with the fountain show and the look of the building, but now, it still retains that allure of beautiful ""Fake"" Tuscany view"" that they offer.  It never gets old.

The hotel is definitely an upscale location with the focus on classy and rich clienteles, however, their service I gotta say is absolutely fabulous because they treat everyone the same!  (at least from what I saw and what I've experienced)

From checking in we were treated great and was upgraded to a lake view room without additional charge!  Service was fast and friendly and in no time we were in our rooms.  The rooms were decent size, has a slight run down look because it has been here for some time now without much of a renovation job, but still it's in great shape and super clean as usual.  The hallway had the perfect lighting and it just simply felt very nice walking down the aisle to your room.  (I'm not rich guy but this place sure makes you feel like one with very minimal effort!)  One small gripe about this place is that they still don't have LCD TVs....  What's up with that?  But that's ok.... room is still awesome and the view was gorgeous!

Speaking of the view.. we were able to enjoy all the water shows (every 15 minutes!) from the comfort of our room with stereo soundtrack of the water dance.... (well!  look those sad people down there.. in the heat, squeezing each other to death in 105+ weather just to see a water show... I'm in my room with the temperature at 69 enjoying a nice glass of whiskey on ice....sounded so snobby doesn't it?....  But man it feels very nice there!)

Now the casino itself is no joke either.... terrific decoration all around and gaming tables starting from the lowest at $15 for BJs, $10 for WAR, 25 for Pai Gow, $10 for crabs, $10 for roulette, etc... so better have a budget ready if you know what I mean?  But since it caters to a high end clientele, you will see lots of $100+ bets all over the place....  (If only I have that kind of money to burn.....that would be nice.....)

Went over to the pool since it was about 104 the day we spent there... very lovely roman style pool with 6 different pools spawned around the pool area.... 2 larger than full size swimming pools, 3 fountain included pools just for chillin' and R&R, and one small hot tub section as the mingle station!  LOL!  All were really nicely decorated, terrific service, and awesome views all around!

Despite we stayed there we did very little gambling because of the high cost.  However, we did enjoy everything else the hotel had to offer such as the pool, restaurant, bars, conservatory, chocolate fountain, etc..  (hopefully I'll have the time to include each of these that I've mentioned)  But one of the most important things to remember about Bellagio is the following.

Service?  Service..........yes........ we're talkin' about service.........

I've been to Palazzo not too long ago.... super high end hotel but service was slow as snail and wasn't attentive at all.  Bellagio service is no joke.  Everyone from the bellboy to valet to janitor, to reservation clerk to housekeeping to mechanics and to some dude that just work for the hotel was extremely accommodating.  Opening the doors, greeting customers, and housekeeping doing their best to make sure the guest having the best experience possible is completely transparent and on full display.  They will always go out of their way to make sure you feel like a king here!  Just ask the housekeeping ladies for one of the most delicious chocolates from Bellagio and they will make sure you get enough of them while you are staying with them!  They are just so nice all around and all you guys know how much I love a terrific service!  So a good tip was left for every single place we visited while we were in the hotel!

One final tip!  For me, I'm not rich enough to stay in Bellagio on a consistent basis, but a good way like we did is to pool the money by having some friends to go along and everyone split the cost!  This way you can save cost while enjoying one of the best hotels available out there in the world. 

So next time you are in Vegas and have a little bit of money to spend, save yourself a few hands from the blackjack table and give Bellagio a stay!  I'm sure you will love it!",18,10,14

My cousin lost his ID at ""The Bank"" (club inside Bellagio). The next morning, we called up the security lost & found who collects everything left behind at The Bank the night before. They said they couldn't help and would need 24 to 48 hours to process everything. I said, well he has a flight soon, so can we just come to the Lost and Found and sift through it. They said no. Nothing can be released for at least 24 hours.

First off that is a ridiculous rule especially when it comes to Identification purposes. What are you going to do in Las Vegas without an ID showing that you're 21 years of age? As a result we then called the concierge. Evelyn answered the call. I let her know the situation. She said she couldn't help and that we should file a police report and to use that paperwork to get onto the flight at the airport. I said, wouldn't it be easier if you just walked 50 feet to the L&F and sifted for my cousin's ID instead. Just look for a Michigan license. And she said she couldn't and wouldn't do that. Horrid service. 

Bottom Line, eventually my cousin did find someone at the front desk to go the extra mile, but that was literally 5 hours after starting the process. I don't believe this would have happened 5 years ago. Service is deteriorating at the Bellagio. Evelyn and the other 4 people we spoke to, really need to be re-trained.

There are so many people walking through that you are very slowed down when you're trying to leave. None of the other hotels we visited over the weekend were as crowded as the Bellagio.

Here are my complaints:

1. My room was super hot and uncomfortable because the staff turned off the air condition! It had just driven an entire day in the desert heat, lugged my bags to the room and I am greeted by no AC because they are trying to be green. Ugh, this is VEGAS, its not suppose to be green. By the way, turning the AC on pull blast did not cool down the room for like 6 hours. 

2. They will not change the bed sheets unless I read this stupid little card about how making them change the sheets is going to destroy the environment and place it on my bed. This is gross in my opinion. The housekeeping staff need to change the sheets for good house keeping unless you ask them not to.( not the other way around)  

3. The mini bar would charge you if there was any weight difference places on it. Lets say you throw a toy football and it hits this minibar, they will assume you took something. It also took up valuable real estate in your small room. 

4. Old fashion TV really dated the room. Very small.

Ok, here are the positives. 

1. Best free show in vegas, the water show in front. 
2. Best dessert in vegas, the "" Intense chocolate dessert in their candy shop"" 
3. Beautiful decorated hotel, conservatory, butterfly garden, landscaping on the indoor garden. 

4.The people staying at this hotel are not your jersey shore types or drunk frat boy.
5. Great location to access the Vegas strip and other hotels around, city center,etc.. 


I would recommend this hotel TURN ON THE AC in the guest room so they won't arrive to a sauna from their trip and revamp the rooms with something a lot nicer.

Environment:
Amazing from the outside. It's known for the huge fountain and its nightly shows with music and coordinated water works. The lobby has a grand entrance with a beautifully decorated ceiling and the garden past the lobby lines. The Bellagio is beautiful and gets five stars on the decoration and interior. 
- As a guest, I had to check in at the front, walk all the way through the casino (of course) and then to the guest elevators. The guest elevators are right next to the buffet which means traffic jam! Conveniently, there is a lobby store across from the guest elevators that has everything from drinks to Bellagio robes for purchase. The guest elevators are also conveniently placed close to the back of the hotel and the pool. 
- The pools (are there four?) are spread out and so are patio chairs for lounging, but when I went there were only a few chairs available out of thousands and I went on a Thursday! I can't imagine how packed the pool area is on weekends. I wanted to get a drink but the cocktail waitress never came around so my bf went to the bar and spent $30 on two margaritas. Yikes. Anyway, if you use the pool, be sure to get comfy with those around you because it's a tight squeeze. 
- Cafe Gelato sells gelato obviously and the sorbetto is great too. 
- Cafe Bellagio is next to the garden and the food is decent (that's another review). The only thing I didn't care for was the location of the cafe. It's relatively far from the guest elevators; I guess the floor plan designers wanted guests to eat at the buffet more so than the cafe. Shrug. When I'm on vacation, there's nothing better than rolling out of bed and going to grab a quick breakfast at the hotel's cafe before hitting the pool - I just have to walk a bit further when staying at the Bellagio. 
- The room is nice; the bathroom is the best part with a tub as well as a shower. The shower head is a rainfall shower head which was nice. The bed was not soft and the pillows were hard as rocks! I guess not many people sleep in Vegas so beds were not a priority. 
- Gambling at the Bellagio - don't do it. I have never won, minimum bets are high, and you could probably make your money last longer at another casino (like Planet Hollywood across the street!)

Service:
I was disappointed in the service. The front desk was polite and friendly, but it was downhill from there. The lobby store cashier miscounted my change and then made me wait for her to open the drawer while she filled out paperwork for her manager. The cocktail waitress at the pool was nowhere to be found. The buffet staff was subpar (please refer to my review of the Bellagio buffet) and the cafe staff was dull (to be reviewed soon).

When I went to bed on my first night there, I had the above-bed light on and when I pulled the covers off, there was a big black thread on the sheets.  No big deal, but as I went to brush that off of the bed, I then noticed that there were 3 short beard hairs, bits of what looked like earwax, and a few other black specks of unknown origin.  I probably wouldn't have seen those things if I hadn't had the above bed light on.  The housekeeping manager was apologetic and had the sheets changed, but it was still gross enough that I feel I need to warn people...

1. The fountain shows are approximately 15 minutes apart and run even into the night.

2. You can find comps and room deals both on smartervegas.com and through the MyVegas facebook\/iphone app.

3. There are quite a few famous restaurants in Bellagio and among them in Sensi, check them out near the Bellagio garden exhibits.

4. Bellagio boasts the largest chocolate fountain in the world at their installment of Jean Phillipe Patisserie.

5. They are the last stop on a short tram between the Monte Carlo, Aria, Vdara, and Bellagio with an entrance a little past the gift shop area towards the conference room area.

Bellagio is an iconic hotel. Featured in so many TV shows to movies (remember Ocean's!?) and has been around for quite some time. The hotel is loved by many because of the beautiful fountains that go on a water show every few minutes to the fact that they are a 5 star luxury hotel.

The hotel campus boasts some of the best views on the strip. They are located almost in the middle of the action across from the equally beautiful, but dated Paris Las Vegas and next to the Cosmopolitan and Aria. 

There are many things to do besides gambling when staying at the Bellagio. Their pool is rather famous for its collection of fun fountains to swim under to the more refined atmosphere of other pool goers. I also can't stop raving about their exhibits that they change up every few months. We are about to visit for Christmas and can't wait to see how they've transformed the Bellagio gardens area. 

Besides the gardens and the pool, Bellagio is sandwiched between two high end shopping areas. The Crystals shopping center is reachable by a short tram ride and the Bellagio is connected to its own series of shops.

One of the main attractions of Bellagio is heading to ""O"" the highly acclaimed cirque du soleil show. I've personally never been to the show due to its price, but it comes highly recommended from friends who have been wowed by the experience.

And, of course, I can't forget to mention their own wonderful places to have food. From Jean Phillipe Patisserie which boasts the largest chocolate fountain in the United States and the best cheap eats such as pressed chicken basil paninis, to the more upscale Sensi restaurant, these are all awesome places to check out. Their buffet needs a little updating, but it's still a good stop for those who want to try it.

Now, why after this pretty much gushing review does Bellagio only deserve 4 stars? Well, the rooms are still pretty dated and a little less advanced then the newer Aria Las Vegas. I think that the price point for the Bellagio is a bit too high. They probably estimate the value of their rooms based on the fact that it is one of the most iconic landmarks on the strip.

Still, I prefer the rooms over at the Aria. Good luck to those staying at this awesome place though, I hope you all have a wonderful time!",5,1,3

So, my boyfriend surprised me with a spontaneous trip to Vegas for my bday 11\/28. Surprisingly, we found a SUPER great deal on the suite, which was amazing.

The hotel was ELEGANT and GORGEOUS!!!!  We used the concierge desk to help us book tickets to a few of the shows (which were also great). The person at the desk who helped us was Patti. She was VERY nice, professional, helpful, and had a delightful attitude.  She was so great that we wanted to tip her, but wasn't sure if we should. The bellman were also great and very helpful.

The reason I am giving them only 2 stars is because of a few quirky things that happened....things that you wouldn't expect of a hotel of this magnitude.

1) The first night, we decided to order room service. The food came in a timely manner and was hot and delicious. However, I did ask for my burger to be well done...which it wasn't. I also asked for A-1 Steak sauce but they never sent it. 

1a) The next day we headed out pretty early and returned to the suite around 2:45 am, only to find that our room keys didn't work. So it took them almost a half hour to let us into the room...ugh!

2) Once in the room we see that it hadn't been cleaned....at all. The room service tray with now rotting food was still there. When we tried to speak to someone about it they asked if we would like to put in a request for daily cleaning. HUH???? Even in the shabbiest hotels\/motels daily cleaning is the standard. Apparently, there was no manager who was available to speak with us around 3:30am. Then I asked if they could take the cart with the food out of the room. They said someone should be around in the morning.

That reaction alone and all the hype around the Bellagio got me really excited. 

When I got to the Bellagio I first overwhelmed by the amount of people in the lobby alone. It was huge and filled with people, but definately decorated well. The italian blown glass on the ceiling is amazing. We got a room in the spa tower that which was decent. I'm a regular business traveler and have spent way too many nights in hotels so it takes a little more to impress me. But the bed was really comfortable and the bathroom was nice- double sinks, shower and separate tub. 

The room service is phenomenal. I think I would stay at the Bellagio again just for the room service.haha j\/k But it was good. The casino was always crowded to the point that I was annoyed, it was hard to walk from one end to the other because there were so many guests and tourists walking, stopppign and looking at everythign that was going on.

Those clever dancing fountains. We watched them for hours, listening to the music through the tv. The pink panther one was so cool! And the last one of our 3 day stay was the US national anthem. Perfect ending. 

So very glad we stayed here on the last leg of our honeymoon. Easiest the best hotel have ever stayed in. Room was divine. Overlooking the fountains. With electric curtains. A marble bathtub. Biggest shower I have ever seen. Softest, comfiest bed ever. And lots of little goodies like mouthwash. sewing kits, chocs on pillows etc. 

The Conservatory is breathtaking. Had to hold back tears as walked around all the fresh flowers and general beauty of it all. See it both at night and in the day.

Swimming pools and our door area is outstanding. So Italian and classy. Loved and adored. 

Noodle restaurant is great and well priced. Didn't try buffet as line looked way to long at all times but heard good things.

The Good.....
1. Beautiful common areas
2. Free
3. The amenities rocked!!  In addition to the normal stuff, they also included hairspray, a toothbrush, bath salts and a loofa. (I am not sure if we were given extra stuff because we were on a suite floor or if this is usual)
4. The Buffet (Yum!!)
5. View of Paris from our room at night was stunning
6. Fountain show
7. (Steam) shower was large and had good water pressure
8. Bose clock radio

The Bad.....
1. Crowded common areas
2. The room we reserved was sold out so we were downgraded
3. Customer service was a little suspect; none of the employees went out of thier way to smile or be helpful 
4. The view of City Center from our room.  Yuck!!
5. The room in the spa tower had two beds and one chair.  Only one of us could sit and watch the lake show at a time comfortably.  Seriously, could they not have put a second chair in the room?
6. The toilet faces the shower and there isn't that much space between the two. This seemed like a bad layout.
7. They piled the pillows in shams and the duvets that they (probably) use on the beds in the room.  (This is where the extra chairs should have been.) They never actually made the bed with these items durring our stay.  
8. Television was small, had bad sound and was dated - 27 inch rear projection.  

Overall, I don't think we would pay to stay in this hotel because we always felt that we were an after thought. We stayed at GVR and Palazzo during this trip and thought that there rooms were much nicer in those two hotels and we were treated much more kindly at both of those hotels.",2,0,1

I've stayed in both the spa towers and the casino towers and I'd prefer the casino tower. It feels a little closer to everything. The Jean-Philippe cafe is a great place to have a coffee or pastry. The buffet is great and crowded. The sportsbook is a decent size. Of course the conservatory is a big attraction and it doesn't disapoint. 

I could go on and on about everything in the bellagio but I want to talk about the convenience factor. It's location is perfect to everything.

I was very disappointed when my wife and I first arrived to check in for our room, we were told that the room was booked and no longer available. We just found out we are having a baby, and wanted to watch a concert in Vegas and celebrate with a room with a fountain view. So we chose the deluxe fountain view, weeks in advance. However at check in time, we were bumped from that tower and pushed to the back tower. The receptionist had no reason except that they had overbooked and we could try to get an upgrade the next day. We asked to speak to the manager and she just said he\/she would say the same exact thing. We got an upgrade the next day, after wasting our time the next morning trying to get the next available upgrade and finally move all our things to the correct tower which we had booked in the first place. 

All in all, the hotel was nice, the staff could definitely be improved. Dealing with them made me feel like I was at the DMV or calling the IRS. Caution when booking your room! Do not get too excited to have a fountain view, because when you drive there after 6 hours, you will be disappointed that they gave away that room to someone who just walked in because they don't know how to manage their own hotel. 

Honestly, I would never stay here again. Also the buffet food was not that great. While waiting in line at the Cafe Bellagio they skipped over us and seated several other couples before us, so we just left and went the the Snacks shop which was the best food\/experience at this hotel, gaining them 2 stars.

My recommendation would be to stay at another hotel and just visit the Snack shop and see their decor.",0,0,0

My newest favorite at Bellagio (and it's really not that new, just new to me) is the VIP Cypress Lounge at the pool area. Drop $75 a person, per day, and you get the most comfortable lounger, freebies like mini cups of virgin smoothies, cool cucumbers, and tasty orange sections. More importantly, you get personalized attention when you want it. Service is with a big friendly smile. The patrons there seemed less inclined to show off their bodies and tans, and were a more mellow crowd than the groups fighting over lounge chairs and umbrellas, drinking carelessly, shouting and causing a ruckus. It was so relaxing. This is the only way to do a pool day at the Bellagio!

Another thing I noticed was the abundance of drink attendants throughout the casino. They were actually more personable than ever before. No waiting to flag someone down, having to spend more time at a slot machine because you're tied to it waiting for the server to bring your drink order. 

One of the major standouts to us was that we ate at fewer Bellagio restaurants this time and tried a couple of sister restaurants to Bellagio's greatest Yellowtail (Japanese) and Picasso (French). We ate at the recently opened Kumi (Japanese) at Mandalay Bay and Julian Serrano (Spanish Tapas) at Aria. They were a disappointment, to say the least, compared to their Bellagio outposts. Bellagio definitely scores way ahead of the other MGM properties in the restaurant department. 

As an aside, the new alliance between MGM\/M Life and Hyatt is a real bonus now. If you are a member of both frequent guest programs, you can earn points and stays which is a real plus for us Hyatt die-hards. Stay and spend money at Bellagio (or any other MGM Las Vegas property with a few exclusions) and you can earn Hyatt Gold Passport points and stay credits.

For some reason, no one is immune to the magnificent display. 3. Plenty of 5 diamond restaurants, and 4. The Forum shop is right across the walkway at Caesars Palace.

On the downside, if you don't get a fountain view room, don't bother staying here. Too much foot traffic, very crowded, and not kid friendly. we only stayed here because our little ones love water fountains, waterfalls, and anything water related.

the parking was convenient and free. it is a bit hard to find, but make sure that you take advantage of this rather than the overpriced valet services. our room was spacious and beautiful. we booked the King suite room which had a spacious bathroom with a large tub and shower. there were remote controlled curtains and lights. unfortunately, even being in a nonsmoking room, we could blatantly smell smoke in the bathroom. I am guessing that the vents located in the bathroom area are connected to smoking rooms but it was unpleasant. it was so bad, that I was actually nervous we might get charged if the cleaning crew thought we had smoked. 

although we were well aware that we would be charged for eating or drinking anything from the minibar, I was disappointed that there was no place to put our own personal belongings in the fridge. when paying hundreds of dollars a night for a room, we couldn't even place our water bottles in the fridge without being charged. I understand that this is protocol, but it seemed a ridiculous and money-hungry rule. 

we quickly got over these few annoying things and went out to enjoy our time at the hotel. we spent some time in the casino, had a few drinks at the bars, and then ventured on out to the clubs located in the Bellagio; Hyde and The Bank. My friend experienced extremely rude employees at Hyde. one of the gentlemen laughed in her face when she asked if a certain area was closed for a private party and simply walked away without answering. the bartender did the same thing when she made a somewhat difficult drink request. I was okay with continuing on with our night here at Hyde, but the disrespect forced her to want to leave. 
 
in the morning, a woman of the cleaning crew came to our door at around 8:30am and knocked multiple times until I finally got out of bed to answer. she realized I had been sleeping and asked when we were leaving. I told her that we would be out by 11:00 (checkout time) and she asked if it would be earlier by any chance so she could clean our room. I was baffled. At this point, we packed up our stuff and left early because we felt unwanted.

Half of the group had never been to Vegas so it was great to see how enthralled they were with our hotel over the weekend. I think the Wynn, Bellagio, and Venetian are in a class of their own. You can tell they spend a lot of time and effort to attract a better crowd than places like Imperial Palace or even the Mirage (which smelled like smoke when you walked in). The year of the rat floral exhibit was breathtaking, just like how they like to do it.

The good:

* Beautiful ambiance in the common areas.
* Fantastic central location.
* Lovely shops to drool in.
* Very delicious room service.
* Excellent customer service from everyone we encountered.
* Complimentary upgrade to a Fountain-view partial suite when we let her know it was our anniversary.
* Lovely room with nice lighting and a very comfortable bed.
* Big, beautiful glass shower and good sized bathroom.  Very important to us.
* The light in the closet turns on when you open it.  Nice touch.
* Beautiful pool area.  Comfortable chaises and huge towels.  They responded to the warm weather and at least opened part of the area, even though it was February.

The surprisingly underwhelming:

* Cheap and somewhat dirty fixtures in the bathroom.  
* Underwhelming provided toiletries.
* Low-quality towels and robes.  Not luxurious at all!  
* Noisy.  I'm not sure if it was the specific position of my room but we got quite a bit of noise from other people's toilets flushing and the explosion of the water in the fountain show.  This is not something I typically notice or complain about so it was pretty bad.
* $20\/day resort fee for internet.  You can't tell me their cost for wifi isn't covered by the already high cost of the room.
* Very limited television options.  Obviously, one doesn't come to Vegas to watch TV but when you're laying in bed, eating your delicious room service, you want more than a couple channels.  See above remark about the resort fee.  Isn't this the sort of thing that 20 additional dollars per room\/per night could pay for?

I'm torn about my experience here.  It is a lovely hotel and we were treated very well.  I suppose I expected all of the small details to be as luxurious as their reputation and the cost would suggest.  Many of the highlights of the Bellagio can be enjoyed without staying there.

Incident #2: The person who brought up our luggage to our room (bald guy) had an attitude.

He got this attitude like he didn't want to do it, like it was such a hassle and just tossed it haphazardly.

I'm running on this newfound life motto of ""why not?""  Rather than think too much about things I'd like to do, I just DO IT.  You know?  Like, ""I feel like going to Vegas.  Even if it's just me on my own.""

""Well, WHY NOT?""

Granted, doing Vegas alone is quite a different experience than going with a group of friends, but it's a nice experience nontheless.  Getting to do anything I want, whenever I want without having to meet up with a group at predetermined times.  I just want to get LOST in my own world and so far, it's been very enjoyable and relaxing.

I'll be honest though, I would not have done this spur of the moment trip if it had been the Imperial Palace or Circus Circus offering me complimentary rooms nights.  I can't justify being grossed out and sleeping on box-spring mattresses, even if it's free.

[Full disclosure]

But complimentary rooms at Bellagio? With $150 in Freeplay and a two-for-one ""O"" by Cirque du Soleil tickets (which sadly, I can't use)? I'm so effing there!

*Yesterday* After a 4 hour drive (that flew by surprisingly quick), I pull up to the resort at approximately 6 PM.  I slumped up to the registration desk flustered and ready to unwind...carrying 3 different bags and a heavy sack filled with snacks and bottled water.  The friendly receptionist kindly welcomed me, and after a friendly inquiry, I was upgraded to a strip and fountain view room!  So a complimentary room, with a free upgrade to a gorgeous view of the Fountains of Bellagio.  F YA!  It was as simple as smiling, being friendly, making eye contact and asking politely!  Everything is...""so far, so VERY good.""

Usually when people go to hotels, (especially) five-star hotels, there are a lot of nice things adorning the space.  Like pretty furniture.  Plasma TV's. Plush bathrobes.  Has anybody here actually never had the sinister urge to take these things prior to checking out? (Aside from toiletries and such?)  Let's be honest with ourselves now.  But in my case here, I don't want any of those other things.  If I could get away with it, I would TAKE THE BED and everything part of it. The throw pillows, the mattress, the sheets, the...EVERYTHING.  I have never had such a great nights sleep.  I have stayed at this hotel before, but not when I have an entire King sized bed to myself and sleeping completely buck naked, rolling around in my sleep.  If not for the casino calling out to me from the ground floor, I probably would have dosed off for 24 hours or more.  Those beds are THAT decadent.

There were a few disappointments with the room and a hiccup in service, which doesn't constitute a full 5-star Yelp rating.  Noticed a few things about the room that doesn't go on par with the 5-Diamonds the resort proudly boasts.  I will give it that Bellagio is now an aging 11-year old property.  However, I couldn't help but notice a couple of lights were burned out in the restroom.  The restroom door lock (not like I needed to use it though) was busted.  The air vent panel was loose and coming off the wall.  Also, the front desk swiped my credit card, but I was unable to access the internet or order an in-room movie.  Had to call down and have that fixed.

The casino itself is not that large, but because of the way they designed it into partitioned areas, it seems to go on forever. There's lots of variety in terms of table play options and a vast array of slots in all kinds of denominations (though majority of these machines are really showing their age).

A few other things I've noticed: the hotel's public areas are PACKED with gawkers, like other Yelpers have noted.  It's definitely not a fault of the hotels, if anything, it's doing it's job of drawing in hundreds of spectators  by the hour.  But damn, try squeezing through the sea of flashing SLR's on tripods in the registration lobby and groups of people frozen in still life, with their jaws dropped gazing at the Conservatory Garden displays.

Anyway, I'm off to shower and heading back down to the casino.  Later!

P.S. their turn-down service chocolates are divine.  I could eat a whole bag of those in one sitting.",22,14,14

What I like:
- It's the fucking Bellagio.  While that probably meant more 10 years ago, it's still a great casino to stay\/visit.
- Rooms are nice and pretty comfortable.
- The location is excellent - right in the middle of the strip.
- The restaurant options are solid.  I actually liked the Le Cirque here better than in NYC (better service IMO).
- Buffet is good.  While it's not the best in town anymore, it's still pretty decent.
- Beautiful garden and lobby area.

What I don't like:
- As expected the table games cost more here.
- Love the luxury stores but wished they had more mid-tier shopping options
- Traffic in this area sucks ass.  Here's where the prime location can also suck.

Generally speaking you can't go wrong staying here.  But if you're not a high roller or in the mood to spend a ton to eat all the time, you may want to gamble\/dine at one of the many casinos nearby.",1,1,2

But if you're one trying to get to bed early, the sounds of the water crashing down and the bright lights have you tossing and turning all night.  My second stay was facing the fountain as well but I was prepared with ear plug and Capt N Morgan. By the way, I cannot comment on the price because both times were paid by someone else. 

As for the casino floor, Bellagio has a lot to offer. The Conservatory, Gallery of Fine Arts, conference rooms, restaurants, and their poker room are all favorites of mine.  Although, I've never had the stack or the skills to ever play in Bobby's Room, it's just an amazing feel knowing that million dollar hands are played out almost daily.

Morning: want some coffee?  
Long lines at every lobby cafe, staffed with stoic women in hair nets handing out plastic-entombed croissants.      

To avoid the lines and the depressing cafeteria atmosphere, I walked through 68 miles of corridors to a charming coffee bar I had passed the day before. 
I found it.  
It was closed. 
It's not open in the morning. 

A coffee stand not open in the morning.  
I was ready to commit a crime-of some sort.  
I couldn't think of what, but I really wanted to.

I thought, Starbucks. I'll go to Starbucks. Starbucks treats me like a queen, this homicidal-suicidal feeling will go away. 
I found one, in a different hotel, far, far away. 
I walked. 
And you know what? 
The Starbucks in Vegas hotels aren't like regular Starbucks.
They don't take the oath to smile and please, and they don't read the book on how to make drinks. 
They charge you extra, too. 
     
I walked the 648 dusty, hot miles back to The Bellagio. 
I passed the coffee stand on the way to my room. 
It was open.
 
I looked at the pool, and hope returned to my heart. 
It's beautiful and I felt like Ellie May would if she could see it--all impressed-like. 
So I went down there. I had to wear my suit because there's nowhere to change by the pool. 
Who knows, there probably is but I didn't see it.

I felt real awkward 'cause I didn't bring some classy suit cover-up thing.
I walked through the Bellagio corridors with a bath towel wrapped around me. 
I looked like a twelve-year old at camp.
 
The lounging area around the pool is deathly quiet. 
You will like it if your hair is white, you smoke, you're silent and you don't like getting wet. 
I have never been to a pool that quiet. Everyone was just sitting, smoking 
and staring. 
Fun times.
Fun, fun times
I was afraid to talk above a whisper for fear of setting off someone's pacemaker.
     
No one was in the pool.  
We wanted to actually get in said pool, but it seemed uncouth and disruptive.  
We braved it, but being in a pool made us want to talk, laugh and play, and we couldn't. 
The smoking, staring people wouldn't like it.  
I got out, wrapped myself in the towel and dripped back to my room. 
      
The next day we walked by the pool at Caesar's Palace. It was full of   
smoking people; laughing, splashing and jumping. 
I cried a little inside.

I noticed a lot of other people commenting on this if they tried to change rooms, etc.  But we didn't ask for anything extra and still couldn't avoid the attitude of the hotel employees.  I don't know the details of my mom's experience with the concierge but she came back to the room upset one night after trying to pick up show tickets she reserved with the hotel a week ago, which the people at the front desk wouldn't give her until she talked to about 5 different people.  My experience was at the pool one afternoon, I decided to treat my sister and I to some cool drinks and ordered two when approached by a server.  She came back with only mine and I casually asked her if my sister's drink would be out soon, and I about fell out of my seat when she, practically screaming, said that I never ordered another drink and she would have written it down if I did.  My sister and I looked at each other in disbelief and said politely that she must have confused us with some other guests and she replied even more defensively, ""No! She said she was full and didn't want anything and I even asked if you wanted anything else!!""  I was in shock, so shocked I foolishly gave her back my credit card to charge for the additional drink without asking to see her manager.  When she got back I told her I didn't appreciate being called a liar, and of course she said ""I didn't call you a liar!  I'm sorry I didn't hear you!""  All I can say to that is, sign me up for a job at the Bellagio because all the time I served food to people I never got to be so rude to customers.  Seems like fun!  Anyway the Bellagio didn't seem to get the memo that there are other nicer hotels on the strip now and they probably want to treat their guests better to avoid losing business.

I look forward to staying with them again the next time I am in Vegas! Thank you David for helping clear up my fears.

-***UPDATE: I was contacted by a manager with the Bellagio, after a couple of clarification messages back and forth I was made an offer to satisfy the situation to the best of the managers ability. In a month I have an upcoming trip to Vegas and am looking forward to staying at the Bellagio now to see if they've kept their word. I expect all will be well as David was extremely professional to communicate with and genuinely seemed to care that my trust in the company was reinstated. Thank you for your help Yelp! And David as well!***



I purchased tickets through the box office for Circ du Soleil ""O"" (the show itself was wonderful, that is a different story). during the purchase my credit card information was given to the agent, and according to my credit card company was used to make an illegitimate card on which someone attempted to withdraw 1,187$ from the Bellagio cash machine. I reported this to 

1.) call center during my request to speak with a manager prior to my arrival in LV, was told that oh well, the charges were declined so no harm no foul! (hmmmm yea there was harm and foul, due to my card being canceled related to fraud one day prior to my trip and i had to travel without it so a great deal of my plans were canceled because my high limit signature visa was unavailable, not to mention i was 1000 miles from home without a security fall back card.)

2.)after the show i reported directly to security office, was hassled for going to the office to begin with even after i argued with the agent at the archway and told him that i was instructed to report there to get a security\/fraud agent. finally i was directed to speak with a gentleman named Calvin who did at least seem responsive to my concern. He took a report and told me someone would be following up within a day or two. needless to say i am now 5 days later and long back home and have yet to hear anything from security regarding the breech. the box office was the only place that had the CVV number from the back of my card and few purchases were made on this a brand new account so the odds of a breech coming from anywhere else with the same information is astronomical (larger than hitting a jackpot for sure).

I am absolutely positive i will never stay with the resort, MGM Grand treated my party with nothing but the best and we were in a moderately priced room. if i can figure out how to i have the call centers agents call recorded as my phone records all incoming and outgoing calls and will post so people can see the type of treatment you can expect from this ""high class"" establishment. trust me: take your money else where on the strip and avoid this den of thieves at all costs!!!!!",0,0,0

 First tip- if you are a conference attendee, spa tower is where you want to be, located a few steps away from hallways and ballrooms of the convention center. 
 Though I couldn't snag a strip view, I was quite happy with 26th floor room and view of Rio and Palms.
 Everything about the hotel- beautiful conservatory that was reset to Sakura blossoms only day prior to my arrival, to  tempting, jaw dropping Jean Phillips displays, actual room, beautiful immaculately manicured floral arrangements that get carefully tended to daily- all of it is lovely, charming and inspires feeling of style, elegance and luxury. 
 You simply never want to step out into reality and want to stay in this make believe world. At least as long as the company will pay, lol.

I was disappointed on several levels, including a particularly embarrassing incident in the room that the hotel didn't quite go far enough to address in my view.

We wanted a strip view room, and the only one available was an ADA accessible room in the Spa Tower. The view was nice, but the shower door seal keeping water from leaking out of the shower was entirely insufficient. Every time we showered the entire bathroom floor (which is marble) was completely covered in water. Upon wiping the water up, the towels were covered with black, indicating the floors had not been properly washed in some time. This was gross, and not something I'd expect from a five-star hotel of the Bellagio's stature.

After using up all the bath towels wiping the floor, I called down to housekeeping requesting more. After about 15 minutes no one had showed up yet, so I decided to take a shower using the small remaining towels, assuming housekeeping would leave the towels outside the door when I didn't answer it. While in the shower, I heard housekeeping knock at the door and announce themselves a few times, which I ignored, assuming they'd just leave the towels when no one answered. I was mistaken. I noticed his voice grow louder, and decided to investigate. I opened the bathroom door, planning to put on a robe to answer the knock, only to find myself face to face with a housekeeping employee, naked as the day I was born. He had let himself into the room, apparently ignoring the international symbol of a shower being on meaning someone was likely naked within. This was, as you might imagine, rather offputting.

I went down to the front desk and after about 20 minutes was able to speak to a manager, Gilbert. He was reasonably apologetic, said he'd wave our resort fees (~$44 per night) and follow up with housekeeping. Personally, if I was a hotel manager, I'd consider such an incident a Defcon 1 type situation and go to the ends of the earth to ensure the customer was properly restituted for something like that. I certainly didn't book an expensive room at a five-star resort expecting my privacy to be so egregiously invaded by housekeeping. Needless to say, that incident sullied my perception of the hotel irreparably.

I also encountered several surly dealers, including one woman who rather curtly told me ""guy, things change"" when I politely inquired about the 6:5 odds on blackjack at a $25 per hand table (which is categorically obscene). Out of curiosity I wandered into the Baccarat lounge, and smiled at a blackjack dealer at a $1,000 per hand table. She sneered at me like I was a piece of garbage. It's true $1,000 per hand is too expensive for me, but I was well dressed and had a pocket full of money ready to spend.

Bottom line, the hotel is beautiful, the fountains are one of the best free shows in Las Vegas, but it seems the hotel staff could use some serious retraining in the basics. I will not be returning to the Bellagio, either to gamble or stay.",1,0,0

-Good location in the heart of downtown Vegas. Walking distance to most popular sites. 
-The Fountains. My favorite! Beautiful & free!
-Chocolate Fountains- Very cool!
-HUGE
-Disney World for Adults
-Famous Buffet (the most elaborate buffet you've ever seen)
-When in the lobby, look up! Incredible glass flowers cover the ceiling. Stunning!
-The Crepe Bakery
-Beautiful pools

Cons
-HUGE -takes 20 minutes to walk to your room
-Oppressive security
-Smoky casino and worn
-Too many people. Lines EVERYWHERE!
-Had to stand in line for 2 hours for the famous buffet (had to call the front desk to ask for a late check-out due to the long wait)
-Cost of Buffet (like most things in Vegas, over-priced)
-The famous garden was very artificial and mobbed by people

It was an experience, but I'll never go back. I'm just not a Vegas person. Too many people, too many lines, too much glut, too much smoke, sad watching seniors citizens on oxygen and in their electric wheelchairs spending their savings on slots.

As you check in it is easy for your eyes to roams over the shoulder of the friendly staff who are checking you in as they are drawn to the amazing floral display.  But this is just a prelude to the spectacular Conservatory & Botanical Gardens which is like walking through a imaginary wonderland of exquisite flower displays, dazzling water features and unique rare butterfly atriums.  What could ever top all of this you might ask?  The amazing Bellagio fountain show!  It never gets old!  Every time I experience the music, combined with the beautiful water display my heart swells! There is something so emotional about the experience!  I recommend trying to get a reservation at one of the many Bellagio restaurants that have outdoor patios overlooking the fountain.

During our visit we stayed in room 28072 which overlooks the fountains!  The room is in a quiet part of the hotel away from elevators, service closets, etc. The room had a modern blue and white decor which was extremely calming!  The room and bathroom are spacious.  There is a large window to view the fountains and it adds a certain open feeling to the room.

The Bellagio pools and courtyard is very beautiful!  It is composed of 6-7 different pools surrounded by tons of trees and lined with private cabanas!   They have a large drink list and a reasonable menu however I recommend having a nice relaxing lunch at the pool cafe!

Did I miss anything?  Yes!  The amazing restaurants, clubs and poker room!  The spa is beautiful!

Check-in was a breeze.

They have these glass things bolted to the roof. Each could easily be like 20-50 lbs a piece.

They have security at the elevators 24\/7 which leaves creepy wanderers out which is nice. Some peeps I knew were in the other tower and even though I flashed my card, they never let me go up by myself, which kinda sucks.

The atrium\/garden is definitely worth checking out. They always change the place according to the seasons and is a nice reminder that Vegas is NOT just about sex, drugs, and alcohol.

The chocolate fountain is so amazing and draws a crowd, you just wanna end up taking a chocolate bath or something.

Their pool area is pretty chill and laid back. Definitely a family\/adult feel to it. It was Memorial Day weekend and there weren't any pool parties, just folks lounging around.

I don't think any hotel workers should be able to put hands on a customer and shove them.  

Pretty much a terrible experience from start to finish.  Would not stay here again.",15,2,0

So for our second (family) trip to Vegas we decided to stay in the Bellagio- the main reason? It was one of the cheapest options for the quality offered (we booked with expedia), and it worked out a fair bit cheaper than the lower rated hotels. Also, having been before to Vegas, Bellagio (without a shadow of a doubt) is one of the most spectacular hotels on the strip - no naff gondolas or pirates, just pure opulence (and a fountain or two!)

Firstly, our room was just a standard room (personally, we spend little time in our room on holiday as we prefer hitting the streets and seeing the sights!) with two double beds. This humble abode was perfectly suited though, and served it's purpose of being a pitstop before going back into that lovely Nevada heat. Furnishings were all fine and didn't seem to be too worn, the big TV and safe worked perfectly. The bathrobes were nice and waffely (snuggle snuggle) and the bathroom was clean, with lots of marble but it was standard. The shower, nice as it was big, wasn't the best, but I'm just being pinnickity now. We stayed in the Venetian last time, and although the room there was a lot more grand and had more in-room facilities, we never used any of them, and a lot of space was never used.

Secondly, what makes the Bellagio a five star hotel for me? Location. Having this hotel slap bang in the centre of the strip is perfect , and personally I think that location is key when choosing a hotel in LV. Hotels like the Venetian, Mandalay( as beautiful as they are) are just a bit too far out (location wise!) for me. Furthermore, unlike the Venetian (where it took 20 minutes to walk to our room - no freaking joke!), it literally took 5 minutes from entering the hotel to get to our room-perfect when your feet were as blistery as mine - yum! 
also... ALL HAIL THE TRAM! ALL HAIL THE TRAM! (sorry..gotta get that out there!) Seriously, Tram = EPIC WIN. It's free (free in Las Vegas you say?!? unlike the bally's one..grr) and takes you to City Center, Aria and Monte Carlo, saving your feet the (longish) walk. Also the Tram is all purple and tinted, and hardly busy and gives you some nice views of the new mahoosaf and shiny City Center Complex. 

Another great thing about the Bellagio? The great choice of food,shops etc. The shops are amazing (Chanel, Gucci, Tiffany, Giorgio Armani...*sigh*) and although we never ate at the Olives restaurant , it looked super good (and always busy- proof in the pudding!) We did dine in the Café Bellagio (for breakfast) and my mother and I had the brioche raspberry french toast (soo soo good..even the thought leaves me salivating) and my brother had the omelette which was a bit dry and not the nicest(but it came with some nice toast and hash brown\/rosti stuff which was scrummy),- price wise, not the cheapest, but worth it (for the french toast anyway). Hotel lobby with  the handpainted glass flowers? Beeeauutifulll, absolutely beautiful. The Conservatory? AH-DORABLE! Lots of cute snails and bees made out of flowers, cool water installations and they even make the huge-ass ant models look cute- aww!
 And the fountains, oh the fountains! Frank sinatra + swaying fountains = happy me! Also a few resident ducks swim in the water (frequently watching the show..see if you can spot them!)

Finally, a big reason I love the Bellagio? The super smiley staff! All the cleaners were happy and chatty, which was greatly appreciated, and any other hosts\/conciergey people always did their best to make sure any questions\/qualms you had were sorted - first class service for a first class hotel.

To conclude, Mr Bellagio Hotel, you are wonderful. Apart from looking spectacular on the outside, you have a heart of shiny shiny gold with your wonderful amenities and super staff and cute fountains. When I return to Vegas, I know where I will be booking in to (if you haven't got the subdude hints here -it'll be the bellagio :) ).",0,0,0

Moved from a Deluxed Room at Rio to a Penthouse Suite at the Bellagio is so wonderful. 
Bellagio staff was so nice to search for the next available Penthouse giving it to us first. We ever we're in Vegas we always stayed here everything here is just about as good as it gets.

There are a lot of good things to say about the room at The Bellagio. The room was well decorated and has a luxurious feel. I also found it to be clean with comfortable bedding. The toiletries included more than the usual so no fear if you forget something at home. 

One of my favorite things was the distance from parking garage to check-in to room. We like to do staycations in our town and find Vegas to be notorious for lengthy walks. I don't mind walking, but not with suitcases. Not at The Bellagio! Here the garage is next to the check-in area and was less than a five minute walk. All Vegas hotels will require you to walk through the casino to get to the room, but this was the shortest walk of any I've stayed at so far. 

The check-in line was long, but I expected this. The line is always long here. Fortunately, we made it to the front in about 15-20 minutes. 

The property has one of the largest selections of restaurants, especially fine dining. Many of the restaurants are strategically placed to have fountain side views. There is also a lot of higher end shopping on property. The Bellagio Fountains and Conservatory are beautiful. They even have one of the Cirque shows available on site for entertainment.

The only negative I found with the room was lack of coffee maker. I get that they want to force you to buy coffee through room service or one of the restaurants\/shops, but it's terribly inconvenient. Just put a Keurig in the room and charge for pods like the mini bar. You'll still make your beloved coffee dollars and increase guest satisfaction.

One thing that did leave a bad taste in my mouth was the resort fee. This has sadly become so standard here and is nothing more than deceptive pricing. When we checked in we were informed that the fee was $35 ($32 fee + $3 tax). I nicely explained that we were locals and would not be using Internet, gym, pool, and anything else the fee is supposedly for. I asked if we could waive this fee since we wouldn't be using any of these things. The clerk called his manager and was told that it's a mandatory fee so he couldn't waive it. Isn't this like charging parking for someone without a car? If it's for the amenities they say it is and I'm not using them then it should be waived. Again, most of the resorts in town are doing this so Bellagio isn't inventing the wheel here, but I'd like to see someone break the cycle.",5,0,2

The last two times I was in Vegas, we went to Bellagio for the buffet breakfast.  Three years ago, it was hangover food.  Did the trick!  This last time, in January, no hangover, which allowed me to appreciate the interior decor more than the previous visit.

In general, I am not a fan of Chihuly glass.  It's just a little too grotesque for me.  Writhing, snaking organic shapes rendered in psychedelically colored glass is just not that appealing to me.  I acknowledge that Chihuly is a living master, and who the hell am I to critique the greatest glass artist alive, but TFB.  Maybe because I grew up in California, where glass worth as much as a house could break at the slightest little temblor, or maybe because it's just so absurdly priced that I can't imagine justifying its value in the millions for some pieces.  BUT....the chandelier (what an inadequate word) in the lobby of Bellagio, a Chihuly original, is stunning.  I mean really, it takes your breath away and leaves you speechlessly stricken with glee.  And considering how lovely the entire lobby and casino are, that's saying something.

Quality materials are used throughout the hotel.  It's just plain beautiful.  It's loveliness utterly defies description, so I really don't think I should even try.

The conservatory is completely redone depending upon the season, and no expense is spared in changing the artwork and foliage out.  Since both of my last two visits fell around Chinese New Year, it was decorated for the occasion.  Absolute gorgeousness!

My review, however, lacks the fifth star, because I'll be damned if I'll pay $20.00 to get into their gallery to see the pieces they have on display.  Bitches, please.  That's EXACTLY where I draw the line.",1,3,1

1. The room and bathroom are nice and big.

2. The shower has amazing water pressure. This is important to Southern California folks because of the drought. 

3. Hotel staff was nice and professional. 

4. The lobby and restaurants are beautiful and amazing. The food is delicious, but, OVERPRICED. 

5. The SPA is good. But, OVERPRICED for what you get. 

6. They have about six pools with towel service. But, the pool closed at 8pm. Why? It would've been nice to have dinner by the pool. 


CONS: 
1. The casino was very SMOKY. Walking through the casino, you were assaulted with the stink of smoke. This was a horrible experience for people who don't smoke. They need to designate a smoking section for the smokers. Or do a better job of removing the smoke out of the casino. 

2. The lady who checked me in did not give me the room I had paid\/asked for. After complaining to management I got a room with pool view... It was a hassle because I was very tired after my flight, getting to the hotel, standing in line, walking passed the crowd to get to the room, which felt like a mile away. 

3. I stayed about five days. The room and bathroom were very clean at first. Subsequently, there was only surface cleaning. The bathroom was not completely cleaned the rest of the week. I found hair on the floors. 

4. Lines for everything: to check-in, to get food, at the concierge desk...

5. Last, but not least, the hostess at Olive, an upscale restaurant at the hotel, was rude. We had reservations and had specifically asked for a table by the window to see the water show. She told us that we couldn't have the table because another party, who had been waiting for over an hour, was getting the table. I told her that we had reserved the table earlier that day (at least 2.5 hours prior) and specifically asked to sit by the window. She said that we had to wait at least another 30 minutes and after then, they'll see. After our reservation and waiting for at least 30 minutes, if a table by the window became available, we could have it.",2,0,0

Why?  Amenities!  Last year we stayed at the Excalibur and the room at Bellagio was definitely nicer (the bathroom was amazing) with a gorgeous view of the fountains (we upgraded), but at the Excalibur you have free access to the gym (and it was a nice gym at that).  Not so at the Bellagio.  Instead you have to pay for gym and spa access.  Mind you,  the spa access does not include any treatments either.  Just access to their sauna etc.  Considering that most major hotels across the country allow free gym access, I find this to be a major issue.  

Now the other major issue is shared by all hotels on the Strip.  I don't know what it is about Las Vegas, but why isn't internet access free?  It is at most any other nice hotel in the country.  

Other issues: 

The Bellagio does not hand out any freebies at all, unlike some of the other hotels on the strip.  

Unfortunately, during our stay there was a fair amount of construction noise going on from the Cosmopolitan next door.  We've run into this issue before while in Vegas.  I don't know why they have to start noisy construction machinery at 5AM in the morning.  It may have even been earlier than that.  Very annoying.

When my husband and I went to breakfast, we were ignored by the staff. They talked at their station for ten minutes before even coming to the table. Then my coffee cup and plate were dirty, covered in messy syrup. 

While the concierge tried to make the experience better, by offering us a room upgrade, it did NOT make up for their lack of service. They even had the audacity to say that the dirty dishes were not their responsibility because they do not run the restaurant. The last time I checked, the resort runs everything and they are all owned by the same company.

I get it.. You're the Bellagio. You're paying for the name and experience. But please be more up front with your pricing. 

*also!* make sure you don't mess with the mini bar. They only say this in very fine print, but if you take anything out for more than a few seconds, a sensor is set off and your room gets charged for it, whether or not you put it back!!

Can you say remote control mini-blinds?  HUGE Godzilla like Jet tub in the bathroom?  (ooohh my girlfriends and I loved this HUGE tub feature and I WISHED I was not single all three times I stayed here.)
Each year, me and the girls would take a few  three day tours trip.  Not 'The Hangover' style, kind of trip, but just to go and work. 
(We did promotions for Weight training protein shakes and went during the bodybuilding expos- no naughty ideas here kids- sheeeeesh)

Plus, we were treated like royalty because of the company we were with, and who we represented and worked for.

Great lighting, fantastic trees and fountains.  One tree was animated, and it said its sole purpose was to make the guests smile.

The bathroom was huge and beautiful, with tiled floors and a separate bathtub and shower.  The bed was super comfortable and even the curtains are motorized.  Everything was beautiful and comfortable, as a nice hotel room should be.

I ordered a beer and when I cashed out my left over and started over, because of superstitious thing. But nonetheless. I was putting it back in to start a new rotation. At the same time I had no more beer and ordered another. Before I could put in the money the bartender told me to put in another $20 before he could pour me another beer. I told him I will, he didn't believe me and stood there until I pulled out a $20 and put it in before he even pour my beer. Standing there watching me. I've never seen anything like that in my life. Then a white girl sat down next to me and played .25¢ video poker and order a beer with no hesitation. WTF. 

Another incident was that when I was pulling in the parking lot. The sign said full but the car in front of me went in anyway. At the same time the employee that was in charge of Parking said it to her other coworker. ""They don't fucking read English that's why"" what kind of employees do they have in this place.

Then we were placed on a smoking floor - even though I asked for non-smoking. By the time we made the long walk to our room - I had no energy to go back and change out rooms - so I sucked it up. 

Once in the room - you can see where time has had taken it's toll on what was once a beautiful room. Wallpaper was peeling off the wall and there was mildew in the shower. Seriously - I don't have mildew at home, so why should I have to pay several hundred dollars a night to stay somewhere where there is mildew in the shower.

It is nice for sure, but the interior feels a bit dated. It is defiantly a very busy and popular destination !  We got married outside at the fountains last July, so it is a special place for me. 

Here for an Mlife promo, so not sure what the rates are. 
We stayed in a spa parlour suite, overlooking the fountains. 
The colours were very cool( teal and green ) and the king sized bed very comfy. 

The bathroom was really nice too. 
It had a jacuzzi whirlpool tub ( that fit 2 ) a separate shower,  double sinks, TV in the mirror in the bathroom. A large closet, and a vanity make up table and chair. The toilet was separate and also had an older style bidet. 

The toiletries were very nice, and I loved that they included a dental kit, make up wipes, q tips, razor, loofa, bath salts and shave cream along with the other usual items. This is the same sort of set up that Aria Sky Suites has. 

The VIP lounge here is also great. It has the private check In desk along with scotch, wine, beer and other drinks. It also has small bite size pastries like quiche, cookies and more. Very comfy couches and chairs. It can get busy on the weekends, but it's much better to be in here, then in the casino if you want to relax a bit.The staff in VIP are all A+

 The rest of the staff are all friendly, and they were very accommodating with late check out, as well as being very generous with taking off our mini bar charges, after we explained we had been caught up in the Rolex robbery chaos from the previous early Saturday morning. 

We had been sitting playing slots around 1 am, when all of a sudden people came running, screaming and even diving under gaming tables. People were confused and scared. There was talk of active shooters in the front lobby . 

We also heard that it was a robbery, and that a man in a Pig mask was one of the culprits. That he had semi automatic machine guns. Many people were panicked and ran out any exit possible. Soon, there were cop cars all over, and we got locked inside the casino.

When were finally able to get out, traffic was gridlocked and cops who actually had machine guns were patrolling the street and turning people away from Cosmo and the road that goes up to City Center. 

It was crazy and like something out of a movie  ! Because of this Mlife also generously gave us 100$ for the buffet at the Bellagio.

We were at this hotel for 4 days\/3 nights (stayed a different hotel night 1, stayed in the grand canyon night 2, and at the bellagio nights 3-5). 

Check in process: We got back from the grand canyon around 1pm, so we stored our luggage while a few of us went to return the rental and the rest gambled. But as soon as we got back from returning the rental, we were able to check in. They have a LOT of people open to help you check in, but they also have a LOT of people checking in, so it took a while. The girl who helped us check in was on the phone when I got up to her counter and she didn't make eye contact or say she would be with me soon, so it was awkward b\/c i couldn't figure out if I should just go stand in another line... but once she was off the phone, check in was easy. She did try to lecture me about calling my credit card company to let them know was in vegas -- thanks mom (one card had been put on hold b\/c of all the charges)... 

Location: in the middle of the strip so prime location. We loved being central to all the hotels. Nearby hotels include Aria, Cosmopolitan, Paris, and Caesar's.

Rooms: We had 7 people - 3 girls and 4 guys and booked 2 connecting rooms, each with 2 queen beds. The rooms were extremely spacious, with bathrooms and closet\/drawer space large enough for us three girls, and beds and overall space large enough for the guys! We had a gorgeous view of the fountains- didn't have to leave the hotel room to watch the show. You can turn your tv onto a channel that plays the music that everyone else is hearing outside while watching, so it's pretty much like you have a private show! amazing. 

Housekeeping: The hotel itself is always clean! 24\/7. The rooms were also kept clean. Our housekeeper was Ingrid and she was amazing, accommodating, and so friendly.She would come by once in the morning and once in the evening (maybe it was someone else in the evening, we were never there) and always did an amazing job. And she left bellagio chocolates every time she was in there (delish, if I saw them first, my friends didn't have a chance in hell at getting any)

Food: (see individual reviews for more details)We ate at John Phillipe Patisserie for breakfast\/brunch\/snacks a few times and loved it. The quiches, muffins, and sandwiches are good. Chocolate is of course amazing. I had the veg crepe and thought it was ok. We ate at the bellagio cafe for late night food and it was good with pretty good service. The Bellagio brunch buffet was really good, wish it was a champagne brunch tho. The pool cafe was good, nothing extraordinary, though. 

Show: We saw O here and (although strange, we didn't fully understand what was happening), it was amazing! I think all of the cirque the soleil's would be like this, though, but O is the aqua one, so it was unique and the performers are so talented. The theater is clean, employees are friendly and efficient, and we had a great time.

Casino: Well kept with amazing dealers. Played roulette a little, but played craps a lot. (The guys played a bunch of blackjack, too). The craps tables were a ton of fun. Of course, the players make it fun, but we had amazing dealers too. My favorites were Theresa and Joe. They were friendly, knowledgable, and extremely helpful. We definitely had good luck wheneve they were around., 

Pool: we got a cabana - I'll review this later under Bellagio pools.

Checkout: effortless, I dropped a piece of paper in a box and got my receipt via email later that day. 

Tips: There are a lot of people who you interact with hourly who provide services and of course, they all expect a tip. So bring lots of cash!.... The one thing I didn't like, is some employees will REMIND you to tip them.... (they did with 2 of my friends a few times). I understand they work off tips, but sometimes what they're doing is not something you ask for and is something so minute that it doesn't really make sense to tip 5 dollars.

Overall, we had an amazing time and had amazing service. We will definitely be returning to vegas and have talked about staying here again (although we do want to try more of the hotels). But we had such a great experience here, we almost don't want to! Definitely recommend it.",1,1,1

** PROS **
Location.  Smack dab in the center of the Strip. I may enjoy walking, but it's still fun to be right in the middle of the action.

Restaurants.  Picasso, Michael Mina, FIX and Jean-Philippe Patisserie are very good choices in their respective categories. I even like their 24 hour cafe.

Lake.  Even after countless walks past Bellagio, I still enjoy seeing the fountains at night. With the price of Strip real estate, it's hard to imagine anything like this ever appearing again. In another forum, I (only half jokingly) predicted that in ten years MGM Mirage will announce that the Lake is to be filled in, replaced with a new tower and high end shopping. Enjoy it while you can.

** CONS **
Layout.  Bellagio aims for grand - at the price of a rambling layout. The casino is the same size as Wynn's, yet seems cavernous by comparison. It's often a long, confusing walk between places in the hotel.

Gambling.  Bellagio wants to be refined.  OK, but unfortunately the dealers too often come across as stiff. Not mean, not unpleasant, just wooden. Craps dealers are like statues - polite statues, but statues nonetheless.

Restaurants.  When Bellagio opened, its restaurants were the best of any hotel in town. However, the Las Vegas restaurant scene has advanced tremendously since then - and all the while Bellagio has stayed pretty much the same. Picasso is still excellent but not the best in town; Michael Mina perhaps once was the best seafood restaurant, but no longer. Relatively new entries FIX and Jean-Philippe Patisserie are excellent for what they are, but neither qualifies as a top dining spot. Bellagio is still a fine place to eat, but management needs to breathe some new life into it.



I don't know what MGM Mirage management is thinking, but it seems as if newer projects (like Project City Center) are getting all the attention. Benign neglect is the watch word of the day. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Well, it ain't broke, but the Strip is rapidly changing, and Bellagio is in danger of becoming ""that property that used to be famous once.",0,1,1

I arrived late off a red eye flight and went to check in, the lady at the front desk told me that although I wanted a non smoking room with 2 queen beds, they only had smoking rooms available. After a few minutes of her trying to find something, she advised that I can just come down the next morning and change rooms. So I agreed.
I get to the room and it stunk like a cheap motel room, I liked the bathroom but the smell of stale cigarettes all over the room was really bothering me. Then I find 2 cigarette butts on the floor and I decided I have to call the front desk. I get the same story about how there aren't any rooms, but cmon we know there are, and they offered to send housekeeping and stuff, but I really wanted to switch rooms. I eventually gave up and went down the next morning.
I had to withdraw money from the ATM and everything processed, I even heard the sound of money counting and dispensing, but when I looked down there was nothing there. I scrambled to find someone to help and was pointed to like 3 different places. Finally someone was able to help but I still had to call my bank and they also gave me some 1-800 number to call for the ATM vendor. ( Fortunately, nothing was withdrawn from my account)

This review is for the fees only
Had booked with what I thought was a good rate for the end of April. I have discovered that they will have a $10\/day parking fee starting in April.  For a two night (which is three parking days) stay, if you add the $35\/day Resort Fee and the $15\/parking and the $5 on tax on the resort fees, that's $55.00 per night...  For a  two night stay  that's $110.00 in resort fees and parking fees !!! The rate you think you are paying is not really the rate you are paying at all!!   

So if you have a car rental or are driving to Vegas, my recommendation is to find a non MGM Resorts hotel to stay at. I have made alternate reservations at an non MGM resorts property, and if Bellagio won't guarantee that I will not pay their parking fees (that are on top of their resort fees), I will cancel my Bellagio reservation and stay elsewhere.... On top of that out of principal I won't gamble at any MGM properties either, I'll spend my time at Cosmo and the Caesar chain casinos and restaurants....

Let's not reward  MGM who that thinks they can do whatever they want without repercussions while ruining the longstanding tradition of free parking on the strip.

There are plenty of restaurants to chose from with a wide variety of cuisine (steak, sushi, Mediterranean, French, buffet and plenty of little Italian inspired cafes).

The pool is just a regular pool, no 21 and over day pool parties.  There are 2 nightclubs inside, Hyde and the bank.  Both are a ton of fun and get busy so I would recommend arriving early or getting a table.

The poker room is a decent size and the casino area is pretty large.  Attached to the hotel is a good size high end shopping area with stores such as Tiffany & Co and Louis Vuitton.

Don't get me wrong, the hotel is not like a 2 star divey motor Inn. It's clean and renovated and all, but for the money they're asking and the reputation that precedes it, the Bellagio really could step up their game, especially with the little things. 

The stock rooms are fairly large, but in the West wing the window is very small cramping the view. 
The room had no coffee maker or actual closet apart from the wardrobe unit. 
That air conditioner barely wheezed out any cold air even when I had it cranked down to 65.

Still as nice as last time.....almost.  We just came back from Las Vegas a couple days ago and had a nice trip over Easter in Las Vegas.  We stayed at the Bellagio in a premium room (24006) front and pretty much cent to the fountains.  Ironically, we stayed in 26006 the last time we stayed here, 2 floors up.

We really like the Bellagio and enjoy the fountain show views from our room at night.  The beds are really comfortable and the location of the resort in the middle of the strip makes for closer proximity to most of the other attractions.

We ate at Café Bellagio twice and really thought the food was great.  We did a buffet one night there as well and the food was excellent.  

The only downside that we could see is that the rooms are beginning to show their age and tire a bit.  There is wall paper peeling from the walls in the corners, our shower had a leak which made the carpet wet by the wall along one of the beds and the bathroom fixtures were getting tired and dated.  Also, the glass window in our room was not the cleanest which was a bummer for photographs.

There was an exhibit featuring Faberge' on site in the Gallery of Fine Art which was very cool.  All in all, we had an enjoyable time.


November 2012
We took a quick 4 day trip to Vegas over Thanksgiving again this year and decided to stay at the Bellagio.  As a whole, Vegas slows down a bit over Thanksgiving and the weather is usually very nice too making it a fun place to go for a quick trip.  We received an email about 2 months before the trip with room specials so decided to upgrade from the Mirage where we originally booked.  The Bellagio is a very nice place, but also very crowded, even during off-peak times.  Overall we liked the Hotel a lot and would stay there again.  The stylish rooms (non-smoking floors available), comfort of the beds, views of the fountain shows, courtesy of all the staff, hotel location on the strip and food variety were all great.  

The down side would be the time it took for us to get our room, over an hour past the 3 pm allowed check in time.  They have late check out, 4 pm for VIPs as well, but do not seem to have the staffing to get the rooms cleaned and turned back over in a timely manner.  There were constant lines in the lobby, at the reception, well into the 7-8 pm hour and with limited seating during the wait.  There seem to always be commotion going in the main lobby almost every time we passed through tons of people smoking.

Another observation we made was that the prices for almost everything inside the Bellagio were very expensive.  Much more so than other places we've stayed on the strip.  Prices for items in the mini-bar were silly.....$5, for a small bottle of water, $14 for a one ounce liquor, $5 for soda and mixer on and on.

The Bellagio was fun overall and very entertaining.  I didn't feel it was quite a 5 star, but better that 4.  I would give it a 4  1\/2 over all.",1,1,2

-Valet would not help with bags neither arriving or leaving. 

-Had to beg for my room to be cleaned every day.

-Went to buy a bathing suit at the pool and it had human excrement in the lining.

-Ordered a burger at the pool and they forgot the buns. They said it was because I made sure the fries were not fried in peanut oil, because of an allergy. I mean really, I can't make this stuff up..

-I was given a dinner out at Fix by Bellagio to make up for these series of event. The concierge did not tell the staff at Fix about my $250 credit though, so a romantic dinner with my wife turned into a disaster and hostile where they treated us like liars and were not respectful of our time constraints to see the show ""O"".

The themes we have experienced of the Conservatory are worth the trip and always inspire selfies and fun moments to capture. The 3 stars is for lack of food options within the hotel as well as poor management of the ordering systems at the food establishments we tried within the hotel. Also the fact that the places seemed to be almost completely out of dessert options at 10pm on a Saturday night...that is crazy and a bad showing for a Vegas eatery in an upscale hotel. There were many upset people in the confusing lines. People upset over all of what I just noted in addition to very long wait times....kind of embarrassing for the Bellagio - I expected more from them than that... Finally the 3 stars also for non working moving walkways and poor traffic management at the entrance. You take your life in your hands when trying to cross safely from the valet drop to the main doors. We almost got hit by a taxi trying to drive through while we were exiting our vehicle with a child.

There was quite a line and they only had three ladies working registration. I feel when you are paying the prices we were, one would think they could have more folks working. We ran into the same thing with the concierge desk. Waited ten minutes to talk to the concierge. This is a staffing\/management issue.

I only stayed here once and thankfully didn't have to pay for it. It was my friend's birthday and her dad was...well, quite wealthy so he payed for her and two friends (I was one) to stay here. The room was great. Nothing too special, but it was well decorated. Had  a big TV, a nice tub and all the amenities you could ask for. It was also really clean.

The rest of the hotel is great. It has some great features. There is the famous fountain show which is always super fun. The conservatory changes through the year. I've seen it twice and was pretty blown away both times. It has a pretty awesome chocolate fountain and some nice decorations including great blown glass flowers. 

The casino is pretty good. We didn't get to do much gambling while we were there, but the dealers were all nice and the place was pretty well kept.

My regular reservation is at the West Wing at the MGM, but I decided on this trip to do it up and go for a lake view room at the former reigning king of the high-class set, The Bellagio Hotel.

The hotel is nice, I'll give it that.  The lobby is open and the conservatory is bright and interestingly conceived.  There are terrific shops and world-class restaurants.  The dealers are all very friendly and helpful when you get confused about the details of whatever sucker bet you are extending.  I also like the scale of the place... it's big enough to seem spectacular, but not unmanageably so, like, say, Caesar's Palace next-door.

There is an interesting trade-off I have noticed regarding the accommodations, though.  On one trip I stayed in the spa tower.  Nice room, lousy view.  Twin sinks.  Lots of marble.  DVD player.  On this trip, though, I was in the main tower overlooking the fountains and though I was already paying more for that privilege, I noticed that the room wasn't as nicely appointed as the spa tower room, and was definitely much smaller.  Not just that, but it seemed, and I might be nitpicking here, that the window in my view room might have been a little wider.   It wasn't like looking out a porthole, but it felt like it wasn't far from it.  I definitely enjoyed several helpings of the famous Bellagio Fountains display from the comfort of my room, but I was expecting a view that was a little more panoramic.

I think in the future I will stick with the West Wing.  Bellagio was nice, but not sufficiently so to merit the premium.",5,1,1

After reading many positive reviews online I decided to book my stay with Bellagio. After driving nearly seven hours I arrive to hundreds of people in a clustered mess of a ""line"" if you can even call it that. After waiting in line people just walk up from behind you and walk straight up to the next counter past you. Terrible!! What kind of system is that?

I finally get checked into my overpriced room just to find that it had not been cleaned at all. There was mens pubic hair in the bath tub, used dental floss on the counter and ""body marks"" on the mirrors\/windows. Looks like the carpet has not been vacuumed in months. After speaking with managements they moved me twice just for me to find that all of the rooms they moved me to are in similar condition. None of then are cleaned properly. That really makes me wonder about the bedding. 

On the their ""word class, five diamond, award winning buffet."" I was interested to see what they had to offer as I had seen a show on the travel channel about them having the ""Best buffet in Vegas."" Even the lady walking me to the table said ""sometimes she feels like Asia has taken over the casino."" Meaning she felt like a minority as did I being stared at as I was seated. The food was nothing special or extraordinary. I added fruit and salad to my plate while everyone else scurried away with all the crab they could grab.

We had a great time here. The room was amazing, very simple but classy. The bed was so comfortable that my boyfriend wanted to figure out what mattress they used. The room service was great, my boyfriend called and asked for an extra ash tray and they came up with three and a bunch of matches for him. 

The bathroom was HUGE! The shower and bathtub was separate and they had a giant counter for the sink and a big mirror, as well as a small circle mirror that lights up (for doing makeup and stuff.) Loved the bathroom, it was perfect for someone narcissistic like me. OOO.... they also have long mirrors in the cabinet for hanging clothes! and the cabinet lights up when you open it.

House keeping was amazing especially since they had to deal with my mess.... i just threw clothes everywhere and left lots of stuff around. But when I came back, my mess is still there but everything else was clean, which is what I like... cause if they put my mess elsewhere, I would have forgot about it....

When we checked out, there was an express checkout. Where we just had to give our names, room numbers, and keys to this person. And we were done in a minute. We then left our stuff with the bell desk so we could go walk around more before we took the shuttle to the airport.

The bell desk staff were amazing too. They ask you what stuff is fragile and put a tag on it, and they were really fast and efficient in getting our luggage when we wanted it back.

The only problem we had was with the lost and found. My boyfriend forgot to pack his phone charger... and when we realized it, we only had 45 minutes until our shuttle came to pick us up. He went to the front desk and they told him to ask the security, and the security just gave him a phone and told him to go call lost and found... he was on hold for 30 minutes... and eventually just gave up because our shuttle was almost here.

We also watch ""O"" here and the theater was gorgeous. We got really good seats for 25% off. 12 rows from the stage, close enough to see details but far enough to see the entire stage.

Overall, Bellagio was beautiful... service really depends. Bell Desk, House Keeping, and Room Service was great but Lost and Found was horrible, as well as the service at Bellagio cafe... but that I will talk about more in the Bellagio Cafe review.

You've gone from my favorite to wayyyyy down the totem pole. 

I stayed here about 5 times in 2012. Always get 1 or 2 bedroom penthouse. ALWAYS. At first it was ok, but the last 2 times, I am not impressed. Phones in the room do not function, lighting fixtures do not function, TV's don't work and could you stop your bogus charges for your stupid mini bar. I don't do mini bar mmkay..  My last visit last week, there was some crazy drilling started in the room next door at about 9am, that was so RIDICULOUSLY loud - called at 2pm, and was basically given the brush off. The work had to be done, nothing they could do about it. Really ? $1100 a night .. I don't want to hear drilling. Ever. The blase attitude of staff at ALL levels of Bellagio really needs to be worked on. 

I came in October, booked 1 bedroom penthouse, lake view. When I come here, I use the VIP elevators - I like it, I want to be in the main hotel. I confirmed this visit 2 days prior, I get there, they try to put me in the Spa Tower with partial lake view. Really Bellagio ? you try to play it like its what I asked for. 

If a reservation doesn't mean anything here, let me know. 

They were filming Hangover 3 there at the time, they told me they had people stuck from Hurricane Sandy, whatever. To be honest, its not my problem, and I frankly don't believe them.

Surprised to see how crowded it would be Anywho, I felt so secured and protected because of these security guards. We got to the elevator, showed security our key and went up to the room (floor 25, fountain view!). The elevator was fast and plays music and is joyful. We walked to the room (We got a standard room), and it was amazing. First off, the bathroom was cool which you can turn mirror lifted on, and the lights. The toilet flushes very fast. Then the COOLEST THING EVER is that from your bed and the hallway, you can control the shades with a click of a button, and we all loved that.

Prior to our wedding night Bellagio was my absolute favorite hotel in Vegas. We also became engaged on the terrace overlooking the fountains. It only seemed appropriate to get married there as well. On our wedding night, while we were celebrating our reception in another suite, cleaning staff stole cash from my wallet. We  had to have security in our room the night of the wedding. SO romantic. Writing up a report and such. 
I wrote a letter after we came back from our honeymoon and talked about what a positive experience the wedding had been: how amazing our wedding planner (Helen) had been, how all of the staff at the salon and the restaurants had taken such care with the whole celebration. I talked about how many of their rooms had been booked with all of our family and friends staying in the hotel as well for the weekend. Not to mention the fact that we stayed in one of their nicest suites for our wedding night. And they NEVER wrote me back or acknowledged our trouble in any way.  We were only given a $50 credit to our room upon checking out. They said this was the amount we ""claimed"" was stolen from my wallet. 
I will never stay there again even though I did love that hotel and obviously have many fond memories of our wedding and engagement there. And I tell everyone I know not to stay there as well. Beware my friends! This is the only hotel that I have ever dealt with theft in the room. I truly thought Bellagio would have cared more. Their lack of response and customer service really showed in this situation however. That kind of attention does not deserve any more of our business.

I booked a room for 4 days, over the weekend.  The room itself was, well, pitiful by ""Bellagio"" standards.  There were holes in the wall by the bed (old faceplate location). There was no showercap in the showercap box (we needed that actually).  The room was terribly dated looking - dark wallpaper, older furniture.  And - to top it all off- a TUBE TV.  I have stayed in much cheaper places and they STILL have HDTV.  I found this ludicrous.  A Tube TV - at the BELLAGIO!?!?!  Is this the same hotel used in the Ocean's 11 remake!?!  I don't think George Clooney would approve.  
Let's talk about hotel design:  The front desk is big and can handle a lot of people checking in, but it's always packed. The casino floor is to your right as you walk in, and it's certainly big, but it's easy to get lost and lose your direction.  The little cafes and restaurants are nice - and all the food we had here was great.  There's no coffee maker in your room, so you have to schelp downstairs every morning for your coffee and croissant at the local shop - which is excellent by the way - great coffee, great pastries.  
One thing I don't like is the design of the place.  You have to walk down this crazy jagged hallway to find the hidden elevators to get up to your room.  The floors are marble, mostly, and I saw all kinds of cracks and damage.  At the Bellagio.  THE BELLAGIO.  The design of the place was artsy and fun, but no cohesion in color scheme or overall design.  It's just not a clean cut place.  
And I say this after having visited a dozen other casinos on the strip.  The location of the Bellagio is the best - right in the middle of the strip - but for the price, you can stay somewhere nicer and better designed.  And hopefully, with an HDTV....",3,0,0

The hotel is beautiful -- particularly as it is now decorated for Chinese New Year.  Walking through the lobby, conservatory, or just wandering the halls to window shop or take a peek at the pools was an enjoyable activity in and of itself.  We checked in around midnight, so lines were short and we were in our room in a few minutes.  (Parking was also very convenient.)  The room was beautiful - spacious, clean, nicely decorated.  The bathroom was enormous, with a separate glass-enclosed shower and deep tub.

We ate at the buffet (great selection for carnivore husband but very limited on vegan options), Sensi (amazing!), Cafe Bellagio (perfect for 3am munchies), and Jean Phillipe Patissiere (my husband indulged and I seriously contemplated giving up veganism).  We also had drinks at the Fortuna Bar overlooking the fountains (amazing!).  Fortuna is a lot of fun, particularly when they have live music there.

Gambling there was fun -- he likes slots, I like video poker - and there was plenty of variety to choose from.

A transformer blew while we were there, causing some problems with electricity and the elevators.  We didn't have electricity in our room one night, but offered to move us to another room.  We were lazy and didn't feel like moving and weren't in the room that much anyway, so they ended up taking about $100 of our bill for the inconvenience, which made us pretty happy.

Check-in was a bit slow, as a lot of people were checking out at the same time... but we got a room right away (around 12:30 pm) and didn't have to wait until 3.

We got a great price on our room through Southwest Vacations\/LasVegas.com - about $149 a night.  If you go on the Bellagio's website to their prices, scroll all the way to the bottom for their internet promotions - they're a lot cheaper than their regular rates.

The room itself was gorgeous.  We were put in the Spa Tower on the 9th floor (a handicap room).  The door had a mind of its own and wouldn't always open with the key - even the maid commented on it.  But other than that it was beautiful.  Automatic curtains were really neat, and we had an amazing view of the Strip.  We could see the higher parts of the fountain show and listen to the music on their fountain channel on the TV.  We also had a great view of the top of the parking garage :)  But it was much better than the view on the other side of the building, which was of I-15.  The bathroom was beautiful and very spacious. Just a shower - no bathtub. The toilet's handle, however, was on the right hand side instead of the left, so we kept reaching for the wrong side the whole time we were there!

The food was very good here - we only ate at Cafe Bellagio and at the Jean Phillipe Patisserie.  Cafe Bellagio had AMAZING french onion soup, and the best club sandwich I've ever had.  The french fries are better than the homemade chips.  Be sure to ask the waiter for breadsticks - they're free, but they won't bring them unless you ask. The Patisserie had a delicious strawberry almond tart, as well as chocolate and coconut covered strawberries that perfectly complemented our champagne that we brought along.  

The Bellagio's casino is my favorite casino on the Strip, even if I only lost money here.  The waitresses were rather quick with the drinks in the slots area, which was nice.  I didn't play any table games here though... just keno in the cafe, slots in the casino, and (with my dad) betting on football games... all of which we lost :)

Parking was fair - we had a handicapped permit so we usually didn't have too much trouble finding a space.  If you're going to the self-park section, skip the lower levels and go straight to the top level - it's less crowded than the lower ones. 

The fountain, of course, was amazing.  My mom (who was the one in the wheelchair) was content to watch from our hotel room, but I preferred being downstairs, especially because you couldn't see the lower parts of the fountain from our room.  Be careful if it's windy - I found out the hard way :)

The decor in the Bellagio was, of course, lovely.  My favorite part is the lobby with the Chihuly flowers on the ceiling.  The conservatory had a fall\/Thanksgiving theme when we arrived, then soon after they closed it to change to a winter\/Christmas theme.  Unfortunately it wasn't done by the time we left, but I liked how we saw them put it together, and they had the designer's drawings on display so you could see what it was going to look like.

There were two downsides to our stay at the Bellagio.  First, it was extremely crowded at all times.  I know people want to see the place, but it felt a bit claustrophobic.  It was also very annoying when I was trying to push my mom around in the wheelchair and people would walk right in front of us, or stop in their tracks for no reason.  Many people also wouldn't let us through the handicapped door to the parking garage because they wanted to make it through before us.  I didn't manage to hit anybody, but we had a few close calls because people can be stupid like that.  But others made up for it by opening doors that weren't automatic for us, which was very nice.  

Second downside was that I believe someone at the bell desk dropped my suitcase and broke the retractable handle, making it stuck in the down position.  I know the suitcase worked right up until we got to the hotel, because I used the handle with no problem.  Now it's dented, with no handle, which renders it pretty much useless.  I called the bell desk to ask them about it, and they told me they couldn't do anything because it takes 24-36 hours to repair a suitcase, and I should've told them sooner.  I didn't realize this had happened until our last day when I had packed up and couldn't get the handle free - I had no reason to move my suitcase once the bell man brought it in the room.  They transferred me to security and someone was going to help me file a claim for it, but the lady said she would call me back and never did.  It annoyed me (mainly because I nearly killed myself lugging the useless suitcase through the airport without the handle), but the situation isn't a dealbreaker on whether or not I'd come back again.  I would... I would just bring my suitcase up myself.",3,1,1

I have stayed on many occasions but this most recent trip was extremely disappointing. We booked a Premier Lakefront Room as we love watching the fountains from our room.  Every time I have previously stayed, the fountain music plays in the room and the show is spectacular. We paid top dollar for the room at the rate of $400 a night only to get to our room and be told that the music was not available as they were switching cable providers.  When I called the manager to complain we were told the problem had just been fixed but it was not.  I feel we were duped. The fountain show (the entire reason to pay for the lakefront room) is nowhere near as nice without the music. I feel that Bellagio should have informed us at check in that there was a problem and offered us the option of a different room, especially as we paid a premium for the show.  Instead we were offered a refund of the resort fee.  Nice, but not nearly enough in my opinion. Not good enough Bellagio, charging full price for a premium room with half a show.",0,0,0

I booked a 4 night stay at the Bellagio for myself and my husband from Nov 23-27 for a little R&R as he had surgery coming up. We have been to Vegas several times, but not that hotel. What a disappointment. I booked and paid for a ""Premier Fountain view"" room and put a deposit on it. We arrived around 9 pm after our flight and I went to check in.  I was looking forward to this.  Our desk clerk looked up the reservation and said "" We have to move you to a different room"".  This room is not available. I told her I reserved it online, and put a deposit on it.  She said if I read the fine print on the web site, it is NOT guaranteed.  WHAT??? In a nutshell what this and I am sure other hotels do is advertise a special and when you book it, and arrive late ( her words) they gave the room to someone that would pay the full rate!! I was so bloody pissed off. She said it was because I asked for 2 queen beds.  I told her I would take the King bed as originally booked, and she looked at me and said"" no, we don't have it"" They told us they were ""upgrading the room"" to a Junior Suite, but at the far end of the hotel, and with a partial fountain view. This was NOT an upgrade!!  This is what they tell everyone who's room they give to someone else. I just read a review on Trip Advisor where the customer ""tipped"" the hotel clerk $100 and not only got a suite, but free buffet and other tickets. If I had known that I would have done the same, however I thought bribery was not legal????? The best the hotel did for us, was reimburse the ridiculous $28 a day ""resort fee"".
So folks the next time the hotel tells you they are ""upgrading you"", I would say in most cases unless you slip them a huge ""tip"" they probably gave your room away to someone who would pay a higher price.

I arrived early afternoon, all the non smoking rooms were booked, so they offered to call\/text as soon as my room was ready. 8pm comes around and not one peep. I came back and they tell me it's ready without an apology for the long wait nor for not notifying me. 

I come to my room and the first thing I see is the rubber piece of the door frame hanging down from the top. As I put my jacket away, missing robe and slippers. Walking to the restroom I heard water running from the toilet and noticed the lid from the tank slightly lifted, not able to close all the way down because it was somehow broken. I decided to flush prior to using it, and of course water did not flush. Engineers arrived quickly and said I needed a new tank, they replaced the tank within minutes, but by this time it was 10:20pm. The smell it left when they changed the tank was not pleasant.

PLUSES:    very clean and well-appointed furnishing in rooms,    elegant decor throughout the premises,   beautiful fountains,  fast and efficient valet service,  friendly and helpful employees.
MINUSES:   1.  ""fountain view"" rooms do not really have a fountain view as there is a lot of separation between the hotel and the fountains. The hotel is not directly on the water.     Do not book a ""fountain view"" room  and expect to even see the fountains unless you are on one of the higher floors, at least above the 10th floor.

3.  The lotion, shampoo, and soaps provided in the bathrooms have an unpleasant scent.  Not sure how to describe them.  They just don't smell good. 
4.  The WiFi  is slow and unreliable
5.  The pools are not for swimming.  They are wading pools about 3 feet deep.  Better pools are visible from the ""fountain view"" room  window but are not accessible you rent one of the ""villas"", which, we were told  ""start at $5,000 per night"". Uhmm. Ok.",0,0,0

That's about the only thing that we enjoyed about our stay at the Bellagio this past weekend. I'm feeling generous today, so I gave them a 2, because the room was nice and the manager, William, was nice (he was the only one).

We received the most horrible customer service from the hotel staff (from the front desk staff all the way up to management). Day 1, the woman who checked us in dropped our credit card down the hole behind the computer. It took 1.5 hours for maintenance to fish it out. The manager who came over during this ordeal blamed us for the incident and told us to just be patient, we'd get the card back eventually. At one point we were told to go to get lunch (difficult without a credit card) and when we asked if lunch would be comped due to the issue at check in, we were initially told NO because it was our fault that the check in lady dropped our credit card. We then declined to get lunch, and said we'd prefer to wait at the desk to get our credit card back. It was clear they wanted us to leave the check in desk (there was a line of people waiting), because they then did offer to comp our lunch. Regardless, we needed our credit card and were afraid that once we were no longer in their sight, they'd get busy and never get the credit card back to us. So we stayed put, and continued to wait as patiently as possible for them to get us our card back.

Day 2, my mom slipped at the pool and hurt herself. When I went to get some ice for her, the life guard was amazingly nice. He was the only one. The manager he called over blamed us, AGAIN. He said that we should know that the pool deck was slippery from sunscreen being dripped on it. This happened at 9am, when it was cloudy out. I guess the other 4 people at the pool that morning had slathered on their sunscreen and dripped it everywhere? Did they not wash the deck the night before? And, really, if it's that big of a problem, they should have put a sign out ""Slippery when wet"". For the remainder of our vacation, my mom walked with a limp and couldn't navigate stairs-which for anyone who's been to Vegas before, knows is an essential skill to have if you ever want to cross the street! It was Day 4 before we received any follow up from Risk Management about this. While Risk Management was nice to us, the woman we spoke with the first person the entire vacation that was.

Not once did we receive an apology from the staff for any of this. Not once did someone say, ""I'm so sorry that your vacation didn't turn out to be awesome."" We weren't looking for monetary compensation (though we did get some). We stayed here because it's a beautiful hotel, and I'd read reviews about how nice everything was, but we received the worst service imaginable.

The fountains - probably one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in my life.
The beds were nice and soft.

CONS:
Rooms: The a\/c is loud.  too loud.  And I can hear people, the walls are too thing.

If I'm gonna pay a lot of money to stay at a luxury hotel room in Vegas, I expect for it to have better amenities than what I have in my apartment back home.  The bathtub was this ghetto looking small stupid thing.  The shower gel, shampoo, soap and lotion were stupid.  They smelled like olive oil and had no lather whatsoever.  We sat at the casino for a few hours, asked for a server about... um... 7 times... and nobody came.  Good thing my husband's a professional complainer so he let em have it for that one.  (lol he asked the supervisor, ""hey, how's your coffee?  You enjoying it?  I'm still waiting for one... yours looks great"".  ""I haven't had service since 10pm last night"").
ok im going back to making a list.

service:  Hi, can I request a late checkout?  We were up till 4am gambling money at your casino.  ""We can extend your checkout to 11:30"". ... uh, what's the regular checkout?  ""11"".  Really?  half an hour huh?  Or else they charge you for half a day.  That's not cool.

The Buffet:  Sucks, I'd rather eat at hometown buffet.  It's old and the food's mediocre.  I can't complain about the food too much, but there was nothing amazing either.  Which is why it shouldn't cost $500 for a party of 8.",3,3,1

We booked our room through a flight\/hotel deal site and arrived on a Saturday to a pretty full lobby area. We were able to get checked in quickly and headed up to our room. We were a bit surprised at the floor we were given (5th) as we were pretty sure we'd ordered something a bit more upscale, which would mean a higher floor, right?

Sure enough, we get to the room and discover two double sized beds instead of the one king. Something definitely isn't write. My partner called the front desk and we headed back down. He went straight to one of the CS reps and politely let them know that the room was incorrect. A bit of computer searching and double checking and we had new keys to a different tower on a much higher floor. We got to our room and it was more in line with what we were expecting! 

Overall our stay at the Bellagio was great and the customer service was exceptional. We had our room fixed up quick and a charge from the previous tenants was taken off our bill after it had mistakenly been applied (the minibar had some items missing when we got into the room and apparently this was charged to us by mistake as a result).

Didn't try any of the restaurants or food courts inside the Bellagio but it was a great place to gamble. Had a lot better experience with the dealers here. The run I had were very lively and seemed excited to be there. It's definitely an older much ""boogier"" crowd but that's alright, they all know how to have fun in the same way.

I immediately replied back letting her know that I was already working with a manager at Bellagio that has failed to assist with rectifying my horrible experience there sufficiently. She never replied back to me. It has been one month since I sent her a message. This is a prime example of how Bellagio has no consideration for its customers.  DO NOT STAY HERE OR BOOK AN IMPORTANT EVENT HERE!

my original post on 11\/11:
Do not have your wedding or any important event here! We had ours there a month ago and had so many issues with their customer services throughout our stay, even though I had been in contact on a bi-weekly basis with two individuals there planning our wedding for 11 months. You would think a years' worth of planning to get it right would be enough time for them to do so, especially since we paid for the majority of our ceremony, wedding dinner, and stay upfront. Some of the issues we experienced included:
-them not disclosing per room reservation fees until we checked in
-them not having on file that we were having a wedding in the hotel upon check-in so that they would know to not be rude to us. we had numerous issues with rude staff
-them booking our rooms incorrectly. two rooms were booked incorrectly in regards to number of beds needed
-they were aware, 11 months prior, that there would be an infant in one of the rooms and that a fridge needed to be there (set up for us) to store formula in-there wasn't. we ended up waiting 2 hours for it.
-our wedding dinner was one of the biggest issues. Their restaurant, The Fix, had half our money for our almost $4000 dinner paid for upfront which made them think they could set up our seating incorrectly. Us and our guests ended up waiting an extra hour for them to reset everything. A waitress was also rude to one of my guests during ordering. On top of it all, the manager on staff that night was rude to us and made no effort to resolve the issues with comping anything off the bill that night though he was made aware of how unhappy we were.
-we also ended up calling maintenance twice for service on broken audio in our penthouse suite that night. the first time, five hours went by, and nobody came.
These are only a few issues we experienced. We stayed at another hotel, while in Vegas, which was just as nice and had way better service. In addition to all of this, I contacted customer service about how unhappy we were once we got home and they have yet to resolve the issue almost a month later.",0,0,0

Bellagio has NICE rooms.  Very plush, yet firm beds.  Pool is ""simple"" for Vegas standards.  There are several.  Nothing overly unique.

Speaking of gaming, I really am a fan of this casino. I've won here almost more than anywhere and I like the general layout. They could definitely use some better ventilation, though; every resort should take a lesson from the Wynn\/Encore in this area. 
The Bellagio can also be a tourist trap due to the glass flowers in the lobby and, of course, the ever-changing botanical gardens. Jean Philippe Patisserie is also frequently busy but a definite asset to the hotel-- I love it there!! 

I've stayed at the Bellagio twice this year, and each time has been close to an impeccable experience. Classy rooms, super comfortable beds, tidy&daily maid service, and friendly staff. 

TIP: Try to request the Bellagio (main) Tower instead of the Spa tower. The Bellagio tower is newly renovated and WAAAY closer than the Spa Tower. The Spa Tower, while still nice, seems to be a little dated. The walk is also inconvenient-- especially after a cocktail or two....or 12. 

Perhaps one of the biggest pros of this resort is its central location-- with CityCenter to its south and Caesar's immediately to the north, everything is right there.

Pool was great, it's not the pool party type but more mature crowd so if you're looking to ""people"" watch you may be disappointed. 

Concierge was nice enough to give us a connecting room as we had booked 2 rooms, this made things a lot easier for co-ordinating and making sure everyone was whole, as people went missing along the way. 

Super tip: If you let the Bellagio Buffet know you are staying at the Bellagio and you're frequent visitor, etc, then they can either expedite your wait or schedule you to come back a little later. This however takes some guts as you must walk past all the people giving you dirty looks through the VIP line and speak to whoever is in charge and ask for the manager so you can plead your case. In my case I had 10 guys, and they were able to accommodate to come back in 1 hr and they will have our table waiting for us, no problem for us since we had rooms in the Bellagio and we gambled a bit. They get 5 stars for this service, probably saved me hours of wait. 

Taxi lineups are crazy though, also when you book online or whatever, you will be charged an extra 'hotel' surcharge for internet etc which is mandatory.

In future however I will be trying out Aria, I believe they have specials going on now so it's quite cheap and the rooms are very modern, as opposed to Bellagio, they are the classic feel and somewhat dated.",3,1,2

My hubby, he went all out and boy it was just amazing. We were escorted to our room by Frank, the bell hop. Our room, in the spa tower, a suite. I almost fell over when they opened the door. I started to cry. My hubby is good to me, great to me actually. I am a very lucky girl! He even had flowers waiting for me. The room, strip view, corner, amazing. Clean. Huge.

When I pulled up and saw the signs prominently displayed, I was very disappointed.

The lobby is always crowded, especially around 3 PM, when you can get access to your room. Save time by downloading the MGM app for a mobile check in. However, be sure you have your confirmation number handy or you can't use the app.

Management here is non-existent and attitude totally indifferent.-2-Most valet people are very indifferent. Neglect to tell, you there is a charge nor ask if you have a card giving free parking. I called down for a car about an hour before I needed it and it was not ready..  Very inefficient  and indifferent. Asked for number of my gold card 4 or 5 times in 4 days. 3-some of the poker room help has reverted to their obnoxious ways of old-4-telephone waits are totally unacceptable. 20 minutes to reach the front desk.-5-Check in with untrained help results in inconvenience. Ask for a room close to an elevator. They say OK but do whatever they wish, Need to get the definition of close..--6-The chain, like Vegas is run by petty clip counters.

The gardens off of the spectacular lobby are always beautiful and the themes are stunning and delightful for every age.  It's also the best place to take pictures.  Truly a wow!

Our room was very clean and large and comfortable.  We had a jacuzzi bathtub which is great at the end of the day.  We were overlooking the highway and the city, but I figure EVERYONE asks for the fountain view, so the beds are probably more worn down in those rooms.  Besides, you should go outside for the fountain show...to hear the music.

The staff was very accommodating and friendly.

Two complaints:  They used to have a really good and healthy little snack bar, with fresh soups and salads.  They still have a place called ""Snack"" but it must be new ownership.  We got a slice of pizza that was like cardboard.   And, my friend's burger seemed like it had been frozen about 5 minutes before.  Also, they used to have a french patisserie with little tables and chairs and great pastries and atmosphere.  It's gone, or blended into the gelato shop and has no seating and florescent lighting.  No fun. (Noodles was good, though!)  And, the buffet in the morning is really good.  

2nd downside:  I used to love that the Bellagio had such excellent smoke-eaters.  Even when the casino was full, you didn't feel like the place smelled of smoke.  That wasn't true this time.  I couldn't stay in the casino very long because my eyes would start burning.  Since Vegas is the LAST of the smoker's havens, there are probably more of them now....but....Cough, Cough.

This year, I decided to spend a night and enjoy the property.  I got a king, lakeview room when they had a room sale.  There were two small glitches--mobile check in needs work--I waited over an hour while others checked in waiting for an email I had been instructed.  After the wait, I went to the desk and asked if I should have received an email by now.  The person answered with a yes and she checked.  My room was indeed ready.  I never did get an email.  

The other minor problem was the TV.  The desk clerk had told me that the fountain music was on Channel 22.  When I turned the TV on, I got a message that there was nothing connected.  I managed to stop a bellman in the hall and he tried to see what was wrong without success.  He suggested I call and get someone from maintenance to the room.  I waited for about 1\/2 hour an no one showed.  I left and went for dinner at Paris because I had a show there that evening.  When I came back at about 9, the TV was working and it was left on.

Wifi is available and is included in the resort fee that's added to your room cost.  Parking is free for guests.  She told me to hold onto my room key to be able to exit the garage without paying.

Check in on a Friday is a bit of a hot mess.  They have a ton of windows open, but there is no real organization, and although the lines for each window look short, you can still wait for well over 20-30 minutes.  When we finally got to our representative, he did little to personalize the check in process and was very robotic.  

They've done a good job with keeping the rooms modern after all these years.  We did have a leaky shower upon check in, but maintenance was quick to send someone and had it fixed in under an hour.  At the Cosmopolitan, maintenance service can take all night.  
We were placed in the tower far from the lobby, located well past the observatory.  The walk seemed like an eternity in 3 inch heels, so plan accordingly.  If you want to be close to the action, make sure you ask for the main tower off the casino.

The rooms were a bit larger than expected for a standard room, and that's always a plus.  The beds were comfy and the bathroom had all the usual perks.  Nothing far superior for Vegas, but still a decent room for the price.  

There are plenty of specialized restaurants, a 24 hr cafe with decent food, the Bellagio Buffet is amazing, and a few quick bite eateries that I didn't see or visit.  It's definitely not a hotel for kids, so try another hotel if you're planning on bringing the littles.",3,0,1

It does have just a few issues, however; more about them in a moment. Like its competitors, the Bellagio is large. Unlike most of them, it is loaded with upper-end stores and restaurants: Chanel, Harry Winston, Gucci, Rolex, etc. The restaurants feature the dishes of some of the world's top chefs like Julian Serrano, Jean-Georges, Todd English, etc. When you are tired of that and need to get to your room, you'll find lots of space, very nice furnishings and a quiet stay. Downstairs is the casino, big (of course) and packed with every game of your choice, and it is especially well stocked for high-rollers. The lobby is lovely, the conservatory makes for spectacular viewing, and those fountains in front light and dance every day, and you don't have to stay at the Bellagio to enjoy them free. The hotel also has a lovely, neatly landscaped outdoor pool and cabana area. You'll pay handsomely for all that, but discounts can be found, and remember you're staying at one of the four finest hotels in Las Vegas in our view.

So why not five stars? We don't like that smoking is allowed in the main casino areas; no matter the air movement, the smell is there, and you have to walk through the casinos to get most places. Why not have special smoking areas for patrons, we wonder? It could be worse if there were more smokers, but happily fewer people smoke now than ever. Still.....  The restaurant prices are quite on the high side even for Vegas, and there is no section in the hotel where budget-minded eaters can find choices (as, for instance, can be found in another high-end rival, the Venetian). The buffet is pricey and often has line that stretch for more than one hour. At times the hotel is so full of visitors and guests it's like try8ing to move in a cattle car. And there's this: a bottle of water costs $5. Finally, there's a daily resort fee ($32) but it does include free, fast wi-fi.

The room was old, the TV was Tube, the curtains were manual. The rooms seriuosly need improvement. For the price we paid, we would've been much better off at one of the REAL 5 star hotels (Wynn, Venetian, Encore, Palazzo, or Trump).

The Bank. We were offered complementary entry to The Bank's Halloween party so I called the Concierge at 7 pm to tell them that I will be late to pick up the tickets, the concierge told me that the tickets will be help at the reception except when I went to the reception desk they said the concierge did not have any tickets. They probably gave my tickets away. So after talking to the management, they told us that the Bank does not belong to the Bellagio and there is nothing they can do but give us free admission (but we would still have to wait in line). Nonetheless, we headed over to the Bank only there wasn't a line. There was about 100 people bunched up in the middle of the casino trying to cram through one door. This club sucks. 

Given my horrible experience with room and entertainment, we did not bother to have any fine dining. We did, however, go to the sportsbar and was surrounded by a old couple who chained smoked cigars.

My boyfriend had late night dinig at the cafe by the garden (can't remember name) two nights in a row. The food was mediocre, but the prices are pretty reasonable.",2,1,1

Room was nice with a large soaking tub and separate shower and remote curtains which opened up to a nice view of ""lake Bellagio"" out front.  We really had a chance to test the quiet factor of the room, seeing as how the streets were literally packed to capacity with people on New Years Eve and we found that no matter how many people were outside screaming, the room was very quiet.  Room service was slow, even in the middle of the night but in the B's defense the entire Vegas strip is an over crowded madhouse this time of year.  My only complaint was a situation with a rude room service attendant, which was promptly resolved upon notifying a manager.  Other than the rude employee, this place offers excellent rooms (and views if your are lucky enough to get a strip facing room) which are a nice quiet escape from the madness of the surrounding Las Vegas strip.  One last observation, we noticed every time we visited another casino (Mandalay, Venetian, Pallazo) the valet was always full and we had to self-park.  This was never the case with the Bellagio, and it seemed just as packed as any other casino on the strip.

The decor throughout the whole entire hotel is absolutely gorgeous and intriguing.  From the minute you arrive, your jaws would drop. That is if you have never been to Vegas and this is your first time seeing this place. It is definitely one amazing hotel in terms of decor, but it does not deserve a five star rating because  the service was not up to par and our rooms were just not worth what we paid for.

I came here recently with a group of girls for one of my friend's birthday celebration. We decided to splurge and made reservations for two nights here. We even caught a limo from the airport to Bellagio.  We arrived on a Friday night around 8:30pm and we were in absolute hurry to check- in to our room. The bell man was getting ready to help us with our luggage until we decided to ask him how long it will take before we get our luggage if he were to help us with them. He said the soonest would be an hour. That was way too long for us giving we were eager to check- in and begin our night in Vegas. We decided to pass and helped ourselves with our luggage. 

From the beginning we were disappointed because it took about half hour before we got keys to our rooms. To make matters worse, they made a mistake with one of our reservations and no longer had rooms available with two queen size bed, which was what we had asked for. We didn't feel like fussing over it, so we settled for whatever they had, a king size bed. They offered to bring in a folded twin size bed for us, however and told us our room will be upgraded.

When we got to our room, we were quite disappointed. The room was small and the decor wasn't anything special whatsoever. It had a bit of an old fashion design to it and the bathroom was nothing to rave about. If our room was an upgrade, why on earth did we not even get a Jacuzzi? We had an average size tub, his and her sinks and a shower stall. There was one rob hanging in the closet and not enough towels for us to use in the bathroom. We just weren't satisfied with what we had received at all. We simply felt ripped- off. The cost per night at Bellagio is not cheap. The best part about our stay here was the gorgeous view our room offered.

Despite our discontent over our stay, Bellagio is a great place to explore while visiting Vegas because inside and out, it truly is absolutely beautiful. They have great shops for those who like to shop and are into designer brands, a casino for people who like to gamble, bars and lounge areas, a nightclub for some late night dancing and other amenities we all would love to enjoy. I personally would visit Bellagio again to enjoy the amenities this place offers (they also have an all you can eat buffet I have yet to try), but I wouldn't want to stay here again. Their prices are high (which is fine if they offered outstanding service), service is average, and it's simply way too busy and crowded for me to enjoy staying overnight.",0,0,0

The hotel and it's property is HUMONGOUS and though the front desk is a bit of a mess (you are just supposed to pick a line and hope it moves swiftly) there is plenty to look at while you are waiting.  

I am a bit of a high-end person so I had rented a one bedroom suite with a double queen attached; we ended up in the Spa Tower on the 28th floor facing the fountains.  The suite was gorgeous and I loved the his-and-hers bathrooms.  I did NOT love the noise caused by the Paris Hotel across the Strip.  They are incredible assholes who have NO REGARD for the general public and our children.  The Bellagio staff did everything they could to help me out and managed to move me to a penthouse on the same floor for Saturday night to try and alleviate the problem I had with the immense amount of noise Paris blasted from 11 p.m. until 5 a.m. keeping me up all that time on Friday night.  The penthouse, unfortunately, still had too much exposure to the Strip and ended up not helping me with the sleeping but I was incredibly comfortable while I was awake all night on Saturday.  

I can not recommend enough the Bellagio, even after my horrible time with that nightclub at Paris.  I understand all of the hotels surrounding Paris are working with the city of Las Vegas to rid the problem that is the volume that nightclub thinks is acceptable as far as music goes so I wish them all the best with it.  Meanwhile, if you decide to stay at the Bellagio, and I hope you do, I suggest you request a city view as opposed to the lake view room- unless you sleep like a rock under any condition.

When I first visited Las Vegas a long time ago, Bellagio was the most talked about hotel and the most upscale hotel (or at least near the top) on The Strip.  Since then, there have been many new hotels that have joined The Strip and some as elegant or even more elegant than Bellagio.

Bellagio definitely has a beautiful exterior with the impressive and vast lake as well as the signature fountains.  Inside, you will find the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens--a constantly changing (with the seasons) exhibit that makes for a good photo opportunity.  Bellagio also features quite a few notable fine dining spots including Picasso, Le Cirque and Michael Mina.  There is also a gourmet French patisserie (Jean Philippe) though all of these great things are open to the public and do not require a room stay, which is expensive though often less expensive than The Cosmopolitan, Wynn or Encore.

My room was nice.  It was fairly contemporary though there were a lot of traditional touches with the bedding and furniture.  The room did lack the sleek and modern look of the rooms at Aria.

The bathroom was nice--very spacious with standalone showers and bath tubs.  There were a few areas where the room could have been better.  The TV was an old fashioned deep TV and not a flat screen.  I often never turn on a hotel room TV though I imagine some would be disappointed to find such an outdated TV in an upscale hotel like Bellagio.

The other negative, which was a big one, was the room temperature.  The A\/C unit was not that good and even after having maintenance look at it, the room just never got cool enough, which can be a concern here due to the very hot summers.  It seems other Yelp reviews indicate the same issue regarding poor A\/C units.  However, I believe Bellagio has been refreshing the decor in their rooms so maybe these outdated elements and poor A\/C units have been (or will be) improved (I think they have moved onto flat screen TVs).

Also included in the stay was access to the fitness center, which was nice.  The pool area was also nice--many different pools and lots of greens, fountains and other scenery if you are just looking to lounge around.

Service was friendly and prompt.

Room rates are high at Bellagio, but there are times of the year where you can find reasonable room rates.  Bellagio has a room rate calendar on their website, which makes for a useful tool to help you pick a time to stay at Bellagio (best room rates are often during the week though and several top Vegas shows are dark and high end restaurants are closed in the early part of the week).

I wished I liked my room more at Bellagio.  I actually liked Caesars Palace more.  I have heard the quality of the room really varies at which tower you stay at Caesars Palace, but the room I had there felt nicer, more elegant and more comfortable than Bellagio.  And even though my first stay at Aria was at a very small room, my second stay there was at a much bigger room and its modern and sleek look felt more upscale than Bellagio.

If you can get a good room rate at Bellagio though, it can be a good hotel choice on The Strip.  It is still a nice hotel and it has a great location--right next to Caesars Palace and The Cosmopolitan, which is a real hot spot right now.  Even if you do not stay at Bellagio, it is a must visit for first time Las Vegas travelers to check out the Fountains of Bellagio, the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens and some of their food (either a more cost friendly option like Jean Philippe or one of their upscale restaurants like the good-for-Vegas Picasso).

The location on the strip is great particularly for those there mostly for shopping and fine dining. Situated right next to Caesars Palace, shopping mecca is walking distance away!

If at all possible, try to stay in the main building (instead of the Spa Tower) and upgrade to a room with a view of the lake and fountains.

The Chihuly glass flower ceiling in the lobby is still stunning while the Conservatory and Botanical Gardens just to the side of the lobby are a popular photo-op spot with seasonal displays. The current French Summer scene is as beautiful as any I've seen although my favorite may be the creative Chinese New Year gardens in January and February each year.

The Bellagio has received the AAA Five Diamond Award every year since 2000 for a reason. It is a great hotel. Elegant rooms and wonderful housekeeping make your experience in your room enjoyable. Meanwhile restaurants like Le Cirque, Picasso, Jasmine, and Jean Philippe Patisserie make dining a delight. The Bellagio Buffet is outstanding, but made even better on Friday, Saturday, or holidays thanks to King Crab Legs and Kobe-style Beef.

Shopping at the Bellagio may be out of the price range of most of us, but it's still delicious to browse the Hermes, Omega, Chanel, Fendi, Dior, Armani, Gucci, Prada, Louis Vuitton, and Tiffany shops. 

For entertainment, my favorite Vegas show is at the Bellagio. Tickets are expensive, but the water-themed Cirque du Soleil masterpiece ""O"" is worth every bit of the cost. Don't want to spend too much money, then hang out at one of the Bellagio pools. Finally, plan to spend some time being mesmerized in the evenings by music, lights, and dancing water of the Fountains of Bellagio.

My only real disappointment with the Bellagio is the Casino. The number of tables seems limited, however, the real problem is a continual sour attitude of the dealers. I played a couple days at a variety of tables (mostly blackjack and roulette) and didn't meet even one friendly dealer that even pretended to like their job. Not sure if it was a bad week, but the negative vibe was noticeable compared to other casinos hit during the past week.

Despite the sourpuss dealers, the Bellagio is a dynamic 4-star plus experience. Bring money and a positive attitude for a vacation to remember.",23,15,18

We got in and there was an incredibly long line to check in. They have a serpentine line in the lobby like a Disneyland ride. To me, this is completely unacceptable. If you can't process the people who are paying you a lot of money to stay at your hotel, then you shouldn't be taking reservations.
We finally got our key and went up to our room, opened the door and found someone else inside. Apparently this was not an isolated mistake because our friends had someone walk into their room.
We went into the hall and used the house phone to call the front desk to try to arrange a new key. After being on hold for 5 minutes we hung up and made the very long trek back down to the front desk.
There they gave us a new key. They did not offer us anything for the hour of our time they had wasted, no room upgrade, not a free drink at the bar - nothing. They simply did not care.
The room that we ended up in was adequate, but really not that great. We've stayed in much nicer places for the same amount of money in LV.
We called the front desk twice more on the trip and each time there was a 10-15 minute hold. I think that level of service is completely unacceptable. Frankly, it's atrocious and they should be ashamed.
Later we went into the pool and found out that the pool closes at 7PM. I've never stayed anywhere, where the pools close at 7PM. It's pathetic. You spend all this money, they charge you a nearly $40 ""resort fee"" (which is absurd, since there is no way to avoid it) and you can only use the pool until sundown.
Before we left we called the front desk (15 minute hold) and paid for a late checkout (3PM). The next morning, a maid opened our door at 8AM and woke us up. Later (11AM), they called us to ask us when we were checking out. They obviously have no communication between the desk and the staff.
I will never stay at the Bellagio again. Not sure where all the good reviews are coming from. The service is atrocious.",0,0,0

I was staying with my 2 children and my husband (he had a work conference at Planet Hollywood and booked late so there wasn't a ton of availability near the conference). I know I know....kids at these fancy hotels isn't everyones favorite thing and trust me traveling with just my husband would be amazing but not possible so theres that. So my main concern when booking a hotel was that (1) it would be quiet at night (2) the loud obnoxious people would not be outside our door at all hours of the night. So those two things were accomplished! The room was VERY quiet and that was the best part of the whole trip. We were on the 11th floor and tried our hardest to upgrade to a fountain view room but they didn't have any available. We did have a nice view of the pools which was fun for my children. We went to the pool once but because this hotel isn't very child friendly there weren't any smaller pools and because we didn't want to disturb anyone we went to the pool the farthest away and there was no one there. It was also 75 degrees as a high for both days so the pool area wasn't that crowded anyways. 

There is an upcharge for almost every thing at this hotel. We did a late checkout (its normally 11am but we needed 1pm). To checkout at 1pm it was $30 and to do 3pm it was $50. Parking is $15 a day. 

We did not get house keeping so I cannot comment on that. Our room was clean my only issue was that the glass shower had a lot of soap scum on the door (I didn't grab a picture of that). The sink drain made a lot of gurgling sounds which was weird but didn't effect our stay that much. 

I did like that there was a hotel employee standing at the elevator area checking for everyones room key so that was a nice sense of security. Also the wi-fi is FREE (so I guess there isn't an upcharge for everything just most things) and it was great!! I had 4 devices connected and didn't have any interruption of service. 

All in all I was expecting a lot more from this hotel because of the premium that you pay to stay here. That being said though; i would stay here again....I would get a fountain view room and I would go in 15 years when my kids are older ;0)",0,0,0

As a guest of their hotel, expect a comfy bed and get the fountain view.  They can use some renovations to make it more modern though. I mean, have you seen their tubs?  I want a clawed tub or something with jets.  Give me some more glam!

Bellagio is a classy upscale hotel, have no doubt about it.  You're connected to Aria, Monte Carlo, and The Crystals by a convenient tram and they're at a great location on the strip.

We then returned an hour later, walked through the doors into the casino and while my dad looked for a machine to play, he saw her pass by and asked if he can have a bottle of water that she had on her tray, but she paused for a second and said, ""sorry sir, I can't give it to you"" without any explanation and immediately left. She didn't even bother to ask my dad if she can get anything for him to drink. What?? Why?? From my perspective, I believe that this lady's actions were downright disrespectful and I do not appreciate that at all. I do hope that this hotel hires and trains their waitresses in a professional manner. Anyways, fast forward, my sister decided to go up to her and ask for bottled water to see what she would say and Cecilia explained that she couldn't give any because they were orders from other ""customers who only play at the casino."" What?? Why didn't you say so in the first place? Back to my dad's situation, so, he's not a customer?? What category are you classifying us under then?? She then asked my sister, ""are you even 21??"" Whoa, lady! We're not here to be questioned, we're asking for your service which is really poor at the moment. Cecilia then walks up to me, explains her bullshit in a loud voice as if she wanted the people around her to hear, making my family and I look like we're the ones who caused trouble, so I let her talk with her bitchy attitude because I don't want to argue with an unprofessional-minded person.

Housekeeping - although we tipped generously each day, the maid very pettily charged us $50 per day for my husband's tiny medication vial being set on top of the drinks in the wet bar fridge. Also, the towels we received each day were dingy and threadbare. 

Casino - Of all of the major casinos in Vegas, this is by far the worst in terms of smoke, to the point that we had to get up and leave a couple of times. Air exchange system needs updated or something.

Pro's: The hotel is beautiful, the entryway stunning, and all the stone work is gorgeous. The rooms are clean and contemporary and the hotel's location is great (middle of the strip).

Con's: Pretty much everything else. Their customer service is severally lacking which led me to the comment about them being 5 stars which I can't believe. Even when you are spending over a $1000 a night on a suite they make you feel like you are crap and that they don't need your money. Really? You don't need my money? FINE, I'll go somewhere else! 

The key reader on my $1,000 + a night suite actually broke not once but twice... having a group of people standing outside an expensive suite for over an hour while they tell you ""maintenance is on their way"" 30 times is ridiculous and unacceptable. Finally (after the second time of being locked out for nearly an hour) they completely replaced the door handle and lock. 

Their receptionists in their VIP check in area were complete bimbos and screwed everything they possibly could up - and Bellagio calls the VIP check in a perk? Come on, they were so slow and they couldn't figure out who was in what room to save their life... it was disgusting.

They also need to really work on the air quality of the casino area... yes, I know people smoke in Vegas and that is totally cool but I think the Bellagio has something wrong with their air filters because there was actually a haze of smoke you could see in the casino and the air was thick and saturated with smoke.

but end of the day we paid for 5 star resort and we expect the same service not a service we get at roadside motel, the rooms where also ok i will still insist Mandlay Bay Venetian and Plazo, Wynn are much better than bellagio",0,0,0

   The rooms in the regular tower are DESPARATELY in need of remodeling! Peeling wallpaper, cracked tiles and out of date decor can't compete with newer hotels. The Christmas displays are always a great sight, and very popular!
   The Spa Tower is quieter, but a long walk from the main casino and front desk. We got fish and chips from room service and it was inedible. What is going on here lately? The service was good as usual.

Had been extremely loyal to Venetian\/Palazzo but their service has slipped and I got fed up with them while trying to book this last trip. We just got back from our trip, 2\/28-3\/5. We were celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary so I wanted something more than the regular and they didn't want to accommodate us.

I booked the Bellagio Suite through Mlife. And oh my gosh, it's an amazing suite!!! It was beautiful and immaculately clean. It had 2 full bathrooms in the bedroom plus a powder room off the living room. I wanted something out of the ordinary and I got it!!

My only minor issues are that the toilets are extremely loud. If one of us got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, we had to use the powder room so we wouldn't wake the other up. And the other issue was the lighting in the bathrooms was not great for putting on makeup. The lighted make up mirror wasn't bright enough and the overall soft lighting in there made it a challenge to put makeup on.

Housekeeping was great. The room was always cleaned and we even got turndown service every evening. They were also quiet. I never heard their carts banging down the hallways or hear them talking loudly to each other.

In fact, I never heard anyone in the hallways. It was always so blissfully quiet and serene. A nice change from the busy and loud activity downstairs.

We were on the 34th floor so we had a nice high view. It was not a strip or fountain view. It overlooked the pool area and that was fine for us. It was more important to me to be in the main tower. 

We had fun in the casino. They have a good selection of slot machines. And there was always someone coming around every few minutes to offer a beverage. Some places you wait forever.

I really liked the location on the strip. You felt like you were right in the middle of all the action and it was very easy to visit other casinos. We only took a cab once, to get to Mandalay Bay for brunch at Border Grill. We planned on getting a monorail pass as we always do but with this location we discovered we didn't need it. It was easy to walk to the places nearby.

All in all we were very pleased with our experience at Bellagio and will definitely return.

The service was great, and sometimes, the welcome desk will do whatever they can to make sure you can get an upgrade from the room you originally booked. We were able to get an upgrade to a higher floor for a better view. At first, I was worried if we were on a higher floor, we'd have to wait and spend extra time in the elevator but there's a whole other elevator for those who are on the top floors. Best of all, the casinos, restaurants and shops are just on the main floor so if you ever want to gamble, eat or shop away, it's just on the main floor. Most of the stores are on the high end so I wasn't really into the shopping but the experience of the hotel was simply amazing. There's also the $20 sandwich tip where you could give to the front desk for an upgrade. 

I'm not sure if it was just our hotel room because they were probably trying to clean it up as fast as they could but there was an interesting stench as soon as we walked in (4.5 stars for that). The overall room was fantastic, and I know this may sound odd but the washroom was pretty nice! They provided most of the toiletry we needed in case you forgot them at home. They even had shower caps which I personally left at home and needed so it was much appreciated. 

The poolside was the best part. From observing the other pools from other hotels, I have to say Bellagio has the best one. It can be tricky to find, but it's just an elevator to the ground floor and it's there. They will ask for your key card so make sure you have that. Towels and robes are provided. Lifeguards are on duty and there's a jacuzzi. If you're into the poolside, I would highly recommend the Bellagio. 

Also, as soon as you check in, I would recommend getting the M life card for discounts. You could even pick up tickets at any MGM Resort if you've booked any ahead of time!",2,0,1

As I entered there since 2013, the atmosphere is outstanding! The arrangements is awe surprising and magical as I walked around the casino lobby.

The service inside Bellagio is doing alright to serve the customers accordingly. No problems or issues at all! I haven't got a chance to stay at Bellagio for a long time, so I'm deciding it to stay here in the next future Vegas visit.

All year long, Bellagio has the famous, and spectacular water fountain shows, so many residents, tourists, and locals will feel the awes and oohs to see the mesmerizing water shows all day and all night long! My best recommendations: watch the fountain show in the night cause it's the best ideal attraction to watch. Of course, the water fountain show is always free, so every theme of water shows will occur every 15 minutes.

The rooms are clean, good size, and have gigantic (& luxurious) bathrooms (total plus if you're traveling with a group of girls like I was)! Not to mention, the beds are large and super comfy. My only complaints about the room - there wasn't much closet space and it was somewhat difficult for us to request additional towels.

There are many pool options, though only some are heated. In the heat of summer, I'm sure it can be hard to find a place to sit, but my girls and I had no problem finding 3 open spots at several of the different pools (we went in mid-June). The crowd at the pool, though, is older or more family-oriented (which I think are more the crowds Bellagio caters to), so don't be expecting anything near a pool party. It has a much more relaxed vibe. Great for just lying out and catching some sun in the afternoon.

The staff here are pretty helpful and fairly easy to deal with. Getting cabs was never an issue, and the bellhops were all friendly and helpful. Checkout was a little difficult because the TV checkout option wasn't working, but making a quick phone call down to the front desk to check out was just as quick.

Biggest complaint: there is a gigantic dead-zone for cell phones in the majority of the casino and lobby, and service is spotty in the rooms. (In my group of girls we had AT&T and Sprint, and we all had spotty service)

Whatever room or suite you get, try to be on the fountain side looking across at Paris and at the old Aladdin (now Planet Hollywood).

The one bedroom penthouses are 1536 square feet, and include a separate bedroom, living room area, dining table, bar (never stocked - Wynn (now MGM) resorts don't believe in ""mini bars"") and very well furnished, although not with solid wood furniture (all Bellagio rooms have particle board \/ low pressure melamine plastic furniture).  The bedroom area has a steam and a large walk in closet.

The Bellagio suite is 1020 square feet, and features a sexy layout with a step up king sized bed in the center of the room, with his and hers separate bathrooms on each side (steam room on the men's side).

The regular rooms at the Bellagio are 510 square feet, which isn't bad, but there are better choices in other strip hotels and I don't recommend staying at the Bellagio if you're going to just stay in a standard room.

Upon arrival, you'll love the colorful hand blown globes hanging from the ceiling in the lobby.

The spa is about average for a Vegas strip hotel as far as its exercise area (pretty much just machines, not much free weights, not so very large), but the steam room, sauna and indoor jacuzzi are first rate.  The conservatory and botanical gardens at the Bellagio are VERY refreshing, and perfect to go through on way back from the spa, or just to go into, breath deeply, and feel energized from as a break from the casino.

There are five separate pools and of course cabanas, in the pool area.

The Bellagio fountain on the Strip is a nice tourist attraction.

Bellagio's 116,000 square feet of casino offers all the usual games, plus a high end baccarat room with multiple mid and full sized Baccarat games going at once, which is key to winning at Baccarat - the ability to jump tables when one has a random, unpredictable shoe going, and also includes European roulette (single green 0, for better odds).  The high limit area includes food for VIP gamers.  You'll need to play hard to get much free at the Bellagio.  Minimum play in the high limit area - $100., and $25. anywhere in the casino.

Cocktail waitresses here wear classic black and are picked of course to add to the atmosphere of the casino.

The Bellagio offers top restaurants, including Le Cirque (of New York City fame), Picasso and Prime Steakhouse.  Three favorites of mine are now closed - Aqua, Circo and Shintaro.  The Bellagio buffet is one of the best in Vegas, although not necessarily my favorite.

The Bellagio offers top designer stores, and a high end watch store (Tesorini).

Bellagio has joined the MGM resorts in charging all but hotel guests (who pay anyway, via a daily resort charge), for parking in their structures.  Pearl level and above ""M Life"" members get free parking, and one way to achieve Pearl status without gaming is by obtaining the M life Rewards Mastercard.

In all, a well planned top resort worth staying at in Vegas, especially if you're willing to splurge for a suite.  Although in some ways the Venetian (for example) is superior, still the Bellagio maintains five stars in my book, at least if you are staying in their suites.",5,0,1

Honestly I wasn't very impressed. GRANTED, this was my first trip to Vegas and I work in the travel\/hospitality industry, so my opinion may be somewhat colored. 

The staff is very friendly, but inconsistent. Everyone working the conference was amazing and spot-on - some of the best hospitality work I've ever encountered. Outside that, however, it was a little dicey. The front desk workers were borderline incompetent, the concierge was extremely rude, and even the casino dealers were snarky and pushy about being tipped, even if we were losing. The cocktail waitresses take FOREVER. I know they have to take several orders and travel great distances in tiny outfits, but 20 minutes for a beer seems excessive. On top of that, I had $100 stolen from my guest room and the hotel seemed very unconcerned. 

The food is pretty good. I ate at Olive and Yellowtail, both of which are very expensive but tasty. The breakfast buffet at Buffet is worth the $15 if you can eat a lot... not a good hangover place though.

The rooms were fine and clean, but very tired and outdated. I know the hotel is in the process of renovating, but unfortunately I did not get to see any of the improvements. Maybe in a year or two it will be a whole new experience.

So bellagio, my love, my favourite hotel in vegas. I've come upon thee numerous times. The garden, the chocolate fountain, the magnificant lake.

I finally had the chance to stay in your rooms this weekend, experience your swimming pool. Gambled a bit more.

Let me say this first. their rooms was drop dead....mediocre.
For $250 i'm paying for this?!?!?!?! (Normally 300+ too!) when I could be staying in a panoramic suite in the rio, or a nice suite in trumps or even the pallazzo\/venetian or aria.

The decor of the room was alright, definitely not modern, but that's ok, i liked it anyway. The room was a little small, 510 sq ft, the window was dinky, view of uhh, the swimming poool? that's not bad i guess. and the TV was disgraceful. Not even an lcd screen? but a CRT? that's from like 10 years ago? the toilet made a loud flushing noise that was the scariest i've heard. The wardrobe could fit like a dress and a suit and that's it. WHAT?? NO COFFEE MAKER?!?!?!

No adjustable lighting, no fancy, no frills. just straight to the point. But which would've been alright if I was paying $100. I just paid $250 for this? I WANT FRILLS!  This might as well just have been a nicer version of Marriott courtyard? Everything was just...so...mediocre. I really expected more. 

The bathroom had a normal tub and a glass door shower, alright. They didn't even have hangers for hand towels? what? 

Perhaps we need to shell out a couple hundred more for a nicer room. Check in was relatively quick though and they also let us do early check in at 1pm and late checkout at 1pm. In room check out is key. They also helped me mail out letters.

The pool is pretty good, a little shallow, and the jacuzzi were spread out at the end so that was kind of annoying. It's a nice pool but nothing grandeur. I've been to nicer swimming pools, but i've also been to worse. Their jacuzzi wasn't even on?! The shower in the womens restroom was also somewhat clogged up and old. At least they had soap. 

The casino vibe was nice, but the dealers, were not very friendly. One or two of the asian women were nice, but most didn't really want to be there. Not to mentioned my bf and I had awful luck! At least their pina colada was good though, and pretty big!

The garden is ever changingly gorgeous. I'll settle for the garden and lake show until I am rich enough to stay at the suites.
I've also tried the buffet over a year ago. pretty good but not too memorable. 

Tip: Stay there at your own risk! you're better off shelling $200+ at another hotel, but feel free to shell out 1k. Gamble elsewhere too if you're a young lad. PH is the place to gamble, just don't get too distracted by the boobage. Definitely check out the garden and the lakeshow. free wireless in the lobby! but you have to pay for wireless in the rooms?!

Favourites: still the garden and lakeshow

Do not want: 10 year old TV?! no hand towel hanger? Mediocre rooms

Last words: Save the $200-300 and book yourself a room at aria\/trump\/pallazzo, etc. Come back when you have over 500 to spend.",4,1,3

However, my husband and I were looking to do something ""different"" last night, and realized that it had been at least two years since we had been to the Bellagio to see the flowers.

It was beautiful, as always. It was crowded, as always. After being picture freaks with our infant, we decided to walk around and see the shops. They have the basic ones, Tiffany, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Dior.... you know, the list goes on.

However, I am very disturbed with two things.

1- The staff at Gucci was completely rude. My family has a decent house hold income, and can afford things in the store. I do not appreciate being followed around like I am some criminal ...as if you are waiting for me to throw something in the bottom of my non existent purse (I had a wristlet that can barely fit my cell phone in it.) 
---We were looking in the children's section, and I had picked up a dress to flash my husband who was....maybe five feet away, I then put it back down, where it was. I showed him a few other items, and put them back..... where they belonged.

As soon as we moved to the next section, which is 3 feet away in those designer stores, a staff member would come rushing in, to ""fix"" all the merchandise in that section. We were never asked if we needed help, or if we were finding everything OK until we were walking out. That is not the way to keep customers.

2- When we went to leave, there was a line around the corner to get onto the elevators to the parking garage. I felt as if we were on the Titanic, and we were all fighting for the lifeboats. People were getting .......let's say, sassy, and rather choosy with their words. Making it very uncomfortable.....

We are locals and we wanted to see the holiday set up so we pulled up to the Valet as we have done many times before unaware of the fact that that they now charge for Valet. We left our car and went into the hotel. The holiday set up was not up yet. We walked around for about 30 min and then decided to leave. We went to go get our car and handed the ticket to the desk and started to walk away to wait for our car and was yelled at by the Valet attendant saying that there was at $13 charge. We had no idea since valet had been complementary for years. I let her know I had no idea and asked when this had gone on effect and she had said since June. I told her that we would not have parked valet if when had known. That there was no signage when we pulled in, the attendant that took our car said nothing to us about it and it was not on the Valet stub.. She contacted a supervisor and he came over and said that there was a sign posted near the entrance and we must have missed it. He was very rude and then proceeded to say He could comp us but there was a sign so he is not going to. That is why we feel cheated. If this establishment wants to keep there local business then they should know that this city runs on the locals word. The way we were treated was very rude and to charge for Valet seems greedy of such a large business who gets there money from so many other ways.

The hotel and casino are at best the very pinnacle of average.  There is nothing at which to marvel, there is nothing that makes it an experience to remember.  Only a few pieces of art that you could see at any cheap city museum.  It is just your average, run-of-the-mill suite hotel.

That is not to say that all of the MGM-owned hotels are bad.  In fact, I love the MGM Grand and the Mirage by comparison.  The buffet was the best part about my stay here and the staff was friendly, but I spent most of my time in neighboring casinos, Caesar's Palace and Paris.  If you are looking for luxury and decadence, find it elsewhere.  

I would have been happier at one of the above mentioned hotels, and you would too, unless conspicuous consumption is your thing and you want to say ""I stayed at the Bellagio"" to everyone you talk to.  Trust me, the price is actually affordable, so you're nothing special for doing so.",0,1,0

It has acai, vodka, rose champagne, who knows what else - it's bluer than a Smurf and has a few fresh blueberries nestled on the top.  This is the best frozen drink ever, especially on a scorching summer day - even if it's served in one of those ghetto Bellagio disposable plastic cups and costs close to 15 bucks.

The food is okay - standard overpriced poolside cafe fare.  Everything is spread out all fancy-like, probably to detract from the fact that the portions are puny.  I recommend filling up with drinks.  

I had the Grilled Shrimp and Papaya Salad ($17) -  5 pieces of shrimp + 3 slices of mango + 2 slices of papaya + few slices of cucumber + a bit of coleslaw = still hungry.

My husband had the Bellagio Lobster Rolls ($21) - It's true there is more than just 1 roll.  It's also true each of the 3 rolls is the size of a little kid's fist.  Tiny bits of so-called lobster meat.  They use the cheapest part of the lobster to make it so don't expect huge chunks of firm sweet lobster meat.

The toiletries were not as impressive - I would have expected higher quality from the Bellagio.

The casino was pretty nice - the air quality was WAY better than any other casino we went to. The Buffet was pretty decent and a great deal if you can eat enough meat and crab legs. Try going around 2:30-3 to pay the lunch price but eat the dinner fare (switches over at 4). The line is at least a 30 min to 1 hr wait. I LOVED the pools - they were just gorgeous. 

The only annoying thing about the hotel was how crowded it was on the whole ground floor (lobby, cafe, conservatory, casino). There were so many visitors with cameras it was overwhelming.

2) Must check out the indoor Conservatory (just a short stroll from hotel registration area) to see what beautiful flower display they dream up. I love being surprised by their latest flower display which usually goes along with the season or hoilday. So they probably change the display every month or so. Last weekend to go along with Spring Break they had lovely tulips all over and a glass enclosed butterfly display. WOWIE...CHECK!!!

* Price: expensive, $250 on Monday night and up for weekends. The fountain view room is worth the money ! You have a view of the strip and the fountain shows all day long. You can hear the music played with fountain on channel 22. 4 star.

* Accomodation: nice spacious room, spacious bathroom but not over the top, flat screen TV. No in-room coffee maker, guest refrigerator. There is a fridge full of drinks and treats but don't open or touch it... You will get charged for just a light touch. The bed is very comfy! I could not get out of that bed. For their brand presenting of luxury, their shamppo, bath supply stuff is really underwhelmed! I had better stuff from Holiday Inn! So bring your own bath favorite supply!

* location: conveniently located in the middle of the strip. There is a walk way to Vdara, tram to Aria, shot walking distance to the miracle mile shopping. 5 star.

* Motif: high end, classy and luxurious. The room decor speaks for it, renaisance romantic style. The check-in desk with decor theme goes with the botanical garden of the main lobby. The casino is big and spacious. The pool area is beautiful and lush with 6 different pools. 5 star

* service: overall is great. The check-in staff is very fast and helpful. Check-out is done online and you can view your pofolio from your TV. The housekeeping staff is also very fast when ask for room service! 4 star.

Averaged to 5 star.

There are also many restaurants , coffee and snack shops within the resort. Most of the restaurants here is high end and dressy. The buffet is OK. Gelato cafe by the pool is my favorite after a hot day at the pool. The noodle restaurant opens till late (2am) and is casual! It is a good place for late dinning with reasonable price!

Make sure you bring your room key to the pool. They will not let you in without a key and even swipe the key to make sure it valid! 

Anyway, it is a very nice resort but expect to pay high price (even water bottles!)",1,0,1

Room Type: Resort King 
Special Requests: 
 Guaranteed Late Check-Out 
Number of Guests: 2

This is supposed to be a member of the Leading Hotels of the World and a Five Star\/Five Diamond Resort. I have been to the Bellagio plenty of times, but during this visit I did not expect this. I was repeatedly insulted, screamed at and called out to a confrontation by an assistant manager. And worse I was thrown out like a dog out of my room for no reason. 

I had a complimentary two day stay at another Five Diamond Resort and I decided to stick around in Vegas for a while longer because my check out from the other resort was on a Friday.  So, I booked a room at the Bellagio. I booked the basic king size standard room and I paid an additional fee of $30 dollars for a guaranteed check out, or so I thought.
 
I arrived early and I do not know the exact reason why I was upgraded to a suite, and I was reassured that my upgrade would not affect my late check-out. I decided to do what I came to do, which was play the table games. I played for almost five hours and gave a very generous donation to the Casino in the end. The drinks took their toll on me and I needed time to recuperate from my fatigue and I have insomnia issues as well, for which I take strong sedatives to sleep. That is the reason why paid for a guaranteed late check out because I just can't get up half way through my sleeping cycle.

It was approximately 10:53 am when my wife called the M-Life Desk to inquire about any comps for my play the previous evening. M-Life made my wife aware that they had me in their system checking out at 11:00 am. My wife woke me up and told me what they had told her and I told her perhaps they had made a mistake because I paid the fee to check out at 3pm and that the front desk would know better.

My wife spoke a front desk staff member and they did not provide her an explanation and told her that we had to check out immediately. That is when I took control of the situation and asked to speak for a manager. I was transferred to a manager named ""Jay"" and he told me that I had to exit the suite immediately because housekeeping was outside ready to clean it and that I had to leave immediately.

I asked Jay if he was the General Manager and the highest authority in the hotel, and he told me that he was. Jay came off the bat with a rude tone and disrespectful tone. I pleaded with Jay and advised him that I had paid for the ""guaranteed late check-out"". Jay screamed at me and told me to exit the room at 11 am or that he would have security come and kick me out of the room. I once again pleaded my case with Jay and he told me that the hotel was at high occupancy and that he needed me out NOW!

I asked jay for time for me to pack my belongings and leave because I was being threatened to be kicked out of the room I had paid for by security. Jay advised me I had a 20 minutes to get out because once again, housekeeping needed to clean that room NOW!
I told Jay that this was ""bad costumer service"" and for him not to speak to me in such a way because I was the guest. Here's when everything took and unexpecting turn for the worse. Jay the 'self-proclaimed' highest authority in the hotel begins to scream at me in a very loud and disrespectful tone. Jay's reply was ""Service!!!?""... ""I AM NOT YOUR SERVANT!!!"" At this point, I was afraid and shocked by the way I was being treated in such a prestigious hotel by a manager. Jay was out of control, and I felt that no one would believe such an account of events. I began recording the conversation because this Jay fellow was out of control. Jay humiliated me by telling me that I am just a ""Pearl"" member and that he doesn't have to offer me much. He was very rude and sarcastic and unprofessional.

I then spoke with someone from M-Life who connected me to the assistant of the real hotel manager, Mr. Hamlet. The assistant that I spoke with was named was Connie. Connie spoke with me over the phone and told me that everyone at the Bellagio is a VIP regardless because we are guests. I then invited Connie to listen to the conversation that I had with Jay. We began in the computer room for guests, and Connie said that regardless of what was said and what happened the costumer was always right. However, she told me that Jay had been honest about raising his voice towards me and being bothered by him being called a servant. Connie was somewhat defensive of Jay because she advised me that no one likes to be called a servant.

I'll start our experience from the beginning. Now we are far from ""gold"" or ""platinum,"" but since we became M Life members, we got a pretty sweet deal on our room. And it never felt like we were the simpleton ""pearl"" members the entire time we were there. We downloaded the mobile app and got notification that our room was ready before we got out of the airport. We skipped the line and got in the mobile app line and got swiftly checked in. 

Got up to our room and wow! Just wow! Beautiful, clean, spacious. We didn't get the water view, but got the pool view, which was still gorgeous. It was quiet and most importantly, did not smell like smoke. 

The room service gal may have been the most polite and customer service oriented person we've ever spoken to. The food was prompt and delicious.

The room was quite large and very comfortable. The shower in the bathroom had very high water pressure and plenty of warm water. Pretty much my only complaint about the Bellagio was that the fridge is ONLY a mini-bar; meaning you can't bring home leftovers from one of the delicious restaurants in Vegas and put them in the fridge. There is only room for the alcohol, mixers and candy\/granola bars.

And no, I won't be one of those people who complain about the prices in Vegas - it's VEGAS (and it's the Bellagio); what do you expect?

I called the front desk and they immediately gave my keycard access to the same room downstairs which thankfully was ready.  They gave us $60 food credit for the inconvenience, but as you can imagine the food was overpriced to begin with.    After paying the high hotel cost, they then bump another $34.99\/day  ""resort fee"" which is a joke.

The hotel itself is huge and beautiful. They have the botanical garden, fountains, and some really beautiful views! There's also the buffet, which was very basic to me.

Overall, I had a really comfortable stay. I ordered room service on my third day there, and it was super tasty, just really REALLY expensive.

First time in Vegas, and after roaming around a few other resorts, this one still came out on top, while I enjoyed the restaurants at Caesar's better, I'd totally stay at Bellagio again.
Bellagio is classy, still right in the center of the strip, a little quieter, less smoky, and just really beautiful. Plus, with 5 pools to chill by to get relief from that desert heat. 
Don't laugh, but I am not a partier nor am I a gambler, so those other more resort like qualities appeal to me more. I went to see the sights, enjoy the food, shop, and relax. There was also no one trying to sell me a time share in Bellagio, whereas as soon as you walk into some of the other resorts you get completely bombarded, I felt like I was playing a real life game of frogger while walking through some of the shopping areas outside our resort trying to avoid sales people on the prowl. 
The room we stayed in was perfect. Not a suite, but a very roomy and comfortable strip view room. Loved that there was a large shower separate from a soaking tub, and a vanity with two sinks. Also probably got some of the best sleep of my life in that bed.

Some of the reviews speak of the rooms being outdated and I did see some minor hints of that but I do not really need to dwell on that because the only way I found this evidence was if I really really looked hard for those blemishes.  Once you walk into the hotel you are just amazed by its beauty and the flower sculptures are really amazing.  The customer service is great the staff is always ready to help you and are kind hearted.  The rooms are very very very clean.  The cleaning staff is great and left our rooms looking great every day.  The restaurants are stellar yes they are pricey but the food is good and of course the water show that is free outside the casino is amazing along with the show O by cirque de solei is really nice.

If you want to stay in Vegas and feel like you are a cut above the rest of the visitors you should come to the Bellagio Venetian or the Wynne in my opinion these are the best places.  I do not like the knuckle head crowd and I appreciated that I never saw any idiots in this casino and hotel.  Vegas has changed a lot in the past couple of years most hotels are really trying to push to get the younger crowd who really just want Electronica music accompanied with their alcohol and drug induced high.  I am not part of that crowd and do not wish to be a part of it.  If you value class and elegance above all the Bellagio is the place to stay.  Only bad things is the 35 dollars day resort fee that didn't work well.  Also they started charging 12 if you have a car not cool,0,0,0

The hotel lobby\/shopping areas\/casino were gorgeous, with lots of amenities (Chihully glass sculpture in the lobby, bakery\/creperie, butterfly house, etc.), but overly crowded and noisy, long lines for check-in and crepes, and pretty impersonal.  I also certainly resented the nightly $20 mandatory WiFi fee.  OTOH, parking was free, which surprised me, but I guess all the casinos have free parking to lure the gaming clientele.

Even included hairspray and sewing kit.  Ate at the Buffet after snagging a Line Pass from Concierge.  Didn't have to beg for it, just plain asked for one.

I called to see how I could have our wedding cake delivered to our room while we were out as a surprise to my fiancé and I was hung up on.  I tried calling back 3 times and never got a live person.  

When we checked in my fiancé was just telling the cashier how we had just gotten married and his attitude was like ""so"".  Not even a congratulations.  I was not looking for attention but dang.  

We were asked if we wanted an upgrade, so we paid the extra fee, I asked the cashier if it was a jetted tub as that was what I had originally reserved, he said yes.  Well surprise!  it wasn't. 

The bathrobes that they advertise on their website look comfortable, but in reality, they are scratchy and look like they have been worn a million times and are grey and dingy.  

We were charged for food we never touched or removed!  18 dollars worth!  The toothpaste for half a tube downstairs is 14.99!  Really???  I ended up going across the street to CVS Pharmacy!  Yes I have the money to pay 14.99 but will I?  No!  

The valet was rude, the door man was rude, the front check in was rude, the place reeks of cigarettes and homeless people hanging around outside vomiting on the skywalk.  

I will never stay on the main strip again either,  there is damage to the walls outside the Mirage that was never fixed and has been there since last October the last time I was there, Harrah's has broken glass that they have silver duck tape on it!  Classy!

The Las Vegas I have come to love has gone down hill and I am not sure if I will go back anytime soon, even my favorite places have closed down and no longer there.

Yes, it is that sumptuous. This past week, I had the remarkable opportunity due to a client visit and conference to stay at the property, attend a conference and dine several times. I could write reviews of all of the components individually, but that would take up far too much time.  Instead, I will write in aggregate about many of the features.

1.  Hotel rooms - four stars.  They have delightful rooms with vast glass showers, soothing bed sheets, beautiful views, a simple but elegant turn down service and all that you should need in the room.  They don't get five stars because I had to pay for wireless access - seriously?  $15 a day simply for access seems silly.  Also, don't bother with the minibar or snack selections - they are a fortune.  The room sizes are really ample. I live in 550 sq. ft and I think the room (including bathroom) was bigger than my condo.

2.  Convention services - three stars.  Because of the size of the facility, it takes forever to walk to your venue.  There were multiple AV issues for both presenters and the audience and networking connectivity varied over time.  On the plus side, the food was remarkable at lunch and in the cocktail hour one evening, kind of meh at breakfast.  Not much to enjoy if you don't do carbs.

3. The Bellagio Buffet - four stars. They don't get five because the wait to get in can be as long as an hour, the place is usually packed to the gills and the service can be hit or miss on the drinks.  In terms of the food, it is unbelievable, particularly in terms of both depth and breadth of choice.  You don't want to go on the weekend if you can avoid it as the buffet becomes ""deluxe"" which jacks the price up $7 (29.95 to 36.95) and the ""normal"" buffet still is amazing.  Make sure you go after the high protein items.  My friend Aron and I grubbed deeply on crab legs, shrimp, prime rib, NY strip, lamb, Chateaubriand, etc...that was the value.  The Friday night ""deluxe"" buffet did include quite a few exotics - quail, ostrich, carved duck breast, etc...Oh, and to the four service people who ignored my friend Aron's request for Thousand Island dressing refill - BAD CALL \/ EPIC FAIL. How hard is it to refill the dressing container?  It cost part of the tip and prevented me from giving it five stars for the entire review.

4. The Bellagio Fountains - five stars. Watch from the elevated veranda roundelay in front of the hotel so as not to be overwhelmed by all the plebes not staying at the FABULOUS Bellagio. (That was for you Aron!)  The best part - it is FREE!

5. The FIX restaurant - two stars. Overpriced, loud and without alcohol, two people was over $160.  I know I am an epicurean, but I expect all components of dining, including environment to be amazing and in this case, deeply disappointing.

5.  The Fitness Center and Spa - FIVE stars.  Originally off put by the $25 a day (which runs from 6 am to 8 pm), we decided to go down on Friday morning early 6:30 am to get our workout on before the conference.  What a GREAT decision! As a long term weightlifter who has now looked to CrossFit and HIIT, they had ample equipment and machinery for everyone.  Loved their cardio equipment and because there was so much of it, I never had to wait a second.  The crowing glory however was the spa.  Three jacuzzi spas (102, 104, 106 F, respectively), a cool (room temp) plunge, eucalyptus steam room, dry sauna, complementary beverages, ice towels, fluffy & silky robes, luxurious large, enclosed rain showers (with primo soap, shampoo & conditioner), full on grooming with razors, qtips, etc... and shorts you can borrow, it was THE best part of the trip.  After doing a 45 minute workout, having a steam and sauna, not to mention the luxurious shower, I was fully focused and centered for a day of sitting and doing the mental work the convention required.  It was such a delight, since our day pass was still good, at 6 pm, where were we for another hour and a half? Yep, the spa!  Totally worth it.

Overall, if I was going to hit Vegas again for vacation or a business trip, I would definitely go back to this property.  Some minor lessons learned, but mostly remarkable.  No kidding about the Spa. I would go back just for that!",2,0,0

I was there on official Toyota business, ahem, so we had dinner the first night in a banquet room, that I would give a solid 3 stars too, maybe the fact there was an open bar there solidified the stars but the meal was pretty good considering our flight was delayed and we were late as hell.

Don't get my wrong. From the stunning seasonal displays in the lobby, to the impeccable room service orders, and the famous fountains...the B knows now to treat guests. 

However, after spending time in the newer Aria and Cosmopolitan properties, we couldn't help but feel like the Bellagio needed to update itself. 

The standard king rooms, still featured tube TV sets. Our shower door was squeaky, and the shower head was caked in green sludge and mineral deposits. The toiletries were in nice bottles but smelled like shampoo ad conditioner from the Double Tree. I for some reason expected Bvlgari or like the W hotels, Bliss products.

First, their rooms are boring and I expected more. It was so cramped and the window was small. The room looked old and wasn't decorated nicely. The bathrooms aren't great either, we stayed in 3 rooms there. Each shower had something wrong with it, either it was the faucet or the door. There was only 1 sink and the bathtubs were small and there wasn't a jacuzzi. Second, all their employees suck and so does their customer service. We had to move out of our first room into another room which was supposed to be connected to another room that we were also supposed to have. Turns out we had 2 rooms that weren't even together. We had to move rooms again and when we were moving our things into the room the door suddenly wouldn't open. We were locked out with all our things inside and we had to go through so much trouble to get another set of cards for the room. When we tried the new cards, the door still didn't open. So we got another set of cards, AND IT STILL WOULDN'T OPEN. They told us the door was the problem and that they would fix it right away. We had to wait over an hour for them to finally come and fix it. We ended up wasting around 3 hours over that stupid door. Their room cleaning service is even worse. We came into our room expecting it to look clean and new. Instead, the maids only did our bed and left everything else untouched. They didn't even bother to clean or replace our dirty cups and old drinks. Same with our hotel robes. The bathroom was still messy and again all they did was make the beds. We also came back into the room with the snack bar messy and touched. We got charged just for ""touching"" them when it was the maids. Besides that, we were missing our chargers and beats earphones. AND, everything is over priced. We ordered room service and ate at the Bellagio Cafe. The food was bland and tasteless but so expensive. An egg, bacon, and hash browns equaled to 18 dollars like really? Wasted money. Last, their pools may look appealing but they aren't that great. Only 2 pools allow children, which is whatever. The pool water is nasty and uncleaned. The water is either warm and smells like pee, or cold and very salty smelling. Not to to mention that all the pools are only 3 feet or under.

* It was decorated beautifully for Christmas
* The staff was super friendly and helpful
* The taxis come one after another so there was never a wait
* The fountains are just fun
* The bathroom was HUGE!
* Room was pretty clean
* The location is awesome

The negatives:
* It is pricey.  From the $6 water to the $8 pastries, there isn't anything to eat that is both quick and not too expensive
* The table limits stay quite high throughout the weekend (even at off hours) so low-rollers like me have to find lower limit tables elsewhere
* Other than the HUGE bathroom, the room is pretty typical. Nothing special here.
* The walls are thin. I could hear the neighbor's alarm go off at 5am.  We had an amazing view of the fountains but they are quite loud and were also heard from inside the room throughout the day and night (I swear I heard a random fountain at 4am).

The rooms are well appointed.  If possible, get rooms which face the fountain so you can view the water show.

Snooty upper class guests and gamblers, high-priced food, scantily clad cocktail waitresses, and dealers who had no clue about ""aloha"" spirit -- I expected all of these things of the Bellagio, and I was right.  What I did not expect -- mold-stained sheets.  Yep.  You got it.  What could be expected out of a flea-ridden, no-star motel, I found at a so-called 5-star hotel.  What made it even worse however is the staff's reaction.  Granted, our group did not make this discovery until the wee hours of the morning (3 am to be exact), but this IS the city where you can get just about anything 24 hours a day.  Apparently you can also get lectured by the housekeeping staff on how it is impossible to get clean sheets when the hotel doesn't launder their own linens. This woman ranted and raved for nearly an hour about how most of the sheets are stained and that the staff is supposed to check them before putting them on the bed.  She even advised us that we should leave a note, in big letters, stating that we wanted CLEAN sheets!!!  Um, isn't that sort of a given???  She even had to go through 6 sets of sheets to find one set of clean ones!  She then had the audacity to grumble to us that she wasn't told there were four beds to be changed.  Um, well, there shouldn't BE four beds with dirty sheets in the first place, right???  And through all this ranting and raving, not even a single apology.

Yes, the Bellagio has a spectacular water show and beautiful gardens.  So go for those things, but definitely do not stay there.  Or if you do, bring your own sheets.

On a more serious note, I wonder if the management there is aware of the serious health risk mold poses?  I mean, there is a good reason the Hilton Hawaiian Village spent millions to rid their Kalia Tower of mold.  In these trying economic times, I think the Bellagio would do themselves a huge favor to make sure their hotel is mold-free.",5,2,2

Why it's awesome: 
-THE VIEW - make sure you ask for the lagoon\/fountain side of the hotel 
- Service was fantastic 
- Love the turn down service with the chocolate squares that they leave for you 
- Nice comfy beds with fantastic sheets 
- Huge bathroom 
- You can room charge at any other MGM property 
- They have an awesome floral display with ants, butterflies, snails .. it's friggin amazing in there and smells fantastic 
- Concierge - they were able to get us fantastic seats for ""O"" last minute 

Why it's not so awesome, but I'm willing to turn a blind eye: 
- No exhausts in the washroom - if you like super hot showers like me, then you have to keep the bathroom door open to let the steam out 
- You have to pay $25 bucks to workout.. BUT it's worth it though, but just a bummer that you have to pay extra. If you get any spa services, that fee is waived 
- Room service is super expensive - it's better to get your lazy butt up and out of bed to make it to their Buffet. $8.00 for orange juice? seriously??

It was also his birthday. I had been in the lobby and casino of the Bellagio many times but had never stayed there. Decided since it was my boyfriend's first time in Vegas to make it a special trip so booked here. We ended up paying to upgrade our room when we checked in to a fountain view room and am glad we did. The view was AMAZING. Check in was pretty quick as we got there around 3 pm on a Monday. 

Our room was lovely. Large, clean and that amazing view! Whoever was our housekeeper on the 25th floor gets five stars for being awesome. Turn down service, chocolates next to the bed, ongoing towel replacement.... sigh. I wish I had service like that at home. The hotel even sent a box of chocolate truffles to the room for my boyfriend's birthday. There are multiple elevators at the hotel that only go to certain floors. This is nice as it cuts down wait time to get an elevator. I also like that there is someone that stands by the elevator bank to make sure you are actually staying in the hotel before they let you on the elevators.

The pool area was so pretty. We didn't ever lay out or use the pool but did sit out at the bar at the pool for a drink. The casino itself is great and while I am not a big gambler, I did win 180$ on a slot machine so was happy with that. My boyfriend played craps for the first time.

Room: A
I was in the spa tower, so totally non smoking (hooray). My room was large, spotless and nicely decorated. I didn't have a view but I didn't pay for one either. The bed was comfortable, and I was a big fan of the bathroom with soaking tub. I brought bath salts from home and had my own mini spa break - highly recommend. No coffee makers or fridges in the rooms FYI. Also, if you want privacy, use the sign - I swear to god they were trying to clean my room\/turndown\/etc like 10x per day. I had no issues with hearing people in the halls or other rooms but I think they don't put the party crowd where I was. 

Food: B
Standard casino mix of mostly expensive ""celebrity"" (I.e. Was on Top Chef that one time) places, an Asian place, a buffet, etc. Not many reasonably priced places but there's a ton within walking distance. I ate a lot of conference catering and rate it above average. 

Amenities: A
Small but beautiful pool area, large clean casino with a good ventilation system, absolutely stunning conservatory (done up Japanese cherry blossom style) and overall beautiful grounds - plus the iconic fountains. 

Staff: A
Great in general - helpful, friendly, always willing to help with directions or whatever.

Five stars for the two hidden $5 Black Jack tables and all the complimentary Peroni beers one can drink.  Even though I lost I totally won!  

Travelers Tip:  Look for the $5 dollar Black Jack tables.  There are only two and they are wheelchair accessible so they sit lower than the other gaming tables (which made me wonder, does the Bellagio assume people in wheelchairs have less money?  Oh well it's fine by me!).  

The first table is located in the front of the Casino, in the first set of table games right behind the very first roulette wheel in the second row away from the main aisle.  The second table  is located in roughly the same area only  in the second table gaming area. Just look for the first roulette wheel in each section and you'll find it.

First and for most, the hotel is HUGE.  I mean huge as in to get from the Front\/Check-In Desk to the room elevators (don't forget to show your room key to the attendant, else you can't get through), to my room....what an immense walk.  And that is not even going from one side of the hotel to another.

The rooms were pretty standard to the caliber of Las Vegas hotels...roomy, clean, and I was definitely thankful for a great view of the pool.  I fell in luv with the electronic curtains, but felt annoyed that the light switches were all over the room.  Can I just get one central light switch to turn things on and off?  I liked the bathroom with it's roominess and separated bath tub and shower.  And one thing I REALLY liked....the toiletries.  Being in the dessert, Bellagio was very smart to provide it's hotel guests with toiletries using Olive Oil.  Definitely saved my skin while out there for the week.

The service from the Front Desk, Room Service, Housekeeping were all very friendly.  And the only inconsistency were the room elevator guards.  I mean, smile..will ya.

Was a definite fan of the 30-40 minute room service delivery, but for being the Bellagio, the TV in the room was quite questionable.  We're talking about probably a 28 inch Panasonic tube TV.  I think the electronic curtains were more advance in technology than the TV was.  I mean, not even HD compatible.

A few touristy notes about the Bellagio.....it has a stop on the City Center (free) tram that will take you to the City Center and all the way to the Monte Carlo and back.  You just have to make your way to the Tram stop.

The Bellagio is severely lacking in simple eateries.  Aside from 2 small cafes, there really was nothing else aside from their buffet (known to be one of Vegas' best) and their somewhat pricey restaurants such as Le Cirque.

The water show runs every 30 minutes, but I believe looks best at night.  And if you can't catch the music while the the Water show is going, one of the TV channels plays the music for you in your room.

The Garden of the Bellagio apparently gets changed per season or occasion, and we were lucky enough to be there when they completed one of these changes.  Really fantastic place to capture a moment and a picture.  You'll also see some flashes in the lobby as people take pictures of that horse and the ceiling.

One KEY note I did NOT realize until it happened....the housekeeping staff has every authority to check you out of your hotel room.  How you may wonder...

Well, if you are noted to have left your room (no bags, no toiletries, no personal items left), the housekeeping staff can deem that you have in fact left the hotel...thus having you checked out of the hotel registration system.  Yeah, definitely surprise to me.

But the check-out staff easily cleared up that snaff-u.",1,0,1

The nice thing about the Spa Tower is it's easy to get to the pool from there. The pool is very nice. It's pretty quiet and relaxing.

Not only that but also, the room is filthy- there was a pill of some sort laying next to the phone, ripped wallpaper in the bathroom and molded shower door.

Beautiful hotel! Probably the nicest one I had visited this weekend, other than THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. It was a vintage, regal and expensive look to it. I have not stayed here, but I was really impressed by my visit this past weekend and would love to return.

LOCATION:
Excellent. Right in the middle of the strip for easy access all over

EXTERIOR:
Beautiful. Especially the beautiful lake in the front which gives it a little bit of distance from the actual street

INTERIOR:
Like I said earlier - regal, fancy, stunning
Entryway has beautiful glass flowers all over the ceiling

SHOPS:
Not too many. Most were very high end stores such as Prada, Gucci, Fendi, Louis Vuitton, etc. More eye candy, but they definitely match the expensiveness of this hotel!

WHAT TO SEE:
Flowers in the entryway
Window shop in the expensive designer stores
Conservatory & botanical gardens (decorated every season!)
Jean Philippe patisserie - home to the ""world's largest chocolate fountain""
The famous water fountains out front! Shows either every 15 or 30 min. depending on day\/time

I am here only bc of company meetings. If they are going to pay anyway I might as well stay here since the classes run early in the morning.

I read another Yelpers review and I wonder where they stuffed her, the maintenance room for the fountains since she complained about raggedy towels and green tiled bathrooms? I agree that I wasn't wowed by this place but things are not bad. Towels look relatively decent. I can't tell if they are new or old. There's no frayed edges and it's pretty fluffy. Everything is clean. No green moss or water scum in the bathroom. Everything is neatly in its place. The wallpaper looks sufficiently classy. It looks like attention was paid to the room. Granted, the Venetian looks better but this grand dame started the mega resort and was the first 5 star casino. I don't know what it looked like when it was new but there's a certain classiness to it. Wynn was always one notch above MGM so maybe it did go down hill a bit. It's no longer the crown jewel.

I didn't valet my car like the working American whose rental was snubbed by Valet guys who are accustomed to parking exotic cars like Maserati. I parked my humble 4Runner in the garage and walked my plebeian feet to the elevator. I just heard a gurgling noise coming from the sink after using it. Probably a little pressure issue. It has been a few years since I inspected this place along with City Center. Everything was running pretty tiptop and they were going for efficiency. Aria was LEED certified. Which I was told was the first casino to be LEED certified. Bellagio, although older was running at top efficiency.

Back to the hotel, the beds are comfy enough. The AC vent comes from the wall and looks like it's a shutter. It's pretty quiet. The window has a vent that allows outside air to come in. The wind was howling tonight so I closed it. But it's nice in the daytime when you want fresh air. Good little trick. The lights do have plugs built into them for you to plugin your AC for your phone or laptop. The clock has a smartphone dock, not for iPhone though :(

The wifi is free and anyone can login but it is kind of slow and cuts you off after 30 min it seems. It also cuts in and out at times as well. It's pretty bad wifi for a good hotel. Again, this place was conceived before the iPhone came out even so it wasn't a foresight back then. But at least they are generous with free wifi unlike some hotels that charge you.

I checked into Bellagio Towers in the fifth floor, which is around the corner from the Buffet. So far, I don't hear my neighbors unless I try really hard and maybe hear a drawer or something. Next to the bed are controls for all the lights and for controlling the drapes. These controls are next to the table\/hallway as well. You can control the lights every which way.

I am not sure what attention to detail this place lacks, other than one of the ceiling\/reading bulbs being out on one side of the bed. These things do happen so I am not going to gripe about it.

Tomorrow I shall check out the pool. Oh, they will charge you $50\/day if you mess their minibar and store stuff in there. That's just MGM's management style of penny pinching. I am not a fan of MGM but I hardly call this place second rate. Try a hotel in Reno and you will see what 3rd and 4th rate is. Dusty furniture, velour drapery and seating. Ooh, I can hear the Addams Family theme song just thinking of hotels there I stayed at.

Downstairs it's pretty busy. Asians are snapping pictures of the scenery and pictures. I guess they are the only ones that care to notice the little flowery things or decorations. I think they should make little areas for Asians to stand and take their pictures without impeding traffic. They can even set up little tea stands there and a little Segway Fun Tours bus can pick them up and guide them thru the casino floors, stopping at each Baccarat table of course. Asians do like to gamble. I joke, half heartedly. They don't make $15 billion in Macau by playing penny slots. Funny thing is I rarely take pictures of scenery or myself. I don't take selfies of myself or otherfies of other people.

What I did notice is that everyone in the hotel greets you whenever you go by, the housekeeping to the gym.",3,3,4

Because I don't go to Vegas to gamble, or for the shows, or to play. I go to Vegas for conferences and seminars... because they happen to be in Vegas, not because they are in Vegas.

The conference venue was the Bellagio. It is a stunning property, meticulously maintained, huge - there are towns in the United States and other places smaller than this one hotel - and busy. Most airports aren't as busy as the lobby of the Bellagio when I entered it. There was a *very* long line to check in.

In fairness, the staff was incredible getting people checked in. I probably waited no longer than five or ten minutes to get my turn and the clerk was friendly and efficient. 

I was assigned a room on the 22nd floor of the Bellagio Tower and given instructions how to get there. This is when you really notice how big this place is... after a long trek through the casino main floor, dragging my luggage while fighting crowds of people, I arrived at an elevator lobby with express elevators dedicated to specific floor ranges, found the right elevator and made it to the 22nd floor - quickly. Up on the floor my room was another trek away from the elevators.

Upon entering my very standard two queen room I found myself in a place that Caesar myself would have found adequate - luxurious, large, very well laid out, a stunning view, and .... quiet. What a wonderful surprise. Probably the nicest hotel room I have been in, and I have stayed at five star properties in the US and Europe.

Back to the public spaces, the Bellagio has shopping of all types, restaurants, coffee shops, art galleries, pools, spas - it really is a luxury city. The personnel is just incredible... all of them courteous and friendly. The food served was outstanding.

Pros: 
* Great room 
* incredibly courteous and friendly people 
* great venue, you never have to leave the place for anything

Cons: 
* Way to large, too much walking to get from one place to another
        o  I got my workout without working out
* In room WiFi - if you bring a pc be prepared to have to reboot several times before you can get on (that is with help from the front desk) - once you are on you have all the bandwidth and reliability you can ask for - but it is a real pain
* Calling the front desk: You'll get a recording to hold, every time. It's like calling a call center

In closing, know why you are going and what you want to do. If Vegas is your thing I can't imagine a better place than the Bellagio. For me it's a love-hate thing.",3,2,1

We booked a room through Expedia. I will start with the good things: The room was very comfortable. That means the bed was very comfortable, the shower (we didn't have a bath) was nice, and the minibar was well equipped.  Also, HD TV with convenient inputs if you want to bring your own equipment like Ipad (just bring a connector). The view from the window was not impressive (i.e. not the water show direction). The bad: it took us 30 minutes to find parking. I should note that parking is free and probably other hotels in the stip face the same problems during peak hours because many people (not hotel guests) use the parking for visiting the casino. Also, you can always use valet parking if you wish.  The way from the parking to the hotel was tedious. Generally it feels like walking in a busy shopping mall with your suitcases. Not a feel of a luxury hotel. There are many pedestrians tourists coming in to the Bellagio to see the water show and inside to walk around. This is part of the experience of the strip, I guess. However, this makes the place be less elegant and more like a zoo. The front desk is located within this chaos and the clerk at the desk was pretty cold to us. But I could understand that she was very tired herself from all the noise around. At the check in we were also informed that we will pay another $28 dollar per day for a ""resort fee"". I think Expedia should inform clients about this fee when booking because it is a serious addition to the price. I also know Priceline does not inform about this fee. This is common to other hotels and you will not know the fee until you know the hotel. During my time of visit there was not much a ""resort"" feeling because the only free thing we used was the internet (which btw worked great). However, It was too cold to use the outdoor pool (we didn't see anyone using it and it may have been closed- not sure). The water show which I heard so much about before I came was also not such a big attraction in my opinion. Yes, if you pass by you should stop by and watch but don't book a room at the Bellagio for this reason. Just stop by like most others.  Generally, some people may be impressed from the indoor decorations. If you come from Europe you will probably not be impressed at all.  The Bellagio is more a pretentious hotel, not schick.  This is my opinion- many people will probably disagree with me. Many others will say this is Las Vegas. But I have seen much classier lobbies and casinos in Las Vegas during my visit. From my walking around I prefer the Aria or Encore lobby, for example.",1,0,0

My friends had already checked in by the time my boyfriend and I arrived, but they did say the process was quick. The room was clean upon arrival and was a decent size. We paid for a fountain view room and were in the Spa Tower. Unfortunately, the view of the fountain was not the best (we had to go to the right side of the window to see it). I would hope next time that booking this selection would render a better view.

There are a few dining options inside-- we got a crepe on Sunday from the crepe place. It was super good and a decent price compared to most food in Vegas (~$13). My boyfriend and I split it and couldn't even finish the meal. Service was a bit slow, though.

The lobby is beautifully decorated and there were fall-themed decorations in the atrium area. It was SUPER GORGEOUS and my favorite ""autumn"" decor I saw all weekend. The only place that has a nicer lobby\/hangout area is the Cosmo.

I didn't hit the casino here at all, but my boyfriend did. He was a bit upset that, though he was playing for nearly 20 minutes, not one person came by to take a drink order. NO BUENO! The tables are upwards of $15 minimum bets, so we didn't play anything. 

My friends got room service one night and it was rather quick and the food decent. It ran them about $60. We got drinks at the pool bar and one of the bars in the casino... They were good, but very pricey (it is the Bellagio though!). 

The pool was nice. We tried to sit in the ""nicer"" pool area with comfy chairs and were told. we would have to pay $100 per chair for the day... Um, no thanks.

Someone told us theres a park about a mile down the road...Really?? Why do you take pets, offer no place for a pet to potty and charge $125 a night...not to mention, they charge if your pet has an accident.. I bet alot of pets have accidents...It comes from not having anyplace for them to relieve themselves! Also, they want you to keep your pet kenneled when you leave the room...which I'm fine with..except for the fact that they have you sign a paper that if your pup barks, they will come to your room, take your pet, and board it til you leave..you have no say, and can't get your baby til you leave...and they charge you for that!

For breakfast I was happy going downstairs to the cafe located near the pool for a croissant and a mocha java.  when one is in Las Vegas, you never spend much time in the room, but it was a welcomed retreat after a late night of dancing and drinking.  The view of the strip and the fountains were fantastic.  The marble soaking tub is big enough for two.

One complaint....the Conservatory this trip around was hands down weak....It was a Chinese New Years theme and it was plain slapped together like my tacky neighbors Christmas display. I can't wait for their next scene....maybe a wonderland theme like the year's past? If you have never been to the Conservatory, it's always fresh and WORTH the walk and changes every season.",0,0,0

It has been a 5 star venue for us because of their excellent customer service, luxurious appointments, great location and amenities, etc.

But things seem to be going downhill.  I blame it on wear and tear, not just of their rooms and facilities, but in the casino, and most regrettably with customer service.

Bellagio remains a high-end hotel.  Shops are expensive as are the eateries.  I am not a whale, my wife and I are not extravagant in our dress (she does like her shoes and purses, though), but we have usually been treated with respect and there has always been that extra effort to accommodate our needs.

During our last two stays?  Not so much.  It's intangible..... a look you get, hesitation before a response, a smile that doesn't seem right......I don't think it's my imagination, or is it....no.....maybe......

Last year, someone got into our room.  We didn't have anything taken, but a box of candy was half eaten and a bottle of water was gone.  We reported it and were not charged, but hmmm.....who has access to our room (I know I locked up), an employee?

When I play the slots, I'm always collecting change as I cash out my tickets.  We were killing time before we were to leave for the airport and I had acquired a pocketful of change. I went to the cashier cage and asked if she could take my change because I had a plane to catch.  She practically laughed in my face.  I was tempted to do something rash, but we needed to get out of Dodge and I let it slide.  If I had reviewed the place then, it would have gotten one reluctant star from me..

This last time, we were comped 3 nights and we gave the Bellagio one more try.  It was a much better stay.  Check-in wasn't so stressful.  Maid service was good, and they now have a change counting machine in the casino.

The Bellagio is still a great hotel, but iit's lost some if its sheen.  Definitely not what it was 5 years ago.  T",1,0,0

Out of all the hotels I've stayed at The Strip in Las Vegas, I can say that this is by far my most favorite one.  The Garden Conservatory itself by the lobby is a great free attraction which is wonderful to look at.  Check in line is quick and efficient especially around the time before lunch if you opt to do the early check in time at 10AM which we did for an additional $40 and late check out is at 3PM for the same price.  One of the main reasons why I chose to stay at Bellagio, besides the fact that it's in walking proximity of everything, was because of the Dancing Fountains.  I could never get tired of watching the Fountains of Bellagio.  The view from the Deluxe Fountain View Room was perfect.  I liked how the room was clean and amenities were complete even if we checked in early and checked out late.  The bed was just so soft and firm at the same time that I slept really good.  Everything from the bathroom, the view outside, to the bed was great and accommodating.  Check out was very easy to do since they give you different options to skip the line when checking out like via the TV in the room or by email the then you just have to drop the keycard in one of the boxes by the exit after the elevators.  I believe the price we got for 2 nights was reasonable especially since I've signed up at M Life Rewards Program before booking which I recommend that everyone do prior to booking.  Overall, I loved the stay here at Bellagio and would definitely go stay here when we decide to go to Las Vegas again.",0,0,0

The only trouble is there are tons of tourists walking around looking for fun which is great and all but it can really take a long time to get around the place. Just plan extra time to get anywhere and plan to walk slow. The spa is nice and they have a great salon where you can get your hair and make-up done. I go there on most trips and I always leave feeling fabulous. There are several great restaurants there like Prime and Picasso's that I recommend. Also, the piano bar in the front is a great place to people watch and they serve caviar. I only gave 4 stars though bc while it's a beautiful place it could use some updating as it's been there quite a while and it's starting to show its age. And it has a rep for having some of the tightest slots in town so you may want to stick to the card tables here. The Bank is the nightclub here and I really like it. They usually have a good dj remixing top 40. It may not be the most flashy club out there but they treat you really well, especially the ladies and it's a lot of fun. Also, O is the cirque show here.

The lobby and most of the main floor was fully decorated for the holidays.  The Bellagio brought holiday decoration to a whole new level, and none of the other hotels I wandered into during my long weekend in town brought it like the Bellagio did.

It is pretty clear that the changing economy has greatly altered the landscape that is gambling in Vegas.  There were far more $10 tables than I've ever seen here before.  Even at the Bellagio, there were penny and quarter slot machines.  None of which took actual coins, mind you (so glad I brought my quart-sized baggie of quarters from home, which the Bellagio was unable to change for me because apparently they no longer have a CoinStar machine in their cashiers booth).  It never occurred to me that Vegas wouldn't willingly take my cash, even if it was a 12-lb baggie of quarters.

The Bellagio's casino felt cramped.  Not the large walkways between gambling locations, but the machines and tables all felt completely crammed in on top of each other.  And the Bellagio is one of the worst locations on the strip for smoke-to-oxygen exchange.  Caesar's next door does a much, much better job of making you feel like the air you're breathing is only mildly toxic.  We did most of our gambling next door for exactly that reason.

The room I reserved wasn't quite what I was expecting, but apparently the fantastic rate I managed to secure a few months back was far too low to obtain a full fountain view corner room, even though that's what I thought I was reserving.  Love the blanket disclaimer on the web site that lets you know that they reserve the right to screw you long and hard and give you any room they feel like upon arrival.  Cue the passive aggressive counter staff.

Truthfully, my overall stay was perfectly fine.  I even figured out that if I pressed my forehead up against the window of our room, I could kind of see a water cannon or two in the fountain up front, so maybe the hotel felt they fulfilled any obligation to me they may have had.

Been there, done that.  Next time, I'm staying at Caesar's.",5,3,1

Came to Las Vegas for my significant other's birthday with a lot planned, and I walked out of the house without tickets I paid for to see a show. 

PH (the hotel I usually stay at) charges $7.50 for 15 minutes of internet use with $1.50 for each print. 
A bit ridiculous, the resort fee is should cover internet use just as it does with wifi. 

Anyway, my significant other gambles at the Bellagio so I thought I would ask them for help. The Bellagio instead charges per the minute for the amount used, rather than a set charge. 

Andrew at the concierge desk went above and beyond to help us. Rather than pointing us to the direction of the business center which was our initial question, he helped us print out our tickets right there at the desk. 
It may have been a simple gesture, but he took a lot of stress and worry from me. Makes me consider my hotel choices as we stay visit Vegas frequently.

Well, I sort of felt that way after my first stay at the Bellagio.

As a kid, a road trip Vegas was like a yearly ritual. For my parents, it was the ultimate family vacation because it was affordable and relatively close in distance. Being exposed to second hand smoke, addictive gambling, hooker billboards, and porn slappers on the street? It was a small price to pay for $29 a night at the Circus Circus, pigging out on buffets, and winning an arm full of stuffed animals at the carnival. 

Fast forward to adulthood, and things aren't that much different. I rarely turn down a good deal, and I typically stay at some of the better value hotels on the strip like Bally's or Paris. But this time around, Bellagio lured us with a book 2 nights, get 1 night free deal. Overall it still wasn't that inexpensive, but I was excited and had high expectations. I wanted to bathe in luxury. But all we got was a puddle. 

It's safe to say that in order to enjoy everything that Bellagio has to offer, you have to ante up. Want a lake view room? Extra $20 a night. Want access to the gym? $25 per day. Going to the buffet on a Friday or Saturday? Extra bucks for the ""gourmet"" dinners because lamb and beef wellington are on the menu. It's only the beginning.

Alas, our ""deluxe"" (aka standard) hotel room had to be luxurious, right? Well, not exactly. While it was spacious and had all the usual amenities, the room lacked any sort of character or ambiance. The window view was the roof and some construction cranes. Service throughout was indifferent. The dealers were grouchy. But we get it. A fat wallet speaks volumes and undoubtedly enhances the experience. But the highlight of my stay at the Bellagio? Those automatic curtains that open and close at the push of a button.

I highly recommend the Bellagio for anyone visiting Vegas!!  We saw a show at the Luxor, the MGM Grand and the Mandalay Bay and none of them compare.  I promise this is the best of the best!",3,1,1

I have enjoyed the Bellagio in the past but I had a bad experience during my recent stay. I would be unlikely to stay at the Bellagio in the future or recommend it to anyone.
 
Here is what happened: Once I checked into my room I noticed that my toilet wouldn't stop running. I called engineering to inform them and to see if they could fix it. I left my room for dinner and when I returned to my room at around 9:45 pm. The toilet appeared to be fixed but I noticed a large towel on the carpet by the bed. I lifted the towel and the carpet was soaking wet. I then called the front desk and informed them that the carpet was soaking wet and that there was a bad smell as well. I asked to be moved to a different room. I was told that the hotel was completely sold out and that I would have to stay in that room until later in the week. I was told I would be contacted in the morning about a room change. They sent someone to spray and shampoo the carpet at 10:30 pm at night. It was still wet and they laid towels back on the wet carpet. The smell was still there too. As a result I didn't sleep well and didn't feel good about my stay. The next day I was in meetings all day and when I got back to my room at lunch time I hadn't been contacted about possibly changing rooms. The smell was still in the room and the carpet was still wet. I wasn't contacted yet and it was about 12:15 pm. I called the front desk and they said they could move me to another room but I would have to wait until after 3 pm. They told me they would contact me when the room was ready. I got back to my room at 5:00 pm and I still hadn't heard from the front desk that my new room was available. So, I called the front desk and they told me they finally had a room for me. I got the new room number and moved to my new room around 5:30 pm. 

I didn't feel like I was a priority to the Bellagio and the customer service was poor. I will stay at other properties in the future as result of my recent stay and will not recommend to the hotel to anyone.",3,0,0

Je vous arrête tout de suite : bien sûr que c'est kitsch à souhait ! 

Mais c'était le but totalement assumé de ce petit trip au Nevada. Nous avions réservé une graaaande chambre, une fois à l'accueil, on nous propose de nous upgrader gratuitement dans une suite dans les étages supérieurs de l'hôtel. Mais bien sûr, avec plaisir ! 

Chambre immense, salon, salle d'eau (avec douche-hammam), salle de bain (avec bain à remouds), trois toilettes (3 ?!), trois (ou 4 ?) télés, 10 coussins et de petits chocolats sur le lit, surabondance de produits de beauté... ? N'en jetez plus ! Le Bellagio, c'est ultra bling-bling. C'est un peu n'importe quoi, mais une fois de temps en temps, qu'est ce que ça fait du bien. Retrouver son lit fait en rentrant du restaurant, voir le soleil se coucher sur les montagnes, dormir au 30ème étage, commander un petit-déjeuner gargantuesque au room service... Je ne fais ça qu'une fois de temps à autres, et quand je le fais, je veux que ce soit parfait ! Et rien à redire, ici, ça l'était. 

Et que dire de l'hôtel en lui même... Bien sûr, là aussi, c'est du grand n'importe quoi. Entre les fontaines (des fontaines lumineuses qui jouent les Beatles ou Sinatra, quoi !), les boutiques, les restaurants, la chapelle, le casino, le Cirque du Soleil, il y a ici une ville (bien kitsch) regroupée dans un hôtel. Au début, ça fait très peur. On a rigolé, on s'est dit que ce n'était ""tellement pas nous"", et puis zut, on ne vit qu'une fois, alors on a joué nos 6 dollars chacun au casino, pour rigoler, on en a regagné dix, on a pris des photos débiles dans notre suite, on a dévoré notre petit dej, on a fait semblant d'être des riches américains, ou des nouveaux riches bling-bling. Et puis on est reparti, avec plein de souvenirs et plein de fous rires ! Et si c'était à refaire, on referait tout pareil !",1,4,4

Because of the holiday and the huge crowds, there were signs posted all over that only guests could enter & keys needed to be shown. Well, one of my girlfriends & I just walked right in and had a blast! 

Since we were there during the holidays, after watching the fountain show, I was able to see the beautiful flower display, complete with toy trains with live cameras! The blown glass ceiling decoration was so fabulous I spent a good 20 minutes taking photos. The salon looked wonderful, although obviously on such short notice we didn't attempt to make an appointment. The pool was gorgeous as well.

Do I like it? Sure. Is it a preference? No, not really.

Rooms are nice. Plush, ornate, luxurious, great views. I don't have much to say about this hotel except that it is exactly what you would expect. It's an amazing hotel and resort, but I was left a bit unsatisfied.

Restaurants in the Bellagio are under par in my opinion. 

I make it a point to come here only because this is the only place on the strip that has single deck blackjack at $100 a hand. Normally for single deck, you're either off the strip or you're putting down way more per deal.

Count cards and come here.

also, why is the fitness center extra? i had assumed that'd be thrown in.  but the pool was of course available, and man was it nice.  i rather enjoyed laying out in the 100 degrees by the water for a while.  and it wasn't crowded at all.

It is a b*itch to get to on a weekend since its possibly the only casino with just one way in off LV blvd. Pedestrians never pay attn to the light and there's always some @sshole who blocks traffic by stopping to watch the fountains. But once you get past that, the self park usually has open spaces and its a quick walk to reach the casino. 

The moment you enter, you're hit by the strong scent of the thousands of flowers filling the conservatory. I love that it's your first impression of bellagio. The conservatory is a must see, but I recommend going after midnight, and not on the weekend. Otherwise you'll have to fight your way thru Asian and European tour groups and every step ruins someone's picture. It'll be a much more mellow experience going at a slow time so you can really enjoy it and take your own pretty pics. 

The conservatory is changed for several seasons - chinese new year, spring (w live butterfly garden), summer\/4th of July (very patriotic, my least fav), autumn, winter\/Xmas. You can tell they've cut their horticulture budget a little, but its still a magical place. 

The water show is another great free attraction and is best seen from the dead center. Don't bother fighting the crowds near the main valet. Its less of a clusterf*ck if you walk thru the casino and shopping esplanade, and go down the escalator to the blvd. Show is every 15 min at night, I think it's every 30 in the day. Go at night if you can - makes for better pics and its just not the same without the lighting. They don't have the show on windy days, and you can ask the concierge desk for the show schedule if you're there for a specific song. The Sinatra ones are fun, but I'm partial to the slow songs like Titanic theme and the Andrea Bocelli song. 

Bring a couple cocktails or even brown bag it if you're feeling ghetto. Just kickback and watch the show for an hour - a great cheap date. 

Now the negatives, which are the rooms. The previously mentioned traffic is a problem if you're staying there and have to deal with it throughout your stay. Valet has been extremely slow in my experience (30 min on sat nite). And if you're older, its kind of a far walk down somewhat slippery tile to get to the valet pick up area. The registration desk is conveniently located, but then its a pretty far walk thru the casino to get to the rooms. 

I was really disappointed in the rooms. I had always wanted to stay at bellagio, so I had high expectations. The rooms seemed dated, and they weren't well maintained. Working at a hotel myself, I do look at things with a more critical eye, but I called engineering to replace a couple light bulbs and fix the bathroom door which wouldn't stay shut. There were also streaks of something on the ceiling above the bed. And this has to be one of the few hotels in Vegas that hasn't upgraded to plasma\/LCD TVs. I was pretty shocked that they still had big old TVs with a really grainy picture. Hotel prices have come down in general, but bellagio still isn't what I'd call cheap. 

So hang out at bellagio - check out the free attractions, have some cocktails at the baccarat bar and a great dinner. Just don't stay there, you can do a lot better for the money.",0,2,1

That being said, I can compare it to other hotels I've stayed at outside of Vegas at a similar price-point and star-rating.

The good:
-room service was fantastic, even making up a special gluten-free box lunch for my partner for a trip out to Death Valley.
-rooms were comfortable, a good size and well appointed.
-the fountains were fun to watch and the pool was beautiful, even though it was too cold to swim in late March.

The bad:
-customer service, apart from room service, was non-existent. I realize it's a casino, and there are a lot of non-hotel guests milling about, but it felt like I was putting someone out to even ask directions.
-the restaurant choices weren't spectacular, but *were* spectacularly priced.

The ugly:
- everything smelled like cigarette smoke, which made me ill. It's ridiculous that you have to walk though the stink just to get to your room. And even though we were on a non-smoking floor, our last night there someone was smoking in the hallway or something because smoke infiltrated our room. Seriously disgusting! I spent virtually zero time in the casino, but my clothes and hair still smelled like smoke each night. 

I gave it 3 stars only based on the speculation that it might not be the best, but maybe it's better than other places on the strip? At least the rooms and hallways were clean. But, that's a sad way to judge a 5-star, 5-diamond hotel.",1,0,0

The casino floor appear rather darker than many of the other hotels, but that could be due to the old drapery changing colors. The flower exhibit is beautiful however anyone from other hotels can view it as well. Maybe it was my expectations that were too high but I felt as if I was being charged for everything. Expensive does not always mean good. The hotel charges for everything and please do not touch (seriously it's on a sensors and you will be charged like me) the refrigerator. There were robes in my room but I was too afraid of a fee, I did not touch them nor did I ask. House keeping did their job however we would always return to the room with my mother's purse  unzipped.

BIG MISTAKE! This hotel is a different place from the hotel it was when I stayed here and it was owned by STEVE WYNN. For starters we left our car in valet where we found out it was $19 a day, of course I expect to pay for valet, I figured I transfer my car to self-parking the next day, that's when I found out that SELF-PARKING WAS $10 ADAY. EXACTLY WHERE DO THEY EXPECT GUESTS TO PARK? Then I had to stand in line TO CHECK IN FOR 45'MINUTES. I felt like I was in a ride at Disneyland!

They also have the other ones they don't charge for, but it's FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE, and a word of warning....come EARLY and DON'T LEAVE YOUR TOWEL UNATTENDED FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR BECAUSE YOU'LL LOSE YOUR CHAIR. It happened to us! When you add that to their thrifty use of TOILETRIES and TOWELS(one bottle of shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and two sets of towels for a room that sleeps four) it gets a LITTLE FRUSTRATING.

Sober me hates drunk me.
But Bellagio's staff were more than glad to help drunk me find my glasses. At 5:30 am. And then, when they brought them over to me, the nice man even told me where I had left them, with a big smile on his face, as if it wasn't the middle of the night, as if I hadn't totally sounded like a stupid drunk idiot asking hotel staff to go looking for a pair of glasses I might or might have not left behind.. 
Goodness are they nice over there.
And then, of course, there is the time my girlfriends and I ran a hot bath so we could soak our feet in it. .And called concierge for some bubbles- Bubbles you ask? Oh no. They sent up two baggies filled with goodies like bath salts! All that was missing was a rubber duckie. But I'm not going to hold that against them.

Rooms
The best hotel in Las Vegas to me is the Wynn. I've stayed at the larger suites in BOTH (Salon @ the Encore and Presidential @ Bellagio) and you can tell the difference by seeing the attention to the details. Little things such as TVs (huge flatscreens), bathrooms, layout, artwork, and decor are better at the Wynn. The biggest thing I notice is the upkeep. Bellagio rooms need a makeover to keep their elite status in my opinion. Carpet, fridge, TVs, and bathrooms were all underwhelming. When you go into a Bellagio class Suite, everything should be something you can't get at home. If your TV at home is bigger, then you're not going to be impressed. I think Bellagio is right there with hotels like The Cosmopolitan. This is just my opinion, but The Cosmo is only nice because it's new. Their rooms are very modern, but don't necessarily convey luxury in every aspect. I like it, but both seem a little less amazing than the Wynn -- close to great. Also this was for the larger suites. Some of the regular rooms have seen some modest upgrades.

Service
Both are quite top notch. I haven't had an issue with either.

Restaurants and Attractions
highly debatable. It really depends what you want. If you want to club, then Wynn has XS. Buffets are good at both. Wynn has some stuff Bellagio doesn't but Bellagio's is one of the most consistent and solid buffets in Vegas. The nicer restaurants. Honestly I haven't been to most of them. I do know that from the people I've talked to the overall impression and consensus seems to be that the Wynn has more wow factor. The food itself is good at both. Next time at the Wynn, I plan to hit up Sinatra.

Gambling
Both are catered more to higher end gamblers. I mainly play poker, so it depends what you're looking for. Both casinos are made to gamble and they are not like the Cosmopolitan where it is more of an afterthought. Bellagio has been stepping it up with more tournaments and high roller rooms and separate room for celebrity status players. I recently saw Doyle, Gus Hansen, and a bunch of others just chillin at the Bellagio. I prefer the Bellagio poker room, because it's more comfortable. The Wynn's buy-in is higher and the competition is more stuffy (which can be good or bad).

For me personally, Bellagio is old money. I recently got upgraded to the MLife Pearl status which apparently gets you to the front of the line at the Buffet. Saving at least an hour will definitely warrant a return. Also staying anywhere near City Center (Vdara, Aria, Mandarin, Cosmo), Bellagio is the best place to play so I see our relationship continuing to flourish. The Wynn's main issue is that it is further north, so can't really walk to and fro. Yes, I said to and fro. No, not talking about hair.

Tip: Water Fountain Show is still fun to watch as you pretend you're one of the Ocean's Eleven crew. Here are the show times:
Monday - Friday
3:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m. show every 1\/2 hour
7:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. show every 15 minutes
Saturdays, Sundays* and Holidays

It is centrally located on the strip and we had easy access to the entire new part.  We had not been to Vegas in 20 years and everything has changed.  There are out door escalators everywhere and moving walking paths too.
The hotel staff were very nice, helpful, and ready to help with anything we needed.  They also have a very good fitness center not to mention the incredible pool area.  The room was nice, had plenty of room, and over looked the pools.
Overall, this was a great vacation and we would recommend the Bellagio to anyone.

The hotel is beyond beautiful and the restaurants are delicious. The reason why I gave it a one star is because several employees treated us very rudely. It feels as if some employees feel more entitled than the guests. There was a lady in the front on friday offering water bottles to the guest who kept rolling her eyes at us for no reason. The young man at the shop by the guest elevators was always looking at us like we were going to steal, very unprofessional. The security that stand by the guest elevators in the spa tower some would rudely ask us for our room key. They would only ask ""certain"" guests not all for the room key. I witnessed this one incident where 2 employees were laughing at a guests face and making rude comments to him. I felt so bad for that guest, the employees handled the situation very unprofessional. Monday morning came to check out and we were a little confused an employee suggested we take an uber to the airport and said we would have to go downstairs to take it. We went downstairs and asked an older man(employee wearing a white shirt and black pants) what the name of the airport was and he started giving us attitude telling us what are we trying to do. I told him we were sent down here to take an uber and he just starts yelling at us that we are wrong and shouldn't be down there ubers are taken up stairs on the side. I told him we were directed this way and a sign was posted to take ubers downstairs. He got mad and started yelling at me telling me that hes been working there for years and that I'm nobody to tell him how to do his job. He mumbled other things and walked off, his argument made no sense as all we wanted is to know the name of the airport. Another employee overheard and shook his head in disbelief, then greeted us and said to us it's better to take a taxi. We got in line for a taxi and the employee that helped us out was so nice we thanked him and tipped him. Not all employees were this bad, the front desk  was awesome and the housekeepers are so nice and greeted us every time we walked by. Forgot to mention several things in our room didn't work like the light up mirror or the outlets in the bathroom. We also asked for a fountain view room and they gave us the view of the parking lot, we were disappointed. There were 2 items missing from our fridge and snack bar so I'm pretty sure we will be charged for that, even though we didn't take it. The hotel is beautiful, but the lack of good service by their employees is what makes me never want to come back. I'm still in shock that were treated like that after all the money we paid to stay there. We could afford to stay anywhere we wanted in Las Vegas and we chose the Bellagio, that was a mistake as it ruined our mini vacation.

Impeccable service from the moment you check in .
The whole place is gorgeous,  and as i said the fountains are simply magical.

Bellagio also has incredible dining options with Picasso, jasmine, Michael Mina,  and Prime. Cafe Bellagio is also great for late night dining .

I'm usually swayed by some super-low-rates or new casino promotions at other properties, and I like to earn my Starwood points at the Westin, but this time everyone was at the Bellagio for a recent family get-together, so I joined in.
  
My recommendation to fellow Yelpers is to go for the Belllagio Suite.  Not the penthouse or anything crazy, just the basic Bellagio Suite.  These are plenty of promotions and discount codes out there; you'll end up paying about 1.5 times the price of a regular room, and you are going to thank me!  My promotion (Bellagio Summer) included a $100 food and beverage credit.  Yes, there is a $28 ""resort fee,"" but everyone seems to have that nowadays.  But, you say, I'm never in the room anyway except to sleep.  Hear me out, I say.  Here's why the suite life is so sweet:

1.  Preferred Check-in.  The Bellagio lobby, though pretty, is always in a state of pandemonium.  Suite guests get their own ""Invited Guest"" line which was never mobbed during my four day stay.  Totally worth it to whisk in and out.   Fancier suite guests get their own check-in room, but no need to go there.  

2.  Front of line pass.  The Bellagio buffet is, I suppose, a must do.  When my group arrived, there were over 300 people in the buffet line, snaking out along the casino.  The VIP line, for high rollers and other cool guests like you, had not one guest in it.  Suite holders get a free front of line pass, good for the buffet and the Bellagio Cafe.  Worth its weight in crab legs!  We were inside and seated within two minutes.  

3.  The room.  Suites are on high floors, 27 and up, and have their own elevator banks.  Even the suite hallways are different, and, not to sound boy scoutish about it, they are just beautiful; my friends from lower floors were astounded.  We did not spring for the much pricier Fountain View suites (for eyeballing the famed Bellagio fountains), but the standard view suite (of the Rio and beyond) is pretty awesome.  Even for a jaded Vegas Yelper, the suite furnishings and size will take your breath away.  Three bathrooms, a huge 600SF living room with furniture I would like to have, and separate 600SF bedroom with super comfy beds.  I'm a sucker for that TV-in-the-bathroom-mirror thing, and there are two.  

OK, enough already, give it a try.  A hit!",19,13,12

 I booked the Bellagio for three nights while attending a conference. The hotel itself has many fine dining options as well as Cirque du Soleil O. 

Check-in was a breeze. I received an email offering pre-registration. When I arrived my room was available. All I had to do was show the my check in code and drivers license and machine spit out a room key. They did have staff there to verify my identity which made me feel more secure. It's certainly beats standing in line to register.

At first glance my room looked good. The housekeeping staff know their job and do it well. The test came when it was time to go to bed. The pillows were like rocks. If the holiday inn can have both firm and soft pillows on the bed, why can't a hotel charges two times if not more for a room tonight. The mattress on the bed needed to be replaced. It was lumpy and had a dent in the middle.

I had to wonder about the plumbing when I was awakened in the middle of the night from a deep sleep by gurgling sounds. I was unable to rectify them on my own and ended up having to close the bathroom door and wear earplugs. I suspect that someone in our room above me was draining a bath and the pipes were all interconnected. When I complained they said they would send a plumber and gave me a $50 credit to use during my stay. 

I mentioned housekeeping kept the room and bathroom clean. The one comment that I make is that whatever they use to clean down the toilet and other facilities contain something I was allergic to. I ended up with a rash as a result.

This year we booked the Salon Suite w\/fountain view. Room was good sized, plenty of space and we had vies of the Fountains on one side and Caesars on the other. Because we had 2 walls of large windows the noise level was higher than is typical of our past visits, but not outrageous.  While the size and views were good, I am not sure if these suites had been updated along with all the Deluxe rooms? Either way, they are in serious need of change. The furniture is worn and dated, bed was on its last legs (though not uncomfortable), and the lighting in the entire room was seriously lacking. 

We also noticed the hallways looking a bit worn, and food carts were left for very long stretches just sitting there. We even called for ours to be removed and it still sat there all day into the evening before someone took it back. Details :)

The Petrossian is our favorite place to sit, listen to the piano, have a drink, and unwind. Still love it, the familiarity makes it a comfortable place to land, however, they too need some serious touch ups. I think the furniture and chairs are originals and the wear is showing greatly. New cushions on the chairs or just new chairs would go a very long way in solving the issue of dated décor. Also in need of a menu update w\/more by the glass wine options. Still, we can't resist either way. 

Love Jean Philippe, but again in need of a change here as well.  Always the same ole menu items and pastry\/desserts in the case. The flow is just not that good, and could use some upgrades to the coffee\/espresso. For the prices, you should be able to get a good latte or cappuccino at all the coffee bars in the Bellagio (or anywhere on the strip for that matter), but sadly this is not the case. We usually driver way out past the airport on Sunset to Sunrise Coffee for our morning coffee. Best we have been able to find in Vegas.

There are 2 Valet locations, one North and one South.  DO NOT check in at the North location (behind the fountains) or you will have to cart your luggage all the way through the casino, it's a haul. speaking of check-in, wow, these ladies need a lesson in customer service. Horrible attitudes and unbelievably slow.

BRING A SMALL COFFEE MAKER and some starbucks in your bag; there are NO coffe makers in the room and room service will set you back about 6 bucks per cup, voila!  

Each time you enter the elevator you must show a room key, feels like your in Costco.  God forbid any terrorists would storm the Bellagios rooms. Ask for 2 room keys per person, if you forget your card, Vinnie the Nose will drag you to the front desk to prove your identity, classy.

Where is the Safe??? It's kind of fun hunting for it if you like treasure hunts when you check in, otherwise you will spend 1\/2 hour of your life that you will never get back.  Of course, it's in the nightstand drawer...brilliant!!

Forget the slots...tighter than an Italians pocketbook.

If you don't like smoky casinos stay away, especially at night it is possibly the worst on the strip, except for maybe Red Rock.  

To see the fountains, ask for a room on a least the 7th floor or above. 

Your drapes open with a button next to the nightstand, homage to The Hangover and Ceasar Velotche!

At the pool, put something on your towel if your going to go for a drink or a drip, or the towel trolls will snatch yours up.

If you don't want to pay 15 bucks for a watered down drink at the pool, sneak in a few airline size bottles of vodka or rum and just get a regular drink.  Also by the elevators is a nice gift shop with booze, mixer, etc.

IF you have decided to go to Le Cirque be very very careful what you order, the price goes up exponentially every time you open you mouth or shift in your seat. If you add the wine flight to your choice, it's $179!!! Salute!!

- It was called the Spa tower, but had no direct access to the spa\/fitness area - Dub Tee eff ? - so we ended up walking the common walkways dripping in sweat and enticing everyone with our pheromones.  Schmexy.

- Access to the spa tower elevators was a hell of a trek from the parking area through some of the busiest parts of the hotel - meh

- When we lived here we used to joke about LV being a few years behind the technology curve and sure enough, it came back to bite us.  The room only had a dock that was compatible with an iPod Nano - Double-Dub Tee eff.  So we had this huge suite and couldn't bump any jams to go along with our Gummi bear-fueled Orgy.  - wack.

Overall though, it was significantly more enjoyable than any other hotel stay we've had.  The option of having both a Jacuzzi in one bathroom, a steam shower in the other and a powder room for guests made it very convenient.  

If we ever get our arms twisted enough again to re-visit Sin City, we've resolved to always stay at a Bellagio suite (unless something better comes along)",3,7,3

From the lobby to the restaurants to the room itself, this is a luxurious hotel. The room was huge, with one of the largest bathrooms I've ever seen in a hotel room. Standing glass shower, two sink vanity, big soaking tub, it was impressive. There's also plenty of space in the rest of the room with a desk and a sitting area that don't crowd the bed. I do wish I'd snagged a view of the fountains, but it wasn't hard to run outside and see it.

Now, usually the question comes on would I stay here again, and I have to say that I probably wouldn't. The casino floor is built for high-spenders, and definitely above my pay grade. If I stayed here for a vacation, I'd for sure need to go off-site to gamble. 

However, I was here for work, and so I'd like to say how impressive their conference space is. It feels like a hotel all on its own, and the number of meeting spaces, and the size of audience they could support was amazing. Above and beyond that, the service at the hotel was top notch. We had catered pool-side parties both nights of the event and it was spectacularly done. I absolutely loved it, and highly recommend it for large-scale conferences and business events.

Sitting next to the pool in a cabana with a waiter bringing us overpriced drinks was also a nice amenity I am not use to.  So many areas within the pool area to go and take a dip, it was nice.

How did this royal treatment happen for free?  My buddy's boss apparently some sort of high-roller in Vegas and gets tons of stuff comped.

I had a sales conference and we occupied 70% of Caesars Palace, so The Bellagio was the destination for overflow reservations.  The Bellagio is a luxurious, very brilliant looking venue. The layout of the casino is easy enough to navigate from one place to another.  This was a major plus for me since I had to navigate my way to Caesar's every day.

My room was comfortable, and well decorated.  My only complain about my room would be the bathroom.  The glass door for the shower was hung crooked.  To the point that if I had the proper tools, I could've fixed the door myself.  With the door being crooked, it allowed pools of water to flow onto the floor.  I didn't notice the water on the floor until I was dressed and almost fell in it at 6:30am.  Instead of flipping out on the front desk, I simply used the additional towels to soak up the water whenever I had to shower.  I made it work.

Housekeeping was very kind and attentive. There were multiple people who would greet me, ask how I was doing, how my day was going, what brought me into town etc...I think that's a nice touch.  There's nothing wrong with making your guests actually feel like a guest.

This place also has one of the most well known attractions...The Fountains!  Quite the mesmerizing display I have to admit.  The water explodes into the air and dances to music. It's impressive in the day time, or even at night when they have it lit up with lights.  What's also great about this place is the location.  It's right in the middle of the strip.  Great for wanting to venture north or south on foot.  I enjoyed The Bellagio, and I look forward to coming back again.",5,4,5

My husband and I recently stayed here for his 35th birthday for one night.  Since it was a special occasion, we decided to splurge on the room (nearly $350 for a king, fountain view room - that's with the M Life discount).  We live in AZ and typically visit Vegas 4 times per year, so this was not our first time here.  

Our first room was 16070.  Upon walking in, the room reeked of mildew.  It smelled like the carpet had been flooded for weeks and then dried off and put back to use.  We called the front desk and they moved us very quickly to a different room just down the hall (16048).  This room did not smell....or so we thought.  After being out and about and returning to our room after midnight, we just wanted a good night's rest.  We climbed into bed and realized that the sheets and bedding all reeked of mildew as well!!!  DISGUSTING!!!  Seeing as it was so late and we were exhausted, we did not want to call housekeeping and wait for them to strip our seats or have to pack up and move rooms once again.  So, we both slept uncomfortably fully clothed.  Isn't the purpose of a hotel to provide a comfortable night's stay?

Also, if you choose to stay in a fountain room, they do not tell you that you will hear the music from Drai's day and night club across the street at the Cromwell all day and all night long (until 4am).  It would have been nice for someone just to inform us of this and give us a chance upon check-in to switch rooms.  

I called guest relations to complain about my stay.  What did they offer me?  An upgrade to a junior suite for 2 nights if I came back and paid to stay in a standard room.  This is just ridiculous.  I would never return to the Bellagio for $350 per night ever again.  I was never offered any type of discount or compensation for my horrible experience.  This hotel is supposed to be a 5 star hotel.  Clearly, neither it's standards nor customer service are 5 stars.

I could go on and on about what I like about the hotel, but it's pretty much what you would expect. The only couple of things I didn't like about the hotel were small things.

First, I wasn't too impressed that a 5 star hotel didn't have a fridge (that wasn't already filled with expensive stuff they want you to buy from them) or microwave inside the room. I know they want you to spend $16 on the Fiji water in the room and another $10 for the gummybears (no joke either), but you would think if you're paying as much as you are for staying there, that they'd hook you up with a mini fridge and microwave.

Second thing I didn't find so great about the Bellagio were the pools. They are all exactly the same and nothing too great about them. I stayed at the MGM before and it had a ""floating river"" and all different types of areas to be in. At the Bellagio, all the pools are a bit boring with nothing fun about them. Again though, not a huge deal and definitely didn't stop me from going out to the pools every day.

If I went back to Vegas, I wouldn't mind staying at the Bellagio again but I definitely want to try some where else. So, it's not some where that I really want to stay with again. I prefer the MGM, but that's based off price and location. As far as the inside of the room goes, I'd definitely choose the Bellagio over the MGM.",0,0,0

We had a nice stay at the Bellagio for a milestone family birthday that was sadly tainted by a pair of binoculars being stolen out of our room by housekeeping (it happened in the 20 minutes between us leaving the room to check out and realizing one of our party had set them on the desk while packing).

Over the subsequent weeks I was bounced from the lost & found department, to the ""risk management"" department, to ""guest experience,"" to the concierge, to management, and was given a series of lines about how a ""case event"" had been opened up and an ""inspector"" would follow up (no one did) to how David in guest experience would look into it and call me back (he didn't). 

It was our 3rd visit to the hotel and while these kinds of things are sadly inevitable, it was the poor treatment by the management that ultimately soured us on the Bellagio in the end.

I stayed at the Bellagio 8-10 May 2015 with 2 friends, one of whom is a 32 year old woman who is both physically (more than 50% deaf) and learning disabled (low IQ).

On Saturday 9 May 2015, we went to the Bellagio ""Pool Cafe"" for lunch at approximately 1 pm.

I asked the Bellagio ""Pool Cafe"" hostess if we could sit inside the covered restaurant. I informed her that my friend was both physically disabled (more than 50% deaf) and learning disabled (low IQ) and was wondering if we could sit in the shade because she was wearing a black dress and was hot (it was about 85 degrees that day). She said she didn't know, turned her back to us, and walked away.

15 minutes later,  we still had not been seated. Other Bellagio ""Pool Cafe"" employees continued to ignore my friend and I.

A different employee then told us that we could not stand there because they were seating Bellagio guests. I informed this employee that we were guests.

We continued to stand for 15 more minutes (30 minutes total). My friend started to experience heat exhaustion. I was a lifeguard for 8 years at both public and private pools and I am trained in first aid so I recognized these symptoms. I helped her layon a pool lounge chair and asked a Bellagio ""Pool Cafe"" employee for water. The employee said that drinks were for Bellagio guests only, turned her back on us, and walked away.

The hostess came over and said that we could ""sit in the back"" of the cafe. I was starting to realize that members of the staff were intentionally discriminating against a physically and learning disabled guest, which are federal crimes under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990.

A waitress immediately came to us and took our order. My friend ordered and iced tea with popcorn shrimp, and I ordered a rum and ginger ale with lollipop wings.

Another 15 minutes passed (45 minutes total) and a man came over to us and said he was the Bellagio Pool Manager. He asked to see my ID, my room card, my Pearl M-Life card, her ID, her room card, and her Sapphire M-Life card. He had a 2 way transmitter radio with him and was communicating with someone he kept referring to as ""Control"". He informed us that the room was not in our names, and we needed to leave the Bellagio immediately.

At this time I could tell that both the Bellagio employees and Pool Manager were discriminating against my friend. 

I informed the Pool Manager that we were guests at the Bellagio, gave him our room number, and were waiting on our lunch order. He left our table and continued to talk on his 2 way transmitter radio to ""Control"".

After another 15 minutes (60 minutes total) our food and drinks arrived. As soon as we both started eating, the Pool Manager returned with 2 security guards, one male and one female. He told us both that we ""were not welcome here"", ""needed to leave immediately"", and ""these 2 security guards"" will escort you back to your room. He then used his 2 way transmitter radio to inform the person he called ""Control"" that we were under ""Custody"" and being escorted back to our room. 

I was also worried that we did not yet pay for our lunches. I informed the Pool Manager that we did not yet pay for our lunches, and asked for a bill and boxes for our food. He didn't say anything, turned his back to us, and walked away. 

The waitress said she would get our bill and boxes. I explained to my friend that we needed to put our lunches in these boxes and eat our food in our room, because the people who work here didn't want us here. She started crying. This was her first vacation since she started working at a new job several months ago that she was very proud of, and she wanted to use some of her money that she brought to pay for her food and drinks. I told her it would be ok, I will pay for our lunches, we could eat our lunches in our room which overlooked the Bellagio pool, and we could go somewhere else to eat dinner later where the people who worked were nicer to us. She smiled and understood that.

After I put our lunches in the boxes, paid our bill, and tipped our waitress, the two security guards walked us to our room. When we got to our room, the male security guard apologized and told us to enjoy our stay. I think he felt bad for the way we were treated. We ate our lunches in our room overlooking the Bellagio pool, and went somewhere else, not owned by MGM or Bellagio, for dinner.

I am also considering contacting the MGM and Bellagio management and owners for an apology to us.",6,0,0

The lobby was packed and a bit hard to get through any time we were there.  The indoor garden was beautiful with tulips and poppies being the focus of the April floral display this visit.  The fragrance from the flowers was amazing!  Lovely hotel though the rooms were a bit smaller than other hotels in this price range.  Our view was a bit of a bummer- seems every one else in our party got a view of the fountains...we got the mountains- which did give us lovely sunset views...but to be honest that side of the hotel over looked the parking garage, service areas and freeway.  Rooms for a convention are always a craps shoot.  On the plus side we were in the tower so we walked past the chocolate fountain display many times each day...though very cool to look at, I didn't even want chocolate after a few walk bys.  We were here for 4 days for a convention so we used the hotel, meeting rooms, banquet facilities, casino etc.

The banquet facillity was wonderful- 800 people served hot, tasty food...that is always a plus.  Some hotels do banquest well- this is one of them.  Great lighting, decor and acoustics...on a scale of 1-10- this hotel get's a strong 8.75!!!

Shops- lots of great shops- though most were strictly for window shopping for me.  Love the galleries, jewelery and high end clothing.

Meeting rooms, convetion rooms, pool-side welcome party, drinks & meals associated with these events- great....a full 10 points

Live band in the Fontana Club- our cocktail waitress was great..the band music started out a little ""old"" we mentioned it to the cocktail waitress and the next thing we knew the had stepped it up a notch....great music & the dance floor was hopping all of this and their breaks timed with the fountains so we got to enjoy it all!!!  On a scale of 1-10...the Fontana gets a 8

Sensei bar- great drinks, great bartender, great service- we had drinks here a bit too much- I think we sampled everything on the ""specialy"" menu- including their homemade ginger ale- yum yum-they get a 9 out of 10 points

Casino- very pretty, staff was very nice, not too smokey- slots didn't give up much money...but truth be told I wasn't really planning on funding my retirement with my winnings...good thingtoo, after all they don't call this place Lost Wages for nothing.  Casino gets 7 out of 10 points.

Room service- pricey...very pricey...no shock there...we had breakfast & lunch with room service- the food was tasty, hot & looked wonderful, best of all delivered ahead of the promised time.  Lunch- I ordered up a grilled chicken & basil sandwich with seasoned fries...my hubby showed up- the sandwich was big enough for us to share.

It is absolutely the best hotel for non-guests on the Strip. I highly recommend you visit it, perhaps even more than once! The conservatory and gardens, fountain show, and art gallery are all just stellar.

The fine art gallery has a lot of fantastic contemporary and post-modern pieces for a small, unusual location. Their audio-tour is very informative and the Figuratively Speaking exhibition is wonderfully varied. It even has discounted admission for seniors, students, teachers, and military.

The conservatory and botanical gardens change their theme every few months. They feature all kinds of plant species but also topiary, sculpture, and cool hanging decor by season or holiday.

Basically, don't just stop outside for the fountains. Go in, especially during the day, and bring your whole family. The Bellagio is an a great place to not-stay.",1,1,1

Our first time there was by choice of my mother in law. I give her the credit for having good taste in all she enjoyed in life and Bellagio only made this statement truth. We have stayed all 16 years there and sometimes more than once a year. As a preference to the time of year, Christmas or close to it gave us the opportunity to enjoy the fantastic atmosphere Bellagio created. From the colorful displays to the phenomenal atrium presentation. Our complements to the creative minds. It is without doubt the amount of courtesy we have been given from room service all the way up to management. Our check ins have had their share of quirks but given the time of year, Christmas, the desk help deserve medals of honor for their patience and courtesy. Waiting in line you have the opportunity to witness the impatient in full action, and only hope you do not appear to be the same. But we have found that patience and respect have only made our check ins go smooth and easy. For example,one year we arrived early, our room was not ready. We were told to return in a few hours. No problem, lunch at the buffet would kill a few hours,lol. Only because the buffet is the best. We knoshed as we have done many times on the most scrumptious dishes ever. And so many we had to remind ourselves to save room for the killer deserts, mmm. Upon returning to the front desk we were told our room still wasn't ready. No problem, we'll just hang out and hit the floor for some machine action. Bellagio always has the latest in New slots and we weren't disappointed. We were having so much fun, the time flew by, plus we were winning. Back to the desk, but being so late that shift change had us worried now. We let the new desk clerk know what our day had been and she got busy. She made a few calls and informed us that due to our long wait,Bellagio wanted to upgrade. Hey, upgrade. Sure. And wow we were not disappointed. even though we had already booked our usual fountain view room, they did us righteous and moved us up to a floor with a fantastic room. We were way up in a beautiful suite with floor to ceiling mirrors, a bathroom with exquisite settings including a television. The room was fantastic and the view to the fountains was breath taking. Bellagio did us better than great. Sadly to say that this was the last year mom would be with us, she got to be part of this fantastic experience. And I can only say of the professionalism and courtesy displayed by Bellagio staff, that this was our best year yet. I would also like to speak of all the fantastic experiences in cuisine we have enjoyed at Bellagio. Our many Christmas dinners at Le Cirque, and Picasso were breathless. The service was without question attentive and extravagant. We always have the same servers who with little reminders, remember us, hint the server with the duchshounds at Le Cirque. Your a gem. Mom loved you. But, without leaving any of the great dining spots in limbo, all have not failed to be exactly what you'd expect at such a Diamond as Bellagio. And note our many times there have allowed us to dine many times over at the same places. For those who have had the opportunity to stay here and enjoy the ambience,  a memory to never forget. And for those who have stayed and found there experience less than expected, come again, but with a more open mind and a little patience. It will work out to be your best stay ever if not the greatest. We look forward to returning soon and dining at Harvest with Chef Roy Ellamar, you did Sensi awesome chef,mahalo. And Chef Seranos Lago, wow. It's like opening presents and knowing they will be great. So, I believe that we make our experiences either good or great, and with the right start say the Bellagio, you already did good by your choice. Can't wait to sink into those fantastic pillows too. Enjoy life, it's to short. Thanks mom for making Bellagio the experience, we will try to continue in your steps of enjoying life at the moment. And will toast one for you as we look down at the fountains. Live,love,eat!",0,0,0

Our first time in Vegas, and our first time staying at a five diamond resort. We usually frequent Holiday Inns and the like, so this review is from the perspective of your average vacationer. The fountains were beautiful, the property was clean and safe, and the rooms were tastefully decorated- oh and the beds were fantastic and super comfortable. But for the prices they charge I would have expected more. What I was mostly frustrated by was the nickle and diming. Of course there is a charge for parking and a $35 a night resort fee. Resort fees are such garbage- just make the rooms more expensive instead of charging hidden fees at checkout. What really bugged me was the mini bar. Prices were absurd and there is a $50 fee for touching the items in the mini bar. It sucked- we were staying at the freaking Bellagio and drinking warm water because we couldn't refrigerate it without paying! Drinking warm water at a five diamond resort. Surprised Bellagio doesn't throw in a few bottles of free water for guests, especially when it's 110 plus in summer. We ate breakfast at the patisserie because my friend wanted to and it was insanely overpriced. $20 for two bad coffees and a bagel and a muffin. The other thing that bugged me was check in. It was like herding cattle as other reviewers had said. Took an hour to check in and we were not offered water or help with our bags or anything. I'm just saying for five diamond I expected more. I would not come here if I was paying full price. Of course it is beautiful and elegant but the nickle and diming has to stop. Service was very so so, most of the staff treated me like they knew I wasn't there with a lot of money. The staff in the patisserie were the worst, such surly attitudes. I would visit Bellagio to see the fountains and the conservatory and walk around and enjoy the elegance but I would not stay here.",0,0,0

Really beautiful architecture and decoration inside that just looks darn good (minus the hollister-esque lounge near the lobby).  The conservatory with all of the flowers was nice (and a bit weird, especially with the sculptures) and a refreshing splash of natural color after being out on the strip where the most colorful thing is a bigscreen tv advertising some show.  There are a ton of restaurants that tend to be more hit than miss.  The fancier you go, the better a hit it'll be.  The top tier restaurants are impressive with Michelin stars and diamonds and master sommeliers (and the entire casino's wine list was something like 5,000 different wines and 50,000 individual bottles or something absurd).  

The little bars and lounges scattered throughout the casino floor are generally nice.  I got one stiff bartender who looked like he wanted to spit in my mojito, but then again that was at about 2 AM and maybe he had a long night?  Being pointed to and asked ""drink?"" isn't what I picture when I think of the Bellagio, yet here we are.  Actually, I had a second waitress at a lounge with a similar attitude....hm.... Oh well, the lounges and bars at least looked nice.  I liked the jazz music coming from one of the lounges, and a grand piano player from another one.

Three downsides in my opinion.  First is the price of things.  I understand that the Bellagio is a bit fancier than most of the other casinos, and I understand that it's Vegas, but I just can't stifle the rising feel of getting screwed when I'm paying $20 - $30 for a drink while surrounded by trashy girls in too tight and too short dresses, slurring and screeching and stumbling across the floor with heels in hand, followed by some over-sized oompa loompas wearing Tapout hipster shirts and talking about who has the bigger gold chain or which girls they're going to piledrive when they get to the room.  

Second is the atmosphere.  I'm probably being too elitist, but it seems like the Bellagio's image is shying away from being something classy and headed towards the place to be if you're a douchebag pretending to have class.  Yea, I saw a lot of fancy people there, but after about 5 PM the entire place looks like the outside of a club for the remainder of the night.  Maybe the older people go to some fancy members only club at night, who knows.  

Third was the layout, it was confusing.  Tried to find some restaurant by going down what I thought was a hallway I had visited the night before only to find that it just looked similar, and this one actually led to the convention center, and I was lost.

Oh, and the rooms!  Okay, we had a bit of an upgrade with a suite in the slightly-more-exclusive spa tower.  Amazing, ridiculous room.  If all hotels put this much effort into their lower-tier suits, they would get a lot more upgrades.  The room had automatic drapes, 3 bathrooms, 4 TVs, a super comfy bed, a shower with steamer AND a big tub.  There was a view of the fountain so we could see the show every time it went on, which was pretty fantastic.  It wasn't very modern but it wasn't trying to be.  Also, I found some of the wall paper stuff was coming off in the corner that is *mostly* hidden by a chair.  Really?  It was the size of two of my palms.  Fix yo walls. 

Service was excellent.  The staff were hit or miss.  The spa tower greeters were the best people I came in contact with; they were always super helpful and super nice.  The restaurant waitresses were average, most seemed like they would rather be somewhere else, even if they were able to put on a nice smile.  A large portion of the casino floor bartenders and lounge waitresses, as I'm coming to realize from writing this review, sucked.  They tended to scowl instead of smile, complete with attitude.  Room service is pretty damn slow at night, taking at least an hour at 2-3 AM, which wasn't the best realization.  You'd figure that a higher tier casino would have enough staff in Vegas of all places to keep the orders going, but I guess not.  

Overall, my first impressions were better than my final assessment but the casino IS pretty great.  Next time I visit, I'll probably try to make more use of the day and use the night for more sleeping, since it sounds like the better experience is when everyone is chipper and all of the morons are sleeping.  There are lots of casinos that I still want to try, but the Bellagio is on my list of ones to come back to.",1,1,0

My husband and I stayed at the Bellagio for one week. We had a nice time up until the end of our stay. The hotel is beautiful, and the common areas impressive. I had a massage at the spa, which I would rate as a very good experience. 

However, at the end of our stay (Friday night) my husband got severe food poisoining after eating at Jasmine, one of the hotel's restaurants. He was so ill that I considered taking him to the ER at one point. There is no question that his illness originated from the Bellagio, because we'd eaten all three meals at the hotel that day. 

When I called the front desk to complain and demand that my dinner bill ($250!) be comped, I was given the run around. Finally I was transferred to the manager at Jasmine, who barely spoke English, not once apologized or articulated any compassion for my husband's illness. He brushed me off and said that I had to file a report with the security department. 

I again called the front desk and was told that they had no authority to comp my meal or make any adjustments to my bill at all. When I asked who could do that, I was told that I had to speak with one of two departments, customer relations or risk management. And wouldn't you know - both are ""closed"" during the weekend. 

When I asked if they could at least provide my husband with Pedialyte, I was told that there is a $40 courier fee for someone to go to the local drugstore in addition to the cost of the Pedialyte. When I refused, I was told to go buy a sports drink at one of the 24 hour stores in the hotel. This was the last straw for me!

The next day, when my husband was at least stable, I went down to the front desk to talk to the staff in person. After talking to the front desk manager for about 5 minutes, she finally told me why no one would help me. In situations wherein there appears to be even a hint of legal risk to the hotel, staff are instructed to basically do NOTHING other than tell the guest to file a written complaint. 

I did end up filing a formal complaint, and spoke with Bellagio's risk management department. As of right now, an ""investigation"" is under way which will take 30 days to complete - ridiculous. I've been told that I will no receive refund for our contaminated meal or the last night at the hotel.

At the end of the day, the Bellagio's strategy of being risk averse will eventually come back to haunt them. Had my husband been alone when he became ill, he most definitely would have required emergency medical help since the hotel refused even the most basic of assistance.

I will NEVER stay at the Bellagio again and I strongly encourage you to think twice before booking your hotel in Vegas!!!",3,1,0

We stayed in the Salone Suite for our honeymoon.  This was a great corner room with ""strip view"". Yeah well when you're only 5 floors up the view is mostly parking lot and the tip of the Eiffel Tower...not impressed.  Though the bathroom was humongous and the bed...oh that bed...SO comfortable I didn't want to leave it.  Amazing.  The TV was lackluster though.  And though unnecessary, the TV in the bathroom's remote was not working.  The blinds in the bathroom wouldn't go down and a plug and some lights were not working in the bathroom as well.  

But housekeeping likes to clean twice a day and I'm sorry - I don't use that many towels.  But they were a bit bothersome.  On voice mails.  Notes left on the door.  And even in person.  And then one of the 2 times we let her in - the woman took our souvenir glasses.  Plastic and cheap, sure...but they were OUR plastic, cheap souvenirs!  

The hotel itself has nice bartenders and great service.  The pools are wonderful as well.  But the lack of more affordable eating options was irritating.  I think we spent most of our money in the tiny grocery shop by the elevator bank.

Oh and be warned when giving them your credit card coming in...they put an over $500 hold on your account!  Just in case you're thinking of handing them your bank card that you plan to use on the trip.

*******************************************************************************************
From the Dale Chihuly glass above the mirrored pegasus in the lobby to the spectacular Lunar New Year exhibit to the Fountains full of dancing water, this place is all about elegance, lavish living, first class fancy.

We took a stroll through the Lunar New Year exhibit prior to having a bellini in Fontana Bar (get it? Bellini in Bellagio). Fuse band was playing there. Initially, Mara G. wasn't feeling their tunes. But she eventually warmed up; especially after they covered Earth, Wind, & Fire. When our cocktails arrived, we took them out onto the deck with us to snap pictures with the water show behind us. Nice!

Then, we made our way to Sensi! (see yelp) After that, we tried our luck at Tabasco and the Sex in the City Progressive slots. Nice! What a super fun birthday! Definitely swanky perdanky! Although the casino is absolutely smokey perdokey. Ha ha! I will still and always return. I still have one of the one handed gloves from the days when you had to collect coins to take them to the cashier. I'm a fan!",1,0,0

Check in was a breeze and although we had originally booked for a plain old mountain view room they upgraded us to balcony view room FREE which was so surprisingly nice! The resort is HUGE but there is something to look at, do and buy around every corner. Security is tight as they do ask to see your room key before allowing you anywhere near the elevator, but that is a good thing. The room was sleek, chic and super modern with a comfortable bed. found the pool at the Bellagio to be beautiful and relaxing, with a lot of people to mingle with and plenty of waitress's in purple bikinis offering up $23 cocktails. The drinks were good, but not strong enough for $22.The only thing that's pretty alarming is there is a timer sensor on the refreshments in the room. They let us know upon check out but my hubby must've been distracted during the check in process as I caught him shuffling through the fridge. I almost had a heart attack staring at  the $10 bottles of Fiji  and the $50 bottle of champagne removed from the sensor. We scrambled to put it back within the 20 second grace period, but made a quick desperate call to the front desk to be sure. We were in the clear. Other than that such a great visit with outstanding views of Vegas and the fountain show. I recommend this show to any Vegas first timers, you will have a blast.",0,1,0

We purchased the drinks package, but I wouldn't do it again. The waitress would not bring us another drink until she saw our glass was empty. Which is fine, but she was only around ever so often so our drink would sit empty for a while. (longer than at a normal restaurant)

My room was pretty small and the decor lacked any style or sophistication. The bathroom was about the only nice thing about it. The TV we had in our room was an old 37 inch Phillips tube T.V. i mean really now?! I know this place is suppose to be older than a lot of the other five star hotels, but I felt that my room at the mirage was equal in comparison. Ironically, the room rates at the Bellagio is much higher than a lot of the NEW five star hotels and I don't understand why...maybe because of the location?

I was nervous when we got to the hotel, as valet had taken a long time and the lobby was packed to the rafters.  But, fortunately, they had tons of front desk agents working and I only waited behind 2 people- about 15 minutes.  The agent was friendly and quick in getting my keys.  We then hauled our bags through the entire crowded casino to the elevators (that's not cool).  The elevators are fast and there is security checking keys, which makes you feel a little safer.  

Our room was beautiful.  We were on the 17th floor, facing the fountains.  The view was breathtaking- as you walked in, Paris' Eiffel Tower took up the whole window, which then expanded into a view from the Flamingo all the way down to the Planet Hollywood, and the mountains behind it all.  Gorgeous and worth every penny.  

The bed was middling- a little stiff, but I've slept in much worse.  The linens and pillows were nice.  The room was exceptionally clean.  The bathroom was fabulous, I took at least 3 baths in the huge soaking tub.  

Room service was really good when we could get it.  Twice when we called down, they told us it was a 1.5-2 hour wait for food.  Once was at 11:30 at night, when almost everything else in the hotel was closed (everything but the cafe).  That was frustrating.  

My biggest complaint about the Bellagio is probably the valet.  They are SO slow getting your car to you.  Even when I called ahead, we waited at the valet area for 10-15 minutes.  There doesn't seem to be any hustle in these parkers.  

Overall, I might stay here again, but it's really packed and busy all the time.  I think I may opt for Paris across the street, so I can have a view of the fountains without the massive crowds.",3,0,0

It's nice to be able to lay in bed, turn the music on the tv and watch the fountains go off. I prefer the spa tower because it's away from the craziness and smoke. I feel like the Bellagio casino is one of the worst for smoke. The other luxury hotels aren't as bad in my opinion. The buffet there is just ok.

We arrived at the hotel, our luggage was whisked away and we were checked in within minutes. We had booked a Bellagio suite but when we excitedly told everyone we were getting married the next day, we were upgraded to a lakeview suite overlooking the fountains and scored line passes to the cafe and buffet! They even sent us chocolate truffles and all sorts of goodies every night in our room. The view from our suite was amazing and we watched the fountain show every night. Room service was delicious and the service was fast and impeccable. During the days we spent all our time in The Cypress Pool where we truly enjoyed the personalized service and the adults only policy, well worth the $100 cover charge for the two of us. We saw ""O"" which also exceeded all expectation. That show is not to be missed! The spa is also the nicest I have ever visited, we had a couples massage that left us both totally relaxed and a few days later we both had the floating bliss massage where you lay on a raft in the pool while you get hand and foot work. If you only do one spa treatment do that! We ate at Prime steakhouse, Circo, Cafe Bellagio, The Pool Cafe and The Buffet and not once did we have a bad meal. The gelato place was also amazing and I recommend the little shop across from it for a quick pastry or a sandwich. There is plenty of high end shopping on the casino level and we did not encounter any typical snooty or pushy salespeople.

We stayed in Bellagio for 2 nights over the Christmas holidays, and we had spent the previous 3 nights at Wynn, and hands down, the service is so much better at Wynn.  It all starts with the check in process...it is almost like a free for all, there are lines all over the place, but you have to pay attention or you will end up in a ""Check out"" instead of a ""Check in\/out"" line.  Three people in front of us, and it took 45 minutes to check in, since all three people had problems.  At Wynn, they had a guy who kept an eye on people in line, if they see that you've been waiting in line for too long, they will direct you to the invited guest check in counter, so that you don't end up standing in line until your feet are numb.  If you run into any employees in the hallway they just say an obligatory ""Hi"" you can tell that management make them so this.  The sound proofing was horrible, you can hear the door close from down the hall!  Terrible!

We didn't pay that much for our stay at Bellagio (about $150\/nt), but i still think i got ripped off.  Never again!  I will either pay more to stay at Wynn or save some money and stay at TI.  They've also skimped on the Christmas decorations this year.

This place is old, it's outdated, it's uncomfortable, it does not deserve its five stars! Do yourself a favor and don't stay at the renowned Bellagio - there are many other options on the strip, that are priced less and have much better rooms and amenities. 

Thought you could revitalize in a jacuzzi or a hot sauna during your stay at the Bellagio? Well, you will need to pay extra $40 per day to access the facility. In comparison, last time I stayed at Grand Hilton Vacations and I had a jacuzzi in my room and at a lower cost, with a much modern and comfortable stay.

The room didn't have a teapot or a coffee maker - I asked the front desk if I could get one and they wanted to charge me $30 for a coffee maker. Wow, even a three star motel has the common decency to include this accommodation without charge. I asked if I could get a cup of hot water and was told that they would charge me $4 and bring it up in about half an hour.

If you don't want to pay the $30 for the coffee maker, you would assume there would at least be a coffee house near by where you could get your morning cup? Well, Bellagio is not known for its coffee shops - the nearest I found was the Starbucks about a ten minute walk from the hotel or the coffee shops inside the Cosmopolitan.

They will charge you extra $30+ per day for a resort fee and an extra $3+ for tax on that same resort fee. This is a hidden fee, it's not included in your initial booking as it may only be charged upon check-in. Oh, did I mention that the $30 extra they charge you doesn't include a coffee maker or the SPA? This is just so disappointing. 

Please make sure to look at your portfolio before checking-out, they also charged us for minibar items that we didn't use. Seems like their electronic minibar checkout system is faulty and why would they fix it if it's adding an extra few dollars to the bill. I called the front desk and they apologized and canceled the charges. 

Imagine you come back to your room after a long night, try to get in and your door card reader just doesn't do anything, the door has locked you out! Well that could happen if you stay in Bellagio. In my case, I had to swipe the card in an out for about 20 minutes before it finally opened. I suppose the locks are just old and are breaking down while you're using it, not the best experience.

The shower and the bathroom were just outdated and you could tell things were falling apart. The shower door would push the towel matt on the ground, so you would need to choose between stepping out on a towel or closing your shower door. The toilet flushed like a rocket launcher... 3, 2, 1, flush!

The room also, unfortunately, lacked a refrigerator. We had a few snacks with us that we bought on the road and couldn't refrigerate it in the room. Not that I mind having a fully stocked minibar, but I would also like to have just a small area for food purchased outside and not marked up 300%.

Before you could take the elevator up to your room, you will need to present your room key to the guard. I found this process a bit tedious and intrusive. A much better experience, I believe, is swiping your card inside the elevator instead of having a security guard chase you down the hallway to ask for your room key. I know this is a minor detail, but all of these minor experiences add up into an uncomfortable and unpleasant stay, which is especially saddening since I was on my vacation. 

I hope you think twice before staying at the Bellagio. Seriously, if you've read so far and are still considering to stay at the Bellagio, message me and I will convince you otherwise. There are just so many better options on the strip that it would be a pity to waste your money here.",2,0,0

My graduation presents (after nursing school) was a trip to Vegas. I always loved the Bellagio (mostly due to the fountains... and of course Oceans 11)... so Daddy surprised me and booked the BF and I at the Bellagio for our 5 day stay! SCORE!!!

From beginning to end, service was exceptional. Check in was easy. Once we were settled someone called the room to check on us. We ordered a mini roll away fridge which was brought up quickly. Our safe was stuck so someone came up promptly to fix it. Anything and everything we needed was done efficiently. Everyone was so courteous and nice! The hotel itself is breathtaking. The fountains are beautiful. Jean Phillipe Patisserie: largest chocolate fountain and YUMMY gelato! The gallery inside is gorgeous as is the conservatory. We saw ""O"" which was beyond words. It was magnificent! There are TONS of different gaming options across the floor (albeit a bit pricier than other hotels). The Bellagio buffet is THE BEST BUFFET in Vegas! Quality food!!! Cafe Bellagio is open 24 hours and has THE BEST crab bakes benedict! The pools are beautiful. The rooms are beautiful. The pillows are soft, the blankets are SUPER COMFY! The bath robes are SUPER COMFY! The hot tub is HUGE and DEEP... you could fit 4 people in it! The bathrooms are all marble... I mean the list goes on and on. Oohhhh must say when you walk into the check in\/check out area the glass ceiling is just GORGEOUS!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE everything about this hotel!!!

When I went back with friends... I stayed at 3 hotels in my 6 day trip. Paris first (never again), Venetian next (NEVER EVER again), and the Palazzo (nice, but I prefer the Bellagio).

Having stayed at The Venetian, Cosmopolitan, Vdara, The Palms and Aria, I was quite happy with my experience at the Bellagio. 
Check-in was a breeze. I was meeting up with friends at the Aria next door and inquired about a room close to the Tram. This is a really wonderful way to get to City Center. My room in the spa tower was perfect for not only this, but also for my visit to the spa the following day. Contemporary furnishings, light and shade panel on the wall (brilliant!) and a very comfortable bed made my stay top notch. Unlike the rest of Vegas, you'll never experience the smokers smell walking anywhere on the property. While the lobby and public areas are whimsical and over the top, the rooms stay classy and understated. It's easy to avoid douchebaggery here. It would have been great to spend more time in my room, but It's Vegas- if you're spending too much time in your room consider reducing the gourmand and increasing the gourmet.

Upon arrival the check out : check in signs were in a confusing spot and after standing in the check out line the concierge came over and said we needed to be in the checkout line and even admitted it was confusing.  
We requested to use a different credit card for ""incidentals"" since we prepaid and we were told no unless we wanted our deposit credited and recharged.  Our room wasn't ready and we were told we would be called so we went to brunch upon return we were informed that if we paid $30 extra we could get our room early ..so why didn't the other guy tell us ??

As you drive up onto the resort for the first time, you too will feel like you're affectedly elegant.  

I love this property!  No other resort is as grand or majestic as Bellagio.  This was Steve Wynn's Pièce de résistance of all his creations.  I can go on and on about the best free attractions in Vegas (Conservatory & Fountains), ""The Office"" (high stakes poker game in the Bellagio poker room), or even the high-end boutiques and award winning restaurants.  But no, I'll just be repeating what everyone else on yelp have mentioned.  As for the rooms, there was this one occasion that still stands out in my mind.

The rooms are nicely decorated, a Tuscan style feel.  STANDARD ROOM: little over 500 sq ft., marble flooring, electronic controlled drapes, glass enclosed shower and separate bath tub, and luxurious linens with the most comfortable bed to lie on.  The rooms can be a bit dim and needs a face lift.  Don't get me wrong, I like it... but after staying here on a number of occasions... it's due for an update.  It's been the same since '98, furniture is looking worn and the TVs are not even flat panel (it's the old tube televisions).  

Now what gets me was when I crawled into bed one night (or early morning) and the plumbing started gurgling.  No matter, I had a hard night of drinking and was beat.  Normally I could sleep through an earthquake... but this became annoying.  It was gurgling all night.  Luckily, I noticed it on my last night.  I informed my host when we checked out and he did apologize.  My rooms were already comped so he took it a bit further to comp my other resort incidentals.  What I did find out was that this is an ongoing problem.  A friend had told me the same thing occurred to her on her stay; and that cabbie's and locals even told her about this common occurrence.  

I only noticed this once, so it probably won't deter me from coming back.  I love the central location and the casino to stop staying.   What will deter me is...  paying for the rooms.  For what Bellagio's charging, you can get a bigger and newer room at the Palazzo.  So don't stay if you gotta pay!",5,5,4

For the average person looking to blow all there money in Vegas the Bellagio may just have some of the regular suites available at about $200 a night. The hotel keeps with the more recent trend of super giant hotels and is absolutely one of the nicest hotels in Vegas. 

The restaurants downstairs are wonderful, (and about $50 per person average)  and offer just about anything you might want. the beds and rooms are very adequately sized even for a regular suite. I do believe all of them have a safe in the side of the entertainment center and a mini bar capable of costing you more than you might expect, (even once you know how much your room is). Eventually after about three days the impressive facade begins to be more noticeably just that and then you begin to think if there might have been somewhere else you could have spent all that money. The bottom line is, you go to the Bellagio to say that you stayed there and you tell everyone how grate it was there, but in the end it's really just a nicer hotel that costs a little more. There is a lot of hype and this place will live up to most of it. It's up to you whether or not you want to see how the experience stacks up to your expectations. For me, it was nice... but it still seems a little too costly.

When we checked in my husband noticed that the bathtub had hair all over it (gross!). He called housekeeping and asked them to clean it. I did my usual hotel sheets inspection and found that they were stained. My pillowcase also looked like it had a big old red punch stain. We called front desk and they sent someone to change the sheets. We left and came back later only to find the sheets were even dirtier than the previous ones! It was the flat sheet that mostly and I slept without a blanket the first night because I refused to touch the dirty sheets. We called front desk again and this time they told us to wait for the housekeeping supervisor. We were on our way out but decided to wait. After 20 minutes, we called front desk again and asked if we were indeed supposed to wait. The rude front desk person told us yes and we shouldn't expect her to come immediately but told us she'll page her anyways. WTF? The housekeeping supervisor came and was very nice and apologetic. She told us she was going to have the person working on our room to check the sheets before giving them to us. We came back later that night and guess what? The sheets were changed but still dirty! Once again, I didn't use the blanket. In fact, I didn't use a blanket for my entire 3 night stay. All the stains were huge and gross but they looked old. Come on, buy new sheets if you can't get the stains out! Note that we didn't yell or demand anything from anybody but was very nice and said thank you to everyone. We didn't even complain about the bathtub, we just asked them to come up and clean it. Everyone was nice except for that one front desk person.  They did give us a $50 food credit so I give one star for that and one star for Bellagio's big bathroom and room. Thanks, Bellagio for a memorable 1st year anniversary.",0,0,0

It was super exclusive way back then - kids couldn't come in unless they were actually staying at the hotel, ID's were checked at the entrance, etc.  Bellagio used to be the best hotel on the Strip, hands down.  There was no competition at all.  However, now that the Strip is fully re-amped with such gorgeous, modern, and extravagant hotels, there is some stiff competition.  

Regardless, the Bellagio is still my favorite hotel.  It's gorgeous, elegant, and classy, especially the gardens which change every season.  (BTW, come before 8 AM and there will be little to no crowd; therefore, you can take some epic pics.)  The crowd here isn't as wild as the other hotels - I feel that the Bellagio is geared towards the more mature crowd.  The Bellagio is also home to the Jean Philippe Patisserie, which is one of my favorite bakeries ever, and a bunch of other restaurants.  The Buffet is also good and more affordable than others such as Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal.  In addition, the parking garage here is very easy and spacious.  There are plenty of places to shop as well.  Cirque du Soleil's O is also here, which has been my favorite show in Vegas.  And of course, the fountains are amazing, as always.

The Bellagio is my favorite hotel on the Strip, for sure, and is right in the middle of the Strip.  Definitely don't miss out here when you come to Vegas!",2,1,3

As we were walking through the lobby of the Bellagio, they were taking down their garden ornaments, and there was places that were cut off and two men who were security funneling and stopping traffic through roped off areas that people were walking in and out of.

As we were walking through the tall man said to us ""Do YOU PEOPLE not understand when a man tells you to stop that you have to stop?!"" -- to which I didn't ever remember the other guy telling us we had to stop, and if he did it was an honest mistake as I was at the front of our group and I wasn't particularly feeling too well as I was a bit anemic at the time. He continued to be rude to us as I walked past and I told him that he ""didn't have to be so rude"" and we continued onward. The use of the phrase ""you people"" particularly bothered me because my husband and his mother are Korean, and his younger sister is half Korean, while her father (my husband's step-dad) is a white male.

Just the way the guy said it to us, and REPEATED it over and over again as we kept walking, each time more loud and more rude didn't sit well with me. So I scuttled ahead to find a place where I could sit down, because I was so upset at just how rude that guy was. People make honest mistakes.. if we walked through and the other guy told us to stop which somehow all 5 of us seemed to have not heard, then we would have apologized, and that should have been the end of it. We were all so upset with how this guy treated us, that we decided to head back to the hotel lobby and just leave for the airport -- well to do so, we had to go back where that guy was.

As we were approaching people were allowed to walk through the pathway and we were going with the flow of traffic. He then stopped us again, even though people on the other side were being let through (like traffic on a two-way road) -- which made absolutely no sense. It was pretty clear that he was singling us out because of the indecent before hand. My husband's father told the guy that the situation was ridiculous, and continued to walk forward as people were still being allowed to walk through on the left side of us. Once he did that the ""security guard"" (as he called himself) physically put his hands on Jason's father and pushed him. My husband's father then told him that his actions were uncalled for and was physical assault to which the guard responded by pushing my husband's father further back with his chest and getting up in his face repeating that he was a security gaurd, and he had the right to put his hands on him and kept telling us to ""look at the badge"" meaning his name tag with his name Michael on it and where he was from - San Bernardino, CA. My husband's mother was appalled and told him to get his hands off of her husband, and the guy touched me telling me to get back even though I never even moved from my original position, nor did I try to even start a confrontation.

We had done nothing wrong. We were on a FAMILY vacation in Vegas. None of us have ever been involved in any crimes, nor were we being aggressive in any manor. It was uncalled for and made for a horrible ending to our vacation.

We then waited to file a complaint with the head of security, in which we got an apology -- but he said the manor would be looked into. And the more we had talked to him, the more it seemed apparent that they probably had other incidents happen with Michael. Unfortunately we weren't able to file a formal complaint on paper with the hotel as we had to leave to catch our flights back home.

Not only that, but in the beginning of our vacation, my husband and I went to check into our room with our confirmation email printed out (which had 2 confirm numbers for each room that his father had reserved) and the lady at the check out desk told us that we couldn't check in because it was only under my husband's father's name -- although we told her we had ANOTHER confirmation number, that also had my husband under another room's list and the woman was rude and said ""I don't care, that's only a piece of paper. It doesn't mean anything."" and when we went to another teller, they were more than nice to hear us out and we were able to get our room.

Other than those two incidents, we had nice clean rooms and had a good time otherwise. However since the security incident happened the way it did, never again will we be staying with the Bellagio....",5,2,0

I've never been to a casino where the dealers are so consistently rude and vocal about their displeasure with their jobs. ""Give me an 8...you got an 8 in there?"" Response: ""Probably not."" I actually walked up to a table in the mid afternoon with one person gambling and read the dealer's name tag that said 'Gary.' As I sat and pulled out my money, I said, ""Hi Gary, how are you?"" He literally looked at me and didn't reply. I left and went to Caesar's, Flamingo and Treasure Island and the dealer's were engaged, friendly and rooting for us.

I ponied up and paid the premium to enjoy a little luxury for a weekend at Bellagio, but unfortunately was a bit disappointed in the room and don't feel that I got what I paid for.

ROOMS :
The ""renovated\/remodeled"" rooms have been redecorated with walls horridly painted with tacky 70's retro lime-green and bright purple swirls\/flowers (?), definitely taking the anticipated luxurious feel down a few notches.  Everything was in decent shape and functioned properly, but the only thing that impressed me about the room was the push-button shades\/sheers (wall mounted, not remote).

LOCATION:
Bellagio's location on the strip is pretty good, but then again, so is Imperial Palace's.  That being said, I didn't leave the property for the extent of my stay; so I guess there's something to be said for the casino.

POOL:
The pool(s) area is pretty large, but nothing exceptional beyond that.  A few of the smaller pools have fountains (these are not heated), but most are just standard, rectangular, 3 or 4 foot deep areas to wade around in.

THE BANK:
The Bank (the nightclub at Bellagio) is nice, a decent size, and has tons of tables if you'd like to purchase bottle service.  As a hotel guest, you can get free entry before around 11:30pm.

MICHAEL MINA:
Michael Mina's restaurant offers fine dining at a 1 star Michelin rated level.  Quite delicious, but of course, also quite pricey.
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/michael-mina-las-vegas#hrid:fJ_xzAemOWoo5glLBcf0FQ

BUFFET:
The buffet is actually really good.  Lunch was $20; which isn't bad at all for what you get.  If you gamble enough, use your player's card at the register to get this partly\/fully comped.

We stayed Friday thru Monday in a room with 2 queens located on the 4th floor of the Spa Towers.  There was 5 of us all together so we had 1 roll in bed.  It felt a little small but was comfortable enough.  We made it work.  Here are the pros and cons of our stay:

Pros:
- rooms were clean.  the whole hotel is clean.  
- house keeping called everyday and asked what time we wanted our room clean (made it convenient)
- its pretty sweet to be part of their Mlife players club card
- located in an awesome area
- free wi-fi
- automatic drape\/curtain openers (switch located by bed, awesome for hangovers)
- quiet
- nice bathrooms

Cons:
- roll in beds are $35 a night (but we were comped) 
- lights in the room were very dim.  super annoying when we were trying to put on our makeup 
- the a\/c sucked balls.  can barely tell.  
- kinda small for 5 people
- ghetto boxed tv
- late check out was 12pm for us (thats not late)
- waiting for the front desk people over the phone took FOREVER constantly
- pool had no where to sit. 
- we are here to party and the crowd is a little too conservative for me.  duds at the pool.  crowd is kinda boring. 
- no reception downstairs in the casino.

Overall, we had a pleasant stay at the Bellagio.  There were little things that bothered us but they were not a big deal.  our rooms were comped for the 3 nights so there is not much to complain.  However, if the rooms are normally around $300 a night, I would say it is not worth it.  Even for $200, I dont know if it is worth it.  The biggest thing that bugged me was the shitty A\/C and how the pool had no where to seat.  Other than that, I would come here again if we are comped again or the rooms are discounted.",4,3,3

The room itself was okay, nothing special comparing to other hotels in Vegas such as Venetian etc. I would not have complained if I didn't end up coming home with bed bugs! I wish I knew those mosquito like bites are bedbug bites! When I was at Vegas, I was feeling itchy the next day and thought maybe I got bitten by the mosquito outside. 

After I returned to Phoenix, the bites didn't stop and I realized it might be something else. Went to the dermatologist thinking it might be allergy, and the Dr asked if I've traveled recently because the bites looked like bedbug bites! YUCK! I rushed home that day and ripped off all my bed sheets and started to look for signs of bedbugs. I remembered for at least 5 days I hardly slept at nights and was just googling bedbugs. Finally I had the pest control company coming over to show me the traces of bedbugs and they've also said that the infestation is only within my bedroom at this stage so the bedbugs would have been brought home around a week ago which was exactly when I stayed at the Bellagio! 

I spent $1400 on the begbugs heat treatment and countless number of laundering my clothes and drying them in heat for more than 30 minutes. If I would have known those bites I got at the Bellagio were bedbugs, I would have sued them for sure! 

I will NEVER EVER stay at the Bellagio and would tell all my friends to stay away given their poor pest control for the guest rooms.

Note, too, that I was ""upgraded"" at check-in (which really meant my view was changed).

When I called the hotel operations manager to give constructive feedback, his response was equal parts excuses and apologies, and offered to comp the resort fees and give me a hotel credit.

While the service and grounds were lovely, our room, the hallway leading up to it, and the air quality on the entire first floor sucked **big time.** 

Here are some of the specific issues dear hubby and I encountered: 
* Ratty towels in the bathroom 
* Leaky faucet
* Shower fixture falling off the wall 
* Several sets of used room-service drinking glasses left on the floor in the hallway for two days (however, after we called the front desk, they were promptly removed)
* Paper-thin walls -- in addition to banging doors at the crack of dawn, while getting ready at the vanity in the bathroom at night, I kept running out in my robe to answer **what I thought** was our room's phone ringing -- and it was actually the phone next door
* Cracks in the crown molding 
* Old tube TV
* Lame amenities -- no shower gel or bath soap? Really?
* Dark, poorly planned lighting -- since we didn't have Garanimals, we had to open the light-up armoire when getting dressed to ensure our clothes matched properly

I **really, really, really** wanted to love Bellagio. So I am hoping we just ended up with a crummy room, instead of experiencing what our cab driver referred to as ""property neglect"" due to Bellagio's involvement in the new City Center project.",4,5,2

This birthday celebration was not the experience I was looking for when booking a room at the Bellagio Hotel. Not just any room, The Penthouse Suite Fountain View room. We thought this would be the best choice OUT OF ALL the hotels in Vegas to celebrate my 50th Birthday. It is a milestone birthday, so we expected a great experience. Unfortunately, we received the opposite. 

Ok, here is the real deal for a $1713.56 two night stay at the hotel and two tickets to KA, purchased through the Chairman's Concierge.  

For securing the Penthouse Suite, we had the opportunity of using the ""Chairman's Lounge"" to check in\/out and have a concierge to help us with our needs. The Chairman's Lounge ( I guess) is supposed to give us more of a VIP ""FEEL"" because you don't have to deal with the front desk where everyone checks-in. Oh, they do offer a place to relax and free water, coffee and wine. These things I can buy myself and come out a hell of a lot cheaper.  First off, there is no signage to let you know where the lounge is. Second, the lounge is usually grossly understaffed, so you still have to wait in line for everything. Third, every time I tried to call the concierge, no one answered. Not until I was checking out, did I realize there was a second private area. When I asked the lady behind the counter if it was the Chairmans Lounge and could I check out here, her reply was, ""Did you check-in here?"" WTF! That was rude and made me feel like I did not belong there. I would not be asking if it were the Chairman's Lounge so I could check out if I didn't belong there. There are a lot of different ways she could have handled that. This woman didn't even ask me how my stay was. She just took my credit card, charged it and said, ""Have a nice a day.""

Now let's not forget that this was a milestone celebration for me. Once again, I am spending $1713.56 for ""TWO"" nights and a show, and they did nothing for me for my birthday. Keep in mind that I told them it was my birthday celebration when I booked it, checked in and throughout our my entire visit because the staff continuously asked me if we were there for a special occasion. We have been to extremely less expensive hotels, and they have offered complimentary bottles of wine, cakes or coupons for smaller celebrations. Needless to say, I was disappointed that they didn't even place a cheap bottle of wine or champagne in our room since I chose to spend my birthday at their hotel. I would have been happy with a cupcake. It's the thought that counts.

Let's talk about the room a little more. Even though it was a great looking room (36006), The HVAC made a loud and disturbing sound everytime the heat turned on or off. In the bedroom, it seemed like someone was trying to kick the door open as hard as they could. This loud thump happened every 15-20 minutes. So, for the two nights I was there, I did not sleep at all because the sound kept waking me up. Luckily, my wife sleeps with earplugs, so she didn't hear it.  That is the most important thing that pissed me off about this whole trip.

There is one more thing, beware of the concierge in the Chairman's Lounge. There is a markup when you allow them to help you. I understand that you pay for convenience, but I thought I was already paying for it. I figured it came with the room price of $711.31 per night. We wanted tickets to KA. The Chairman's Lounge concierge was the most expensive for the same seats that I priced with the regular Bellagio concierge that everyone uses and Half Price Tickets on the street.  The only reason why we ordered through the Chairmans Lounge is that we waited until the last minute. Plus, my wife talked me into it. We PAID (again) for the convenience.

Now, I understand that $1713.56 is not a big deal for a show and a two-night stay at a hotel for some people, and in particular for the Bellagio. But, for us, it was a lot of money, and I just wanted to best possible time for my wife and I. Sadly, I got the opposite.

My wife and I have been to Vegas a combined eight times and have never experienced this type of treatment before.

I guess I am writing this to say; you don't always get what you pay for.",0,0,0

I have stayed here a handful of times.  By far, they have the best customer service!  I had a bad customer service experience while checking in and they upgraded me to a 1 bedroom suite with 3 bathrooms.  They even sent up a fruit basket for my troubles.

The bedrooms are very nice and a step up from some of the other hotels on the strip, but not a HUGE night and day difference.  Just being in the hotel and in the room makes you feel like you are Donald Trump.

You must check out their season botany garden display which changes every month.

The pools are nice, but a bit weird since they have about 7 different pools which are a bit on the chilly side and attracts an older crowd.

TIP: Although their buffet has received high reviews, your best bet it to go to the Wynn Hotel's buffet where is a bit cheaper and WAY better!  Also, there is a free tram that you can take from the Bellagio to Monte Carlo that you can take.",2,0,0

Booked a decent deal (three nights for the price of two) and made sure we had a nice view of the fountains. This was a must, for us there was no point in staying at this hotel unless we could enjoy the fountains.

The guest room was adequate, but not overly nice. I was actually kind of disappointed. Before staying here, I thought the Bellagio was supposed to be one of the snazziest hotels on the strip. As a passerby I was always impressed by the casino and lobby, so I assumed the hotel rooms would also be incredible. So the room was just ok. No fancy tv, relatively small room, and decently appointed bathroom. The fountain show was amazing though. I've never had a room with such a beautiful view. In the evening the show would come on every 15 minutes (until midnight) and you could turn the tv to a certain channel, which would play the coordinating music. Nice touch.

For the money, I feel like I could find nicer hotels in Vegas. Bellagio has been a staple on the Strip for a long time, but I think other hotels are competing in the luxury four\/five star resort status. I would stay at the Bellagio again, but I would probably splurge for a suite...which would definitely have to face the fountains.",1,0,0

Crying baby (for hours \/ poor kid!) down the hall and they sent security when I called but of course crying stopped yet started up 20 minutes later.

The check-in agent warned me not to use the in-room refrigerator for anything except buying their products, because sensors under each item will charge me automatically, even if I don't consume the item. A $32 daily resort fee, on top of whatever room fee you pay, comes as a surprise at checkout.  Lines for check-in are frequently long.

I understand that Bellagio is a popular hotel with high demand, so it may not be as important for them to provide the best service.  However, it is still annoying for a hotel at this caliber to be nickel and dime.  We probably will look for a different hotel next time, just to avoid the hassle.",0,0,0

Be prepared for long lines at check-in, and a smoke filled casino which I wasn't expecting. Apparently all the casinos allow smoking. The sports book in all casinos is the only non smoking environment. I didn't win much at this casino but scored at the D downtown and the Luxor. Also, room service takes a LONG time!

It was my first time there and my husband's fourth time. I was a little weary to choose this hotel based on some reviews and wasn't sure if it will be the right choice for us. I am glad I choose this hotel!

Checking in was very pleasant. I loved the person who helped us! Her name was Naya I believe. She upgraded us to a suite for additional fee and requested housekeeping to send us chocolates every day, which was such a nice gesture. We were checking in early around 11 and we were able to access our suite right away since we upgraded, regular check in is at 3pm. We got lucky! They also, let us check out late at 12pm. Big Plus!!

The Suite was breathtaking! We had the spectacular views of the Fountain and a view of the pool on the other side. The bed was absolutely comfortable and the bathroom was beautiful! We were on the 18th floor.

Housekeeping did an amazing job. They cleaned our room in the morning when we left for breakfast and then we went out to dinner and came back to made up beds again. How awesome is that? Keep up the great work guys!

We had a beautiful stay and I will be back. It was a lovely, well maintained, classy hotel with great hospitality. Will definitely return again.",1,2,2

Gambling. For me, the idea of putting hard earned money into a machine, only to watch my funds disappear with a resounding cacophony of bells, whistles, and flashing lights has always seemed less than gratifying. However, my linear misconceptions were refurbished in February of 2015, when a co worker and I decided to fly into the neon desert for lunch at the Bellagio Hotel. 

The architectural decadence of Vegas' post Howard Hughes renaissance undoubtedly extended it's influence into to every detail of the Bellagio. Decked out in floral regalia to commemorate Chinese New Year, the first breathtaking attraction to pose for my cell phone's aperture was the ornate conservatory. As we made our way beyond the majestic waterfalls donning taxidermied goats, I remained captivated by the red and gold lanterns, matching miniature pagodas, and life size figurines made entirely of flower arrangements. 

Nestled away in an inconspicuous corner of the conservatory was the entrance to Cafe Bellagio. In spite of a long line, my co worker and I were seated within a timely manner. After reviewing the reasonably sized menu, I settled on the portabello, Swiss, spinach, and mushroom sandwich, with Parmesan french fries and a mocha frappuccino. Both feeling thoroughly satisfied, my co worker and I departed from the cafe and spent the remainder of our time at the hotel exploring the gift shop, enjoying the live pianist, and of course venturing into the casino. Although gambling isn't my cup of tea, I must admit that it was enjoyable to see the different celebrity themes of each slot machine. 

When I have a chance to remain in Vegas overnight, I'll be interested in renting a suite and experiencing every ounce of luxury that the Bellagio has to offer.",3,3,1

All the stuff in our room was controlled by one remote control, the window blinds, the lights, the TV and the DVD player all in one remote, that in itself was heavenly LOL

We ordered room service and got a rib eye steak cooked to medium rare, mashed potatoes and a spring salad. I've never had room service turnout so well and the steak come as ordered. Usually it comes a over done and the other items luke warm or soggy. That wasn't the case here, the meat was cooked as ordered, the potatoes were hot and the croutons in the salad were still crunchy! 

The next morning after the wedding rehearsal we were treated to lunch at the Bellagios buffet and oh damn...that was the best buffet I've ever eaten at. Pizza, prime rib, turkey, butternut squash ravioli with sage, prime rib, sushi, Alaskan crab legs and did i mention prime rib? GOOOD STUFF!

The thing about the Bellagio though is, NONE of it is cheap. Even the roulette wheels are at a $20 minimum inside and out, I won though so no complaints. The room service we got was about $120, the buffet was free but I've eaten there again and it was $29 and the room...hell I ain't getting into that LOL but it costs you...a lot.

We had such high hopes for Bellagio but they couldn't do a single thing right. 

To sum it up... here was our 3 day\/2 night stay... of nothing but WAITING: 

Day 1: 
Arrived at Bellagio... waited an hour in line for check in... arrived at check in and there were no more rooms with double queens, so they said they would have a roll-away bed delivered... 4 hours later, go to the room and no roll-away bed so we call to ask for it... 1 hour later, still no roll-away bed so we call again (2 am in the morning).... another 45 mins, still no roll-away so we call again... another 30 mins, still no bed, so I call to speak to a manager, 5 mins later, the roll-away bed arrives. 

Day 2: 
We call to get switched to a room with 2 queen beds and they tell us our new room number and tell us our keys have been electronically updated to the new room... we walk to the other room and our keys don't work... call the front desk, spend 20 mins on hold and they tell me they will have security meet us to let us in... 40 mins later security comes and lets us in but he doesn't have new room keys for us... so we have togo to  ""check in"" again and wait another 30 mins to get new keys. 

Day 2 night: 
Come back to room around 12 am and there is a party in the suite beside us so we ask to change rooms... go back to check in and wait 20 mins to get new keys... talk to the manager about how frustrating our experience has been at bellagio and she upgrades us to a suite.... go to the suite and it's 1 king instead of 2 queens.... call the manager who apologies for her error and takes us to the correct room with the new keys... 1:30 am and hungry, so we go to the Bellagio Cafe (the only thing open)... place is empty but still a 45 min wait to eat... 

Day 3 - Can't wait to leave... but until we can leave... must wait 1 hour for our car at valet. 

Worst experience ever which consisted of non-stop waiting and waiting and waiting. One of the most frustrating experiences of my life.  Check-in is the most unorganized area where there are no line queue, so you just have to choose a line and hope for the best... it's crazy this place is a 5 star hotel since they clearly don't know how to manage guests and visitors. 

Never again... better off staying at Venetian, Mandalay or Wynn.",2,1,1

However, my most recent stay here last weekend wasn't as climatic. By all means, the hotel is a must-see, but staying here and paying an arm and a leg isn't worth it. 

The rooms are not as luxurious as the newer hotels - so minus 2 stars for that. Everything looked old - the walls, paint, bathroom decorations, the old-school TV, etc. I'm sure they are trying to go for the classic Italian feel, but they should invest some of their money to spruce things up. I also stayed at the Vdara that weekend, I have to admit that I wished I stayed both nights there instead of the Bellagio.

However, don't let this review stop you from visiting this hotel. The casino is top-class, the conservatory is breathtaking, and the fountain show is amazing. However, I was disappointed that the show I watched did not have any music playing.

Bellagio is a staple of new Vegas. I booked a room there a few weeks back and can say the hotel itself is of course beautiful. The hotel incorporates an atrium area that was both beautiful and whimsical. Picture being in the middle of a Tim Burton film.

The room - Surprisingly basic except for the bed. Great bathroom with separate shower and tubs. The bed was incredibly soft. The walls however are shockingly thin and I could easily hear what sounded like a stripper party next door. (nothing wrong with that, it is Vegas) Because of that, I wouldn't suggest getting much sleep.

Parking - Free and lots of it. No complaints here.

Casino - Higher priced tables

If this hotel were in Dallas, no doubt it would get 5 stars. But due to the cost and the expectations associated with the Bellagio, I am forced to give it a 3. I believe if you want to shell out the bucks on a room, check into the Aria.",0,0,0

The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, everyone is very friendly and the staff was very attentive. It is a little disappointing, not having a refrigerator in your room. Here is a little tip , we brought a huge cooler bag with us in our suitcase, filled it with ice and kept light snacks and water in there, and it worked out perfect. You can also put ice in the ice bucket and leave a few waters to chill for the day. Worked out perfect for us! There is a CVS directly across the street which sells liquor, light snacks, sunblock everything pretty much you would need. It is about two dollars more than our average local CVS, but so worth it. Especially for a case of 12 waters (Dasani) $6. And it's 24 hours. You do not want to buy any snacks out of your  room or anything out of the refrigerator as is an absolute ripoff. A huge bottle of Fiji water $18 a small bag of chips $8, a small little thing of cookies $7 so not worth it , The prices are on one of the channels on the TV. Stock up across the street. This location is prime right in the center of everything. The mile mall is across the street, make sure you go to the ABC store  and stock up on any novelty gifts you want to bring home, as they have the best prices that I have seen. Also, if you have a AAA card make sure you go to the customer service desk, they will give you a huge book with tons of discounts. A lot of buy an entrée get an entrée free, free trials of popcorn etc. Buy one show ticket get one free.
so worth taking a look at and it's free. We like having freshly squeezed veggies and fruit shakes in the morning for breakfast, there is a place called Jamba Juice in the mall excellent! So many different varieties and tasty shakes, a large runs about nine dollars, but in the coupon book there is buy one get one free.
We walk the strip every morning and every night, and tried different food and honestly Bellago by far , has  the best tasting food.I thought I can get a cheaper deal outside of Bellagio, but all the prices are pretty much the same $15 for a cocktail $17 for a sandwich and fries etc. even at the steakhouse, all the prices are pretty much the same. Yesterday we sat at the Cypress pool, being a holiday weekend, it was $125 for a chair, but with the reviews all being great, we figure we would at least try it once, and we are so glad we did! Get there early, because you get to pick your seats. We stayed from 11 AM till 5 PM and enjoyed every minute of it. The chairs are so comfortable, and the service they give you was impeccable. Not to mention the food was delicious, I believe it's from the restaurant Fix in the hotel. I got a turkey club sandwich, with Parmesan fries, my boyfriend got turkey sliders and we shared nachos with guacamole, everything with the tip came to $85. But was so delicious and so filling, and generous portions. All said and done between the chairs, the food and tipping everyone it was a$400 afternoon, something you definitely have to do at least once if you can. We were going to rent a cabana, but for both of us it really wasn't worth it, the  chairs were definitely a better deal.  My recommendations get the plastic large Bellaggio cups , $28 for your first drink, and  the refills are only $24 for a 32 ounce drink. I really thought I was going to drink a lot more, but with the heat, you really don't feel like drinking and it tires you out, combined with the sun. They to give you free water by the pool out of a water tower , so you can use the reusable cups, which come in handy. The other two days we came down around 3 o'clock, after walking the strip and we were able to find lounge chairs after looking for about 10 minutes. This morning, I woke up early and got here when they opened up at 8 o'clock which there was already a line of about 70 people in front of me, and about 50 people behind me when I got down at 7:45. But on a holiday weekend, if you want an umbrella , a table and two lounge chairs you need to get here early. I am sitting next to a pool that is directly across from the cypress pool, which is a great alternative if you don't want to spend the money on the cypress pool. The cypress pool is  an adult pool, but the one right next to it basically the same , they are both cooling fountains , the water is a lot colder, and not for swimming, so the kids don't come over here at all. They stay in the other two big pools, which the water is warmer.  The pool area is beautiful, and they played a good variety of music. You can also order food and drinks around any of the other pools as well.  Caesar's Palace is right next-door, which is also a nice place to visit with a lot of bars ,lounges and .All in all, we are having a great time and definitely recommend this hotel",2,0,0

The hotel amenities were wonderful!  The bed was amazingly comfortable for our aching bodies due to walking up and down the strip in 110 degree Vegas weather!  Housekeeping was very prompt! With a phone call away, the hotel staff were very attentive to our needs.  We didn't know where the ice was and where to get ice from so we called the In-room service staff and received it within minutes!!!!  

We had a fountain-view room and it was amazing! We could see the dancing water fountains throughout the day that it played.  I loved the fact that they had staff at every ""guest elevator"" to check to see if people had proper access (room key) to get onto the elevator!  Just that alone, I knew that the management was very keen in making the hotel safe for all the guests!

We didn't munch at many restaurants while we were in the Bellagio because we wanted to see the strip.  We ate at the infamous Bellagio Buffet which was one of the best buffets on the strip for the price that we payed ($35+ per person on weekend\/nights ).  We had the Dim Sum at the restaurant called ""Noodles"".  It's a very quaint restaurant.  The dim sum was okay, but of course because it's in a well-established hotel.. the prices were inflated ($3.50 for mini appetizers).... and the Chinese sausage and shrimp fried rice was not worth the $19 that we payed.  I could have made these food and it would have cost me less than $20 to make!! 

For a quick and reasonable bite, go to ""Snacks"".  They have some tasty snacks under $10!!!!! :))

first of all, bellagio is beautiful and classic. it is centrally located. i will say that the clientele seems a bit older than other places. 

the spa is wonderful (only guests can use the spa so it is not as crowded as other hotel spas where anyone can get in, and easier to schedule appointments- i will write another separate review for spa)

the buffet is superb - pricier than other buffets - i think the market buffet (formerly aladdin hotel but now in planet hollywood) is still best bang for the buck but if you want better food and willing to pay extra, belliagio buffet is excellent - i used a tip from yelp to pay for brunch and get in a little before dinner starts (which costs a lot more) - genius!  

we stayed on the 26th floor in the spa tower. there was an annoying constant buzzing sound which we later learned was from a generator for the hotel (we didn't really notice it until we were getting ready for bed but we were able to fall asleep because we were soo tired each night). if you get a room on the 26th floor, make sure it is not one of the rooms with this sound - you could probably easily change the room unless the hotel was completely booked.",0,0,0

I go to Vegas every year and have stayed at many many different hotels.. The Bellagio is definitely a cut above all the hotels I have frequented previously. The service level was exceptional from Ivan the Bell Man at the front door (he was so helpful and had the most positive energy\/attitude) to the woman who was at the front desk walking around with the IPAD trying to help people in the lineup check in\/out in a more timely manner (she helped us out a few times during our stay and everytime was soooo pleasant ) . I was impressed .. Customer Service is VERY important to me and I couldn't find anything to fault at this hotel... even the girl who worked only night shifts in the store selling souveniers (who had to deal with crazy drunk people every single shift) was always happy, smiling and helpful...Our room was very nice in teh spa tower (room 18605) ... we had wanted a king size bed but got two queens (honestly it ended up being a godsend having a second bed as my husband and I ended up spending a bit too much time in the sun and were burned to a crisp and were quite happy to be in different beds haha ) ... The one and only thing that I can say I wasnt too thrilled about was  the service at the pool. The server came around very infrequently and when she finally did show up after an hour, she took our order and then never showed up with our drinks..She seems to skip over sections of people and I heard a few people around us commenting that she wasnt paying attention to our area of the pool .When you are spending 20$ a drink , and tipping generously, you kindof expect SOME service. We ended up having to get hte majority of our drinks at the bar but.... is this really a big deal.??. no... it didnt affect how I feel about this hotel at all .

The decor is super modern and hip and I absolutely loved the color scheme! It was a lime green and turquoise and white and I was just enamored with it! The furniture in the suite was a nice sofa with chaise, a table and chairs, a little coffee table, and the huge bed. Everything here was insanely comfortable and the suite we were in was overlooking the fountains! It was awesome to be able to see the water show just by looking out the window! I have never actually watched it before, so this was a double awesome for me!

The lavatory area is awesome, the actual area to tinkle has a toilet and bidet inside of a room and the wash area has the tub and shower which were huge! Inside of the wash area is also a closet and vanity.

This is probably one of the pretties and most comfortable rooms I've been in! I would definitely reccommed this room (Corner suite 22nd floor) to those who can afford it!

The rooms themselves at one point were top notch.  Time has gone by and while they are far from run down they definitely don't feel special anymore.  You can tell the difference in mattresses between the better hotels in Vegas and the lower end places.  The mattress was soft, with springs that still had life in them.  Was never a fan of the decor in the rooms and that hasn't changed.

This place does well with the free entertainment and fine dining restaurant options.  Bellagio is one of the first places I tell people to go if this is their first time in Vegas.  Between the fountain show, the lobby glass, and the seasonal atrium decorations you can kill a bunch of time without spending any money.

On the dining side have been to Le Cirque 4 or 5 times, Picasso 3 times, and Olives twice.  Never had a bad meal at any of those visits.

Their spa is one of the best I have been to.

Location is fantastic, basically the middle of the strip.  There is a tram that leaves from Bellagio and takes you to a spot in between Monte Carlo and Aria.  I think that feature is very underrated as that stretch is my least favorite on the strip to walk.  Nice to be able to avoid it.

It wasn't (yay!), but some of the furniture and fixtures in the room were showing signs of wear and tear. 

THOUGHTS ABOUT THE ROOM: the room itself was spacious. There are controls near the door for the ceiling-to-floor window curtains. The room does not have a wall-to-wall view like Wynn, but more like half a wall of a view. The TV stations offered are not as plentiful as I've seen in other hotels. Certain channels, like the Asian channels, were a bit wonky. There are a couple of channels for them and when you flip to it, it works for a few seconds and then appear to lose the signal. Happened for every Asian channel. I didn't see a problem for any of the others. The bathroom had both a soaking tub and separate glass enclosed shower. The room fridge is fully stocked as a minibar and not empty, so you'd have to order an empty one at an additional cost. 

The resort fee of $33 covers internet, fitness center access, local calls, and boarding pass printing. During my trip in April, there were no parking fees for now but I was told it will be coming later and it'll be a cost separate from the resort fee. As of this posting, they've started implementing parking fees at certain M Life properties like Bellagio. -_-

THOUGHTS ABOUT THE AMENITIES: The fitness center is far from the hotel rooms. It's near the conservatory, sharing the same entrance as the spa and salon. As you head to the fitness center, you are given a great view of the conservatory from the second floor. I think Bellagio has my favorite fitness center thus far. It's a large fitness center with high ceilings, bright lights (some of it natural light too), weights, machines and an area for balance exercises. Surprised to see a considerable amount of people working out on a Tuesday morning! I didn't have a chance to check out the pool during my time here, which I was sad about.

THOUGHTS ABOUT THE SERVICE: Jacqueline, the front desk personnel who checked us in, was so warm and welcoming. We had booked a resort king room, but was able to upgrade to a fountain view room for a reasonable fee per night. It was totally worth the upgrade fee. Jacqueline is amazing; she worked her magic to get us a room as close to the middle of the floor as possible, which meant a breathtaking view of the fountains and the strip skyline. We pretty much stayed in the room when the fountains' schedule started and tuned in to the TV channel that played the music to the show. The music came through clear and crisp. We took many a video that captured all of the fountains. It was clearer than filming it at street level.

Bellagio was definitely worth it for a special occasion. The view itself was worth it. However, due to the parking fees, I would be factoring that in when choosing the place for my next Vegas trip.",5,0,0

I knew I was in for a rich (as in, I would soon be poor) experience when I first walked in the door and used the ATM and it spit out only Benjamins.  But if you got to go down, do it in style.  Bellagio's got style in spades.  You know you're in a class joint when even the urinal dividers are solid marble.

Those beautiful people chatting in the hall that you can't understand? Yes, they're actually Italian.  And there are a lot of them.  I assume Bellagio doesn't just truck them in for verisimilitude.  They actually fly themselves over from Florence or wherever  to stay in this idealized version of Italy.  In a city, or at least a street, where everything is artifice this is as close to real fakery as you can find.  

The thing is, for all the show (my room had marble floors and from the bed I could open the curtains remotely, then stroll over and watch the fountain show) Bellagio doesn't miss the details.  The pretty Italian cafe near the elevators uses both Illy Caffe and Umbria coffee and has outstanding pastries and snacks.  The personnel are without exception professional friendly and helpful.

Also, for all this I didn't pay all that much.  True, I was on a conference rate but I heard one of my fellow conference-goers bested that with Expedia.  I just give thanks to all those folks on the gaming floor, subsidizing my stay. 

I could go on about the spectacular pools, the selection of restaurants and bars, the amazing people watching, but you'll just have to go check it out.

It was the best experience!  The Bellagio limo came to pick us up at the airport.  When we left, a bell hop place another couple into our limo when we were standing there for 15mins.  This was the one thing that ruin the perfect Vegas weekend
Other than that we had 24 hour butler service available and the perfect view of the the strip.  We stayed with my future in laws who were there for business meeting.  The butler service was the best part of the presidential suites perk.  All you have to do is pick put any phone in the room and let them know what you need.  Most of the time, we used it for room service.  We needed some clothes pressed for some couple of the fancy meeting we needed to attend.  All we needed to do was give it to whichever butler was working and they were by our front door the next morning. Our tub was next to the window of the view of the strip.  The radio in the bathroom was great too!  I loved the robes that were provided for us to use.  Wished I could of taken that home.  There were fresh flowers places around our suite and they even switched out the flowers after a day or two. Room service was amazing, the butlers has their own entrance to our suite and when they were done setting up our food in the dining room they would politely announced that they were ready for us.  
The only con from this experience besides the limo was that we were not allowed in one of the pool sections where you had to pay.  My father in law was in the presidential suite for a week.  For the amount of money that he spent that week for his work meeting, that paying pool section should be included with the presidential suite perk.  Our overall experience was fantastic!

Christmas time in the Bellagio was breath taking.    Never before have I seen such a massive grand display in their center courtyard.   This reminded me of Christmas in the Park back home in San Jose.   Bellagio's Christmas displays are definitely on steroids!   I could spend hours here in the courtyard admiring the displays and the details spent on the icons that make this time of year joyful.      On this enchanting evening, our party ventured to Bellgaio's dinner buffet on a Sunday night and filled our bellies with delights of prime rib and kobe beef.   Yes, you read that right... KOBE BEEF!      I had to dive for seconds and thirds for the succulent Wagyu cattle from Japan.     I joined my beef dinner with their selection of Alaskan crab legs, fresh shrimp, sautéed and herbed mushrooms, and various fresh greens.    I'm taking one star for this visit because I expected the desserts to knock me off my seat.   Instead, it fell short of tantalizing my taste buds.     I love my desserts moist and full a natural sugars and creaminess.   In any event,  I've learned over the years that Bellagio has the best buffet food.    It's all about the quality of the food, not the quantity.     This is big recommend when searching for the best buffets in Vegas.

As for the accommodations, I suggest booking early as you can and getting on their mailing list for special deals.     This is my go to spot when in Vegas.     Perfect for romantic getaways for couples on a quick mini vacation.   Leave the kids at home.

I never like to write 1 star reviews, and I always try to find something positive to say.
I am actually sad to admit I cannot be very positive in this review :(

Me and my wife found what seemed to be a nice online packaged deal and we stayed here for the 1st time ever thinking it was a going to be great and we were looking forward to the stay here very much!  

We upgraded our room and were told about service charges and resort fees and listened carefully about all these things the desk clerk mentioned..
After check out and we viewed our bill on the TV service they provide and we were ok with it. We get back home and find more charges were applied to our credit card!
We were charged for things we never used or even saw or told about!  
We do not drink, yet were changed for alcohol!
How is that legally possible?

Do yourself a favor.  
If you do not intend to use the snack bar in your room and tell them to remove it from your room before your go to your room unless you want to be charged for never using it.

I can't stress this enough to everyone, Get a copy of your bill on paper before you leave so if need be, you can dispute ""unforeseen"" charges!  
Yet even then they still may take you to the cleaners for no valid reason.

Also My wife was stopped by security a number of times trying to go to our room thinking she was not a guest by the same security guard even though she showed her room card!

If all of this sounds like a good time to you. Then by all means go to the Bellagio.
Maybe you have so much money that you don't care about getting ripped off and or you do not love your spouse enough and do not mind them being treated in a hostile fashion.   

Looking at and talking with other yelpers on this subject.   Lori P. of Bellagio Hotel always says sorry, but never makes any effort what so ever to compensate or right the wrongs that have been done to honest people.   In short, her apologies and words are like the service we paid for, worthless. 

We tried calling the Bellagio, but were just given the run around with numbers that go to recordings and no one to talk to.


So all in all...
Yes, I just like to give out our hard earned money to places like this so we can give bad reviews rather than a good one for no valid reason. Kinda like taking money for no valid reasons, right?

There a huge difference between splurging and telling a resort to just have their way with your credit card, thus robbery.

I've seen how bad things can get (Westward Ho) and I've seen the five star side of things (Venetian). During my visits I almost always visited the Bellagio to play poker or just hang out because I felt it was the classiest joint on the strip. I always dreamed of staying there, but the high price was hard to justify.

So this was my first stay at the Bellagio and I saw things that I had never seen before. Things such as $24.95 per day WiFi access, $6.00 handling fee per letter to receive mail at the hotel, $1.00 per minute computer usage, and a $10 per day fridge rental fee. I heard things that I had never heard before in a hotel, namely my neighbor urinating. The sound coming through crisp and loud through the vent above the camode. The constant sound of dripping water in the shower drain. And dealers informing me that I have to bet $25 per hand at blackjack to get MGM\/Mirage rewards.

In addition to surprises, there were things that I found simply disappointing. The pool closed at 6:00 PM. The CRT television had around 30 stations, and 10 of them were in Chinese. And most requests (hangers, pillows, towels) took an average of 45 minutes to arrive. Yes, I actually timed each request because I had read another review on Yelp about how fast they had things delivered, they said usually in less than 10 minutes.

Is this just a negative review? No, I hope not. There are some really nice things at the Bellagio:

* choice of down or foam pillows
* the fountain show and an amazing view of the strip
* fancy and expensive restaurants
* comfortable beds with good linens
* a fancy bathroom with a beautiful glass shower and large tub
* almost as much marble as the other nice hotels on the strip
* a very helpful conceirge desk, although sometimes understaffed
* lots of shaded parking close to the lobby (but not to our tower)
* good, invisible, and quiet ventilation in the bathroom
* reliable and quiet HVAC with 1\/2 degree increments
* electric curtains, although the switch wasn't near the window
* clock radio with iPod dock (although not for iTouch or iPhone)

When we checked out of the hotel, we had an overwhelming sense of being nickle and dimed, despite paying a premium to stay there. Perhaps after reading this review you won't suffer the same sticker shock and awe, and can enjoy your stay knowing how much you will be billed when you check out.

Will I go back and stay there again? Yes, I will. Not having a flat panel TV is not the most important thing about staying at a hotel. The most important thing is making my wife happy, and she absolutely loved the spa. As far as I know, only guests are able to use the spa on weekends so that will be the one reason we will return.",2,1,2

I've been to Vegas more times than I can count (and then I'd like to admit), and stayed at various hotels. I honestly believe that any of the mid-tier hotels are good enough (Paris, Monte Carlo, etc). but if you are looking to splurge, the Bellagio is worth every penny.  There's the Pool Cafe which I LOVE (see my review here: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/bellagio-pool-cafe-las-vegas#hrid:tj7FPE3ZFiI7pwAZrXDUaA) and amazing customer service. My friend lost his wallet in the middle of the night (or early hours of the morning, depending how you look at it...) and got a call the next day from security letting him know that they had found his wallet. And everything was still in it.  When we were checking out, I took my bags with me to grab my friend from the pool. I asked the guy at the top of the stairs leading to the pool if I could leave my bag for a few minutes while I grabbed my friend, and he was more than happy to do it, and even suggested I pull it around where he could see it better to keep an eye on it while I was gone.

And.. location.  You can't get much more central than this. In terms of the high end hotels (Venetian and Wynn are the other two I would note) the location of the Bellagio is by far the best. We could walk almost everywhere that we wanted to go (even in the 100 degree heat).

The rooms are large and roomy and nicely decorated, but that is to be expected.  What sets this hotel apart are the customer service and its location. I only wish I could rationalize the splurge and stay here more often...",1,0,1

Unfortunately, it was really crowded when I got in, which makes things  annoying. A lot of people passing by while standing in line to check in. They were out of non-smoking rooms when I got there so I had to spend my first night in a smoking room, gross! Had to fight through crowds to get to my room.

Rooms are a decent size, and are quite comfortable. Only problems I had was that it was too dark and the smoking (which was fixed night 2) The chocolate is good. Bathroom is roomy, and had a separate bathtub\/shower.  Gym is nice.

Service is good, they know your name and room number as soon as you call in. Getting a non-smoking room night 2 was a synch, I didn't even need to go to the front desk in person!

I splurged for the Deluxe room with Lakeview since this was a milestone birthday celebration which did not disappoint. There were no lines in check-in, professional staff, exquisite room decor, fabulous pool, and the banks of elevators that take you directly to your floor without stopping at every level. 

If you can fit it in your budget, live like a Rockstar by reserving a poolside cabana that is yours for the day with your own personal Cabana Boy to pamper you. You will want to reserve it a couple of weeks prior to your stay to ensure your spot, they will call you the day of to confirm that you still want the reservation, no charge to reserve or decline. Just call, the staff is accommodating. 

I would have rated it 5 stars aside that there is no late night quick bite joint where you can grab something quick and get back to gambling or carrying on. All eateries are sit down, and at 3:30 am, who wants to play nice-nice with a waiter that doesn't want to be working at 3:30 am.

It's extremely disorganized, you just look for the shortest line, and get in it, no matter it may suddenly slow down and people who got into other lines 20 minutes after you did are probably in their rooms by then.  Unfortunately, we picked a line like that the last time I stayed there.  I don't understand why they don't use the ropes, so the line is fair and orderly, instead it's crowded and there are people scattered everywhere.  It took probably 45 minutes to check in because the people who were at the front were from out of the country and had about 8 passports to check in, then they decided they wanted to change their type of room.  Now, this is not the hotel's fault, but if they had an orderly line, I could have gone to the next available person.  Instead, the employee directing people to lines tells us to stay where we are.  I did not even see the point of that person.  Seriously, a simple rope that probably doesn't cost much could make all the difference and keep guests tempers down.

They have recently renovated and the rooms were very nice and clean.  I liked the photographs they had throughout the halls and in the rooms.  Of course, the lobby is beautiful (but not beautiful enough to distract from the line!).  The housekeeping staff was extremely friendly and they are a definite positive about the Bellagio, unlike the cocktail servers.  Good luck finding one while you are gambling or if you do see one, getting them to stop and take your drink order.  I will probably stay there again, but I know I need to prepare myself for the cattle call check-in.",1,0,0

Built when themed Vegas hotels were still a thing (ahem - cold sterile City Center) this place packs a bunch of personality and spares no expense in doing so.

From the beautiful exterior to all the small details inside this place is nothing less than incredible. I've been so many times and no visit to Vegas is complete unless I drop by. From the moment you step foot onto this property you will notice that is different and better than all the rest.

Just enter the parking garage. Right before you get in you are greeted by security and asked to pop your trunk. This isn't just some free for all where you can just walk in like Walmart - rather this is like a Costco where your checked by the door for admittance. I like that and it adds to security. I noticed other properties do the same but only on New Years eve - Barbary Coast comes to mind where they inspect your car - even with mirrors to check the undercarriage. You can never be too safe these days.

I particularly enjoy one of the hostess at the  Buffet. She has been there since day one back in 1998 and it always puts a smile on my face to see her there. Looks like she never misses a day of work.

I don't like the addition of the new tower that was completed in 2005. Its an eyesore but I guess its set back far enough that it shouldn't be an issue. I would have preferred they name it a different name and painted it a different color. Such a shame the sweeping double staircase was sacrificed for this addition... but business is business.

Casino is beautiful. Ceilings and light fixtures... walkways - all just as beautiful as can be. Some casinos look like warehouses - no this one... rather a work of art. 

Standard rooms are small but of high quality. Power shades and lots and lots of comfort and pillows. Good thing they have turn down service - moving all those pillows and opening up the bed is hard work.

Other resorts might be newer but in my book none beat Bellagio and all the elegance and good vibes it has to offer.",4,0,0

Upon arrival, we were shocked  the checkin line was winding through 4 roped off lines all the way to the  lobby exit door.  It took an hour to check-in.  Why they weren't better staffed was puzzling.

The room was of decent size but was dusty in areas, shower had loose molding, wallpaper is pulling from the wall, there were spots on the bathroom floor and tub area that were never cleaned and the bedspread smelled of urine.  All items I would not expect from a ""luxury"" hotel.  I asked housekeeping to remove the bedspread and bring a new one, but it wasn't replaced  until the day before our departure.  The A\C rattled and we called engineering to repair.  A nice gentleman did come and repair it, but he stood there and talked (we had just arrived) until we tipped him and he left. 

We immediately took note of the expense of the In-room snacks and beverages in the refrigerator and decided to avoid that at all costs (pun intended).   There is also no coffee maker in the room.  So, we taxied to a market and purchased some milk, water, wine and snacks to enjoy in the room.  (A bag of chips in their ice and concession area is $5 and a beverage is $7).   We did not carefully read signage and removed a couple of sodas and beer from the refrigerator in our room to keep our items cool.  We had a knock on our door two days later from an employee who informed us we were being charged $50\/day to use their equipment.  I was shocked and said by all means I would remove my items so they could put the items we removed back back so we wouldn't be charged.  She put those EXACT items back in that we removed.  Worried about the charges, we called the manager who said we had actually been charged $50\/each day AND $468 for the contents of the entire fridge.  He said it was a health code violation to put items back.  I expressed outrage and said a) not everything was removed and B) the exact same items were put back in so how could we be charged for all of it?  He then he agreed to remove  the charges ""as a courtesy"".  Perhaps as a courtesy they should make things affordable, provide a coffee
maker  in the room and provide a refrigerator you can actually use?  The evening before check out we were settling our bill and noticed another $50 charge.  Called and at first we were told it was a ""perishable"" fee charge then by a different person a ""restocking"" fee.  The manager refused to honor what we were originally told that it be removed and would not credit it off.  

The entire experience we felt so nickel and dimed, disappointed by the lack of customer service and it just wasn't worth it for 4 nights.  There are too many other options on the strip to be treated this way.  We will not be returning.",13,2,0

Also Prime steak house was great and so was the staff in that restaurant. 

Tip of the day, splurge a little and get a lake view room-that way you can watch the fountain show when you want right from your room and they have a channel on the tv which plays the music for the fountains.

Review:

The Bellagio is a place I want so hard to like because it is absolutely gorgeous. I've been to Vegas a couple of times, but both times, I've stayed on Caesar's, which has been more than excellent. 

My issue with the Bellagio began with the bellman. I was asked three times when I was wheeling my luggage into the hotel (all one bag) if they could grab it. I politely told them 'No thank you.' They all responded by making a snide sound or rolling their eyes or throwing their hands in the air. Totally unprofessional. 

The next issue was the most major, because it reinforced the idea of the Bellagio that I got upon my arrival - that the employees are snobs. I played Craps countless times, and the dealers were just flat out rude, especially when I would have bets taken down and cashed out (I would imagine because I was up). This happened on three different occasions with 3-4 different employees. One was a higher up with a tie, overseeing a chip deposit to our table. 

My next issue was the room itself. The temperature would not adjust. The room is a smokehouse, and while the temperature reads 65, there is no way it is above 73.

Next was the food. Every place I ate at (that was a quick grab -  not a restaurant) was twenty minutes to fill an order. It shouldn't take that long to make a pastrami on rye sandwich! This occurs multiple times.

Having had very positive experience at Caesar's, I don't know if I'll ever return to the Bellagio, and that just isn't to stay, I will no longer gamble there either (for the rest of my trip, I'll be gambling at Caesar's or somewhere else). 

I hope that someone reads this because the Bellagio is such a beautiful hotel. Everything is set up to be perfect. Some of the employees aren't executing it like they should be and it's ruining the experience.",13,1,0

I love the Bellagio and wish I could give them 5 stars, but they continue to have a few unresolved quirks that are consistently mentioned in reviews which keep them from being a world class hotel.  These Include:

Lack of Access to Coffee:
Even Motel Six  has in-room coffee makers, but not The Bellagio.   I tried the coffee options that include: 1.) Jean Philippe Coffee Shop-a 35 minute wait in line for one cup of black coffee.  2.) Room Service- very fast (8 minutes) but the coffee tasted bad and was expensive. 3.) A quarter mile walk to Starbucks at Planet Hollywood-best option.

Robot Thief of Mini Bar:
As true of all mini-bars, no one in their right mind would pay these inflated prices.  However, with this one, you are charged if you pick-up or touch an item.  You are also threatened with a $50 a day fine, if you store any personal item in it...just plain tacky.

Resort Fee:
This mandatory fee is charged daily and covers the following, regardless if you use them or not:

Wi-Fi--------------------I have LTE data and my phone is a hotspot.
Fitness Center---------Who wants to work out on vacation?
Print Boarding Pass---I save it as as a PDF on the phone and don't print.

Why not make these optional or just include them in the room price? Once again, tacky.

Other:

I even discovered a new one this visit.  There are no blender drinks at the pools.

The only reason I cannot think of that these things continue is the opposite of the Burger King slogan.  Management wants you to ""have it their way."" If you do not like these aspects of your stay, you can stay somewhere else.

Otherwise, this is a beautiful hotel with the best customer service on The Strip.",1,1,1

Once from in-room service and second time from eating at Cafe Bellagio.  Which is a shame because spent more than $50 on each of those meals, to only spend all night in pain having diarrhea. 
The front-desk staff is incredibly rude.  I asked to speak to the manager to relay the sickness I experienced, and the guy told me he was the manager and was unbelievably rude and and condescending. 
The room attendants and the phone operators are really nice, but everyone else there seems like they have huge chips on their shoulders.  
I spent about $1000 at the blackjack tables, and can say that the dealers are ok... not really nice but not mean either... just ""there"".  The drink waitresses have SERIOUS attitudes, literally barking back ""I'm only 'picking' up now!!"" Meaning, no drink orders could be made at that moment.  That was another example of how ""jaded"" the staff here was.  
The rooms are comfortable enough, most notably the nice big bathroom... but one many occasions, you could hear the toilet gurgling all by itself and emitting a really foul odor.  Obviously there was something wrong with their plumbing.. but how gross is it to experience this at such a high-end place!!!
I spent six nights at this hotel.  I've stayed at many other nice casino hotels on the strip, but I really was looking forward to the Bellagio experience.

I do not know if its because of the economy or what but we got a terrific rate for our stay in October.  We always stay in one of the 1 bedroom President's Suite.  This stay, it was $399 a nite!!!  At over 1500 sf, this is a great room.  This room, this stay, was on the back side looking out at the Rio and The Palms hotel with the gorgeous mountains in the background.  I tend to keep all the draperies open so at night the lights illuminate the room and in the morning, the sun coming up on the mountains is great.  Although I complained to myself this time for not booking the room on the fountain side, I actually prefer this because the fountains are loud and can bother you after you see them the first few times.

The President's Suites are furnished in purple and gold tones.  When you walk in, you have a foyer with a 1\/2 bath on one side and entrance to the wet bar on the other side.  The front side of the wetbar has 4 barstools. It is a mini kitchen with cabinetry, refridgerators, sink, etc.  This overlooks the dining area (table for 4) as well as the living area which has a full size sofa and two chairs, huge flat screen TV.  The whole wall is windows.  In the bedroom is the most comfortable king bed.  The bedroom is on the end of the hotel so the windows wrap around the room.  There is a TV that comes out of the console at the foot of the bed.  Only a slight problem (which is insignificant to me), its hard to operate the remote while lying down.  There are his and her bathrooms and closets off the bedroom.  My bathroom had a huge jacuzzi tub that overlooked the mountains.  Flat screens in each bathroom.  My husband's bathroom had a huge steam shower.

New since about January 09 is that when you stay in the Suites, you have VIP access.  You have complimentary transportation to and from the airport via a stretch limo.  There is also a few food presentations in the VIP suites room (wine, cookies, choc covered straberries, etc).  We always forgot to take advantage of this - but it is a really nice amenity and its secluded.  The VIP concierge took care of all our reservations and we always went right to the front of the line in many of the food establishments at the Bellagio as well as ease for reservations for last minute dinner choices.  We are already planning next year's trip (my husband attends a yearly conference)....next year I plan on hosting a private party in our room for business associates which the Bellagio staff said will of course be , ""no problem"".  Oh, and the housekeeping is AWESOME. Very attentive!!!!

One last review of the pools.  They are my favorite.  There are a bunch of pools - finding an open chair is hard if arriving after noon or so.  I've found it best to find one of the pool attendants and giving him a tip to find the best location where he will bring the chair(s) over and set them up.  Its worth it as to not waste time walking from pool to pool to find one chair or two.  We usually get a cabana for one of our days there.  You have to book this before and its not guaranteed as the high rollers have first pick of them as they are comped.  However, we have always gotten one - you will know by 8:30 am the day of.  The cost is $400 for the day.  What is great is that when you check in between 9 and 10 at the cabana, if your cabana is in the shade, ask your cabana attendant to reserve some beach chairs in the sun - they will go and set them up and put reserved signs on them.  This was just terrific.  The cabanas have a flat screen TV as well as fruit and beverages in them.  It was great to take breaks in there when you had to get out of the sun or have lunch.  My husband watched football and enjoyed lunch at the table (seats 4) and there is also a sofa in there.  Outside the cabanas are usually 4 private chaise lounges.",0,0,0

Anyways, for what you pay... everything should be in pristine condition.  
We attended Hyde which provided great service since we were there before 10 and were able to get free bottle service. The rest of the night gets pretty packed, but that's common with most of the clubs. 

Expect to pay out some nice change for even a bottle of water at the convenient store here. I took the tram to Monte Carlo for water that was way more affordable. And by the way, the tram is great! 

Gambling is fun at Bellagio... why because it's one of the few hotels in the strip that actually still carries the older slot machine games (along with the newer ones)! And they have European roulette, which is fun to watch when the minimum is $300. Crap dealers are always friendly, and I enjoy that they have lower minimum tables to play. 

I really wish that Bellagio was part of Total Rewards instead of Mlife... much better program with perks. I would gamble at Bellagio wayyyy more often. 
But if MLife stepped it up, you'd be back in the game!

next, i had my own conference room (not reserved for my usage - no no), like a conference room IN my Penthouse, hello!  could seat 20 and had crazy audio visual capabilities in case you wanted a corporate feel.  i had my own bar - with 4 bar stools and 2 refrigerators and it's own TV (just for the bar area).  then i had my own steam room!  well, my big-ass shower doubled as it's own steam room.  nice!  

ask me how big my room was?  How big was it , you say?  it was sooo big that i had 2 bathrooms in my room.  the main bathroom and the guest bathroom for all the partiers.  we juiced up the sound system so much that security came to our room 2 times per night.  but relax though, they had this great system where basically you had at least 5 warnings before you got kicked out of the room.  so we're like: ""why don't you tell the people complaining that they should get a Penthouse next time? or maybe that they shouldn't get a room next to a penthouse, hello?""

couple things i forgot: you don't check in with the masses when you have a penthouse. they take you to a private room to check in that has coffee, free drinks, chocolate covered strawberries, cookies... heck i was looking to see if we had our own 21 table and go-go dancers in there.  of course, you have your own concierge that can get you tables and entrance anywhere.  we partied in the penthouse till 3-4am each night then we decided it was time to hit the clubs downstairs.  we were never back in the rooms till 7am either night\/morning.  tragic.",3,3,5

Second day: I tried their tub. It was ok. Paris suite was much better you could fit someone else In the tub. Not as relaxing as Paris hotel. I probably had jets in em if I paid more for my room. Bellagio was a little too high class for my taste but it was an ok experience.",0,0,0

Had an amazing time here. We stayed in a fancy suite, so maybe that's the reason I didn't have the underwhelmed response some people did to the rooms. Our suite had 3 bathrooms- one presumably for guests if you were to have visitors in the living room area, and two off the bedroom. One had a large jetted tub and the other had a steam shower. Enjoyed having my own bathroom to get ready in! The bedroom, living room, and dressing area were large, the huge windows with automated curtains and amazing view of the fountains were incredible. Everything in the room was luxurious and well maintained. 
The room service was incredible! Definitely expensive, but so good that it's one of the things that would make me come back to this hotel. Fresh juices, delicious eggs benedict. 
The walk to our elevator from the lobby was a bit long, but the lobby and gardens were gorgeous, and the many places you pass on the way, like the candy shop with chocolate fountain, were fun to look at.
Didn't gamble here, but the casino looked serviceable.

Central to everything, the Bellagio hotel made arriving at every stop while in town a cinch. The cab stand outside ran quickly and efficiently. It seems they aren't very Uber-friendly given they make it a little tougher to order one without having to walk forever to find it. 

The water fountain show is grand and magical. 

The lobby and public areas were pretty spotless considering the amount of crazy foot traffic this hotel gets. You can always spot employees cleaning up at all hours of the day. The same goes for their lobby bathrooms. 

I stayed at one of the Spa Tower rooms and enjoyed the space, storage, shower, and outlet availability. Our room had a mountain and pool view; it was especially nice at sunset. The window treatments worked via wall switches. I never knew I needed that in my life. Ha! A nice added touch. Their AC power and water pressure were on point. I can't even begin to imagine what it takes to run that beast of a hotel. Impressive. Checking out online made the departure relatively painless.

Having easier access to favorites Le Cirque and O is a nice perk (reviewed separately). I didn't have enough time, but I would have loved to visit the Michael Mina restaurant too. Additionally, the Jean Philippe Patisserie has all sorts of sinful bites for breakfast or snack. I suggest going Sunday morning when all of Vegas is asleep from too much Saturday fun. ;) 

The hotel conveniently connects to Caesars Palace.

THE BAD 

Although technically speaking the Bellagio is not the largest hotel in Las Vegas, something about the layout makes it feel like it. I've stayed at the Venetian and walked through endless lobbies while there and have never felt this claustrophobic. To put it simply, it's a f'ing zoo within the already existing Vegas pandemonium. I know it shouldn't come as a surprise, but I still found it overwhelming. One second I'm walking out of my peaceful room and the next...boom! People everywhere: a complete cluster-f*ck. There was security by the elevators at least, but that also meant sometimes there was an additional wait just to get to the room. You know, after walking a mile from the lobby to that point. 

Checking in was a nightmare. I thought joining M Life Rewards would expedite the process, but it did not- despite even ""checking in"" online the night before. The front desk staff couldn't be bothered to step out of their script to personalize service. Just one more person to robotically check in. My questions were answered with the same rehearsed lines and a painted smirk\/smile. The lines are painfully long. Wear your patience hat. I forgot mine. 

The mattress in our room was quicksand. It swallowed us whole no matter how many times we rotated. The pillows were equally flimsy. I slept on two at once in a failed attempt to puff them up. 

BEWARE of the mini bar rules. Everything is displayed out in the open. Removing ANYTHING (meaning just lifting it off the shelf) adds the charge to the room. My husband took two bottles of Fiji water and put them on our nightstands. We left them untouched while we searched for the price list (which is ONLY available if you turn your TV on). When the bellhop came in with our bags, we asked him about it. I didn't know if to laugh or throw something when he said we were probably just charged $36 for the two bottles. That's $18 EACH. It's not even about the amount. On principle alone, I will NOT pay that for water! I called downstairs and had them credit it back. The same bottle poolside is $8, still a rip-off, but more in line with usual inflated hotel prices.  

Speaking of the pool, available umbrellas are hard to come by. Even if you do luck out and get one, know they are stationary. If you don't time the sun location just right (because everyone carries a chart that tells you just when and where to sit, right?), you will be left fully exposed despite being the proud owner of that nice umbrella. I'm not being petty. This is Las Vegas in June. and a big deal when you consider temperatures peaked at 113 the weekend I visited.

Never again. Next!",8,4,5

I can't get into the details of what happened, because the service that was provided to me is NOT common practice at Bellagio or other hotels and I don't want any unfair expectations being put on them. What happened with me was a one-time occurrence and I was just very fortunate to deal with such wonderful people who took mercy on me. 

So....to KIM AND JESSE IN SECURITY.... thank you SO MUCH for helping me!! You guys saved me from extreme hardship and I can't be more grateful or thankful for you. Jesse, you are the best and I really appreciate what you did. Also, to Kim's and Jesse's bosses: THANK YOU!!!  Thank you for making a one time exception. Your compassion and understanding saved me so much.

Also, I'd like to add, that what they did for me happened AFTER I'd checked out of and left their hotel. This hotel is unbelievable in their Class, Customer Service and compassion. I've always chosen to stay at Bellagio when I go to Vegas, and they have gained my loyalty for life.

The Bellagio is leagues above the other hotels in Vegas. I've stayed there countless times and continue to be impressed by them: by their wonderful restaurants, beautiful rooms and amenities, and excellent Customer Service. But this time, they went way above and beyond the call of duty to help me out and I will always remember and be grateful.

If someone could fwd this to the Security Dept, I 'd really appreciate it. 

Don't stay anywhere else...Bellagio is a Five Star Hotel in every sense of the term.

I checked in a little after 3pm. Check in was easy although very long lines. I didn't experience any snobby front desk agents like other reviewers. The lady who assisted me in check in was courteous, sweet and accommodating. 

FYI: You do pay the resort fee at check-in (which went up before my stay on march 11th). The resort fee as of that day was $39.00 plus taxes and fees which totaled $44.22 per day. In addition to this fee you must pay a deposit for incidental which they will refund at the end of your stay and that can be anywhere from $200 plus. This will appear on your credit card as a charge but again they do refund (in my case I got my funds back 48 hours after check-out.

I was placed on the 10th floor and my room was clean and spacious. This is a no view room. The bathroom was definitely my favorite. I love the glass stand up shower and the bathtub definitely came in handy on my trip. We had enough clean towels and was given new towels daily by housekeepers. 

Room-service was also pretty good. We had a lazy afternoon and didn't feel like doing much so the Bellagio in-room dining service came in handy. You have the option of having it charge to your room, paying directly with credit card or cash when the food arrived. I ordered the Bellagio prime burger with french fries and my sister ordered the Chicken Alfredo. The meal comes with a complimentary basket of bread and the sodas were $6.00 each, which was a rip off for the amount we got but the Bellagio is quite over-priced in certain things.

Overall, my stay here was phenomenal. The Bellagio fountains is a must see, the garden inside is beautiful, the casino was nice, the bank night club was good and popping and the staff was all courteous and showed great customer service. I would definitely stay here again when in Vegas!",7,0,3

The rooms are small and smell like cigarettes even though we had a non-smoking room.  The amenities are old and unkempt. We had to pay for parking which was also annoying, as you don't have to at the other resorts.  In addition, the daily resort fee is quite high, especially when you are already paying $300 a night for a small subpar room.  It is just a poorly kept property.  The Bellagio has lost its glamour.

Bellagio is situated right in the middle of the strip, convenient to everything. Next door is the new Cosmopolitan Hotel, which ranks as runner up favorite hotel on the strip. Bellagio features Cirque du Soleil's: ""O"" in my opinion ranks as the best of the three Cirque shows I have seen. 

Las Vegas is known for its fine dining and Bellagio is no exception. Even the Buffet at the Bellagio outdoes the rest. The hotel features 5 Fine Dining Options (a great assortment of Seafood, French, Chinese, Spanish, and a Steakhouse) as well as 6 other midlevel restaurants, and even more casual dining options. There is truly something to satisfy even the pickiest of eaters at the Bellagio. Yelp rates both Picasso (French\/Spanish) and Le Cirque (French) as 4.5\/5 stars.

If you aren't a high roller or you are finished with playing the tables, there is lot's more to see still at the Bellagio. There are the unforgettable fountains, Botanical Gardens, Art Galleries and an enchanting blown glass ceiling by famous Artist, Dale Chihuly. Shopping consists of 7 high end shops and boutiques. And Bellagio's hot nightclub The Bank features 8,000 sq. feet and VIP rooms to accommodate up to 75 guests.

Can't afford to stay at Bellagio? Stay next door at Caesars or across the street at Bally's. Bally's connects with Paris, another great hotel to explore on the strip.

Let me me start by saying I've been to Vegas multiple times in the past and have always wanted to stay at the Bellagio! It just exudes class and is breathtakingly beautiful! I made my reservation about 3 weeks before our trip and just book a regular room. After contacting the guest concierge, we received a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe fountain view room since it was my birthday and my husband's first time in Vegas! I thought that was very sweet!

We arrived late in the evening and there was no line for check-in! I believe we waited less than 5 minutes...I did see how long the lines do get during the day so i guess we just got lucky! Our room wasn't very far from the main desk. After reading so many reviews, I was expecting to walk a mile to our room! It wasn't more than 5 min from the main desk. 

Our room was spectacular! Literally a million dollar view of Vegas! We were on the 28th floor of the main building and had a view of the fountains, all of the hotels and a view of the mountains in the back! We will never forget the view! Our room was spotless! Lots of (overpriced) goodies in the mini fridge and snacks right below the TV. The closet had a couple of robes! The bathroom was huge! Loved it! The bed was super soft and so comfortable! The windows even had a automatic open\/close feature which i thought was a nice touch! Our room was always cleaned promptly! On our second night, I received a complimentary chocolate truffle amenity which was such a wonderful surprise! We couldn't really hear any outside noise (not sure if people were staying the rooms beside us) but I thought that was nice! Although, we could hear people talking as they were walking by our door! 

This hotel is HUGE and it definitely lives up to its name! It has a lot of high end shops if you are interested in spending $$$ and is in the heart of the strip! There are also lots of restaurants and the conservatory is beautiful as well. Since this hotel is so iconic, it's quite busy and there is always lots of people walking around! The pool is beautiful and I wish I had enough time to spend there but there was just so much to do and see! I'm not a big coffee\/tea drinker so I didn't mind that there wasn't a coffee maker in the room. There are multiple cafes downstairs and I lost count of how many Starbucks I saw near this hotel.

This is definitely a romantic hotel and it's perfect for couples! A very special thank you to Michelle S. and Chaz P. for going above and beyond to make my birthday very special! The staff are extremely nice and very friendly! I wish I could give the hotel 10 stars! It lived up to every expectation I had, and then some! We were very spoiled while staying here and i cannot imagine staying anywhere else! My husband and I cannot wait to come back! 

Tips:
 - There is a standard $35\/day resort fee. 
 - On top of the resort fee, there was a $130\/DAY (yes, PER DAY) incidentals charge that they will put on your card until you check out. This wasn't a problem for us but might be for others if you are on a budget and wasn't expecting extra charges.
 - Security is very high here. You will need to present your key to security before entering the elevators to go to your room and also to the pool.. (I thought this was nice since I didn't see any other hotels do this)
 - They have a business center in between the check-in desk and guest concierge which is perfect to print your boarding passes or anything else you need!

I have been a dedicated customer and fan of the Bellagio for many years. I have always thought they showed  class, service, and value that many hotels on the strip did not provide. However, my most recent stay disappointed me for many reasons - i will mention them as i  write a detailed review of my entire stay below:

The service:
Highly disappointed - While many aspects of the staff and service of this hotel was great as usual, there were a number of events that stood out and really made my stay very unsatisfying:
1) upon check-out, i wanted to store my luggage with the bell desk b\/c my flight was not set to take off until 6pm. I did not have small bills to tip the bell boy and needed the bigger bills for the cab. I thought i could make it up by tipping them again when i picked up the luggage at the end of the day. The bell boy reiterated upon receiving my luggage that he would not be here later that day and that someone else will be serving me in an obvious tone that was implying i needed to tip him. He also stood there quietly, for several seconds waiting for me to tip him. I felt uncomfortable and awkward and was forced to use what little cash i had on hand for him. This should not be the mentality of an employee of a five-star hotel!
2) Update: I emailed the establishment of this complaint and all i got was an apology letter and that's it. No further follow-up, no nothing. 
3) The room: it was nice. The room is fairly large and the furniture and what not was well-kept and modern. The bathroom is large with two sinks, a separate shower, and a separate tub. I found all the amenities i needed in my bathroom. There was also a robe, iron, and safe. 

In all, Bellagio embodies the nature of today's Vegas: a high-class surface masking the old, crude, low-class mentality that has always existed.",4,1,1

Lots of restaurants, decent size casino, great shops, pretty pool area, amazing decor that changes seasonally. Only thing is that I wish they had at least one restaurant that had cheaper choices. Even their cafe was really expensive, when you'd think a cafe would be on the cheaper side. The service was great, and the rooms are really nice and well equipped. My big complaint is that they didn't provide a fridge, only a mini bar fridge that has weight sensors so you can't move anything around because you'll get charged if you pick anything up. So if you want to store things that require refrigeration, you can have them put a mini fridge in your room for an extra $35 a day. No thank you!

One time I was there with 3 girlfriends and we were at a blackjack table during the wee hours of the morning.

Bathroom was clean and room was spacious. So it was nice and in the evening my friends arrived and a parties like ore partied (no one called complaint on us unlike they do in encore).

This was my first Vegas trip, his third. I do A LOT of research before I book trips anywhere. Some may say that where you stay in Vegas doesn't matter, because you likely won't end up being in your room a lot or at that hotel a lot. Well, in Vegas, the major hotels that you stay at are where you will in fact spend a lot of time. These hotels have many restaurant, large casinos, pools, bars, pool bars, shops, etc. So that's why when I looked into different hotels, I looked for a place with good reviews on all components of the hotel for a fair price. My boyfriend had also given me some insight since he had already stayed at the MGM and the Palms in rooms that were comped thanks to his dad, but said they weren't anything remarkable. Bellagio had the best reviews for my budget, and I couldn't agree more. I booked a fountain view room. I only found out about a month out from the trip that the standard king bed fountain view I picked was in a separate tower with actually only a partial view of the Bellagio fountains. I upgraded the room to a deluxe fountain view king room. Thank goodness because we ended up getting a room with a remarkable view. The room was perfect for a couple. For me, being able to go back to a luxurious room is quintessential to a vacation, so that's another reason why I picked the Bellagio and why I'm happy I did. The room and bathroom were large. The bed very comfy. The decor, lavish. Housekeeping kept it very clean as well. 
The hotel itself is perfectly located on the middle of the strip and right in front of the Bellagio fountains that have beautiful shows through the day and night. The lobby is magnificent. From the moment you step out of the cab, you're greeted and all staff is eager to help. The lobby is grand and decorated very uniquely. Our check in was technically at 3, but we were able to get a room at 10 am (partially due to the fact that we had come on a Tuesday). The casino is HUGE and very well lit. We walked to about 7 other casinos during our stay, and I was highly disappointed in how poorly lit they were on top of the dark materials used to make up the floors, walls and ceilings. The Bellagio is made up of lighter colors. It makes the place feel a lot more welcoming. Additionally, the lay out, although big, is very easy to navigate. 
The pool area is jaw dropping. 
The staff keeps pretty good security measures. For instance, before you enter the pool area or go to the elevators to get to your room, you have to show your room key. 
Room service, the concierge, etc all work fast and efficiently and are very pleasant. 
Although prices are a little high, I believe that is a vegas thing. So, just be prepared to spend money for things like room service. 
We spent a lot of time in the casino. The dealers are very friendly and fun, as well as the other vacationers that come to the Bellagio casino. We also spent a fair amount of time in the poker room. The poker room at the Bellagio is by far the nicest I saw. We also got to see some big name faces, such as Doyle Brunson. The wait can be long sometimes, especially at night time, and especially for standard buy in of 1-3 Texas Hold 'Em, but once you sit down, you're bound to have a good time! 
Over all, very VERY happy with the Bellagio. It's a BEAUTIFUL hotel and casino resort located on the middle of the strip right in front of its own lake with its own fountain shows. The place is so lavish it makes you forget you're actually in a hot and dry desert. 
Aside from room service, the deluxe fountain view room with a king bed, a large bathroom with a glass stand up shower and a separate  tub for four days and three nights (all room rates, resort fees, taxes included) cost me about $741---not a bad price whatsoever. 
So if you plan on staying in Vegas, and want a lot of bank for your buck, and want to stay in a lovely hotel And casino, definitely consider the Bellagio. I had zero complaints.",2,0,0

I had a nice time staying here with my boyfriend. We had a very nice room with a massive king bed and the room itself was clean and pristine. I didn't really like the sheets they used on the bed though because they were a bit scratchy for some reason. The big TV was legit and the bathroom was very pretty. However the toilet always flushed with such force that it scared me every time I flushed it lol The shower was a bit small and the shampoo smelled like citrus which wasn't my favorite but it did the job. 

Checking in was craziness since there were so many people at registration, but the employees working the desk were great and had us checked in in no time. The casino is very nice and I had a good time playing some blackjack for an hour or so (first time gambling!!) The pool was okay, I wish that they had a deeper pool because everything was 3.5 feet which made it feel like we were wading. The restaurants at the Bellagio were pretty legit though so that was fun, especially the Cafe in the Conservatory.

My partner and I booked many months in advance, as we were getting married and also honeymooning in Vegas. Our travel agent emailed the Bellagio to suggest a complimentary upgrade. When we arrived, not only were we not upgraded, but we were downgraded from our originally booked King Room, to a Double Queen, even though it was a Sunday evening. When we were informed of our downgrade, I suggested that we at least be moved to a fountain view room, but we were advised that that would be an extra cost.

Our Double Queen room was most outdated, and quite small. Although the bathroom was quite spacious and nice, the shower was also lovely and big. 
However, we were not happy with the sound of (what we assumed was) clanking pipes throughout our stay. It almost sounded as if we were staying underneath a gym and heavy weights were being dropped on the the ceiling above us.

On checkout we complained about the noisy room, and we were refunded one days breakfast at the buffet. The gesture was appreciated, but doesn't quite make up for our disappointing stay.

On a positive note, the foyer was nice, and the flowers were lovely of course.

We paid a decent price for a great room via hotels.com. It was around $170 per night with a view of the Strip (rather than a view of the fountains, or no view at all). Still pricey, but you'd pay much more for something comparable in virtually any other city. 

Check-in was a little slow - it gets busy. There was also no sign of the mobile check-in that some of us had signed up to use. But once we got to the front of the line they were pretty quick. The room and charges were described but they didn't tell us how to get on the wifi. They also underplayed how far the walk would be to our room, so we kept wondering if we were headed in the right direction.

Our room was kind of out of the way in the spa tower, which was quite a long walk from the front entrance, past the parking and some of the restaurants and spa. Overall, though, that turned out to be a good thing because the elevators didn't lead directly into the casino. Some family stayed in the other tower with fountain view rooms and they all commented that their rooms were too warm.

Back over in the spa tower, the room was large and clean with a desk and two comfortable sitting chairs. The a\/c worked fine, and the electric drapes were a nice touch, and useful, especially for the location. The bathroom was palatial with his and hers sinks, a great, very deep bathtub, and large shower. The wifi is serviceable for email and light browsing but I ended up using my mobile data most of the time.

The cleaning staff were really efficient. A couple of times they managed to get in and out of our room even when we'd only left for an hour or so in the afternoon and everything was clean and tidy on our return.

My only complaints were the pillows - super flat, which always gives me a cricked neck - even after being plumped, and the in-room snacks.

Let's start with check-in.  They had everything absolutely perfect.  They knew I had paid for the room through Delta Vacations and had charged the upgrade directly from them.  Great start!

The room.  Oh, the room!  When I made the upgrade with Bellagio, they moved us up to  the 25th floor with a lake view.  The bathroom was exquisite with it's marble foyer and bath.  The bed was so comfortable!  My only recommendation is that they add a floor-length mirror in the foyer like at the Aria.  I know they have the mirrors in the armoir, but the doors don't open as far as I'd like to be able to see myself without holding the door--minor criticism to say the least.

The hotel staff were all wonderfully polite and accommodating.  Housekeeping comes by twice a day, and they greet you whenever they see you in the hallway.  Even the maintenance staff greeted us in the hallway!  The first morning we woke up late and saw that we had a message from housekeeping saying they weren't able to service our room because of our privacy hanger.  After we called them back, they said they'd be more than happy to service the room.  So nice!

The hotel has great restaurants, exquisite decorations, feng shui casino, and they have the Cirque du Soleil, ""O"" theatre!  The only thing lacking really are a couple cheap places where you can grab a quick bite.  We made up for that by taking the tram to City Center for that though.  

Another great example of how accommodating this place is my friend wanted to see a fountain show featuring Celine Dion.  He ended up calling the concierge who called someone to verify if and when the next Dion song would be.  Unfortunately she informed him that they would not be playing the song for the next two days, but to our surprise, the very next show was ""My Heart will Go On"". 

A second example is when we checked-out.  They said we had had some pretzels, but we didn't.  They immediately took care of the issue for us.  Furthermore, check out is at noon.  We didn't check out until 2pm, and they didn't bring it up as an issue.

If you're looking for a great hotel in Vegas on the Strip, you need to come to Bellagio.  I was extremely pleased with everything here, which was a surprise even to me.",1,0,0

I wrote down: centrally located, good food, excellent customer service, entertainment & shops, and filtered air (I cannot stand smokey casinos where the smoke permeates the walls and carpets-I feel like I smell like an ashtray afterwards).  When I entered the casino smells of flowers wafted through the air from their show stopping seasonal display.  They have at least ten lines to improve efficiency in check in\/check outs. I love all of the restaurants: Noodles- a quick stop for lunch, Fix-trendy dining, Sensi- fusion, Michael Mina & Picasso (both outstanding) and the buffet ain't bad either.  One of my non negotiables is stopping at the Jean Philippe Chocolate fountain. If you are lucky enough to get a fountain view room it is absolutely worth it! There is really nothing like it, it's beautiful by day and even more gorgeous at night- truly a Las Vegas landmark. Yes, I know it's an older casino and a little dated.

We are Vegas regulars, hardcore gamblers, and Platinum M-Club members. I can't believe I have to write a bad review about the Bellagio. I don't want to, but I'm shocked at the poor customer service we've experienced here. Lori, to clarify, please check your records but there was a scheduled water outage on 1\/3 between 2am-4am that we were not notified about. We were gambling all night, came back to the room, and there was NO running water. When Michael called to inform the front desk that we did not have running water, the staff member that helped him did NOT help him. She simply stated matter-of-factly, ""yes, you will have water again after 4am."" 

This is absolutely unacceptable. We asked for more details and were told our entire floor had no running water for 2 hours. I had to ask for a solution -- we were checking out the next morning and had flights to catch. We're not going to sleep dirty. We were offered (Option A) of peeing\/showering\/etc. in another room and staying in our own room or (B) packing up and moving altogether. Well, it's 3am at this point, we're tired, but we pack because it's ludicrous to expect a guest to jump between floors to use the restroom. 

Basic Customer Service 101, when a huge inconvenience happens, management usually tries to satisfy the customer. But since our room was comped for this particular night, we were told ""nothing could be done."" I mean, really? Our rooms are comped because we spend ridiculous amounts of money at your hotel and casino. The staff member could have followed up with management, or anything, to address the inconvenience. After expressing our frustrations, we were offered $50 in-room dining credit, even though we were leaving super early the next day.

Michael takes the time to write a Yelp review of his experience and Lori responds with information that is completely UNTRUE. Michael ALSO took time to write the hotel directly and DID NOT receive a response from the Bellagio.

I really, really cannot understand how this could happen -- and to say that I'm disappointed with this experience is an understatement. It's unfortunate that a hotel with such a great location AND reputation cannot address customer service issues directly. Here are the various time points in which we could have been treated better: (A) a notice that the outage was occurring ahead of time, (b) an apology for not notifying us that the outage had occurred, (c) spontaneously offering options for running water, without being asked for a solution by the customers, (d) spontaneously offering some sort of compensation or credit for the inconvenience (we did pay for part of our visit), (e) offering to follow-up with a supervisor about our concerns, and (f) following up with Michael's review with accurate facts about what had happened.

I hate to play the ""well, we are Platinum status members"" card because ALL customers should be treated as valuable, but the truth is, this is Vegas. If this is how you are treating your guests, well, we will be taking our business elsewhere.",6,0,0

The public areas are absolutely stunning and warrant a visit even if you aren't staying here.

The ventilation was pretty good as well, and even my smoke-hating grandmother wasn't bothered very much.  However, if you can't tolerate smoking, Vegas in general probably isn't the right place for you.

I was totally impressed at how warm and friendly every single person working there was.  From the maids to the security guards, everybody had a warm smile friendly demeanor.  The rooms were beautiful, though I was a bit surprised at the low quality of the toiletries.  Most of the restaurants and food outlets are very pricey (think $5 muffins and $7 gelato).

- Service at the pool
- Friendliness of the bell guys
- Food and service at Olives restaurant
- Automatic curtains

Minuses: 

- Front desk lady acted offended when I told her we'd like an updated room at check in after friends said they had stayed in one that was not. ""ALL of our rooms are updated!"" Then (pretty sure same lady) told our other friends at check in she could upgrade them to a more updated room...
- Hairs (yes those kind) in the tub upon arrival to our room
- On that note, our bedroom was nice, but the bathroom was super ugly. LOTS of mismatched marble with super busy wall paper and the tub and toilet were a gross dark yellow color. Pretty sure that the bathrooms haven't been updated in quite some time. 
- Kleenex and toilet paper were incredibly cheap (rough - super thin), is this Walmart or what is supposed to be a nice hotel? 
- The cleaning ladies were so loud - yelling down the hall, that they woke me up and it kept going on long enough that I went out to ask them to please be quiet. She apologized but not in a sincere way and then it was just softer yelling
- We got a cabana at the pool and that thing was FILTHY!!!!! I mean really, really disgusting. Like years of dirt. We bought it for my friends who flew in for my bday and I was praying they wouldn't open any of the cupboards and be grossed out like I was.
- For the cabana, which was $500, not only did they charge us 20% tip for the food and beverage (which is understandable), they CHARGED GRATUITY ON THE $500 FOR THE CABANA!!!! WHAT?!?! If you want to charge $635 for the cabana, charge $635, don't be a**holes and try to slide $135 into the gratuity. 
- We told them at check-in we were there to celebrate my bday and had gotten 8 people to stay at The Bellagio to celebrate. I have to admit, I did expect a little box of chocolates or bottle of champagne, but nada. Even mid-range hotels do this consistently. 
- The gardens. I have walked through The Bellagio before and been really impressed. This time it was like the set from a bad horror movie. They were trying to do a Halloween\/Fall theme and clearly spent a lot of money on it but it was just so ostentatious. 
- I had an good bagel one morning from the Cafe by the pool downstairs, but the next morning at the same place the bagel was super small and cheap and burnt to a crisp. I can't believe someone working there thought it was ok to serve! Too bad it was served in a bag and I didn't want to deal with the line again so I didn't go back. 
- The hotel just feels outdated. I'm guessing their bookings are going down. Because of all this and the sense that whomever is running this place is like 90 years old and just isn't quite with it, I won't stay here again. My group of friends wasn't impressed either.",0,0,0

I had a dream that someday, I'd give up my life here in SoCal.  I had a dream that I'd travel to the far reaches of Nevada and pursue my dreams of becoming a professional poker player.  I'd make big bucks from winning championship after championship.

Always, this dream ended with me taking up permanent residence at the Bellagio.  Always.  Did I mention the word: permanent?  Yes, I think I must've mentioned it.

Aside from being flat-out gorgeous, the service is top notch.  Yes, in Vegas, you'll feel like a VIP almost anywhere.  But what hotel actually caters to a green, naive 21-year-old as if she were the most famous socialite in the world?  Only Bellagio.

The rooms are simply elegant, with every pleasure and convenience you can dream up.  You will truly feel like a princess, I kid you not.

The rooms are fantastic, the service is fantastic, the actual hotel itself is fantastic - is there more?  Of course!  The food!  Bellagio has some of the best food I've had in the Vegas area, and again, the service is impeccable.  Their servers can even make chow mein and saimin seem like elegant delicacies, the way they carry on serving you. Shoot, i could probably order a street taco and it'd come with a gold-plated mini-spoon and monogrammed napkins.  Who knows.

Is there more?  Yes, of course!

True Vegas lovers do not go to Vegas for the shows, the hotels, the restaurants, or the nightlife - True Vegas Lovers go to Vegas to gamble.

All I have to say is... the dealers are all incredibly friendly and classy, some are also incredibly funny, and best of all, I feel like it's my lucky casino (so I always save it for last on my casino crawls).  Winner, winner, chicken dinner, bitches!

Oh, and it helps that, as Bellagio caters to a slightly higher-end clientele, the people who are playing cards with you are either (a) familiar with the rules of the game, or (b) well-mannered and fun to play with.  I hate playing with people with uncivilized tourists with bad attitudes. Blech!

But only IF.  For a place to sleep, you have better or less expensive choices.  See what kind of deal you can get at Aria.

The rooms are only four star by any standard.  Recent upgrades have addressed the TV and bathroom issues, but the building still is 15 years old.  You can get more opulent and modern rooms at Aria, for example.

The common areas are five stars, led by the incomparable fountain display and the conservatory.  These are among top five attractions in Las Vegas.  Also note the Chihuly glass flower canopy in the lobby.  

The buffet is the #1 buffet in Las Vegas, and the holiday dinner buffets are particularly fine.  Breakfast is a great value too (but not weekend brunch).  The rest of the dining establishments are good but not good enough for their cost.  A possible exception is Picasso, which, at $150-$200 a person, might still be considered worthwhile.

Service is generally very good to excellent, although at busy times there is sometimes a wait to check in.  This seems to be true everywhere in Las Vegas.  When well trained employees are hassled, they tend to act hassled, although at least at Bellagio the smiles usually remain, if somewhat frozen.

Here are a few tips:
1.  Make sure you get a room in the main tower.  A good fountain view (from at least the 20th floor) may be your preference the first time you stay here, but it will be noisy.  You will hear the fountain shows every 15-30 minutes until midnight.  A pool view is quieter.
2.  If you gamble, be sure to get a Player's Card and use it.  After a relatively modest amount of gambling in any year, you will get upgraded from the lowest (Sapphire) status and important percs become available -- such as line passes to the buffet and coffee shop.
3.  Jean Phillipe's is a good place for breakfast and lunch, and the bakery desserts are worth the price.  Make sure you ask them to grill the Paninis.  Some of the packaged products are expensive even for the Bellagio.
4.  Eat at the buffet or coffee shop (Picasso for a real splurge).
5.  See ""O"".  Make you reservations way ahead of time.  It is that good.  I have seen virtually every show in Las Vegas, and ""O"" is #1.  [Here's an odd note -- of the many Cirque de Soleil shows in Las Vegas, the shorter the name, the better the show.  ""O"" is the best, followed closely by ""Ka"", etc.  Forget about ""Zumanity"".]",4,0,0

We found the sticky stuff first, and asked for housekeeping to come in and clean the sticky mess. Unfortunately, even after 2.5 hours, nobody showed up. As it was already 1 AM, we decided to clean it ourselves. Then, we found the food crumbs and the sparkles all over the bed sheets and covers. When we asked for a room change, we were given a room that already had an occupant. We opened the door with out key, only to find the safety lock had been put in place. Thinking it was a mistake, we slammed the door shut and somehow managed to open the door, to the absolute horror of the man who had been peacefully asleep. The shock and terror in his voice is something that would most likely linger for a while. By this time, we demanded to see the manager, but were sent a desk attendant instead. When we went to our third room, we found a used cable tie on one of the beds and food crumbs, yet again, on the carpets and sofas. At this point, we refused to leave the room until we spoke with the manager. Our fourth and final room also had tape on the lavatory sink and taps and food crumbs on the floor, yet again. However, seeing that it was already 4 AM, we decided to stay.
This isn't the first time we stayed at the Bellagio. We try to stay at the Bellagio whenever we visit Las Vegas for work. Though this is the first time we've experienced anything this egregious and frustrating, we do not intend on staying here ever again. We'd recommend the Wynn or the Mandarin Oriental.",0,0,0

You pass by the fountain watching its spender, wander through the casino, the ""O"" theater, the retail shops, it all just feels so great. So the lodging experience has to be even better right? 

Nope, keep walking. When do you realize this? It all starts with the check in experience. High brow hotel? High brow service? Nope, get in one of the random lines and pray you will get checked in. No one to direct you to an attendant, no one to organize the guests, just kinda figure out if you are in the ""right line"". In my opinion, not a good start, but I was still looking forward to relaxing in the room. 

From there, while the room was nicely appointed, once you look past the glitter, it is just a basic room. Mine came with a slow running sink and well used towels. Not my idea of a 5 star hotel. 

Clearly the big plus is the location, but that has a bit of a downside too. I found getting in and out of the hotel parking area was problematic because of the foot traffic on the Blvd. Big glitter, big hotel and I would stop at big disappointment, but clearly a disappointment.",4,2,2

It was a bit hard to feel welcome pushing past bodies after bodies to get to the elevator. The suite we stayed at is absolutely breathtaking. We had a living room, three bedrooms, and four bathrooms; it was quite spacious. The furnitures are impeccable and the decor have a warm feeling. The pools surprisingly were not crowded and there were a lot of chaise available for lounging and sunbathing.

The employee at check in (wish I would've gotten his name) was so personal and friendly. We received an upgraded fountain view room, and the view took our breath away! The fountains are one of the best shows in Vegas without a doubt. The breakfast at the Pool Cafe was superb, and portions were huge! So much so that we actually were able to split an entree on the second day and have plenty of food for the both of us. The pools were fantastic, and the cocktail waitresses at the pool were very friendly and accommodating. We were able to take in a couple of shows, have amazing food, and gamble a little. I loved the new fall display in the lobby... Beautiful arrangement of flowers! Great getaway for a couple of days! I appreciate this higher end hotel and we will definitely be back. 

The only downsides to this hotel are basically what I hate about Vegas in general... But they come with the territory. The smoke in the lobby in the casino area is atrocious! My allergies are horrible, so I just avoided the area as much as possible. The fresh air at the pool sort of made up for this. In addition, the extreme prices of basic things such as $10 for a bottle of Figi water, $90 that we spent on breakfast the first day, $15 for a small cocktail at the pool, and $5 for a vending machine soda were a little rediculous. This hotel will quickly thin your wallet. However, this is the case with most Vegas hotels. You take the bad with the great, stay for a couple of days, and hopefully spend most of the day at the pool :)",0,0,0

The benefits under this program are as follows:
Noon check in and upgrade room when available
Daily breakfast for 2
$100 property credit to be used during stay
Guaranteed 4pm late check out

At check-in I asked for fountain view room upgrade
Bellagio check in attendant Christy replied ""Did you book for the room? You have to book for the room"".  What she should have said was ""Let me see what I can do""  

Then she said ""I am offering you 4pm late check out"", 
At this point I get very annoyed and think that Excuse me?! I paid for my late check out with my platinum card fees""

She did assign me to a fountain view room at Spa Tower Room 16-606.  Note 16-606 is over looking parking garage and fountain view is partial almost non existent. Did I mention the moldy smell associated with the room? It smell so bad.
I called front desk and asked for room change as this was a total insult to me, mind you this is a long walk all the way down the hall from elevator.   I then got re-assign to 26-624 but this room the switch plates had turned yellow and the tub had rusts on them.  Both of these room to me do not worth $250 per night.  

The best part comes when I found out my dining reservation at Le Cirque wouldn't be honored under that $100 property credit.  The benefit that has the most value for my buck is property credit and that wasn't going to be granted.  

At this point I asked for management intervention.  The manager Robin is nice enough to resolve the issue but who wants to constantly have any heated conversation on their vacation.

Guess what I checked out at 9am and chose not to have breakfast because I was so dissatisfied with their room and services.   Then the valet didn't even help with my luggage took the tips and walked away.  5 star\/diamond hotel really?!

Conclusion:
1.  Don't book for resort room.  Bellagio will assign you to spa tower, these rooms Bellagio comp their frequent gambler free nights.  These rooms should never be sold at the same price as the main tower.  Unless you like Vintage rooms that you have to switch every lamp on and every single light.

2.  Even if you book deluxe room there is no guarantee that you will not be assign to spa tower.

3.  I thought I would be special under American Express Platinum FHR program but I was so wrong.  Maybe I expected Bellagio to perform the same as Wynn.  

4.  Prior to my stay at Bellagio I stayed at Wynn under the same program, I was treated like queen and had the best time ever.  There are so much competition on the strip and they fail so miserably to keep me as a customer.  

I totally agree with other Yelpers who said come visit the fountain, the garden and or eat at the fine dining restaurants but DO NOT stay in their rooms.",11,5,2

I'm giving them a 3 for a number or reasons I realize not everyone's experience won't be the same. 

Pros:
1. The woman at the concierge desk was so extremely nice she blew me away she made sure Greg & I were well taken care of at the restaurant FIX & she told us all of her favorite things to eat. Also the woman who checked us into the hotel was very sweet & I could tell wanted to impress us. 

2.  FIX the restaurant was absolutely delicious! I highly recommend going there for dinner & getting the tacos & the fried Mac & cheese so so good. They were prompt with service & the waitress even placed our napkins in our laps which I found odd but still it is a very high class place. 

3. The sweet woman in the shop across from the elevators. She was so sweet & exhausted but she helped us & even chatted it up with us for a little while. 

4. Gorgeous downstairs & for the most part everyone that worked there was nice & said good morning or hello when you crossed their path. 

Cons:
1. We got there early so I didn't expect a room to be ready right away & was told that they'd text us when our room was ready. We arrived at 7am & still didn't get a text by 12:30pm which sucked cause we still had to get ready for the event we had planned at 2pm we also had a drive ahead of us & didn't know what the traffic would be like. So we called to check to see if the room was done or if another one like the one booked was available yet. Well the room wasn't ready it was suppose to have a garden\/pool view we asked if another one exactly like it was ready otherwise we'd still wait. They switched us to another one which I assume was suppose to be like it I could be wrong but they told us to go up to that room after almost getting to the elevators they called to say go to the front desk for new keys to activate. We got to the desk & the new lady was pretty rude we told her what happened she got all pissy & said ""who are you? Let me see your ID."" My husband gave it to her and she then looked up the room she said ""it isn't even listed on here so I'll have to give you something else like it."" She gave us the new card keys & we headed up to the room. It was pretty lame we got a king size bed but there was nothing special about the room or the view we got a view of the freeway definitely a downgrade from the garden\/pool view. The tub & pillows are nice though.

2. After a long day at the Vegas speedway we wanted to take a nap & refresh our batteries for the night out, we were on our way up to our room when we were stopped at the elevator entrance by someone that worked there he yelled ""um excuse me you two! Room keys?"" I wouldn't have minded him saying this but since we were the only ones he stopped to see the room keys it was rude & I didn't appreciate the look or tone of voice he gave us. I'm not sure if he was having a crappy day or didn't want to be there.

  My husband was asked for feedback by hotel, yet has not been offered reconsiliation. This was a surprise from my husband. Great time on the grounds (bit overcrowded tho), the restaurants, the view that my husband paid the upsell fee for was wonderful. 
 However, The room had not been cleaned. This was not the obvious not cleaned room either. This was the get in bed and go to sleep to discover a smell of analgesic rubbing cream emanating from the sheets. We discovered this around 3am. No problem - have housekeeping take care of it. 
    We had had a long night. So no prob- fresh sheets. Until we went back to bed, fell asleep.. smell still there. The medicated ointment had permeated in to the mattress.
 The efficiency and professionalism of staff severely lacking. 
 The attitude and tone of the guest services staff was confrontational, unsympathetic and unapologetic. Literally had to request from their employees a verbal apology. This was not only a tremendous inconvenience to us and a great disappointment but also raised concerns for the exposure to the biologics present in the room. We were mouth wideopen flabbergasted!!
  The only staff member of the hotel that recognized the grave implications of the state of the bedding was the actual room attendant. The supervisor of housekeeping offered 2 pieces of chocolate. Refused to perform a sniff test of the mattress, however, did proceed to cough mouth uncovered in our enclosed space. Anxiety levels were through the roof as we waited door opened for Maintenance to replace the mattress. Who had their own set of issues as they delivered the wrong mattress to us.
   The Supervisor of Housekeeping offered up a spot clean of the room after a convo between her and the attendant. We were so beyond exhausted and felt for the attendant, we declined. (She had to run back and forth to remove, find and replace sheets and cases.) This however prompted our own  investigation. Finally it all made sense. 
   Even though the room was a cool, modern feel, it didn't wow. WHY? The room had not been cleaned. Upon closer inspection, the cabinets, mirrors, chairs and floors had visibly dried stains, dust and lint about. The biggest and most notable? The bathroom shower- long black hairs in and about the drain and entrance to the shower. I nearly threw up, I
 began gagging. This was beyond too much for us.
  At around 5am the fiasco drew to a close with more dealings with the guest services. Facing 4-5 hours of sleep after being so severely stressed by the experience, we requested a late checkout. The level of inconvenience Guest Services expressed to us was insane by this point. We were enraged. 
    Who would think that a hotel that intrigues everyone with so much romance would show so little concern for the effect it has on it patrons through their representatives? I have a medical condition that causes great fatigue. This experience drained everything out of me. It took me a week to recover physically. 
    This experience has stuck with me, hence the reason I have reported back my findings so late. We are recent locals to the area. The number of choices we have to stay on the Strip include staying home then heading out for the enjoyment. What a horrible experience Bellagio afforded us. I would advise everyone to think twice. Do the due diligence when u enter the room. Don't do the upsell until you can be guaranteed the status on the room. Hey better yet the Paris across the street may score lower but they are cheaper, with great views and better staff - from our experience. Or spend the money and stay at the Cosmo. People!

During my three day stay, I had what was a just about perfect hotel experience. The rooms are unique, spacious and mine offered a great view of the strip. Housekeeping was always done within an hour of me leaving the room and the room itself was comfy from the bed to the awesome bathroom.

The hotel also offers a club, many restaurants (including the famous buffet) a huge casino area and shopping. You could essentially not leave the hotel your entire trip if you really wanted to, which is the sign of a great place.

We were here initially, then in LA for a few days and back here again for two nights.  We had booked a room for four people but on the first check in they said the room wasn't suitable for four.  They didn't propose to do anything about it, even though they could see we had booked for four people.  In the end we managed to get them to put two foldaway beds in and we managed OK.

When we came back just now for the second visit they tried to charge us extra for the two foldaway beds.  When we said 'No' they went away and then came back and said it would be OK - No apology for trying to charge us extra.

Also, trying to pull up to load\/unload the car is a trauma.  Both times they waved me through to an area and then told me I couldn't park there.  After driving round the loop again they told me to pull up in the valet area where we then got abused by the valets.

As I said, very nice hotel, food is good and the baggage people were very friendly but I couldn't recommend staying here.

Quick update two years later - we checked in at 16:30, with a check in time of 15:00, after six hours of travelling and they said they should be able to find us a room in about 90m.  We said this wasn't acceptable and to be fair they upgraded us several levels to a penthouse suite!!  Room was very large but basically this is a very old fashioned hotel that has had its day.  The wifi was patchy to say the least in our suite, showers leaked and it all felt very dated.

Well, I love that it's located in the Center of the Strip, the interior is nice and welcoming, the Fountain Show, the Conservatory, the Buffet, and the rooms are clean and inviting.

And the price is not too bad since you can usually snag a weekday special in the mid $100.  Other 5 star places like the Wynn cost so much more.

I recommend the Lake-View rooms since you'll be able to see the Fountains.  Otherwise, the view is typical of what you get from Vegas.

It took security over an hour to get to us, and when they did arrive they were rude and did not care. Security told us they had called the police, which they had not. We spoke to the hotel manager who basically informed me I had no reason to be upset about my passport being stolen, that 'this is Las Vegas, people lose their passport all the time'.  Cut to: it took me 16 days to return home. The Bellagio did not reach out or help at all to accommodate me during this time. In fact, their 'internal investigation' team discovered that although someone did try to get into our room the very same morning we were robbed, they determined they were 'unsuccessful' and therefore no one actually broke in our room, and that was have lied about what happened.  

Yes, Bellagio. I spent thousands of dollars trying to get back home to the UK just to try to get a $200 drink voucher for 6 girls and 6 bad tickets to cirque du solei. It's not even about compensation- the way we were treated after this happened was appalling. We had to ask to change rooms- as clearly someone somehow got access to ours.

For a hotel that says that they are luxurious, the only luxury I saw was the ultra deep bath tubs (WIIIIN btw!!) - the beds were pretty much what you get in hotels, the pillows the same. The sheets weren't high thread count at all, my bed at home has higher thread count.

Room service happened daily unless you specified otherwise - some days we had chocolates on our pillows, other days we didn't. I guess it was up to the feelings of the room service people.

Just be aware though, if you are going to spend extra for a fountain view room that you'll be listening and being kept awake by the thunderous noise they make all the way till midnight. It's a we bit like having a cannon go of in your room, to be honest. And why you have to pay extra for that noise I really don't know.

The TV!! Oh good gods, the TV. It was atrocious. My best friend was sick so we decided to spend one night in bed watching crappy shows and eating room service. We turned on the TV to find that whatever crap channel was trying to show, kept pixelating and freezing. We advised the front desk of this and was told that there was nothing to be done. 

And what the hell is it with the channels available? More than half were in another language and the few that were english were useless. Free to air TV has better offerings but unfortunately we couldn't get that either.

All in all though? If you want to spend this much on a hotel room, find somewhere that is actually luxurious and not just upmarket in the bathrooms.

And the walk to get to your room. If you're in heels you might want to think of slipping them off during your trek to get through the casino to find the elevators to rooms.

Our coffee cups were picked up from our bedroom the first 2 mornings, after that, forget it! I still have coffee cups from yesterday morning, and from this morning sitting in our bedroom.  Apparently you pay $20.00 per coffee pot, they bring it and take it for the first couple of days, after that, forget it! you need to take out the coffee pot and cups, that was the answer I got from the front desk.

We usually sit at the 100 dollar tables but this time we sat at the 15 to 25 one because the dealers and pit bosses there were so much fun and friendly.  My wife was there first and when I told her to move to the higher limit, she refused.  And it was all because of Steve Corso and Valerie.

Some of them (like Krystal) have a major attitude when the guests let them know the process is taking too long.  Krystal even rolled her eyes, flapped her hands up and said guests questioning their ability will only slow the process down.  Geez.   Not asking for Zappos customer service but come on...

We've stayed at The Mirage, Paris Casino, Palazzo, etc.  But Bellagio is the best.  We got a room facing the fountain and it was so fun listening to the music and watching the waterworks!  My favorite song is ""Proud to be an American"" because it had the most spectacular waterworks.  My 2 year old daughter would agree with me on this one.  

Our room was nice and clean.  The ventilation at the Bellagio is also the best because I smell the least amount of cigarette smoke at this casino.  The staff was professional and friendly.  Housekeeping was also very prompt in their service as well.

The table games were nice too.  The chairs and the colors are all very eye-pleasing.  Not too much flash and bling.  Simple and elegant is the theme at Bellagio.  

The only gripe I had was the marble shower didn't have any floor mats on it.  It was so slippery.  I could have asked for one but my husband didn't want one.  *rolls eyes*  So I had to risk my life not to slip and fall in their shower.  The water pressure was also somewhat weak.  But their tub!  Wow!  Water filled it fast and it was a very fancy and spacious tub!

Out of all the Casinos, I definitely love Bellagio the most.  Also they had the BEST dinner buffet too!  Better than the Wynn, Rio, Mirage, Paris, etc.  The already peeled jumbo shrimp!  The sea bass!  Kobe beef!  FRESH sushi!  I miss it already!",0,0,0

Since the take over by MGM, sadly the Bellagio is not what it used to be.  My main issue is with the hotel rooms.  The ""remodel"" that took place within the last year to every room in the entire hotel was a huge mistake.  The new bright, cheap and disgusting décor replaces what once was a room full of classic, neutral, rich tones that went with the rest of the hotel.  The new rooms feel completely out of place in the Bellagio and make you feel like you are actually staying at a cheap generic hotel.  Sadly, I will never be staying at the Bellagio again but I will most certainly visit the resort for the shopping, dinning and gambling.",2,0,0

Accommodations were good, as expected for a five diamond hotel (free chocolate, yay!).  The room was spacious, very clean, and newly remodeled.  We had two queen sized beds with ottomans at the end of each bed.  The decor is nice (no cheesy theme), but not particularly modern (there's less automation than at Aria, for example).  The bathroom facilities felt more minimal than I expected for a luxury hotel, but everything was clean at least.  My experience with customer service was fine, although not particularly memorable.  I've experienced more attentive, enthusiastic service at other comparable hotels.

Within the hotel, there are a good amount of attractions - namely, the fountains, the botanical gardens, Cirque du Soleil's ""O"", and the shopping - all of which are nice, particularly if this is your first time in Las Vegas and\/or you are visiting for a special occasion.  I'm not crazy about the food options at Bellagio however.  Generally, if I'm planning on eating in the same hotel that I'm staying at, I'm looking for convenience; however, there aren't a lot of options for quick meals or even casual dining inside the Bellagio.  The best deal is probably the buffet, which is good but often has a long line if you don't go right at opening time.  For fine dining, I'd probably leave the hotel.

Overall, the Bellagio is a very nice hotel with a prime location in the middle of the Strip.  The general atmosphere is probably most appropriate for a couples' trip.  Personally, I probably would splurge on a room at Encore before coming back to the Bellagio, but I definitely think it's worth it to book if you see reasonable room rates.",3,0,1

We checked in and the front desk lady was very pleasant and talked us into an upgraded room to see the great fountains, told us what channel to turn to so we could listen to the music while we watched and we would love the view since it was our for time in their hotel. We were excited and accepted to pay the upgrade. In fact, nine years ago before we were married, we took a picture in front the fountains and thought it would be great to take one from the top of the hotel. 

By the time we got to our room 15 minutes later it was past midnight and the fountains stopped playing. We woke up and tried to watch but unfortunately the fountains don't start until noon which is one hour past checkout. Since we are only here for one night, we aren't getting to see the fountains from our room. 

We are disappointed because we spent money to see something that was never going to happen during our stay. We would have just paid for a normal room since we were just here for a few hours. 

I called the front desk to explain my disappointment and all the said was you still got a lake view even though the fountains weren't playing.  The girl who answered the phone wouldn't even patch me to a manager. Just kept putting me on hold. 

The room was nice, but service is what I rate and Bellagio has failed us on our first trip to their hotel. Its apparent our MLife status doesn't mean anything at this hotel. We will stick to Aria who treats us as a valuable customer.

Disappointed and won't be returning or recommending this hotel to others.",1,1,0

I somehow feel the gild is off the lily to a certain extent.  I really find that the Wynn causes the Bellagio to pal a bit in comparison, both in the rooms and in the main casino.  Of course, the Bellagio is still a cut above other 3 star properties and it is great to stay there anytime.  Room service was awesome this trip, and so was the entire experience.  But it is just not up to the same level as the Wynn, which is now the gold standard, in my mind.  I shockingly found the clientele (or maybe these were just the lookie-loos) to be very low brow.  Lots of fanny packs and cut offs.  Back in the day when Bellagio first opened, no one went in without being dressed nicely and they were rather rigid about allowing kids on the property.  There has been a lot of backsliding.  

However, as always, I thoroughly enjoyed the garden show.  This year's fall show was so outstanding it might have eclipsed any shows I have seen in the past. See my blog.

There are MANY reasons to stay here.  If I had to choose one property on The Strip, this would be it because I have come back time and time again over the years and have never been disappointed.  I can't say that about other properties for one reason or another.

Let me start by saying that there is one potential negative.  It is always busy\/crowded.  Ok, maybe not at 4am when I usually lurk around looking for that paying slot machine, but during the day.  There are tons of hotel guests, show-goers, locals in the poker room, staff, tourists taking photos, and on and on.  

This is the place to be...Ground Zero on The Las Vegas Strip, if you will.  That makes for a major potential positive.  I consider the location to be one of the biggest assets because you can pretty much walk to anything on The Strip.  You have access to the new City Center, opening soon.  You can cross the street and hit the ""cheap"" gambling halls like Bill's and O'Shea's.  Caesar's Palace is right next door, along with The Mirage, Paris, Planet Hollywood, Treasure Island, etc.  The list goes on and on.  The Bellagio is central.

Having said that, I have also found The Bellagio to be a great place to spot celebrities, and I don't go the The Bank, the resident nightclub.  I am talking about on the elevators, which is where I seem to bump into people.  To date, I have ridden elevators with Andy Garcia, Amaya from The Real World, and Bam Margera.  I have also seen a wide variety of televised poker stars in the poker room.  That is an everyday thing.

WIthin the property, there are a number of things to see and do.  The Fountains are the most obvious must-see attraction, but don't forget to see the Bellagio Conservatory and Botanical Gardens.  It is amazing, changes frequently, and never fails to impress.  While there, sneak around the corner and grab a dessert treat from John Philippe Patisserie.  You will love it, chocolate waterfall and all.  Also, be sure to see the Chihuly glass display in the lobby, as well as his retail store near the Conservatory.  There are a lot of high-end boutiques like Louis Vuitton and Bottega Veneta lining the halls if you want to drop some coin.  There are also a lot of nice restaurants, allbeit pricey ones.  Fix is good.  The spa is lovely, and has been renovated over the years.  I had a wonderful massage treatment there about 6 months ago.

If you like gambling, this is a very nice place to play with higher stakes.  The poker room is large and nice.  The sports book is top-notch.  If you want to see the opposite of top-notch, hit The Tropicana.  The bartenders are very friendly and informative and the cocktail waitresses are among the best on The Strip.

The basic rooms are very nice.  They are above average when compared to other basic rooms on The Strip.  They have nice built-in cabinets\/wardrobes that feature flat-screen televisions, a nicely stocked mini-bar, iron and board, a safe, robes, slippers, full-length mirrors and the ability to close away all of your personal belongings.  This is a nice touch.  The beds are very comfortable, and the drapes are operated by electric motors with the flick of a switch.  The bathrooms have glass-enclosed showers and soaking tubs as well as his and hers sinks.  The only negative is that you can hear things in the hallways from these rooms.  Doors slamming, knock-knock-housekeeping, etc.  If you reserve this type of room, request to be in the main tower, preferably facing the fountains.

If you move up to one of the suites, it becomes an entirely different ballgame.  The Grand Lakeview Suite (my personal favorite) is amazing.  To start, it is several thousand square feet situated right in the middle of the hotel, facing the water show.  In addition to that, it has two balconies that are accessible from the living room and both bedrooms.  The foyer is grand, with a powder bath.  The main living area, dining area for 10, and bar face out to The Strip and the water show.  Stunning!  The bedrooms are huge, have the pop-up tv's at the foot of the bed, and his and hers bathrooms.  Not his and hers sinks...bathrooms.  Each bathroom has a steam shower, a jacuzzi tub or something else.  There are tv's everywhere.  I had a funny thing happen once in this suite.  I ordered room service (which is really good here by the way) and when the delivery arrived, the gentleman seemed disappointed to see me.  He was very polite but said that he thought he was going to Ben Affleck's room.  Apparently, Ben was staying in the same suite as us two floors up.  I gave him a hard time for not being excited to see ME!

The next step up (the top step) is into a private villa.  I am going to let you experience this one for youself.  They are special.  Think private gardens, private pools and original art special.  Too much to describe in a 5,000 word Yelp review.  If you are interested, email me.",4,1,3

They will never have the vision the same way Steve Wynn did when he built and designed the Bellagio but it will always be famous on the Las Vegas strip.

My Mom received a deluxe comp room for 3 nights and so we couldn't pass it up and booked right away as a mother and son trip. 

What I like about the Bellagio:

+Updated rooms
+Center Strip location being close to (Cosmopolitan, Caesars Palace, City Center,                      Planet Hollywood, Flamingo, Ballys, Paris and Mirage)
+Crowded casino with lots of action
+Bellagio Fountains
+The Conservatory (Open 24\/7)
+Connected to Aria and Monte Carlo
+The Buffet
+Excellent Customer Service from all the staff from the valet, bellman, housekeeping, front desk, pool staff and the drink waitresses (Hit or Miss).
+Free and fast wifi included with the comp room
+Architecture, Landscaping and Italian marble flooring all over the property. 

What I dislike about the Bellagio:

-Hookers all over the casino and lobby but that's in all over the strip hotels
-High priced 24\/7 cafe
-The long walk from your hotel room to the strip (15 minutes)

However, with all the amenities (rooms, lounge, The Bank, buffet, etc...) and the great placement on the strip, The Bellagio doesn't stack up to other comparable hotel\/casinos in Vegas. I went to the Bellagio last time I was in Vegas because I generally had frequented the Venetian, which was always great, but I was eager to try other higher end hotels in America's playground...so I went here (to The Bellagio). 

Let's, run through it shall we...
We get there, our room is nice, but not as nice as the Venetian (and smaller) and the AC was not working. To add to our experience, there was a moldy sandwich in our fridge! We called to have all this stuff taken care of and no one did! I know this an unusual experience, and that's way I'm not going to totally ridicule The Bellagio...after all; they must be doing something right to be such a success.  Anyways, so when we check out at the end of the weekend, we told them of our problems and they comp'd only 50 bucks...even after we dropped a bunch of bills in the place and they managed to forget to clean up the moldy sandwich they left in the fridge after three phone calls to customer service from our room. 


Basically, ignoring my unusually bad experience with customer care, The Bellagio is a nice resort. However,  soooo many hotels are a lot more fun, more lavish, and LESS EXPENSIVE than The Bellagio.

Service promptness and friendliness is top notch.  Based on previous stays on the strip, Bellagio service blows any of the other resorts out of the water.

The Bellagio pool is definitely for the elderly crowd or for families with young kids. So if you're in your 20's like me, you'll want to party at a different pool as a heads up.

The cafe is good food as well. Though, just keep in mind no matter what time of day you go here there will be at least 25-50 people taking photos of the gardens.

Problems:

1. The fucking wi-fi service didn't work. What the fuck is wrong with the fucking wi-fi? My boyfriend and I are geeks and we need to get on the fucking internet.

We were only able to connect once we stacked poor B's laptop on top of an LV phone book and a Holy Bible on top of a trash can underneath the desk to hook up the the hotel's ethernet (or whatever the fuck it is called) cable because that stupid shit was BOLTED to the desk below. I'm a recovering Catholic and so I did not feel at all good about stacking a bible on top of a Las Vegas phonebook on a trash can. My Mom would not approve.

And don't try to get any technical support. They think that you are willing to wait all night for a technician to come up. What the fuck are we supposed to do while waiting? Luckily, all B needed was my mad problem-solving skills and we were able to cancel the tech support call we had already waited in excess of an hour for.

And to top it off, there was a 14.99 fee for poor B to get online, even though he could only do so sitting underneath the desk. My man is tall too so this did not spell crazy convenience. Jesus Christ, it was ridiculous, but I have some great pictures.

2. Fix your plumbing! It is NOT romantic to hear the water draining from the floors above. It sounded like there was something in the pipes and that a toilet was having a problem flushing. B and I exchanged tens of ""What the fuck is in those pipes?!""  looks as we tried to relax in our room. Hmmph. Gross. That ended up being funny too, however.

3. Please install a microwave and a fridge. I rarely finish my dinner all at once, and I don't want a tummy ache later from bacteria growth. And, call me cheap, but I do not want to throw out our DELICIOUS steak leftovers, seriously. B says it is ridiculous to need these things, but I disagree. I like to eat when I get back from a long night of drunken gambling. I mean, there's not even a coffee pot in these rooms. WTF.

4. B said don't touch anything on that snack thing, and BOY was he right.  We ended up getting charged 20 bucks for snacks we didn't even want, much less have. Thinking the snack thing was a fridge, I put our steak leftovers (MMMM) in the fridge and had to slide a few things around to get the box to fit. Well, it wasn't even a fucking refrigerator, we didn't get to enjoy our delicious (and I mean DELICIOUS) steak, AND we got charged 20 bucks. What the fuck.

Other than these issues and a few problems extending our stay that I won't expand on but to say that it was excessively difficult, the hotel was very nice. I la-la-LOVED the bathtub to a psychotic, addictive extent. What a joy it was to get ready, just absolutely wonderful! Imagine getting out of the bath with a big goofy grin on your face. That was me, at least twice a day. Also, I highly enjoyed freaking poor B out walking through the area with the Chanel, Gucci, Hermes, Dior, and Armani shops. Hehe. I almost made him go to Chanel with me. He clearly DID NOT want to.

But the number one reason to stay here is for the view of the fountains from your hotel room. Even with Donny and Marie Osmond plastered all over the Flamingo smiling back at us (when I called my girl Liz to tell her, she replied ""That's a LOT of teeth!"") we spent hours in that window. Make sure you request the fountain side. I recommend it.",16,16,10

1.  Check in process was a bit funky.  Waited awhile in line then the lady at the counter says ""let me go find you a room"" and walks away leaving us standing there.  I see her standing with other employees all gathered around a computer monitor chatting.  This goes on for about 10 minutes.  I almost jumped onto the counter to get her attention and ask what the heck was going on.

2.  I had high expectations for the bed, but nope.  Pretty ho-hum. Nothing to write home to mom about.  In fact I think a typical Westin bed beats it hands down.  That is pretty sad.

But I did love everything else....flowers....view of the fountain from our 27th floor room....all the restaurants\/snack bars were delicious

Would definitely stay here again, especially after walking through a lot of other hotels on the strip - call me a hotel snob if you must",1,0,1

It's supposed to be the best of the best, so our expectations were high.  We upgraded to a suite in hopes of a luxurious, relaxing experience... no such luck.  

Check in was disorganized, but tolerable.  The lobby was packed as usual, but we planned to stay through the weekend and into the week.  I figured the crowds would die down a little; I was wrong.  The Bellagio is a super popular tourist destination, and even on an off weekend in January, it was jam packed.  The really unfortunate part of that is the SMOKE!  Bellagio allows smoking in the casino, and apparently has no filtration system whatsoever.  It smelled worse than a lot of the older casinos, and was completely inescapable.  So, gambling was off the table.

Next was our ""upgraded"" Bellagio Suite.  The decor was over-the-top and a little outdated, but nice enough.  The big problem was the ratty, torn-up holes in the carpet and the bedding (I'll include pictures).  At $350+ a night, I didn't expect orphanage linens.  There were two tv's in the suite - one in the bedroom, and one in the living room area.  Both were small (maybe 25""?) and old.  The living room tv's sound cut out every 5 seconds or so, making it impossible to watch.  I didn't go to Vegas to watch tv, but I like to be a little lazy on vacation.  

The last straw was the service.  We ordered in-room breakfast.  When the lady arrived with the table, she pushed it into the middle of the living room and said ""I'll leave this here.""  No 'good morning,' no 'where would you like the table?', etc.  Not a huge deal, but pleasantries are always appreciated.  My husband signed the bill and handed it back, she looked it over and said ""You're not gonna leave a tip?  YOU KNOW gratuity isn't included.""  No, we didn't know.  This is the first hotel we'd ever been to that didn't include a healthy gratuity on in-room dining.  He quickly adjusted the bill to tip her (even after her rude behavior), and she left without another word.  I completely agree with tipping the wait staff, but she could have mentioned it nicely when handing over the bill, instead of insinuating that we tried to skip out on it. 

At this point, our vacation had reached a low point, and it needed to be salvaged.  I walked through the smoky lobby to the front desk.  A Bellagio employee named Michael approached me, and asked what he could help with.  I explained the situation, and he was nice enough, taking notes.  I told him I just wanted out of our remaining nights, with no cancellation fee, so that we could continue our vacation elsewhere.  He set us up for checkout that day, and said he would see what he could do about removing some of our charges, since we'd had such an unpleasant stay.

When we checked out, the front desk attendant asked us how we had liked the room.  We were honest, ""It was pretty bad, actually.""  She ignored it, and said nothing else as she handed us our bill.  As expected, we were billed for everything... they didn't remove any charges.  Yet another sign of Bellagio's we-don't-give-a-f*ck attitude.  It was perfectly fine, though, since we were finally free of this run-down hotel.

We high-tailed it over to Encore, where the service checking in was so characteristically fantastic that it reminded us what a great hotel should be.  And I forgot my toiletry bag at Bellagio.  It took several calls to the lost and found, where I gave ""Melissa"" the room number, the description, my name and phone number.  She sighed loudly and told me ""It's going to take me all night to look through everything, so I'll just call you back later.""   After more prodding I finally got it back, and it was another disdained trip to Bellagio to pick it up.  

This hotel and it's couldn't-care-less staff left a really terrible taste in my mouth.  I won't even be back to shop.

TL;DR - super smoky and crowded casino, torn-up holes in the carpet and bedding, tiny broken tv's, and a rude, apathetic staff of employees who hate Bellagio as much as I do.",26,3,1

At $500 for a run of the house room, you expect to get what you're paying for. So keeping this in mind  you go into this hotel with some expecations. And YES while the hotel is very, very beautiful, its based off an Italian ""feminine"" luxury design. Not my cup of tea. But here is what you need to know: 

1) Terrible Customer Service
2) Terrible Casino Service 
3) Terrible Gambling Odds with high Minimums and shuffling machines
3) No prices in most stores and resturants

Inheritance brats and trust funders could care less. However for those of us who EARNED our incomes from $0 we know the value of money. We KNOW we are getting ripped off. 

$1,200 bottle for Opus wine I can get online for $100 bottle. $32.00 for cigarellos - $5.00 online. $25.00 for a tiny little cup of chopped peppers. $16 for 1 shot of Costco Malibu rum at the bar. 

On top of this - you are charged for every single little thing. They play these little manipulative tricks and games all over the hotel - it's ""institutionalized"" into the experience - if that makes sense;  to get your money by cutting corners and ripping you off but thinking you are too stupid to notice.. True LUXURY hotels and resorts do not do this.

The room is IKEA ON STERIODS. Vintage Made in China everything. The bed was SAGGY. The carpet was CHEAP. The flat screen TV was SMALL. The placement of the lights were off. I could build the bathroom in my home myself with $3,000 (or less) of materials from Home Depot. F that room. Ripoff! I'm being honest when I say I would never stay at the Bellagio again - not even for $29 per night.

You have to keep in mind - this hotel markets itself as the #1 Luxury Hotel in Vegas. Top five in the world. The lobby - YES. The room NO. Service is lousy. Prices are high. Do these people need a job or not? Oh, and every time you go back to your room, you are insulted by a secutiry guard asking for your room key. there is a LINE of people waiting and the guard is asking for everyones room key. Perhaps you should install quality LOCKS on the doors. All the have is a standard hotel lock with a latch! There is no second bolt lock on the door. Just a cheap latch. 


Their systems were down. And they could not find my booking. But they had plenty of vacancy! Even still - the managers refused to book me because it was manual and ""too much work"". It was only at the insistence of a nice girl at the front desk who could see they were being lazy and pushed over them - that I was booked. Otherwise I would had to stay elsewhere and pay $$$$$$ for last minute check in. 

The guy is like ""Uhhhhhh You should go to Planet Hollywood Uhhhhhh"". Planet Hollywood? Give me my room key! Not my problem your Bellagios computer systems are down. I booked. Your computer systems bungled it. NOT MY PROBLEM. Re-book it manually Mr. Lazy. Also if you have an M-LIFE card - it will not tie into thier system for comps. 

I would strongly advise anyone coming to Las Vegas thinking they will spend a little more to get a 1% luxury feel - do not come to Bellagio. You will be far better off at the other casinos!

Flashy, pretty, and seems fun.  But after you spend some time there, you find its all looks and little true substance.  Small warning signs add up to real issues such as $5 machine sodas ($5.50 for an 8oz bottle from room service) to hairs in the food at the pool cafe to burned $70 steaks at Prime steakhouse which they apologized for and replaced with fatty steaks from perhaps a grocery store.  Housekeeping didn't clean the room at all, and the front desk said we should have asked for the room to be cleaned.  Huh?   The mini bar nazi literally barged into our room while I was in the shower and propped our door open for people walking past in the hall to look in, all to tell me I removed something from the mini bar and it needed restocked.  When I told her I made very sure to not even touch the thing because of the prices, she said it must have been the last guest then, didn't apologize, and didn't charge me. I guess the last person got an extra bill?  But why prop open my door and make me stand near the doorway in a towel while she was in my room arguing with me?  We even had issues with the cable TV going out.  And unless you're mlife gold or up (which fortunately I was) you better plan on 45 minutes to 2 hours to check in.  Don't get me wrong, most of the staff were extremely nice, but the flaws with this place are evident when they're in a situation of not extracting cash from you.

We arrived early on Friday and had no problem with the check in lines, and a very friendly staff member checked us in.  We booked a Fountain View room- the view was gorgeous.  That's what my stars are for- the fountain views and the location of this hotel on the strip.  But that's where the fun ended.

We were on the 15th floor.  After seeing the beautiful view, we just wanted to stay in the room all day and watch the fountain shows... that is until we realized we were directly across from a maintenance door that slammed closed every two minutes and rattled our entire room and all of the rooms around us. I tried to talk to the housekeeping staff about it politely- asking them to avoid slamming the door.  We were woken up several times in the morning. On top of that, the maids shouted down the hallway at each other making conversation starting at 7:30am.  Additionally, our sink was making a loud gurgling sound throughout the night and the shower door did not close, so water leaked everywhere.

We called the front desk and they said we could call back later to be placed in another Fountain View room, and that they would wave the resort fee.  We were very satisfied with this resolution... Until we call back that afternoon to find out we are being moved ONE room over!!!! When we told them this was unacceptable because we'd still be across from the maintenance door, they said this was the only option- unless we wanted to forfeit our view and downgrade with no refund!!!!  We reluctantly re-packed our things and moved one room over, hoping it would be quieter.  We continued to hear the slamming maintenance door and the housekeeping staff shouting at each other the next morning. And this sink ALSO gurgled loudly throughout the night.  When I told the check out clerk about this, he apologized... but that was it. I should have asked for a manager but I just wanted to get home.

Do try their coffee at any of their cafeterias. As a coffee aficionado & connoisseur, I can assure you the blend is spectacular and the best quality out there.

A very typical hotel room. Nothing fancy really. And there must've been an event going on that weekend because we paid over $500 per night! NOT worth it.

The worst part of the whole experience was the customer service. I can't judge ALL of the staff based off my experience BUT, all it takes is one person.

So we spoke to the help desk JONATHAN and before he opened his mouth, I knew we were in trouble.

I HATE cigarette smoke. If you want to smoke and smell like shit, it's your business. I don't, and I don't want to smell the shit or smell like shit myself. 

The bellman arrived with our luggage and I asked him about it. He called the front desk and verified that it was a smoking room. He had housekeeping bring in an air deionizer, which helped some but was really only temporary. I still woke up in the middle of the night to the smell of sleeping in an ashtray. Lovely. You can't just deionize it from the air, it permeates everything. I called the front desk and had the room changed. Unfortunately none were available that night so we had to spend our first Vegas night in a room smelling of shit.

The good- great placement on the strip. Good restaurants. Great pool! Great service at the pool.
The bad- very curt desk and room service. I swear an angry Frank Oz delivered my breakfast our 2 mornings. Very smoky casino. We asked for a king, and got 2 queens. A couple visiting with us got a room after us- and got a king! The carpet was taped down in the hallway. 
I assume that we were on a floor that had not had recent renovations, and I get that. We could have demanded to move, and we did not. 
However, the whole thing together (curt service, run-down appearance of our hall) just didn't impress. And another thing- the bathrooms: the toilet is not separated from the shower. Maybe you like that- I don't. 
Would we come back? I don't know. The pool was great.",1,0,0

I have always wanted to go to Las Vegas, for 20 years I have wanted to go. So we finally went and stayed at the Bellagio in the spa tower so our walk was extremely long!! The room was nice, I won't deny that, however we paid greatly for that nice room. The room cleaning situation was dreadful!! We had our room cleaned once while we were still in the room on our first night. We tipped her and she stated she would call someone to refill the coffee pods and condiments, that never happened in the four nights we stayed. The towels were replaced and that's about it. 
  Now we tip very well and I guess this is a good thing seeing as you are expected to tip EVERYONE. When we finally made it to the casino we would tip the server who gave us drinks, however if that tip amount got lower than $10 for ""FREE DRINKS"", our server became nonexistent, we simply never saw her again?? As for the casino... mind you where I live I have a very nice resort\/casino and the rooms are fantastic and the casino actually pays out. If you go to the Bellagio please don't go expecting the casino to pay out, you will be disappointed! We had spent approximately $2k a night and although we are not what the Bellagio caters to (Chanel, Rolex, Omega) are some of the stores in the Bellagio, I believe $2k a night is worth a bit of  pay out. The MOST we won in three nights, was $276 on a $5 slot machine, that was it!! We played cards, nothing we played war and my husband lost $100 in two minutes! The payouts at this casino are a complete joke!! Perhaps the owner needs to tighten the machines to implement more upgrades or terribly expensive stores. You're welcome for my contribution because we certainly did not get anything out it. 
  Now they have these white cabs that line up outside waiting for people. We took one and the man was a maniac and we almost crashed twice, I ended up losing my Ray Bans because we slid around in the back seat so badly they must have slipped out of my purse. We did not get his name and he took off to get more fares (more money) so I could not call about my glasses. So they are gone and I was scared to death. I thought New York cabbies were bad...nope!! Perhaps the Bellagio should pay attention to who uses their property for business. The man did not stop for a merging car who had the right of way, and we nearly crashed; he giggled?? We did see other hotels that were beautiful but we stayed at ours for the most part. Don't go here thinking you will win or have this grand experience. 
  All in all I'm glad I can say I went but feel no need to ever visit Las Vegas again. If I do I will not spend our money here. I'm not sure why the star rating is so high, perhaps others have never been in a casino\/resort before. We did enjoy our limo driver and a few restaurants were amazing but again you pay for that. I do believe most of these hotels simply do not  cater to average people. I believe the feeling is that of ""if you are not extremely wealthy you have no business being  here"". Therefore,  I won't give my money to the Bellagio again. I heard good things about other casino\/hotels in Vegas, but honestly even tho it was snowing in my hometown and beautifully sunny in Las Vegas I was super excited to get home!

The Conservatory was super nice since it was decked out for the Lunar New Year. It was a bit crowded, but I enjoyed walking through it. We didn't get a chance to walk through it at night through, but I'm sure it's a completely different view. 

There's a bunch of restaurants in the Bellagio - we ate at Olives, which is a Todd English restaurant.

3.  Waited in line at the cafe about 2 couples  ahead of us literally stood there for 10 minutes and didn't see one attendant hostess or cashier even come up to the counter obviously they may be a seating people but to wait that long and  have nobody standing out front to greet you tell you how long the wait is for the prices of a cafe and the quality of what Bellagio tries to deliver very poor we walked away and decided to go somewhere else to eat.

4.  The automatic revolving doors on the lower level to go out to the water fountains we're broken and people are getting stuck inside the doors and everyone was having to push them really hard to get out they were the only doors to exit out on the Las Vegas Boulevard another bad impression to say the least it was scary for some folks.

5.  What bothered me the most was the walk way skywalk \/ flamingo that enters into the top level of the Bellagio has at least four different people selling cooler s of water but about 10 feet outside the Bellagio entrance on this walkway there was a Hispanic lady selling cans of beer out of the cooler right there as you enter into the Bellagio now we know this is against the law and maybe hard to police but that one its that close to the entrance of your building to have a legal sitting there selling cans of beer out of their cooler and no one does anything about it is pretty pissed poor.  It's bad enough having to bob and weave between the others that are selling their water or doing caricatures or dressed up in stupid costumes right outside your property but to have somebody selling beer to anyone who wants it right outside the entrance of your building that certainly could be policed and set a really bad example for such a high quality hotel.

We ordered at the front desk, found a place to sit by the pool and picked up our order after ten minutes - charged to the room... so convenient because we didn't even have to bring money (needed ID though to order alcohol). 

Their jalapeno hot dog was amazing. It was bigger than a costco dog and the bread...the bread contained little jalapenos - not hot at all...just there for flavor, but that flavor was so good. Even when I could tell the bread was a little older because it was a little stiff, it still tasted great. 
My wife had the chips with all sorts of dip...maybe it was like a three layer dealy, but the beans, salsa and guacamole came in separate containers - but she kept raving about it too. 

Oh, and extra kudos to the cafe or just the pool area in general to serve Blue Moon. Seriously, I usually never order beer in Vegas because they always just have the whatever domestic stuff. Good experience and would be five stars if each dish went down by $5.",2,2,2

For the money though I don't think the room was worth it. But the night we got there (the night before the race) we went to bed early so that we could be well rested for the marathon. The alarm clock woke us up at 3am (mind you, we never touched the alarm clock - this was never turned off from before we got there). Being half asleep we just unplugged the thing.  10 minutes later it went off again.  We just started hitting buttons. Ten minutes later, once again it woke us up.

I stayed on hold with the front desk for ten minutes then finally he said they would have someone bring it up. An hour later I finally got my fork.  When I was checking out they said that I owed 12 dollars. I asked for what and they said room service. I told them I did not order room service and had them look it up - it was for the fork.

The room is just OK. None of the luxury amenities I came to expect were there - only 1 regular tv (Palazzo had 3 flat screens, the main one had HD); no living room or couch (Palazzo had a nice sunken living room with a sectional); no complimentary robes or slippers (Palazzo, check); no closets - just a large tv\/drawer\/closet combo (Palazzo had plenty to spare), the bathroom was just ok (Palazzo had a separate toilet area, tv by the bath, vanity area with seating, better toiletries) I can go on and on how the Palazzo was just so much better on EVERY level. My friends and I just couldn't believe how much the Bellagio is riding on reputation alone.

The Bellahio casino itself was very busy and crowded with people staying there but also with people who came to see what all the Bellagio fuss was about.

4) Centrally located. This is both pro & con. You can go to tons of places on foot.   
5) Mobile checkin\/checkout. I was particularly pleased with this service. I checked us in the night before we travelled to Vegas. Checkin time is 3 pm usually but I got an email saying our room was ready at around 1:30 pm. We then picked up our room keys at the mobile check-in counter. The process took less than 2 mins. 
6) Complimentary breakfast buffet for 2.
7) Luxury shopping. Valentino, Louis Vuitton, Bottega and many more luxury brands are within the hotel premises. Very convenient. You dnt have to go out to the heat.

Cons:
1) For a 5-star hotel, It was lacking the basics such as toothbrush, slippers, tongs for ice. We stayed at a lot of other 5 star hotel before n we even get sleeping masks sometimes, razor, emergency kit, q tips, etc. 
2) Towel is stained with brown. Ewww. Made me wonder if they were changed at all. 
3) The room key never worked for getting out of parking. We had to call for assistance every time which is embarrassing because we're holding the line. 
4) So-so security. Anyone can use the guest elevators. There's an employee standing near elevators randomly asking for room cards but I see a lot doesn't get checked. Ive been to places where u can't use the elevator without card. It makes me feel unsafe that a non hotel guest could just come knock at my room. 
5) Because it was centrally located getting in and out of parking is horrible at certain hours. 
6) The door to our room keeps getting stuck. I think they need to upgrade.",0,0,0

All necessities  were provided.  There was not a tint of cigarette smoke in a room. It is very important to me because i can't stand the smell of  cigarettes.  Check in and check out was very easy and fast. 
After taking a walk on the Strip I can totally understand why you have a security check in front of the guest elevators. We stayed in this hotel for a few days and  did not have any problems with any of the security personnel but two women who worked on Thanksgiving morning. I think they  should be reminded that this is a HOTEL ( and rather expensive one) , not a TSA or some state prison check point.  There is no reason to be over zealously aggressive in asking people like my husband to show their keys. I understand that they probably were trained to profile certain people based on their appearance, but there is no reason to make it so obvious.",0,0,0

Quite frankly I was not impressed. The garage is tiny for a hotel of this size with only 3 levels of parking. It took 30 minutes of searching to find a parking spot.  2 minutes later I saw my first pile of puke next to someone's car. Vegas attracts all the idiots which is why I hate it so much. Checking in was worse than the usual Vegas nightmare.  It took 40 minutes to get to the front of the line. The room was nice but who spends any time in their room in Vegas?

I've been to Vegas numerous times, but have never stayed at the Bellagio (as much as I always wanted to).  This time, we took the plunge.  It was our 20th Wedding Anniversary and we wanted it to be awesome.  

We booked a non smoking Deluxe Fountain View room two months in advance. We checked several times, up until the week before our trip, to confirm that our room was booked.  When we arrived, we quickly realized that check in is a bit of a pain.  There must've been at least 200 people standing in line to check in.  It's a big hotel, but wow!  And, as always, we must've picked the slowest moving line ever!  It took us well over 45 minutes just to get to the point of talking to the gal at the check in counter.  

Although we booked our room ahead of time, there was a problem with our room; they apparently only had a smoking room.  I'm not sure what the point of a reservation is, if they can't hold the room you're wanting.  And it's not like we were checking in way late; we arrived right around 3 pm.  After more time watching the gal sit on the phone, she came back and said they've found a non smoking room up on the 27th (or something similar) floor.  My husband said that would be fine as long as it was a fountain view room.  Back on the phone she goes.  After another 15 minutes just for that phone call, she says that room just had one bed (we needed two) so they found another fountain view non smoking room. Hallelujah!  But for our trouble, they did give us a $75 credit to use at select restaurants within the hotel, on top of the $80 credit we already had at ""The Buffet"" as a booking perk.  So, check in was a bit of a pain, especially with one very tired six year old on our hands.

The room was amazing.  The view was amazing.  You can tune the TV to a specific channel to listen to the music playing along with the fountain shows.  You cannot hear the music playing from outside, which is nice, however the really big water acts sound a bit like loud thunder during the night; not necessarily a bad thing.  

The staff were all very nice, if only a bit clueless on a few things.  Because it was our anniversary, they did bring us a nice box of fancy chocolates and a hand written ""congratulations"" card.  The grounds feature seven pools, with a couple reserved for special folks.  There's an outdoor pool cafe located right near the entrance to the pools.  The location is awesome, being very near the middle of the Strip.  There's a small Tram that'll take you to the Monte Carlo, Vdara and Crystals.  They've got free Wifi. The staff are pretty adamant about getting your attention; if you use the Do No Distrub sign on the door, and you truly do not want to be disturbed, you'd best unplug your phone... because they'll be calling ""just to let you know we noticed the sign on your door.""  

Having stayed at several other hotels on the Strip, and having visited most of the rest of them, I will say that the Bellagio is indeed one of the very nicest and I'm glad I got to stay there.  Will we stay there again?  Maybe!  While we do enjoy trying out a new hotel each time we visit, I did love our stay, even given a few minor annoyances. It was exactly the way I wanted to spend our 20th Anniversary!",1,0,0

We checked in during the evening (around 6pm) and when we arrived at our room, the door was open and there was a pair of dirty women's underwear sitting on top of the bathroom door as if the cleaning staff had put it up there and forgotten about it. We called downstairs and someone came up and got rid of them. The next morning, upon the sun shining in through the windows, fingerprints were covering the mirrored armoire doors, the drawer to the nightstand and the plate of the door handle on the room door. The carpet hadn't been vacuumed and the shower (especially the shower head) was caked in limescale. We went down to the front desk and told them what we found, even showed the person pictures so they knew we weren't just complaining to complain. She apologized and assured us she'd let the cleaning staff know to take care of it. I had packed everything we had into our suitcases, except my husband's prescription glasses, which were left sitting on the nightstand between the bed and the wall (the one without fingerprints). We were gone ALL DAY, returning around midnight. We arrived to find that whoever cleaned our room also decided to steal my husband's prescription eyeglasses, worth almost $400. We called security and were told to wait until morning since the staff works through the night and they turn things in around 8-9am. We waited until 10-11 and called. No one turned in any glasses. Shocker. We decided to make a report.

A lady with security came to the room and took a report, and we were told it would take 5-7 days for an investigation to be completed. I called today, 2+ weeks later and was told by another lady in security that it could take ""months and months"" for investigations to complete and that the status of our report would depend on how many reports were in front of us. Really? You have SO many security reports that it will take ""months and months"" to get the results and some kind of reimbursement??? That is such garbage. So now we have to fork out another $400 for new glasses that my husband needs for practically everything (night driving, reading, working, etc.) because your cleaning staff has butterfingers as revenge for not cleaning a room properly and someone calling them out on it?

I have stayed here a few times, usually as a wedding guest.  The Bellagio does a top notch job on weddings, and their prime rib is probably one of the best on the Strip.  I think it was probably the best wedding reception I've been to in all time.

As a guest, the rooms are spacious, and classy.  Their check in process is pretty fast, which says a lot considering the volume of guests they have.

The down side is EVERYONE wants to visit this casino, so there's wall to wall people miling around, gawking at the lobby, the holiday decorations and of course, the water show (which runs every 1\/2 hour until 8:00 pm, then every 15 minutes).

All in all, the service and opulent setting are what set the Bellagio apart from many other Vegas spots. Moreover, the  Bellagio has everything you could ask for on site: 5 star restaurants, an expansive casino, a luxurious spa and fitness center, stunning pools, fabulous shops, the Cirque show O, fun clubs and bars, and the best gelato in Vegas.  I love that you can enjoy so much of the Vegas scene without even leaving the building! On top of all that, the huge guest rooms are so inviting and pretty! The beds are perfectly comfortable and the bathrooms are massive.

A few of my favorite things about the Bellagio:

-The Cypress VIP Pool: While all the pools are nice, it's well worth the money to rent a cabana or chair at the Cypess Pool.  The amenities and service at Cypress are incredible, and the staff goes out of their way to make sure that you have a perfect day. I LOVE the constant delivery of amenities from fresh fruit to chilled towels while I relax in the sun.

-The spa and gym: They offer great fitness classes on site, the workout room is huge, and the spa offers an escape from the Vegas scene to a world of blissful serenity.  The service is incredible here as well, and the staff makes you feel like you are the most important person there.

-The security: The Bellagio is just about as safe as you can get in Vegas, and I love that security is everywhere. They won't let people in the hallways near the guest room elevators, or down the stairs to the pool level area, unless they are a registered guest and have a hotel room key.  

-The food options: Whatever you like to eat, they have it at the Bellagio and they make it the right way! A dear friend of mine who is on a gluten-free diet joined me on my last trip here, and the staff really bent over backwards to accommodate her dietary needs.  Even she had a ton of options to choose from! While I have never had a meal I didn't enjoy at the Bellagio, my favorite restaurants there include: Prime (incredible filet and seafood), Circo (Italian), and Todd English's Olives (more Italian).  If you have a sweet tooth, Jean-Phillipe offers treats that are to die for, especially the snickers chocolate mousse, and Cafe Gelato serves up incredible gelato in every flavor under the sun.

Wear comfy shoes because the place is HUGE....walked my stupid feet off in high heel wedges...came home with blisters...but I was cute, right??

Casino is pretty clean considering, it'sa casino and everyone smokes....but it wasn't terribly smoky. Lots of slots, my favorite being the Sex in the City machine! Won $500 on $20.....but then like everyone else does, my stupid ass put it back in the machine throughout the next 2 days and lost is all.

Several nice restaurants and shops.....the conservatory garden is beautiful! Stop by the largest chocolate fountain.

The biggest attraction at the Bellagio is the fountains...gorgeous choreographed sprays to music...and its free to all. The 2nd attraction is in their theatre...the Cirque Du Soleil show ""O"". I have never seen anything so stunning...amazing music, acrobats, all in WATER!! I've seen a few other Cirque shows, but this one was the best by far.....and 7 rows from the front I had an amazing view of it all....yep, beeee jealous!!

Room: There is nothing special about the room. Standard room with nothing special. If you overpaid for the room with the view then you'll at least get the fountain view. If not, you'll get the view of the... The freeway. 

Hotel: The hotel must have a horrible ventilation since the entire hotel is filled with cigarette fumes. You can't escape the smell you'll walk away smelling like the nasty smokers.  

Pool:  Pool was small and over crowded. We couldn't even find a spot to lay down and had to wait an hour or so. Horrible experience. 

Service: It was mediocre at best. If you call the front desk, expect to get transferred and put on hold for 10 minutes or more. Service you would get is just OK and nothing special. 

Bellagio Buffet: MOST DISAPPOINTING BUFFET EVER !!!!  Over priced and seriously nothing special to even write about it. Don't waste your money here. If you have kids, they'll have the adult rate, even at age 4. 

Overall, we ended up checking out early to switch hotel. We couldn't stand it here anymore after 2 nights.

The customer service was awful. You would think a bachelorette party of 8 females staying in a pricey suite could be accommodated... But instead the hotel messed up our reservations, didn't have our room ready on time, gave us DIRTY sheets, and then said there was nothing you could do to make it better. We paid over $2k for two nights and we got a room no better than my local Marriott. When we tried talking to the manager she was rude and not helpful at all. We didn't even want to be upgraded.... We just wanted the room we were told we had booked over 2 months ago. In the end our option was full refund if we could find someone else to stay (umm it was a Manny Paquio fight weekend- where the hell else would we go?!).

  My favorite thing is the interior design with this hotel. There's a indoor botanical garden that is absolutely magnificent and they change it every season. There's also floral blown glass on the lobby ceiling. It's breathtaking. Outside they have a huge water design with fountains and lights. Every night they do a water show where there's music, fountains shooting up and lights to go along with the show. LOVE this place. It's gorgeous. :)",1,0,1

My only complaint - please please please clean your service hallways.  I can smell it way down the hall on the way to and from my room and it makes my stomach turn every time.  More frequent bussing of the hallways may help too - I walked past the same leftover breakfast cart outside a neighboring room several times until after lunch.

** 02\/08\/08 Update **
If you're coming for business be very careful about paying for a room block in advance.  The nightmare that is billing has washed any good taste I had for the Bellagio right out of my mouth, dropping a four star review to one.  How is it possible that I can call the hotel weekly (sometimes a few times a week), to try to get a list of all the charges made to my credit card for over two months and still not have it?  Especially when the woman I just spoke to said, ""we get this all the time.""?!  
I've talked to so many people and been transferred and brushed off so many times; it wasn't until I threatened to dispute the charges with my credit card company AND had my company AP department contact them several times as well, that someone was actually able to help me.  How is that even possible?  Why would they be so against sending me a list of charges?
For two months of stress and anguish, I am totally pissed off at you Bellagio.  There are plenty of other hotels on the strip that would gladly take my 200+ room nights, and thanks to you, they'll get to in the future.",7,3,4

My buddy and I went and deliberately meant it to be a bit luxury and it was. From the limo pickup at the airport to the private check-in and incredible room to the luxury spa treatments we got. 

The bed and pillows were incredible as well.  I only wish I knew what brands and types they were. I slept so amazing. The website for Bellagioathome.com gives a type but it isn't for the penthouse suite. 

Bellagio hotel was a overall nice experience. For as old as it is, it has a great feeling about it. It was also Christmas time in the hotel and the decorations were great.

The elevator attendants were friendly and helpful, The room service was pricey but always extremely quick to deliver.  There are excellent dining options, like Olive, where we had a great overall dining experience. The chairman's lounge offers complementary beverages and snacks, which we only used twice during our three day visit. The second time I went to grab a few waters and an orange juice, The clerk behind the desk approached me and scolded me for taking too many beverages. Apparently she thought I loaded my bag up which was filled with a toy and sweater for my daughter! I was truly appalled that management would train their staff to limit customers to complementary items.

What a wonderful first night in Vegas.  An exceptional hotel from all aspects.  The hotel amenities, the rooms, the fountains, and the conservatory.  A truly wonderful hotel on the strip.

We didn't end up dining here so I can't speak to that.  We did a little slot gambling that was enjoyable, lots of slot options which is always nice.
