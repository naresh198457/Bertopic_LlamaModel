I stayed here last week for my vacation, not at all what I expected the service and people are not worth the price.  They have no idea what customer service means, only the front desk do unfortunately.  If it weren't for the front desk I would give it 1 star only.

I went to the concierge to ask for a great  Italian restaurant for lunch.  Unfortunately concierge recommended a restaurant they haven't eaten because the food was horrible you can read it from my other review Dal Toro, don't go there please. 

I went back to concierge after lunch to ask where can we sit since we are waiting to check in and it's not 3pm yet.  A lady told me there is no sitting area, we have to go to a cafe.  I thought this is odd, a big hotel like this no seating area. I can't bring my kid to the gaming area, this is why I need a place for her. I found at least 3 areas on my own, thanks for nothing... 

I got to my room, the cheese crumbs was still on the couch.  My hubby is nice enough to clean.  We had to wait 2 hrs for our luggage from the bell boys. REALLY!!! My husband had to call to ask them about it. 

We ended up sleeping in a comforter that was wrapped with a fitted sheet, which means no comforter cover and no sheets. We got hot at night and realized there was no sheets... The next day I asked a house keeper is it normal they don't provide sheets for the bed. It turns out my room wasn't clean.  Oh great mind you I took a bath and used the bathroom too. Now I am really disgusted.  

The housekeeper told me he will talk to the manager for me. They offer to clean my room ASAP. It turns out the room was clean and the new sheets had stains on it. 

I had it and went to the front desk and told an associate of my dilemmas with the hotel. She apologized and comp me $75.  Really for how much crap I endured with my family $75 should be fine. I didn't really care at this point, I will never go back. 

The next house keeper changed the sheets and told me she couldn't give me new wine glasses and that I have to call priority desk. OMG! 

The rest of the time the guests that stay here are nicer than the staff.  The guests would  greet each other, but the staff don't greet you even when you talk to them.  It's like your inconveniencing them!!!

The hotel is beautiful.  Next time I will only stay at the Wynn.",0,2,0

I do not think that I can ever go back to another hotel after staying here. I sure was spoiled scoring a room here! Between the amazing decor, soft King size bed, to the TV in the bathroom (that had both a shower and tub) and the sitting\/office area I was in heaven. And the staff couldn't have been more accommodating, helpful and friendly. Now this is how you should feel \/be treated at every hotel. You defiantly feel like you are staying at a resort when you are staying at the Palazzo. 

I also really enjoyed the fitness facility, high end shops, and delicious restaurants that the Palazzo offers. I didn't get a chance to check out the pools, but I am sure they are just as amazing as the rest of the hotel and it's facilities.

The pool at Palazzo is very chill on a Friday.  I noticed a lot of families with young children.  They need more cocktail servers, I saw only 2 working the entire area so we had to go to the bar to get drinks.  

On Sat, we woke up too late to get a cabana at Tao Beach so we opted for Azure, which is Palazzo's version of TB.  We got a cabana with a pretty sweet location in between the two pools in Azure.  The minimum for the cabana was $750.  Bottles are less expensive at Azure then they are at the clubs so we were able to get 2 Greygoose and plenty of food.  What I remembered tasting good was Azure's lobster salad, cheeseburger and salmon pizza.  Service was excellent.  Estelle was there and sang a couple of songs so that was cool and they had a modeling show.  The crowd at Azure was good but more tamed than Tao Beach.  All in all, a very good experience.",1,0,0

It was wonderful to see it over Valentine's Day filled with brides and red roses everywhere.  This year, Valentine's Day and the Chinese New Year fell on the same day, so the hotel was filled with people celebrating and having fun. It was festive.

When we checked in, the agent was very helpful.  We were supposed to be in the Venetian, so he got our reservation transferred rather than sending us away.  He managed to get us a room that was ready so that was good. 

Once we settled in, we went to lunch and then walked around.  It is a very lovely hotel with lots of things to do and see. However, when it came to customer service, they were not stellar.

They took more than four hours and four phone calls to bring us linens and pillows for the pull out sofa for our daughter. That was not good.  After getting frustrated at a fairly simple request, I called the front desk manager, Francesca, and she made things happen.  Finally. She did apologize and I think she really tried to make things better.

Then the next day, my husband was not thrilled when they said it would take 35 - 45 minutes to come get the luggage for check out.  Since I already left for my conference, he had to manage the luggage and the kid by himself.  That was not easy.  

In addition, when he was reviewing our bill at check out, there were a couple of items that were overcharged and he had to have them corrected.  It did not fill me with confidence in their staff.

While the Palazzo has the makings for a terrific hotel, it is not the 5-star customer service experience one would expect.  They can do much better with a little training.  Maybe they can get the staff from The Hotel at Mandalay Bay to give them a few pointers.",2,1,2

I consider this one of the best places to park on the strip because coming from interstate 15, you just exit Spring Mountain, head eastbound and it's the first right after the LV Blvd. This area is great because it's near the Fashion Show Mall, Wynn\/Encore and is attached to Venetian.

Once you park in that lot, just take the elevator up and you're right at the entrance to the hotel rooms\/casino or Lavo. Important note: there are ALWAYS available parking spots when I'm here. The casino area is spacious, Lagasse is also the biggest sports book with the best seating and Lavo is a nice ultra lounge\/restaurant.

I didn't think the staff were very polite. When my husband was checking in, the lady at the desk said, glancing at me: ""Would you like to add 'her' to the booking?"", not 'your wife' (as had been established already during this process) or even addressing me as a person! The room was okay, but very dark, with insufficient lighting. We didn't really using the sunken lounge bit at the bottom; i found its dark furniture quite uninviting.
We had breakfast included and this was the worst part of the stay. You had to order room service, which took about 30-45 minutes. that was okay. But the food was cooked according to how the kitchen made it; it didn't matter what you ordered. Your fried eggs were well done and that was it, unless of course you asked for soft boiled eggs, in which case they had barely been shown the water. One morning they insisted on setting up our breakfast next door, ignoring the occupants' protestations that such a request had not been made! Then despite our order, all four people got scrambled eggs and bacon regardless! The food was universally horrible.
They claim to have 'a smoke-free corridor' through the casino to the hotel rooms. It's not.

When we first arrived, I was helped by Robert at the front desk. He was a lovely gentleman who took care of us and made our stay special. We loved the place at first sight. This hotel had a more intimate feeling than the Venetian. The Bella suite at first entry seemed like it was clean. We had a great view in room 22-730 and it was quiet. 

   Then housekeeping services were needed. I called in a request for replacement robes as the housekeeper did not replace the ones we placed on the floor. Over 1.5hrs came and went, but no one dropped by. A second phone call was made to find out that the person who took the assignment marked the job as completed. That was not something I would expect from a hotel like this. It didn't take long for the delivery of the robes upon after completing the second call. 

    Another thing that disappointed me with housekeeping was the lack of bathroom cleaning. The towels have been replaced and items on the counter have been rearranged. But the tub and the shower were not cleaned. I could see my hair in the shower and soap scum. Also,  the residue outline in the tub from the bath bomb was still there. This was something I did not experience at the Venetian during my stays there. 

   I have to say the worst part of it all was that I had forgotten my jacket in the suite and had realized it late after check out. I called the hotel that evening and was told it had not been logged in yet. So I left my phone number so I could be contacted. Well, I just called back today and spoke to Karen. She said that they had not found my jacket. I told her that was strange and asked if there was any recourse for this. She said I could file a police report (if I believed that a housekeeping staff took it). So I decided to do so- for what is a $40 jacket. That jacket was of sentimental value to me. 

    I feel that my jacket should have been found as it was left on their property- in the room. No compensation of some sort was even offered. 

    I liked the fact that it seemed more intimate than Venetian, but I feel like I could trust the staff there than I did here at the Palazzo.

     I don't believe I would stay here again if I don't hear back from them.

What I liked about The Palazo though is that while the next door Venetian Hotel felt like half-price day at the neighborhood flea market, The Palazzo still felt relatively quiet.

However, I base this review on my most recent stay, which was greatly affected by poor and inefficient service...

Everything was dandy until check out time... We give the bellhop desk a call about 10min prior to check out and end up waiting 45-55 minutes for someone to finally come up to the room.  I get that around check out, things can get busy, but you are a lovely, big arss hotel and have plenty of people on staff (I would think) to accommodate the number of guests you have on a Friday morning. 

Glad that we finally had someone to help with the luggage we picked up the car and gave the ticket to the bell desk at the front of the hotel, and proceeded to wait for our luggage for AN HOUR.  Finally after inquiring AGAIN about our luggage, they tell us we have to go to the other entrance of the hotel to pick up our luggage....how about you tell me that right after I GAVE YOU THE TICKET?  And hello customer service, why don't you send our luggage where we've been waiting for the past hour?  Thank you for wasting our time and having your ish together. 

So finally we drive to the other entrance, wait another 10min to get our stuff.  THANK GOD we didn't have plans to see a show or a flight to catch!  For such a nice hotel I am surprised at how they can have people there that operate this way.  I would be hesitant to stay there again just because of how frustrating and ridiculous that was. It's not like I took a flight across the country and had my luggage lost...

The average two bed at Palazzo is only slightly smaller than a Parlor Suite at the Wynn. The bathrooms are not as nice as the Wynn's or Mandalay's, but this is more than made up for by the added space to the main room. 

The location of Palazzo couldn't be better. It's perfectly in the heart of the strip and most of the best clubs are in walking distance. However, the staff are particularly unhelpful in directing you out of the property and will actually WILLFULLY MISDIRECT you towards the canal shops in some bizarre attempt to get you to shop there regardless of where you intended to go.

This brings us to the downside. The service is terrible. Even if you're playing hundred dollar plus hands you will not get a drink in a reasonable time frame. The front desk said to call them for late check out, however, both stays here I attempted this and was stone-walled with a 20 minute hold while music played and then met with a front desk girl that was the most unpleasant person I have dealt with-- She reminded me of the voice from 1408, with an insane sense of smugness-- ""No"" was clearly her favorite word and she was unwilling to compromise on any point. It was terrible dealing with her. On both days that I requested late checkout she claimed that it would be impossible. It was as if she sincerely believed that all the hotel rooms would be cleaned promptly by noon and that every room would be booked on a Sunday. Seriously?

The Concierge desk is significantly better than their other service and will help you out if you are a hotel guest, especially with clubs\/guestlist, etc-- it's a refreshing change.

But other than that, the service here fails to meet the targets that it should and needs improvement to match the Wynn or other hotels.",2,1,1

We stayed at Aria for two nights and then decided to stay another night in Vegas, so we booked Palazzo (since our stay at Aria was very mediocre).

Room had three TVs (one in the living area, one in the bedroom area, one in the bathroom). Room had a huge bathroom and the furniture was all very nice - not overdone, just really perfect - what I'd expect from a five-star hotel.

Not much else to say on the room itself since we were only there for one night - everything worked as expected.

I ordered room service for dessert about midnight. Was initially told it'd be about 40 minutes, but they got there in about 15 minutes and were very friendly.

All the rooms are huge with separate sleeping and ""living"" areas.  The bathrooms are amazing with separate shower and tubs and quality amenities.  The floor to ceiling windows have great views and the automated curtains are sweet.  The gaming area is well ventilated and there's no lingering smell of smoke at all. It's a little more on the pricey side but worth it if you're taking your lady (or man).",0,0,0

I stayed here for 2 weekday nights in their King Suite (720 sq ft) which is their standard room and I was highly impressed by the overall hotel and room decor.  Very spacious and extravagant. The suite was so big, I did not get to utilize the sunken living room. 

Their pool was decent. I loved the area where they placed lounge chairs in the pool, where you can relax & get a nice tan without being baked by the sun.  I went during the summer months and one of the pool attendants gave everyone an ice-cold towel to cool down which is spectacular!

As with all of the resorts on the strip, they charge a daily resort fee of $25 to use their internet access and fitness center.

Great price, $129\/night plus 2 tickets to Phantom. No complaints other than the shower head.  Let's just say it was not gentle at all.",0,1,0

I decided to stay here for my 28th birthday with a couple of my girlfriends. When I got to the room it SMELLED AWFUL. I expected the cigarette smell but it also smelled musty. After settling in and unpacking I found the previous guests' clothes in the drawers and socks beside the bed.  Spoke with the front desk and they provided me with a air purifier and came and got the clothes. Problem fixed and everything would be smooth sailing. NOT. We brought our own liquor and juice and we needed the fridge. Spoke with the front desk and they said it was ok to remove the mini bar inside and to put them in the drawer until we left so that we wouldn't get charged. To my surprise the next morning my card was charged over $300 on my birthday. Spoke with the front desk manager again and we got the issue resolved with my bank. Ok great. The manager offered me a $100 drink and beverage credit or a refund on my resort fee. I chose the resort fee. My room NEVER got cleaned the whole time we stayed and I literally called everyday and no one ever came. Once I got home I realized the hotel STILL charged me the resort fee after all. I called and spoke with the manager and they said it was nothing they could do because they didn't have any record of the incidents and I couldn't remember the manager that so spoke with.  NEVER AGAIN . Completely ruined that part of my first Vegas experience,0,0,0

Newer than the Venetian, I found the facilities to be of higher functioning quality and cleaner.  We were lucky enough to snag a Strip-view room on the 39th floor and enjoyed watching the Treasure Island volcano erupt at night.  

Conference staff were top-notch and the rest of our interactions with staff members were a mixed bag with some going out of their way to be of assistance (Security) while others couldn't be bothered (Grazie and Housekeeping).  

In fact, my only real negative experiences were with housekeeping for a variety of reasons  including some cleanliness issues like not exchanging the wine\/water glasses and former guest business cards and rubbish on the floor as well.  I was also disappointed that they did not visit my room twice during my five night stay, even though it was available from 11-5.  I also noticed that even though the hotel conserves water only changing sheets when requested, it also claims the sheets will be changed on your 3rd night regardless and they were not.  

None of these issues are terribly significant but I was surprised to be asked on my second day there why I had not left the room yet and if I had a late check-out -- I explained I was actually there for 3 more nights.  On the actual check-out day, housekeeping attempted to enter the room at 9:30 am and luckily I had the bar lock over the door preventing their entry because they provided a quick rudimentary knock before attempting to open the door.

Resort Fee Tip: The resort fee includes a complimentary newspaper and coffee daily at Cafe Presse on the second floor near the guest elevators - don't miss it!  Fee also includes access to the fitness facility with a variety of cardio, assisted weights, and free weights available.  Unfortunately I only found out on my last day there that I could pay $20 to attend a group fitness class which would give me access to the various water features of the spa for the remainder of the day.",1,0,0

Last time we stayed at the Wynn which was a disaster and we instanly changed our reservation to this hotel and cancel the rest of our reservation with Wynn. Wynn's hotel is getting old and they have very poor standard and poor up keep to their hotel rooms. Palazzo offers many restaurants and many retail shops to shop. Casino is much cleaner and air quality within casino is very good. We will be coming back in November soon to celebrate an Anniversary. We love this hotel with spacious spaces. See you soon Palazzo!

Palazzo has better parking(imo) once you get to know their crazy setup. I'm also not saying the parking at the Venetian is bad....its just like saying you can park 10 feet closer to the door.....its not a HUGE deal but every little bit helps when you have to lug around peoples luggage. I'm sure all of the other reviews have covered everything about their awesome service, how accomodating they are, how seamless the entire experience is so I'm not gonna bother adding to it. 

My only complaint, they dont have a nice big jacuzzi tub to soak in when youre losing your ass in the casino and want to call it a night an relax. haha",0,1,0

The rooms at the Palazzo are nice. You can get a suite with 2 queen beds and a lounge area with a fold out sofa bed. Perfect for hanging out - lots of room for all those girls and their luggage. 

It's nice to have so many good restaurants in the building too - Thomas Keller, Mario Batali, Emeril, etc. Perhaps this is standard along the strip. Although there are no current ""it"" spots in the hotel (pool, restaurant, bars, spa) everything is nice enough that if you didn't care about getting into the hottest spots in town you could just hang out here the entire time and not leave.  

There's no special lobby here though it's connected to the Venetian and its fake canals (which I abhor) and they have carnival people walking around. I have to go on record to say that these places capture none of the charm of Venice and frankly it's very mall like and creepy.

We got a killer deal that included breakfast for 2 plus a $100 food credit to use at select restaurants. There's a resort fee of $25 per room for wifi and gym use. If you plan on using the day spa though it's only $20 per person - $40 without the resort fee so keep that in mind.",1,1,1

He gave me a very generous budget for a 3-night stay to enjoy ourselves and he said he didn't care what I spent it on.  I'm a huge researcher and after hours and hours scanning all of the hotels and the reviews I chose The Palazzo for our stay.  I doubt we could have afforded to ever stay here so I took advantage of my budget and spent a good portion on our room.  We had the best time from check-in, Hugo was great, to check out via email.  Valet parking is FREE, hello, who does that and they were quick each time we needed our car. The Palazzo is absolutely beautiful with all of the light marble and décor, light and bright! The smoking in the casinos was not too terrible and I'm extremely sensitive to smoke.  The security at the elevators was much appreciated as well as the mini store just before the elevator.  As stated in other reviews, we had no problem\/no wait at check-in and no wait to get on the elevators.

Our ""Luxury King"" room, which is their ""standard"" room, was one of the newly renovated rooms.  WOW, for a ""standard""  room you will not find a nicer one anywhere, I did my research! Other hotels that may have a room such as this would call it a suite and charge you a considerable amount more!  I booked directly with The Palazzo as I have heard of horror stories with other sites and the rate was steady, the other sites that did advertise a cheaper deal I had never heard of before, too risky. Yes, they do charge a resort fee as do most of the larger hotels on the strip, it includes WiFi, entry into their spa, free parking, 6+ pools, pool bars, etc.  I'm not a fan of resort fees but this is Vegas - what I appreciated was the fact that there are two hotels (The Venetian) linked to each other with a ton of pools, shops, restaurants, bars, casinos, etc and therefore, we didn't enter out onto the strip once!  If it's your first time, of course you want to venture out but this was not our first rodeo in Vegas and so we had no real desire to venture out into the crowds and the heat.  We had a great time within our ""resort""!

The room, gorgeous, spotless and luxurious!  We had a view of The Wynn, their pools and the beautiful golf course and mountains.  I'm a real stickler for germs but this room was so new and the carpet and floors so clean that it's the first time EVER that I walked around a hotel room in my bare feet. Plenty of dresser\/closet storage. A table in the living room where our breakfast was served every morning, most rooms only offer a very small table, this could easily seat 4 people.  We chose the option of ""Breakfast in Bed"" each morning because we like to take our time, relax a little and not be rushed to meet a breakfast deadline.  The in-suite dining staff were awesome, from placing the order each evening to the servers.  The breakfast, considering it's only a $15\/night fee, was outstanding, tons of food and a real savings compared to going out to breakfast.  It took us right thru the day before we were hungry for dinner.  No ""surprise"" charges at the end of our stay, I tipped the server each day upon delivery.

We enjoyed hanging out at the pools and you have access to The Venetian's pools so there are at least 6 pools to choose from and you don't have to go into each hotel to get to the pools, once you've entered the pool area, it's a very quick walk to The Venetian's pools.  The bartenders, Gary and Christopher are on their game!  We enjoyed sitting there watching them make drinks.

We ate dinner at the Grand Luxe Café and it was impressive, not at all what I expected it to be. It was very nicely decorated, was more like a nice restaurant than the standard ""diners"" you get in hotels.  Their menu is extensive and their food was delicious! My husband had the rib eye steak with mushrooms and I had the baby back ribs, so yummy!  Our server Chris was extremely personable and did an excellent job taking care of us.

All restaurants are accessible between the two hotels, just a stroll thru the Grand Canal Shops.  We ate at - Grimaldi's in The Palazzo, the honest to goodness best pizza we have ever had. Buddy V's in The Venetian was very good but we thought it was a bit pricey for the lack of ambiance and noise factor.  B&B Burger and Beer, excellent burgers and we chose to eat outside which is right on the water so we could watch the gondolas come and go.

If we are sent there again thru work, we will most definitely be returning to The Palazzo.  Excellent and friendly customer service from check-in, parking garage valets, elevator security, restaurant servers, room service, pool staff and housekeeping.  I've been in customer service for 40 years so I'm an excellent judge of great customer service!  Thanks Palazzo for a wonderful stay!",5,0,3

We've heard nothing but rave reviews about it. However, our experience wasn't stellar. We had a ""Bella Suite"" which was nice, but we've had just as nice at other hotel suites. Our FIRST problem was the shower not draining. The showers are stand-in showers, which means the barrier between the shower and the rest of the bathroom is about 1\/4 an inch. So, shower drain clogged=entire bathroom floor flooding!! We called 4 times over the span of 3 hours requesting someone to take care of this problem and every time we called (before the final fourth time), the operator said ""We have no record of this request"". UGH! ANNOYING! Stop lying about saying you'll send someone ""right away""!! The DVD player didn't work in the room either and it had to be replaced. When we checked out, we explained our situation and all we kept getting was ""We'll investigate this. Please understand we have so many guests..."" For a 5-star hotel that's this expensive, YOU NEED BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE. Taking my business over to ANOTHER HOTEL! Booooo....Oh, and P.S. One of their selling points is the pull-out bed from the L-shaped sofa. It's the size of a TWIN, not a full and certainly not a queen size.",2,1,0

Fianace and I decided to splurge and upgrade to the Fortuna suite.  Let me describe how NOT worthwhile this upgrade is.  The normal suites are beautiful and make good use of the space.  For the Fortuna,  you pay approx $100 more for two more chairs.  That's all they've done with the extra square footage. The bathroom is exactly the same, the living room is exactly the same, they just put a bed around a corner and we had more floor space to throw our clothes. NOT worth it.

They also neglected to give us our coupons during checkin - which I didn't figure out until the morning of checkout when I couldn't get my free coffee.  The checkout employee wasn't unkind about my experience but also offered no reprieve.",2,1,1

Modern, lavish, and a great value for the money. Their rooms are perfect for some extra party crashers as they have a huge sunken living room with a nice L-shaped sofa area. It is great for pre-partying or just to lounge.

As we were hotel guests, they gave us guest list into Lavo and wristbands for free mixed drinks! Fabulous way to start out the evening. Who doesn't love free drinks!?! Another perk of the hotel is being so close to Bouchon for a meal or just to go the bakery for some sweets.

A couple things I was disappointed by though included the fact that we booked the bella suite and they ran out so we only had one king bed instead of two queens and they also only gave us two bath towels so we had to call for more...which of course took forever.

All in all though, it is a fabulous hotel.",1,0,1

I guess, when reviewing Vegas hotels, you have to look at a much larger picture than just the rooms.  So, in that case, I can honestly say, the Palazzo is the nicest hotel in Vegas.  The casino itself wasn't very big, but just a short walk through the shoppes takes you to the Venetian where you have all the gaming you want.  The decor was absolutely fabulous with a huge waterfall in one of the lobbies.  The Shoppes are easily accessible and we didn't have any problems finding what we needed.

I can't speak for all the rooms, but the layout of ours was very nicely done.  On one side of the room, we had a nice L-shaped couch with a fair sized LCD TV.  The other side of the room had two queen size beds.  The room was separated by a small wall and although I didn't totally feel I was in a separate room, it somewhat felt like I was.

I've never stayed at a hotel in Vegas more than once because it always seems like I can find a better deal somewhere else.  I've lived in LA more most of my life, so I've been to Vegas on a regular basis.  I've stayed at the high priced ones like Bellagio, Venetian, Ceasar's and the lower priced ones like MGM, Luxor, Monte Carlo.  Out of them all, I like this one the best.  I know I might be speaking too soon because I haven't had a chance to stay at Wynn, but for the ones I have stayed at, this one has to be the best.  I would definitely stay again.",3,1,1

The rooms - Since it's also the property of The Venetian Hotel & Casino, the suites are similar in design with 2 queen beds, a sunken den with it's own LCD screen, pull-out sofa bed and wrap around couch, double-door entrance to the restroom with LCD screen TV  above the mirror, 2 sinks and toilet area with its own door & phone. Very spacious suite. I've seen the bigger suites which have a double door entrance, full bar and separate bedroom and living area. Very nice... These rooms are quite updated from the rooms at The Venetian. They use a darker marble and the suite, in general, looks a little more modern and refined. 

The pool - Love the Palazzo pool. Even when staying at the Venetian we find our way to the Palazzo pool. The pool areas of both of these hotels are connected so you can shuttle back and forth. Kids pool, big wading pool, smaller side pools and jacuzzi area. Cafe right at the entrance allows you to order sandwiches and salads to eat nearby. There's a full bar for drinks and there's the Azure pool party if you want to hear music and avoid the craziness at Tao Beach in the summertime. Pool attendants are helpful in securing you a lounge chair and towels.

Grand Lux Cafe - This place is open 24-7. There's a Grand Lux also in the Venetian but it closes around midnight. So if you've ever been in Vegas and are hungry for a decent meal after the club, it's such a luxury to have a restaurant with the consistency of Grand Lux in your hotel. My daytime meal of choice is the kids meal of hand-battered chicken strips. Always hits the spot. And it's by no means a kids sized portion. Good stuff. There's a take-out counter so it's very convenient for ordering food and drinks.

The club - Lavo is always a good time. A roman bathhouse themed nightclub. Sound is great, lights are dope and it's a lot smaller than Tao so it's usually not as crazy. DJ Skratchy is our favorite DJ there. He definitely keeps the crowd movin. And if you wanna have a chill drink, Lavo lounge downstairs has an outdoor patio over looking the Strip and directly across from TI and its pirate show. Always a great option.

Valet parking - Never a long wait. Pickup is underground (with misters to keep you cool) so you're not exposed to the Vegas heat as much in the summertime. There's also an air conditioned waiting room if it gets too hot. 

Always a good time staying here, as a whole... Never disappoints. Thank you Palazzo.",1,0,0

But chose Palazzo due to its vicinity to the strip and better deal. We will certainly like to come back again and stay here if we plan to visit Vegas again. Rooms are pretty good, I would say very spacious and nicely done. Casino floor is good as well, not as in your face as MGM grand or couple other resorts on the strip but certainly had enough slot machines and table games to cater to one's gambling itch. Location is also very very nice,  it is owned by Venetian and connects via forum shops to Venetian. You can enjoy all the ambience, nice restaurants, gondola rides without madness of the strip. I would say it's for the crowd that do not want to be in midst of hip, club type atmosphere while around Aria or Cosmopolitan Very good front desk and support staff,  free parking garage in the basement so an easy access for you to park and check in. Only complaints or I would say nuisance is that as an FYI.. Once you check into the room and have kids with you, don't let them turn on the television because as soon as you turn it on, by default it starts playing promotion for adult channels that may make for embarrassing situation. Not sure why Palazzo would have that setup that way, it always can be more discreet. Similarly they have a small beverage section by the refrigerator that is filled with all types of beverages and is cool but obviously little pricey, but  between all the refreshments is an adult intimacy kit for sale as well that a kid can unknowingly get access to. Other than these couple nitpicks, I would say Palazzo is definitely a good bang for your buck.",1,0,0

I thought ""saving"" would be frowned upon, but I talked to a lifeguard and he said that they do allow it, but if it's gets really crowded and lounge chairs are limited, they only let a space stay vacant for 30 minutes before they put it up for grabs.  

Drinks can be slow going if you use a server so just mosey on up to the bar yourself for faster service.  The iced towels and orange slices were a nice touch.   Food can be purchased at the Canyon Ranch Grill or at Solaro.  The turkey sandwich on pretzel bread rocked.

We were there last October for the Timberlake concert and paid so much for the room.    Not surprising when there are concerts so we knew it would be expensive.  The room was HUGE!  We asked for a king but got two queens.  We don't tend to be particularly picky so we said it was fine.  The bathroom was huge too and the view was nice.   The reasons I gave it two stars was because of the service. We tend to leave our room so that housekeeping comes and takes care of the mess.  I'm normally not messy because I'm kind of a clean freak so is not like we had trash lying around or anything. We left for four hours.  We figured that should be enough time to get our room cleaned.  We called to get our room clean on top of that because we slept in.  Hey at almost $300  a night.... I figured I can get room service whenever I want.   When we got back  about an hour an a half before our concert our keys didn't  work...  BOTH OF THEM! It took them about 40 minutes for them to get our door opened.  I wasn't happy because I had to rush to get ready.  i rushed so much I broke my FULL CHANEL bottle on the floor by accident.  On top of that... they didn't even clean our room.  I was very disappointed.   They didn't charge us the resort fee for the inconvenience but we didn't even use the pool or gym so it didn't matter to us.  They kept our deposit money for about a week which my husband was not happy about at all! Never again will I stay at the Palazzo.  I rather stay at the Trump nearby.,0,0,0

I want to hug things when I walk in, before any beverages I might add. Yes, it's beautiful and expansive. Yes, it has a ton of GREAT dining options. Yes, the location is marvelous.  Is that why I love this place?

Nope. 

Well, not the main reason. It's the service. Do some have more smiles to offer than others? Sure. But every. single. employee. here is courteous and ready to go above and beyond at any given second. I feel like the world's most exciting VIP when I stay here - despite being neither exciting nor a VIP. So the service puts this place tops in my book. That and the food.

Oh, the food. You can't take a single step without tripping over a menu that is drool worthy here. But why even bother taking a step?  The room service menu selections are equally delectable. It is my humble opinion that room service is often overlooked in favor of higher end\/pricier restaurant dining options. I get that. From a business perspective, it makes sense.  However, when I'm vacationing in a room as splendid as the one provided at the Palazzo, I may very well decide to spend multiple meal times lounging in my pjs basking in the comfort that is my suite. Don't judge me, it's glorious. I'll traipse in Europe. In Vegas, I'll lounge.  I digress. 

The breakfast is outstanding from Benedict to waffle.  So are the late night options. I haven't been excited about a chicken finger since I was 7...until the Palazzo chicken fingers arrived. Delicious! And the pizza - they used real mozzarella. Not the ""real"" shredded kind, but the *gasp* REAL globby kind that is the only mozzarella that should ever be used - or spoken of, for that matter. Again, the restaurant dining options here are fantastic and I don't recommend you skip them. But also let yourself enjoy an in-room snack. Your taste buds will thank you. Probably your feet, too.",6,2,3

After tipping for the service, was offered a complimentary upgrade+view. The suite was close to the elevator,  itself was beautiful, however the view was a little disappointing. But we do love the room! Why then only 2 stars?

1) House keeping was disappointing, had to call in order to ensure we get our rooms cleaned (and yes we did tip for house keeping as well)
2) After coming back to our suite from our trip - we noticed that house keep supplies were left in our bathroom, since priority service line & front desk line took a long time to respond we ended up placing it back on a cleaning kart in the hallways.
3) Room service food was meh ..food was COLD, and for the price of $90 for 2 meals, we expected a lot more.
4) What was worse was the check out part. 
A) We did not receive a receipt in our email, turned out that they sent it to the wrong email - it would be a lot nicer if they were to confirm all the information taken down was correct.
B) We paid for a full vacation package, and upon check out we noticed that we were billed for the room!!!! Luckily we stayed behind and ensure that we received the receipt. Can you imagine after coming home from a nice vacation and found out that you were billed incorrectly? The service person could not make decision on the spot when obviously this was an error on their end and had to get an approval from a manager (which i understand) - however having to stand there and wait was not fun especially if you're in a rush to go else where (eg. airport!), at one point i even said to the agent ""you know what, it's only $109 - it's okay forget it"" ..Anyways, they were able to resolve it at the end. Got the pictures of all the receipts  AND FOR OUR INCONVENIENCE..they gave us two pens (lol) sigh..

Review? Meh, I've experienced better.

Tip? Service in general was decent, as long as you're polite and tip well you can pretty much get what you ask for done. But expect to wait or having to make that request on your own (house keepig) - oh and dont try the room service, not worth the money.

Advice? Didn't have to do this when i visited other hotels but i guess human error & mistakes can happen .. double check your bill\/receipt before you leave! :-)

To sum it all up, it was a short vacation, we didnt get as much done as we like so we definitely will be returning to vegas.. but we would reconsider whether or not if we would like to return to Palazzo.",0,0,0

We had a lengthy conversation regarding all the Cirque du Soleil productions, gossiped a little about Steve Wynn and the corporate break-up that led to the birth of Le Reve, and traded tips on the fabulous celebrity chef restaurants. He assured me that dinner at Joel Robuchon would be ""the best meal of my life"" (as it was his and many others before him) and gave me a list of a few unknown casual off-Strip eateries commonly frequented by visiting celebrity chefs, sommeliers (Robert Parker), and Cirque du Soleil performers. (I assure you, losing that list was not fun.)

By the end of the conversation, he had upgraded us to the Palazzo Bella, with a view of the Strip. I realize it's not ""the best room in the resort,"" but it was beautiful just the same, and wonderful coming back to such a clean, spacious, and comfortable room every night after all that walking around the Strip followed by dinners and shows.. The bathtub was big enough for two to relax in, and the sitting area allowed us to sit and chat over bubbly whenever we wanted.. We had 2 LCDs in the actual bedroom, and another one in the bathroom.

I recommend this place highly if you can swing the weekend rate of $169...although bear in mind that they add on hotel tax, sale tax, and then add on a $17 resort fee per day so you will end up paying over $200 per night. 

If you stay here, ask the checkin clerk for line passes to LAVO, and make sure see if they have any vouchers for freebies (they do - sometimes you have to slip a tip to get them though).

The pool areas are very nice. While crowded, you'll find these a little more relaxed than  other pools around Las Vegas. Make sure to order a pitcher of sangria while you relax in the pool all afternoon.

I've probably stayed here four times already. I crashed here last weekend after a night of partying since my sister had a room. The beds are SO soft. It's almost like sleeping on a cloud. My sister was so amazed at how soft they were that she started taking off the bedding to find the mattress brand. The rooms are also very spacious and can easily sleep 6 people (if you get the double queen room) because it also has a sofa bed. If you plan on renting a room with that many people, you should get a little ""occupied"" sign for the bathroom door though because it doesn't have a lock.

The rooms are all suites and most offer a sunken in living room with luxurious plush couches and coffee tables.  Great for having people over for a few drinks and pre-gaming before hitting the club!  The beds are super comfortable and the bathrooms are huge.  

The only con about this hotel is the pool.  I'm just not impressed.  It seems a bit dated and I think it could use an update. While its not the worst, if the pool is really important to you, there are far better pools on the Strip. 

Ive stayed at some of the newer places, like Aria at the new LV City Center but Palazzo still shines even though she is a bit older than some of the newer establishments.  I'm not sure Id pay top dollar to stay here, as there is an influx of hotels on the strip and you can typically get really good rates on really nice rooms at newer hotels, BUT, if you can snag a good rate here, its definitely worth it.",2,0,0

It is right in the middle of the strip, you can walk to Wynn\/Encore very easily, across the street from the Mirage (Jet nightclub).  You can also walk to Caesar's Palace, but I think that might be easier if you have had a few drinks.

I also like the hotel itself.  Its really beautiful in the lobby and around the shops.  The rooms are nice and big. They have a large living room area with small dining table, desk, and a large L shaped couch that folds out into a bed.  This allows for about 6 people to sleep comfortably in the room.

The bathroom is nice and large, and includes a vanity area to sit and do your hair\/make-up.  There is also a large soaker tub and a separate shower.

In total the room has 3 TVs, one in the living room area, 1 in the bedroom area next  to the living room (usually separated by a step) and 1 in the bathroom which I particularly enjoy while I'm getting ready for a night out.

The other great thing about the Palazzo is that there is a giant Walgreens in the Venetian shops area that will have everything you might need or you might have forgotten.

When we asked for blankets it did take about an hour to receive them, but I think that's because they take that as a red flat of more people being in the room than should be = )

They also charged for cups (I forgot plastic ones) and a knife ( to cut limes).  It was 4.32, and I wasn't particularly bothered by it.

The pools at the Palazzo are also nice because they connect to the Venetian so you can enjoy either way.  I particularly enjoy the shallow pool that allows you to be half in the water and half out when you are in it, I'm not sure why I enjoy that so much but I do.  There are several regular pools you can spend time at, as well as outdoor spas.  

I also went to the Canyon Ranch spa, I will save the full review for that specific item, but as an overview I thought it was a really great place for more relaxation and not so much for socializing with friends.  I preferred the spa at the Palms Hotel.

Well, I must say.. couple months really did some damage to the casino.  Can't believe I'm going to give this place 2 stars but whatever has got to be done.

(1) Service just got horrible.  It went from a solid A to a very average C.  And trust me, average is not acceptable in Vegas. With all the competition they have, it was very disappointing experience this time around.  From the front desk to the casino credit, it was very just average.  Maybe even a little below for the price they charge you for room.

(2) Room was still big and comfortable as I remember. But can the cleaning service be upgraded?! If the room wasn't comped, I would've been even more mad... but because it was free, I can't complain that much right? But at $350\/night regularly, it was quite annoying that the cleaning lady could not distinguish lotion between conditioner.  I was in the shower, shampooed my hair, great.  Time to condition my hair... but wait, what is this, the lotion? Since when did people lotion their body in the shower? Very irritating when it took me almost an hour brushing my hair just because someone can't distinguish between lotion & conditioner.  Also, I was looking for my glasses that I left on the nightstand for about an hour, only to realize that the cleaning lady decided to tuck it into the bottom drawer. (Even though I specifically told them not to clean anything BUT the bathroom). Ugh.

(3)  Gaming wise... wow. Must say, pit boss's and dealers got super unfriendly.  Maybe they've been running into some not-so-great players, but honestly, what's up with the service?  Here we go again on the service.  Unacceptable, especially when the Wynn & Encore is just a bridge away.

(4)  They charge you for an extra fridge and late-check out now. What? I know they're going bankrupt and all, but c'mon now. Are you really going to scare away your loyal customers so you can get a few bucks here and there?  I have never been charged for an extra fridge nor the late check out.  But this trip made me realize... The Palazzo really must be DESPERATE!

(5) They don't comp cigarettes anymore. Wow. What else are you going to take, free alcohol? The Pit boss told me that it was because of health issues and regulations.  I assumed that this was all of Las Vegas's new rule and thought it was quite dumb but still let it slide.  Next day, I went to the Wynn\/Encore to play, and the pit-boss comped cigarettes like nothing.  I was confused.  I then told the pit-boss what the Venetian\/Palazzo told us about the cigarettes and all he said was, ""The Palazzo is still around"" and laughed.  Seriously.  They're still around? They need to honestly up their game.

My loyalty has really gone down in the drains with this trip.  On the up side, theres always Wynn\/Encore.",0,0,0

As you enter from the portico, and you are greeted by a well groomed and well dressed staff you instantly feel dwarfed by the sure scale of the lobby.  With beautiful towers and a beautiful towering fountain, you instantly know that yes this is Italian influenced, but not Italian themed!

Having been a huge fan of the Venetian I was unsure what would the Palazzo would look and feel like with out the heavy theming.  I am pleased to announce that it really takes comfort, luxury, and style to a whole new level in Vegas!

After a prompt check-in with a wonderful check-in hostess I took my elevator to the 26th floor and was greeted by a beautifully decorated room, and a great view of the strip!

I had a King Suite room, and it is probably the FIRST hotel room I could honestly live in!  The whole time I was in Vegas I kept telling myself that I could do Studio apartment living!  Who needs all of the extra room and space when your room and space looks like a King Suite room at the Palazzo!  

The room is huge, with a great bed area, and living room area!  The bathroom is the size of some hotel rooms, with a great separate shower and bathtub.

The amenities package in the room is great, and after a long day of meetings I really appreciated the bath salts as I relaxed in the tub and just enjoyed the room!

One of the great things about the Palazzo is it's location!  It is connected to the Venetian via the Canal Shoppes and is right next to the Wynn, so your entertainment options are really limitless while you are there!

The restaurants available are top notch and shops are also pretty great (if you wife is spender keep her in the Casino she is sure to loose you less playing cards than in the Palazzo Shoppes).

This was my first time staying in a suite outta my own pocket and it was definitely was totally worth it.  I finally got to fulfill my dream of playing with remote drapes and curtains ever since I saw Ray do it in ""Rainman"" when they were put up after they hit it big in the casino.  You're not a balla till you play with the remote curtains.  I eventually pissed off my GF by playing with it so much that she hid the remote on me...oh well.  Allow me to be more helpful by disecting my experience at the Palazzo:

Decor - Overall, the hotel felt very upscale and very spacious.  The mini waterfall was a nice touch.  However, and this may just be me being a little picky, it felt like the design could have used more details.  This becomes very noticeable if you walked through the Venetian, Palazzo's parent property.

Casino -  The walkways between the Black Jack tables were huuuuuuuuuuge, about 20 feet apart, which gave it a very spacious feel.  Payouts on the video poker were less than desireable.  After midnight on wknds, the minimum at the Blackjack tables get jacked up to $25.  However, these kind of odds and prices of gambling are pretty standard with the newer mega resort casinos.  After all, who do you think is paying for the hefty cost of building these suckers?  Nickel slots do exist here but are far and few in between.

Room - My favorite part of this hotel.  I got the Luxury Suite w\/ view(this is the lowest tier of the suites).  Spent approx. $280 a night for Fri. & Sat. night during middle of June..  very nicely decorated.  On the 45th floor, we had a nice view of Treasure Island, the Mirage, a piece of the strip and the maddening crowd at Tao Beach.  Already told you about the remote controlled drapes and curtains.  About 550 sqft. of space, living room section, which is only separated from the bed by a knee high counter( I have no idea as to the purpose of the counter), had a nice wrap around couch.  It also had some ottamans, a table with chairs, and a working desk with a scanner\/fax\/printer.  wireless\/wired internet is available for about 10 bucks a day.  THREE...yes, count them, three flatscreen TV's in the room; a 37"" in the living room area, a 42"" at the foot of the king size bed, and a 21"" hung in the bathroom.  The bathroom was very luxurious, marble counter with 2 sinks.  Bathtub is separated from the shower.  Nice robes and slippers are provided for you during your stay.  The king size bed is so comfortable that you can't get on it without wanting to jump on it everytime.  The sheets are high thread count sheets but they could be a little softer.  And the room is generally very clean, but there was a light layer of dust on the table which I made housekeeping aware of and was taken care of the next day.  So, I took a star off for the dust and stiff sheets.  I know, I know, call me anal.

Service - loved it, almost everything was a phone call and 5 minutes away.  ""Good morning\/afternoon\/evening Mr. L, How can I help you?""  That was the greeting most of the time I called front desk.  Luggage was brought up super fast.  Called for a humidifier.  Boom, there in 5 minutes.  GF left her credit card in Grand Luxe.  Was able to get it back within 20min of first phone call.  Can't say anything bad about these guys.

Amenities - the gym and spa facilities will cost you $30 a day.  A big thumbs down for that.  The person that set the pricing for that should be fired as he will be responsible for the down fall of the contracting company that runs that gym.  However, you do have access to a total of 3(4, if you count Tao Beach) pools and 2 hot tubs between the two hotels.

Nightlife - unfortunately, I can't speak much to this as we did not experience it at the hotel.  However, Tao Beach at the Venetian, which is very close is currently considered one of Las Vegas' hot spots with a lot of obscenely good looking people going in and out.  If you're looking for more of a sports\/hip-hop crowd, there is the 40\/40 club by Jay-Z on the premises.

Booked directly on the Palazzo website and they only had King bedroom suites available.  As a family of four, I called the hotel to inquire where our two kids would sleep.  They said the suite had a fold out sofa.  Fine- not ideal but it is what it is.

Fast forward to arriving and the fold out sofa is a single!  How on earth do they expect two people (even kids) to sleep on a slimline single ""sofa""?  It's one thing to discover this upon arrival, but I phoned in advance!!!

Wait--it gets worse.  It's midnight now and we finally try to make the bed only there is no bedding!  No pillows or blankets are left in the rooms.  Huh?  I checked in--the hotel and front desk knew we were a party of four.  And yet the room was never prepared properly, nor did the front desk bother to inform us that our bedding wouldn't be supplied unless we called house keeping ourselves.

To make things even worse, I phoned housekeeping just now only to be told it will be 45 minutes for someone to bring pillows and blankets for our kids!  Hello but it's midnight already.

Ladies, there was a vanity, complete with cute little bench in the bathroom.  Loved that.  Our room directly faced TI and we were able to watch the pirate show clearly.  

It was just Mr. DJ and I so there was no need for a pool area with all the bells and whistles.  There was no lazy river or wave pool which was just fine with me.  There were 3 big pools.  Heated!  This is important because in April, the hotel towers cast a huge shadow on the pools until about 3pm.  Someone probably didn't think that one through.  Although, I would give them credit for putting the pool just a few steps from the tower elevator because there is nothing worse than having to walk a mile through a casino soaking wet just to get to your room.  I'm looking at you MGM.  

Location was super convenient.  Close to the freeway.  Walgreens right next door.  Mall across the street.  We all can't afford to throw down $100 every meal so having the mall food court near by was awesome.

As I was surprised with the room for my birthday from my grandparents (gotta love Joanie and Jim), I could not have asked for a better place to enjoy my first Las Vegas experience. 

The rooms are nicely sized, TVs everywhere, clean, comfortable beds, and just overall a great place with phenomenal architecture and insane attention to detail (yes I do pay attention to things like that). However, that last star that it misses comes from 2 things... My suite was towards the corner of the hotel and since the elevators are only in the middle, it was quite a trek to get to and from my room.

Also, the pools are great but the service at the pools could have been better. When I order my mojito I want it asap, not in 15 minutes. Sorry, Palazzo.

But the shopping... oh boy the shopping there is spectacular.",0,0,0

I'm a Grazzie gold member and every time I go I get a upgrade to the next level room (complementary) . Well upon checking in , Bradley at the vip check in desk declined to upgrade me or my brothers reservation. After about 45 minutes for my reservation he said a Siena room was available for 180 additional charge. Please Bradley I just got to palazzo u already ruined my day. Those 45 minutes I could have been gambling. Bradley assigned me a tiny sienna room in the corner that smelled like an old dusty elevator.  I was so unhappy I didn't even feel like going to the spa with my bf , I guess thanks I saved  1k just there.

I should have questioned what was going on when they had a air purifier in the living room. I checked in at 3:30 .. Had dinner in suite.  The bell man came and got air purifier. I went out and did the highroller wheel with my kids.. Came back and questioned the smell!?  We thought is was our dinner... By midnight the room reeked like a ashtray...  I called the hotel manager asked if they could waive the upgrade.. they said they would waive $32 of tax off my room. Then she suggested I switch rooms with my kids asleep and us catching a flight at 6am!! I reluctantly said yes because I would have to pack everything ...  the smell was sooooo bad.  At 12:20 she said she would send someone right away.... It's now 12:45 and nobody is here to move us.  I called. They had no idea where the person was to switch rooms!!   Going to bed.

Been staying here for the past two nights. We are staying at the fortuna suite and it is very spacious, the window overlooks Treasure Island and we could see some fireworks at night. However, when we arrived:

The tables were dusty
Used drinks were left in mini bar
Cups in bathroom had toothpaste residue. When they 'cleaned' the room, they weren't even changed.

We had to use the fold out mattress from the couch and there were no extra pillows or blankets in the closets.

We called housekeeping and it took about an HOUR to bring two pillows (we specifically asked for 3) and two blankets (when we needed only 1). 

The housekeeping also left us a vacuum as a souvenir when they cleaned the room and failed to replenish the toilet paper and tissue paper boxes. These took them half hour to bring up.

All in all, I do think having the casino and food option downstairs is nice. There is a coffee bean adjacent to the elevators for the suites.  The room indeed big, the bed is comfy and there is a dining table for 4, a nice small sectional and a study desk BUT I base reviews mostly on service and I felt they lacked it. The cleanliness is just so so. Oh, did I also mention the bed comforter has a tiny blood stain? What I absolutely abhor is that I need to call them for every little thing and it takes them too long.  Perhaps they should take notes from the Trump where housekeeping is exceptional and they keep us stocked with essentials.

The ambience is okay, some posers and drunks here and there.  Two very 'classy' men were puffing smoke at the patrons of coffee bean but security reprimanded them.  

I stayed at the penthouse suite at the Venetian years ago and was unimpressed, looking back I should have went with my gut and booked the Wynn instead. Needless to say, I don't think this hotel is worth 300+\/ night and I wouldn't stay here again.",0,0,0

The rooms are gorgeous and at rates one would expect. However they lack that bit of extra treatment one would expect from a high class hotel. The staff are average and treat guests as average too. Recently stayed there and chose a suite package that offered some beneficial perks like dining credit, gambling credit, etc. However when it came time to use the special there was confusion from staff at the casino, the restaurants, and the spa as to what I was entitled to. There were also too many stipulations to qualify for what I thought was to be an advantage. If a hotel or other service offers a deal they should just make it simple and accessible to the guest. I felt like ""trailer trash"" each time I tried to use the deals offered as though I was asking for something unusual or free or something. Also, this hotel was one of few where you could smell strongly the cigarette smoke throughout the casino. And their attempt to cover it with a very artificial fragrance made it worse. I had a runny nose and eyes every day. So I will not return.

The casino floor isn't the largest, but has a nice feel to it and the property in general doesn't feel quite as trendy\/trashy as say the Cosmopolitan.

While one might not notice much differences between the two hotel, there are subtleties of Palazzo that distinguish it from the Venetian.  First off, because it's a few years newer, the hotel rooms do have a more modern appeal and look.  The layout of their rooms is pretty identical, but something about the Palazzo feels more modern.  I believe it has to do with the colors, but I'm not an interior designer, so I can't give actual specifics.  

Another plus of the Palazzo is that Grand Lux Cafe is just downstairs and open 24\/7! That means you can simply phone in an order and pick it up 20 minutes later in the separated cafe, or you can drop in and have an above average meal very conveniently.  While Venetian also has it's own Grand Lux, I feel the Venetian one is more packed simply because it's ""closer"" to other attractions\/hotels.  

The beds at the Palazzo are a legitimate competitor to my memory foam bed @ home; the plush mattresstop and sleek, silk sheets make sleeping in the bed extremely easy and comfortable.  In the few occasions where I actually get to sleep in a bed, I wake up feeling refreshed, relaxed and ready to taint my mind & body w\/ alcohol and late-night clubbing.  One day I shall repeat this cycle of alcohol\/ sleep on bed over a span of days and see how good I actually feel :)

Lavo, the lounge\/bar downstairs is apparently a nice place to chill and drink.  While not exactly a place to dance your pants off, it is a convenient location for hotel guests to start the weekend off with some class, before your sweat smears off your makeup and your shoes end on your hands instead of your feet.  I would recommend Lavo for those who don't like dancing\/crowds and prefer just drinking and trying to socialize before the alcohol hits.  When it does, you might as well move over to Tao (at the Venetian) where it's so dark and crowded no one will know the difference.  

So if you're stuck with a choice between Palazzo or Ventian, just flip a coin as it really doesn't matter too much.  The Palazzo is easier to park in and exit since its entrance is off-the-strip slightly, so that's a plus.  Walking to the Wynn is also closer than the Venetian, so if you wanted to go to XS \/ Encore Beach Club \/ Surrender, Ventian will make that walk of intoxicated, shameful walk  back home all the shorter :)",1,0,1

Room service takes forever. At least 45 minutes to get towels, cups, extra blankets, etc. 

Actually, my biggest complaint is that the air is so dry in there that my nostrils were actually hurting.

I'll keep this short.  It's one of the pricier hotels, but it's a beautiful hotel and the rooms are good for groups.  Like Venetian, they all (I think) have a living area with a pull-out couch bed.  You could comfortably fit 6 people in these rooms.

As with my other Vegas stays, I base my hotel choice on where I'll be clubbing (along with budget).  We were gonna party at Surrender, so Wynn or Encore woulda been ideal.  But if you try to book on the busiest weekend of the year (yes, that would be Memorial Day for Vegas), rooms will reach $600 for Wynn and $1000 for Encore online.

I was not expecting anything too amazing when I checked in, but the rooms are REALLY large, and the bathroom also boasts a large glass shower + a tub.  (Actually, the bathroom setup was the exact same as I've had at Caesar's, which was interesting.)  

My room came with two double beds + a large seating area with a small table, large L-shaped couch, and an office desk\/chair set.  I've heard this is the default setup of all of their rooms, which seems pretty nice.  

It was just me in the room, so when I get 2 beds I use one for working on my computer and one for sleeping.  I pulled back the sheets on one bed and found a long, dark hair... so that was for working.  The other bed was fine, so that's where I slept.

Things I dislike about the Plazzo --  it has a weird smell.  All the hotels have a signature scent, but I just HATE how the Palazzo smells.  I know, I know...but I can't help it.  Also, I'm genuinely confused about why they call it the Palazzo (as an Italian-style theme), but then all the decor and even their soaps\/shampoo, etc is all covered in Asian-styled writing.

Also, the last night that we were there, I ended up having an hour to lay by the pool before dinner.  My coworker and I went to the pool bar to order drinks, and I kid you not--there was ONE working bartender for maybe 50+ people.  My coworker and I waited 10 minutes for her to take our order before completely giving up.  It was really weird that they'd have the bar so understaffed, but...whatever.

Five minutes later we were ready to move on (yeah it was that boring) and made our way to the Palazzo via some back stairs. Not really sure how we ended up there but the thought of traversing Venetian again was too much to think about. 

In the casino, I thought I would have a cocktail before hitting the machines. Ordered a vodka soda (well brand) and the bartender said ""$13 please"" What! For a cocktail, in a casino, where people play penny machines to score free drinks?

Needless to say, I wanted nothing else to do with this casino. I drank my $13 vodka soda, found my friends and got out.

Hey Palazzo, want people to stick around and play your machines? Drop the price a couple of bucks on a drink.",4,2,0

A group of us booked 2 suites here for Halloween celebration last weekend. The rooms were definitely spacious, and can hold up to 6 people per room if you get the Bella Queens (2 queens plus a pullout couch bed).  The rooms here are twice as spacious as other hotels, about 970 sq feet.  The decor is modern, clean, luxurious.  I felt like such a princess staying here.

I heard about tipping to get an upgrade and when I was checking in, I held a $20 bill in front of my credit card at the desk.  I asked about any possible upgrades and she said they were $45 per room (we had 2 rooms).  Then she said, oh, I'll upgrade you to strip view.  When I asked if there is an extra charge, she said no, with a smile.  I slipped her the $20 and she said thank you and put it under her keyboard.  Score!

Our view on the 21st floor was breath-taking.  I loved that we got connecting rooms for $11.20 more.  I think it's a bit ridiculous to charge a connecting room guarantee fee but since we got upgraded for such a little amount, I am not complaining.

It amazes me that this hotel is so well ventilated that I didn't smell any smoke unless I was down in the casino floors.  I also love it's so close to the Wynn since that's one of my favorite hotels in Vegas because of how beautiful it is.

If I didn't have such high expectations, I might have given this place 5 stars, but I thought The Palazzo would be bigger and better than the Venetian and it simply wasn't.  Although it's definitely a luxurious hotel, it lacks the spirit that the Venetian has.  I mean...consider this:

a) Venetian has TAO, while Palazzo is stuck with Lavo.  Nothing against Lavo, but it's just so insignificant compared to TAO.
b) The Grand Lux Cafe at Venetian is open 24\/7, whereas the same restaurant at the Palazzo is not.  We found that out the hard way.
c) The casino at the Venetian was still crazy and energetic at 5am, while the casino at the Palazzo was fairly dead.

All in all, I enjoyed my stay at the Palazzo - but I spent most of my days and nights wandering over to the Venetian or to the nearby Wynn and Encore.  If you don't mind walking a bit, then sure...I'd recommend staying at the Palazzo.

It's the 3rd Italianesque hotel behind Bellagio and Venetian. First of all it's an all suite hotel, so no rooms, just varying degrees of lavishness. I've stayed here 3 times in the 700+ sqf Bella Suite, 1900+ sqf Lago Suite and the 1200+ sqf Siena Suite. Some things that they all have in common is the pretty high thread count sheets, L shaped sofa sleeper, 3 tv's, double doors to bathrooms, marble entryways, in room safe, ottoman, sunk in living room. It's a very cozy and lavish stay no matter what suite you get. I found the walls to be slightly better insulated to sound than many hotels in Vegas. These rooms are great for entertaining people as you pre-party before you go out. For the price you get quite a bit of square footage and I've had 6 guys sleeping in the Siena after a night out. I wish they offered Kings for all beds instead of queens in the Bella. Touch button curtains, fast valet parking. There were a few things I wasn't impressed with. The ease of getting from room to casino floor was a bit longer than I'd like and the elevators don't drop you right in the middle of the action. If you're trying to get more than a few people to meet up with people at another hotel I'd give it a few extra minutes. Regardless of how pretty the decorations are in the lobby take me to the games, the limit's were a bit high for my taste and the restaurants food not as intriguing as more established hotels, but aside from it's lavish amenities there was no one draw to it except it's nightclub Lavo. The pool is very nice, but doesn't quite have the location or orientation of other larger pools on the strip. Back to Lavo, it's a roman bath house themed club. To be honest with you I prefer the smaller venue because places like Tryst and TAO tend to be crowded and DJ's tend to drown the crowd in sound rather than really care about what's making people like it. The downstairs lounge is great to get away from the noise and have some alone time, maybe blast a cig after a few cocktails, full view of other hotels with shows outside like TI. They may not get the huge DJ's that the larger club's use(typically they get paid per person and with a smaller venue they can't command certain prices), but you know for sure you'll have a good time. Maybe this is a dirty little secret that no one wants me to say, but of the major clubs like Tryst, Tao, Body English, Pure, Jet, Krave, The Bank, Studio 54, Blush, LAX, Pure, Revolution, I Bar, Haze, Tabu, Caramel and the like. I've been to most of these and there are only a few that I haven't seen people having sex somewhere in the club, whether it's in the corner, booth, vip, dance floor, etc. Somewhere, someone is getting it. Maybe it's me and I havne't seen it, but Lavo is one of the few that I find more chill even with the ""bath house"" theme. So in conclusion I give Palazzo a 5 star rating for comfortable, quiet, lavish sleeping arrangements,  fast valet, great club, good location and great service. I'll definitely be staying here again.",1,1,1

You know you're in for a treat when you get that kind of reaction from people who know LV.  I was there for business and my employer paid for most of the hotel costs, but I was responsible for the difference between the price of the Rio and here.  It was worth every penny.  

We stayed on the top floor of the non-concierge suites (I'm cheap enough that I didn't figure that was any kind of good deal.  An extra $50\/day?  Give me a break.)  The room was enormous, and looked exactly like the website.  Rather than go into the amenities, I'd rather direct you to the website.  

I was able to relax in this hotel because it was elegant without being obnoxious.  The Venetian seemed like it was trying too hard, the Palazzo seemed like it was for those who appreciated quality.  I do, naturally.  The color schemes were pleasing, and everything felt solid.  I never heard anyone out in the hallway or in the next bedrooms.  I felt like I was in my own house.  The electric drapes were a nice touch, but the remote would only work if ya fiddled with it, which was slightly annoying.  The huge couch was comfy and the DVD player was another nice touch.  Sometimes you just want to get away from the stress of losing and veg in your wonderful room (fortunately, the recharge must have worked, b\/c I was on fire my last night there.)  The staff were attentive.  

My reasons for not giving them 5 stars were my problems.  First and foremost was the bill.  It was majorly screwed up.  It took me about 2 hours on the phone, being transferred several times to get it straightened out (my employer had me be responsible that the funds were used correctly since we weren't staying at the Rio where the conference was).  Second, and perhaps more irritating to me was my breakfast the final morning.  We were flying out wicked early, so I called for room service 24 hours in advance with our order.  They ended up being 40 min late.  I had 10 min to eat my $85 breakfast.  To say that I was pissed was an understatement.  Hell, I'm still pissed and they're lucky to get that 4th star.  The last quibbles had to do with the lights in the bathroom:  1\/2 of them were burned out.  I can understand saving energy, but it just seemed kind of tacky.  Also, the way they had the T V positioned in the bathroom, you couldn't see it from the bathtub.  

I am believing that I had just a bad go of it, though.  Maybe a perfect storm or something.  So, I'm still strongly recommending this hotel.  Tips to travelers:  business casual is strongly recommended.",1,0,1

I don't know about you, but when I'm stumbling back to my hotel room at 5am I want someplace to eat.  And I don't mean McDonald's.  At least at the Hard Rock Hotel, you have some options.  At the Palazzo you have ZERO options, and even if you did have options, it would have to be a $100 steak.  All of their restaurants are high-end and therefore leaves me starving when I reach home.  I guess if I wanted to eat, I should have stayed at the Hard Rock or at Paris.  Anyway, I had this problem every single night I was in Vegas staying at the Palazzo.

So here are some tips:

-You've got lots of pool options, because the Venetian is right next door.

-USE the concierge, they have hookups to everywhere you want to go.  We went to the club at the Mirage and the host knew our name the very first time he met us because we mentioned that we had called over from the Palazzo.  It was a very busy weekend and we got in everywhere, no problem.

-Hookas in the bar downstairs where you get a $25 credit with your room.

-Compared to the Palazzo, the Venetian rooms look like a dump.

-Glass mirrored inset coffee table?  Wonder who (using what kind of drugs) designed this??  Balla suite.",0,1,0

I usually don't like staying at the big time major casinos on the strip, but the Palazzo didn't let me down too severely like most of the other ones.

First of all, the room was beautiful.  Totally worth the $4 hundo a night we paid.  I really enjoyed the fact that it was *new* and not too many asses had taken a deuce in our toilet or boned in our beds.  Thats the whole reason why I booked the Palazzo-because its so new and still nice...the Vegas grime hasn't had a chance to set in just yet.  But, the decorations are very chic and tasteful, and the beds are really comfy with down comforters and high thread count cotton duvet covers.  Another positive aspect of the Palazzo is that there is a plethora of restaurant options to choose from, and they have a really upscale mall to shop at as well.

Outside of the room, many of the other aspects of the hotel were similar to things I dislike about other casinos on the strip.  These include: lame service, senior citizens and screaming children running around, desensitized environment, overly air-conditioned, weird pool setup.  Out of all those, I'd have to say that the pool setup bothered me the most.  The Palazzo has lots of individual TINY pools (I'm talking 15x15 ft).  There were no large pools that you can actually swim in, but many small shallow wading pools that are filled to the brim with people.  And, in addition to the small size of the pools, I felt that there was a severe lack of pools!  They could have thrown in 5 more pools to accommodate the 5,000 people in the pool area.  It was totally overcrowded-we had to pay a pool boy to find us chairs to sit in.  And, the pools were lukewarm-not refreshing at all.  You can forget about swimming-it was like a packed club up in those bitches.  Oh, I must not leave out how one pool was closed because some child ""got sick"" in it....gross.

The reason I'm giving four stars is because the room was so damn nice.  And, we were able to get a late checkout of 6pm for $100 extra-MUCH needed due to our extreme hangovers.  But, after all that, I'd still rather stay at the hard rock!",3,8,2

with Palazzo, I have very mixed feelings and many disappointments.

I booked a Concierge Luxury Suite for 2 nites. It says on their website that you get all the extra service (seperate check-in\/out, packing\/unpacking service, the access to the concierge lounge for complimentary food\/drinks and more), so I figured, at around $100\/day more, I'd give it a shot....well...it's not exactly what I thought it would be...

First of all, I arrived at the hotel around 2:00am....took me about almost 7 hours to arrive from LA, traffic was really horrible...I called the hotel to let them know that I'm arriving late and asked the operator if I am still able to check in at the concierge lounge instead of the main lobby registration. She says 'oh of course, just tell the security guard at the elevator that you are a guest at the concierge suite and take the elevator to the 23rd floor and they'll check you right in' she says....I'm feeling pretty good at this point...BUT~~!!!! And here comes the 'BUT's....I get to the elevator to the suites and there is the security guard....I told him that I need to check in at the concierge lounge(My name was not even on the list of guests he had with him...hmmm...was that a sign of things to come?) but he told me to just go up to the 23rd floor to check-in...I'm like 'oh cool~' . Go up to the 23rd floor and guess what? The lounge is CLOSED! So I bring the luggage down to the casino level and walk past the security guard that the lounge is closed and he tells me that 'oh, you need to check in at the main lobby then'.....'o....k......why didn't you tell me that before I went up?'.....so i leave the luggage at the security desk and walk back to the main lobby across the casino floor....had to wait about 15~20 minutes in line before I could check in....I told the nice lady at the front desk that I actually made a very unnecessary trip up to the 23rd floor and back down because one of your security was not aware that the lounge was closed for check-in....and she says...

Front Desk lady: 'Oh, I apologize for that he should have known better to let you go up at this time'

Me: '............... oh....ok......'

Front Desk lady: 'I will make sure to inform the supervisor that this does not happen again'

Me: '......... oh.....ok.....'

Go up to my room....nice room...nothing too different from Venetian rooms. Just better and newer stuff to fill a room probably bigger than it needs to be for 2 people....3 o' clock in the morning.....geez....

About to fall asleep....now what is that noise? some kind of wind noise is just 'wooshing' thru the room....try to turn off the fan....still there....turn the fan back on, then turn in off....still there....ugh!!! wind was blowing in from the vents above the closet doors....i get 2 pillows to block the vent and it's now much quieter....ahhhhh.....time for some shut eye....I shall talk about this in the morning....too tired to even ask for new room at this point anyway....

Next morning...

I decided to give the concierge lounge a try. Wanted to arrange for a limo service from Palazzo to MGM for latter part of the day. Very helpful, execept the wait here is no better than waiting in the concierge desk in the main lobby....station for about 6 concierge staffs, only 2 are working and there are more guests waiting behind me now....finally another staff comes thru the door and my turn....finally....she's very nice and friendly...arranged for the limo service and now I'm feeling good....until....I bring up the wind blowing in from the vents.....the staff tells me...

Concierge Staff: oh that's just the air circulating throughout the hotel....and it is NOT blowing...if anything just a mild circulation....

Me: oh....uh.....so other rooms in this hotel have the same 'circulation'? 

Concierge Staff: Yes. 

Me: oh....uh.....ok then.....@#$@%#$@$!!!!!! 

Day of check-out....can't check out using the TV for some reason....go down to the concierge floor to check-out....leave the bags with them to pick them up later at the bell desk. Come back later to pick up the bags and guess what....the bags were not at the bell desk and bell boy went to get them. 1 hour later, the bags finally reunite with the owners....sigh....

I was severely disappointed.  The goal of the Palazzo is to provide guests with world class accommodations and experiences with memories to last a lifetime.    The goal was not met.  The memories that we left with were not good ones. 
This review is based on service. 

We booked 2 rooms directly from the palazzo website that we fully prepaid.  1 king suite and  1 bella suite (2 queen beds).   Palazzo website has a guarantee they will never lose your reservation.   We requested connecting rooms.  There is a charge.  The connecting charge was $10 per room plus 12% tax per day (total was $67.20).  
Upon arrival on a Monday, check in line was long.  Queue was 30 minutes.  Their computer system was down.   They couldn't find the correct reservation and thought we only booked 1 room.  Finally they found the reservation and was told that they would put us on the 32nd floor in 2 separate rooms on the same floor, but that they are not connecting rooms.   The only connecting rooms they have are on the 7th floor and we wouldn't like them because there would be no view.   After consulting with my party, we decided that we need connecting suites.   Front desk agent walked away and came back and said there was nothing she could do.   She would put us on the 32nd floor.  There were no connecting suites on the 7th floor.   Front desk agent lied to us !
Manager arrived.  I recommended that they provide a complimentary upgrade to a Lago 2-bedroom suite, which has 1 king bed, and 2 queen beds.  They said no, not unless we wanted to pay for it.  
The reservation that I prepaid for was not available, and so it would have been the proper thing to do to provide an upgrade.   Lago 2-bedroom suite would have given us the 1 king suite + 2 queen bed suite that we prepaid for.  

Next morning we stopped by the front desk and the computer systems were back up.  This time, front desk employee Helen helped us.   She only found 1 room under my reservation.  I told her that I have 2 rooms under my reservation, and that we would like connecting rooms and if she could move us.  She said well I now see in my computer that you are in 2 rooms and that you ARE in connecting rooms already so you don't need me to do anything.  She said I see in my computer that you are in rooms that are connecting.  Front desk agent once again lied!      I explained again yes the rooms we are in are connecting rooms however they do not connect to EACH other.    She did not understand.   She kept telling me that her computer is showing that the rooms are connecting, and insinuated that I was lying.  Finally the morning supervisor helped us and moved us to connecting rooms.  

The new connecting room the air was not working.  It was warm.  We called the front desk.  Engineer has to come to the room, who arrived, and Danny helped us.  He seemed displeased and upset.  He didn't say much.  He appeared upset.  After the air was fixed, he simply said ""all finished"" and walked out.    Later that day, my keys stopped working for both rooms.   I did not want to go back to the front desk.  Fortunately the other guests in my party had keys that worked.  

It was one problem after another.  It was not the experience we had expected.   My recommendation to you is to be alert.  Front desk may lie to you.  Write down the name of each employee you encounter.  Document each employee interaction you have.  Don't believe everything the front desk tells you.  

Let the front desk know that you are not happy, and what they can do to fix it.  
I did let the front desk know that I was still going to be at the Palazzo for 2 more nights.....we are still there and did not check out yet, and that would be their opportunity to help make up for the poor performance of the front desk, but they did not make an effort to revise their mistakes.    That should be a hotel's objective, to make things right while the guest is still there, and not after they checked out.",1,0,0

Check your bills everywhere as some of the staff like to upcharge your for 'top shelve' when it's not requested. 
If you can get through to front desk\/concierge, there's not much they can do for basic requests (DVD remote to navigate through DVD's with menus or coffee pot\/ kettle). They have removed all the coffee pots\/kettles from the suites, so you're on your own to find a decent cup within distance.
Thie room wasn't remotely clean when we arrived and wasn't ready by check in time. We had to go back to front desk to find out what was going on as we had been waiting an hour and a half (only 30 mins past usual checkin- they told us we would get in early) and then another 30 for our luggage. 
The pools are nice, especially now that the frat brats have left. The food is delicious at the canyon ranch grill, but again check your bills as we were uncharged $4 for a top shelve we didn't order, so watch your bills!

Let's start at the beginning...we checked in at the concierge and they told us that they would send the bellman up with our luggage, they told us it would take about a half hour and that we should stay in our room.  45 minutes pass and nothing...I called the bell desk directly and they said that they'd bring it up in 20 minutes and that we should stay in our room for delivery.  45 minutes later our luggage finally arrived, but we waited for about an hour and a half!  While we waited for our luggage, we noticed that there was a used and dirty towel in the bathroom...that's nasty.  Speaking of nasty, my brother in law and my wife's cousin were in a room on the floor below us and their mini-fridge had left over take out from the previous guest!

Later that night, we asked the concierge to book a limo for us.  They told us to wait downstairs at the pick up area for the limo.  The valets directing the cabs and limos pushed us into a limo.  As we were leaving the driveway, we received a call from the concierge informing us that the valet had put us in a wrong cab and that we should return back to Palazzo and get into the correct limo or else we'd be charged for 2 limos. 

The following night, we ordered room service for some appetizers because we were going to a show at the MGM.  They told us to call them when we were done and they'd pick it up.  When we got back to our room at 1 am, we saw that it was never picked up.

The casino sucks...it's decorated alright, but the sportsbook is downstairs from the rest of the casino and completely separated from everything.  

For the amount of money we paid to stay at Palazzo, I'd rather stay at Bellagio or Wynn.  I had no issues at those two other properties.  The Palazzo is pretend luxury and no class.  I would have given it 1 star, but there is a Charlie Trotter restaurant there and my wife likes shopping there.",0,0,0

The Palazzo is an awesome place to stay on the strip!

Location and Parking: The Palazzo is right across the street from the TI and Fashion Show Mall on the north side of the strip. For arrival from the I-15, I recommend taking the Spring Mountain Rd exit and then going across Las Vegas Blvd to enter the parking lot on the right side of the road. As a note, Spring Mountain Rd becomes Sands Blvd on the other side of Las Vegas Blvd.  I found that there is plenty of parking either through valet or self-parking. The Palazzo is connected with the Venetian and offers plenty of restaurants, bars and shops in the Grand Canal Shoppes area located in between the two hotels.

Room: Nicely done! My wife and I went with the regular suite with no strip view (least costly of all the suites\/rooms). The suite provides over 700 sq. ft. of space and the layout is terrific. The sunk in living room\/office\/dining area off the bedroom part of the suite is really great. I was able to get some work done on my laptop using their WiFi while watching football games on the TV (multitasking at its finest). The bathroom has dual sinks, a vanity area, a separate bath and shower, and best of all a TV. Never missed a moment of football games since I was able to watch while showering! The bedroom came with a comfortable king size bed, a large dresser, two bedside tables, and the largest TV of all three TV's in the suite. 

Service: I believe in second chances when it comes to service. I have to admit our stay was off to a rough start when our room had not been adequately cleaned upon check in and then it was neglected to be cleaned at all during our second of six days here. So I called the front desk and explained the situation to a manager who quickly sent a cleaning crew to our room.  From that moment on, we had no problems with the cleaning services. Everyone I spoke to at the hotel was very polite, courteous and eager to help with any issue or question I had.  

Casino: The sportsbook is super nice and I really like the stadium style seating with comfortable chairs, but I wish they would keep it open longer for their customers to enjoy. It ended up not really being a big deal since the Venetian sportsbook is open 24\/7.

We will be staying here again!",4,1,1

I don't work there so I can say whatever about it in full honesty. Convinced our family to stay here and they were all really pleased as well. If my mom is not happy, I will talk down shit so fast as her vacation to see me should always be 20 out of 10. They liked their suite a lot and liked the property very much.

Now onto my stay....

 I've stayed at Venetian before I knew my BFand preferred it until Palazzo opened. He booked us for our anniversary last night. 

These are the biggest standard suites in Vegas and some of the biggest worldwide. I like space so I really appreciate where that is not skimped on...its almost 700 sq ft and the usual place is less than half of this. A standard suite at most places would not have a separate hangout area, maybe a table and a chair by the window and thats it. Here there is a sunken living room with a couch (some are pullout couches even! not all though....but you can ask for roll out beds to be brought up too for extra peeps), cabinet with a TV, a fullsized desk and a round corner table with two chairs- that extra living space would usually constitute a ""deluxe suite"" in most properties, not a standard. Bathroom has a vanity which most places don't and a standard tub, separate shower and a closed off watercloset\/toilet. 3 TV's are unusual as well for standard rooms elsewhere. Beds are comfy here- I dont sleep as nicely in strange beds but I got a decent amount of sleep here. When living it up in Vegas, you need all the quality sleep you can get so I normally dont recommend cheap places with lumpy moldy beds even if youre trying not to sleep much. Probably one of the comfier beds I've tried in Vegas...does not beat Tempurpedics in a few hotels I've gone to. A foam bed is what we got at home so of course it's my bed of choice hands down. 

Check out was efficient, room was clean, staff is generally good natured here and helpful...specially kudos to the guards for giving good directions.  

 I find the design pleasant and the property itself has a lot of great places to eat- including many of my favorites on the strip and great shows. I like that the casino is open and you can see the lay of the land to spot things out or spot people out. Definitely a plus that here you dont have to go far to have a good time.

Favorite property definitely. They kept their AAA 5 diamonds and 4 stars for a reason.",1,0,1

We signed up for a 3 day Palazzo package strongly motivated by the Frank Sinatra show. Our reservation confirmed that by email. At Check In the rep said we could pick up our tickets at any box office and printed a coupon saying Frank Sinatra show. At the box office they said that show ended 1 month ago. Do you really think they didn't know that? Because it was the holidays there was very slim pickings for an alternative.

It is a pretty property. It's swarming with people all the time which may be good for many folks. Gambling minimums are higher and incidental costs are higher, even than other high-end properties in center strip.

But there are the annoyances of inattention to customers. Lines for everything, including just checking in. Included in your fees is a morning coffee. But the size they 'give' is tiny, smaller than the smallest size they sell. For my wife and me they suggested pouring both the tiny coffees into one cup and buying another coffee. Before I've had my coffee is not the best time to eff with me. Why not just acknowledge that the 'free' coffee is a trick, and we can find somewhere without a line to buy it.

The phone at the desk in the room was programmed to ring busy no matter what button we pressed or even dialing 0. I was able to reach the front desk by dialing 9 and the full 10-digit main number of Palazzo. I asked what time the pool closed, the representative looked it up and told us 8pm, We got in our swim suits and bathrobes and went down to learn the pool closes at 4pm. So many little things that suggest poor management and training.

Finally we were there the week that it was revealed that Sheldon Adelson had bought the local newspaper, the Review-Journal and had planted a story by a fictitious reporter slamming a local judge whom he had testified in front of a few months back. Yes, the same owner who likes to buy GOP canddiates for president. So you can also consider who you're giving your money to...",7,1,1

Well, no... maybe the devil himself has just turned the Palazzo into his official sinful indulgent home..my friends and I would have gladly done his bidding just to stay one more day in Vegas and enjoy the treats of the Palazzo...

Me and 3 friends stayed in one of the suites.. three of us fit in the large king bed, and the L-shaped couch in the suite was big enough for 2!  Plus, the shower was big enough to share...if you know what I mean..

With four people, we sat ourselves down at the blackjack table, and flirted with ""Dirty Dennis"" and Jay for 5 hours on one dayy.

There are pros and cons to staying at a gigantic, luxury hotel.  The rooms are wonderful.  They've continued to keep the non-smoking floors pretty smoke free, so you don't have lingering scents causing frustrations.  They are also huge.  I believe each room is over 700 square feet, and if you get the rooms that have 2 queen beds, you can honestly sleep 6 people in a room easily.  They have sunken living rooms, and a tv in the sleeping area, living area and bathroom.

The bathrooms have a separate shower and tub, and plenty of room for both, plus a sitting area for make-up application.  The drapes are really easy to use, and are complete black-out systems.

Be sure to ask for a humidifier when you stay here, and with luck, you should find one in your room before you get there, already chugging away.  I've found having that addition makes staying in Vegas for more than 48 hours bearable, and I'll sleep better, and feel worlds better. You can recoup from a night of excess WAY easier when there's moisture in the air.

The room service is decent food for room service, but keep in mind, it takes a long time. They estimate the times pretty well, but it won't be a 15 minute turn around. They serve a lot of rooms, and it's a big place to cover, so be realistic.

The Palazzo has a clean, manageably sized casino, though the tables minimums start reasonably high.  It also has a selection of really top notch restaurants.  Sushi Samba is solid for it's Japanese and Brazilian fare, B&B is great for Italian.  Lavo is a more mellow approach to clubs than Tao, and all in a reasonable space.  If you're going with a group, I highly recommend this place.",5,2,1

Cons:
The pool setup is not the best I have seen. They have a setup similar to Caesars- a large main pool and a few smaller pool areas and whirlpools. The whole pool area, including the pools, are crowded. They place the lounge chairs in the opposite ends of the pools which creates a small area for people to swim. There are no baskets to place your used towels in, not enough Staff for drink orders, no umbrellas and limited trash barrels.

if you value your belonging, this place is as secure as the Cromwell, Nobu, and parts of Caesars.
You need to show your hotel card to the security before you enter the elevators. Most hotels do not do that.

The moment you walk into this place, this is not your normal hotel entrance. This place is a work of art! We had a very nice lady help us check in and recommended some upgrades- this is normal in the industry. We ended up taking her up on one of them which was a strip view.

We ended up getting the most beautiful view of the strip!

The rooms are huge and very inviting. I wish we spent more time in them. In some hotels you can hear people walling down the halls, not here. we couldn't hear a thing!
The bathrooms are also huge and very very clean.

The connection between the Palazzo and Venetian makes you think you are in one huge town center. We partied at the Rockhouse and ate at the Lavo restaurant. We also spent time at Lagasse's Stadium.  There is soooo much to do at these two hotels you may never want to leave! 2 days is not enough. Our next trip will be 3 days for sure!

Pros: Noise level is very low
         Security by the elevators
         Professional staff that seems to care
         Valet very nice and fast!
         Rare Silver Strike machines! Only a few places in Vegas still have them!

Cons: Just a little away from the a action - that's if you want to nitpick. Took us about 7-10 mins to get to the center of the strip (Caesars\/Cromwell)

If we weren't Total Rewards members, we would spend more time here. Hard to beat free or next to free rooms that we get at Caesars properties.

Thanks for the first and lasting great impression Palazzo!",2,1,1

My friends and I stayed here for a friend's birthday weekend. We parked in Valet for ease and convenience. After hitting the club, we went back to our hotel to crash and we discovered the pipes below the sink were leaking. We called for additional blankets and somebody to come check the sink. Even with the obvious water drops on the floor and on the leaky pipes, they said it wasn't broken and if it continues to call them back. No option to move to a different room. It took 3 calls to get an extra blanket. They apparently sent an extra blanket to the incorrect room.

We only had time for a nightclub because we didn't sleep all night. We went to complain to a the guest services manager Patrick who did not seem to care. All we got were ""sorry"", ""shit happens"", and ""there's nothing we can do"".   He even went to say that valet was a ""locked area"".

When we first arrived check-in was pretty easy. The valet was easy to maneuver and the bell hop took our bags right away. I did use the $20 sandwich tip and it worked out great. He was able to move us to the 44th floor for the strip view. He also provided us with some complimentary tickets to Lavo. We went up to our room in the Venetian and there was dried up vomit on the couch and floor. This was extremely unacceptable for a 5 star hotel that we paid $300.00 a night for. I called down to the front desk to let them know what was in my room. (This is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5) He immediately said he was going to upgrade my room for my troubles. He moved me and my party from the Venetian to the Palazzo. They upgraded my room for free, waived all my resort fees, gave us free drink tickets and had the bell hop take care of all our bags from the trip from the Venetian to the Palazzo. The vomit was really the best thing that happened to us all weekend. When we got up to our room at the Palazzo, it was amazing. What a fantastic view and easily one of the roomiest and best rooms I've ever stayed in. The suite had 3 tv's in the room, yes 3 tv's. It also had a shower and bathtub which came in handy when we filled the bathtub with all our alcohol. The blackout curtains were also amazing. No light went into my sleepy eyes at 2pm. The beds were pretty comfortable and controls to the A\/C & heat were easy to control. I didn't like how they only have a cd player that looks like it was from 2003. This is a state of the art hotel. At least get an ipod hookup to listen to music. The bathrooms were huge. The toilet area was separate from the shower\/bathtub that way no one has to smell the beer craps the next day.

About the rest of the Hotel: If you go during sports seasons, go to Lagasses Sports Book. It is by far the best sports book in Vegas. They have the most comfortable seats, great food and a fantastic atmosphere. I would stay at the Palazzo again in a second. The Venetian...not so much.",0,0,0

I've never had the luxury of staying at The Palazzo Hotel, but on the few occasions that I have visited the lobby and waterfall, I've always been impressed with how nicely decorated the hotel is.

There's always plenty of people taking pictures around the waterfall area each time that I'm here so it's not easy to capture a solo pose.

Even during the few occasions that I've been here, I notice that they change the decor each time that I've taken pictures here.  I honestly don't know if it's seasonally like the Bellagio's garden, but it does seem like it's pretty often.

I'm just glad that I finally got the chance to take some pictures with the infamous ""LOVE"" sign so I can post them on Facebook so everyone knows that I've been there and done that!  LOL",12,9,15

I stayed here for the first time when Tom W.'s company gave their employees a free trip to Vegas which included a fully paid for two night's stay at this hotel.

TV didn't work, called to have it fixed, they said it needed to be replaced, but they took a day and a half to fix it. Total of four phone calls needed because they had closed our ticket without fixing the problem. 

Very high resort fees regardless of whether you use the amenities -- why not just add the fees to the daily rate? They said there would be a mini-fridge and a microwave. There was no microwave, and using the mini-fridge results in a charge, even if you don't eat or drink anything. Moving anything in the fridge results in an automatic charge. And they make it so you are forced to move something if you want to store your own perishable food, such as your leftovers.

No tea or coffee in the room -- never seen that at any hotel, anywhere in the world.

The suite is ""large,"" but it is really split into two parts, one is a small room with a bedroom, and the other has a sofa, which I find of no use at all. The view was terrible.

The show at the Palazzo is not good, and their ""coupon book"" that comes with the room only has coupons to terrible places. The places that are worth visiting don't offer coupons in that stupid book.

The casino is not bad, but you can enter it and play without staying at this awful hotel. Worst hotel we have ever stayed in. Not at all worth its price tag (especially including the fees they don't mention anywhere).",5,2,2

We've never been to Vegas before, so his choice for a hotel was based strictly on online reviews and recommendations from friends.  Needless to say, this was the best hotel we've ever stayed at. We had a luxury king suite, and the bed was so comfortable. I wish we had the same exact bed at home. The room was huge and even had a separate sitting area. The bathroom had a separate tub\/shower and the toilet was off in a small separate area. The bathroom had double sinks and a mirrored vanity. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because we could have used a mini fridge to store some water. There was a fridge in the room that was fully stocked with items, but we were not willing to pay $4 for a bottle of water. You can rent a mini fridge for a daily fee, but we didn't think it was worth doing.

It's so luxurious - shiny and bright, no flaws in sight. Once you step into the lobby you'll see the front desk on your left with sky high ceilings where they pump out some sort of alluring scent that sucks you in. Walk through and you're in the middle of the large casino. Further down you'll find the shops I can't afford, like Christian Louboutin and Herve Leger. 

But the rooms...

Each suite comes with two double beds and a corner couch in the ""living room"" with built-in bed. There were THREE tv's in our room - one in the bathroom, and two bathrobes, and a large bath for bubbles... These rooms make you forget about your real life of poverty and take you to another place of bourgeois and glamour. 

I think the best part about staying at the Palazzo though are the pools. Now, when I think of my ultimate pool I think of the Grotto at the Playboy mansion, something with ambiance - rocks and waterfalls and lush palm trees. So when I heard that Palazzo's pools lack varying topography and landscaping I was kind of bummed. But wait until you see the pools - there are seriously a million pools here (6, I think) combined with Venetian's pools equals a billion. There's small wading pools, hot tubs, Azure (the party pool), large pools. I got lost just trying to get to the pools. And they have lounge chairs in each of the pools where they're about a foot deep into the water so you're halfway immersed like a glistening Malibu Barbie doll that screams, 'YOU WANT ME.'  (I do a beached whale much better than a Barbie.)

And then of course there's Lavo (can more attractive people fit into one restaurant?!) and the restaurants that connect Venetian and Palazzo. The staff is useful too, although with a hotel\/casino that large there isn't much interaction between staff and guests. They were really accommodating when it came to getting housekeeping to bring up a buttload of stuff everyday. Lifesavers.

Our trip to Vegas would've still been insane if we hadn't stayed at Palazzo but man, it definitely helped and I'd looove to hear the stories if those walls could talk.",6,8,7

The housekeeping staff was amazing as was the concierge for helping us with certain issues.  However, when we arrived, our 2 year old daughter was under the weather and was not sleeping well.  We  were finally able to get her to sleep at around midnight.  We had our ""Do not disturb"" sign out.  At 2:00 am, a bellhop in a Palazzo uniform banged on our door multiple times asking if we needed assistance with our luggage.  This was the night we checked in.  When bringing this up to the front desk, they said they could give us complimentary late checkout.

Fast forward to the next day.  We had our ""DND"" placard up the whole first whole day.  The housekeeper saw us leaving and asked if there was anything we needed or wanted.  She did it very politely and as to not intrude but to be accommodating to us and to make sure we were taken care of.  Major props to her.

Lastly, the concierge.  They helped us get our shuttle to the airport.  W00t!

Playing here.. was also a little different.  This time I only lost a little but still some thing seemed a little odd.

I exclusively played craps this time around.  The first night, I was at one end of the table and there was a group of young asian people playing.  They were getting very excited and the shooter had his friends blowing on the dice.  The pit boss did not look happy and started yelling at them without warning.  The second day, the same thing was happening at a different table with a different pit boss.  This time it was an older Caucasian couple.  They were politely asked him to be careful with how he proceeded handling the dice instead of outright yelling.  I'm not sure if the first boss had a bad day (not likely since the second day he looked just as pissed off) or if it was the age\/race difference.  

Another thing that caught me off guard was some of the dealers at the craps tables cheering to some players how, ""We're Trump people here!""  Leave politics out of my vacation please.",2,0,0

Tryst and XS at the Wynn and Encore, which is across the street.

The room itself had all the amenities you would come to expect at this price point.  The remote-controlled drapes and curtains are a nice touch.  So were the 3 flat-screen tvs.  You could probably fit four people comfortably in a single king room if you're really desperate.  The couch is ""L-shaped"" and could accommodate two average sized humans.

Right from the beginning, I knew our stay would be fantastic. The lady helping us check in was incredibly friendly and made sure that they had all the specifics about our stay and specific room requests exactly right. Once we got upstairs to our room, I could hardly believe how huge and luxurious it was. Actually, huge doesn't even begin to describe things. The room was extremely plush and had a large living room area with a full-size lounging couch. The bathroom was equally gigantic, with separate shower and tub. To top things off, every inch of our room was as clean as could possibly be. The bed was very comfortable, which is often not the case with hotel beds. The shower also had great pressure and felt amazing. We had a fantastic view of Treasure Island across the way too.

As nice as the rooms were, I was also quite impressed down on the casino floor. Every single employee was polite and friendly, from the dealers down to the cleaning staff. The cocktail waitress never took more than a couple of minutes to bring us a drink no matter what section we were in or what we were playing. The casino at The Palazzo also had a much cleaner, ritzier feel to it, unlike some of the older places like Stratosphere. If gaming isn't your thing, there are dozens and dozens of great shops, bars, and restaurants, and there is also a connecting walkway to the Venetian.

Once the thing that was a ""mattress"" was taken out of the bed and just placed on the floor, it was much more comfortable.

The people there, including the valet were all very nice and professional. Even checking in, they have a person that will greet you and call you by your last name to escort you to a receptionist. So far, so good.

Once I got into the room, there were just some minor hiccups. Perhaps, the same hiccups that you've read here before when they first opened. The ice bucket handles were flimsy, they broke off immediately. Also the door handles to the bathroom just fell off. What is this for a 5-star resort??? We bumped into the lady that worked in the halls and asked for extra towels. Time passed by and guess what? No towels.

We were there for a conference and felt that the added features of a full office set would come in handy, as the upgrade to the Prestige Lounge.  While the Prestige Lounge was wonderful and worth the upgrade, the rest of our stay was riddled with issues.

When we got to our room, the marble everywhere was filthy.  And it just went downhill from there, it started as little things and as they added up it became bothersome.   

Dirty carpets where our pants collected the dirt and dust.  Remote control for the curtains had the battery low and we could not fully use this feature.  The area where we could plug in our phones behind the night stand was full of dirt and dust and I did not want to put my hand in there.  The printer toners were low and then the paper ran out.  It seemed that the room wasn't verified as ""clean"" and ""ready"" for a new set of guests when we arrived.  In addition to this, while they knew that we were two colleague women sharing a double queen room, the slippers were sized for a man.  It took them a day to get us the right slippers.  This wouldn't be an issue if we felt comfortable walking in stocking feet or barefoot.  During our stay, towels were not refreshed correctly, we were lacking washcloths several days.  Then a bath towel was provided as a bath mat.  Then as the room was cleaned, all of our bathroom products were moved and not placed back as found - my colleagues items where moved to my side an mine to hers.  We had placed everything on towels as we didn't trust that the room was clean.  I had to take stock of all my products nightly to make sure that they were all there.  This would be a minor annoyance if it was the only issue.  In the bathroom, the wall paper was peeling and there was dirt in the crevasses of the water closet.  The check out process was a nightmare that I am still dealing with it.  

We spent nearly a week at the Palazzo, so our charges were substantial.  The day before we were set to check out, we went to double check that the charges were correct, and they weren't.  They had the entire stay on my colleagues account, and the upgrade fees on my account.  The concierge desk said that everything would be fixed and we would get folios emailed to us.  We also set a time for the bell hop to come by in the morning to pick up our bags as I was presenting a session late morning and we had a flight within two hours of the end of my session.  We changed our mind on the time, and this was not communicated to the bell hop team.  Luckily, they came back to the room as requested.  After breakfast, we went to check to confirm that the charges were corrected and to request our folios be printed out since they were not emailed as requested.  The charges were in a SNAFU state, while they assured us that they would be correct, the folios still had the last four digits of my account! They double charged my card for the WRONG amount - to the tune of $300 per double charge (concierge gave us a minimal credit for the issues above).  They insisted it was correct, even showed me the screen with my colleagues charge card number!  Upon checking today, we found that the charges were incorrect and that the notes we left with all the issues listed above still had not been reviewed.

It is a behemoth of a building; impressive both outside and in.  If you are looking for pure luxury in Vegas, this is where you should be.

Without a doubt the Palazzo is the nicest resort in Las Vegas.  The attention to every little detail is amazing.  This resort has definitely earned each of it's 5 diamonds.  The service provided here is impeccable.  Every staff member you encounter is extremely friendly and professional, and you can tell they pride themselves on making your stay as great as possible.  If you ask, they will provide.

The rooms are also incredible.  This is an all-suite resort so even the smallest room is almost double the size of any other standard room in Vegas.  I was fortunate enough to stay in a Siena Suite with a strip view.  Absolutely breathtaking.  Plenty of room to relax and entertain guests.  

One of the most impressive things about this resort is the fact that you don't need to leave for anything (this could be a problem depending how you look at it).  There are a ton of restaurants, bars, shops, activities, shows, pools, casinos, etc. all on site.  If you didn't want to leave, you wouldn't have to.  I stayed there for 7 nights and I still didn't get bored of the place.  I wasn't thrilled by the casino though, probably because it wasn't that busy and the dealers weren't the friendliest, but the casino next-door at the Venetian is fun.

And as far as restaurants, I would recommend TAO if you're looking for a ""cool"" dining experience, CUT if you're looking for an expensive upscale dinner, and the Grand Lux Cafe for all other dining needs.  Grand Lux Cafe is essentially a Cheesecake Factory, and has great breakfast and burgers (among many other things) for very reasonable prices.  I would highly recommend it. 

All things considered, the Palazzo is an amazing place.  If you are trying to decide where to stay, look no further.

It helped that there were nine of us staying in a one-room suite with two beds and a fold-out couch.  I'm not going to sit here and pretend that wasn't snug, but it wasn't uncomfortable either.  We brought one air mattress, and that was enough to ensure no one slept on the floor.  There was just the one bathroom, but we were all able to shower\/get ready\/use the toilet at the same time, at the small cost of our privacy.  Other than bedding and bathroom space, our suite didn't even feel crowded.  It was giant, with a comfortable sunken living room and a great view out the wide window.  We hung out in the hotel room a fair amount during our trip.  On our second night, we sat on the couches and played bachelorette party games.  The room was ideal for that kind of parlor gathering.  My friends even decorated it while two of them lured me away to gamble.  It was perfect.

We didn't gamble much this trip, and that was probably for the best.  We did take advantage of some of the other attractions - we spent a day by the pool, and ate at Grand Lux and Sushi Samba.  Overall, it was an excellent weekend, and The Palazzo was a great choice for our stay.  I'd highly recommend it, whether you're traveling alone or with all of your closest friends.",4,1,2

I love the layout of the suite here. 2 queen beds and a living room with a sofa sleeper. 7 can sleep here pretty comfortably. 

From what I can remember, sleeping on the bed is like sleeping on a cloud. I've probably contemplated not going out and just staying in bed because it was really that comfortable. This room is beyond luxurious and the hotel is a great place to stay since it's right next to Wynn, Venetian and TI.

We were very suprised to see so many differences between the two, especially on the negative side since this was the newer of the two hotels. My boyfriend and I agreed that this had to be the hotel geared more towards older folks since the venetian has since gone to a younger crowd with clubs like Tao and Tao Beach bringing in the younger crowds. 
With the Palazzo we found a more uncomfortable bed, a 3 HOUR wait for room service, one of those slow rain showers that take a few more hours to get my conditioner out of my hair, and calling to have our room cleaned...and then they never show up.

First off I am an MGM Guy - Bellagio 90% of the time and I gamble which may not be the #1 source of income these days at Hotels but it should amount to something.  This trip was for friend's bachelor party so I am trying something new to not have to taxi back and forth. 

 Arriving from LAX late on Thursday Evening after 5 days in Pebble Beach so I'm already exhausted as I get to the hotel at 1155PM...  Gave my bags to bellman who said give your ticket to front desk bags will come up..

Go to check in and the line is unusually long for this time of night and it appears that it is taking 15 minutes for every guest I have no idea what the dissertation was between each guest but it was unnerving.  It also appeared each front desk personal was talking with each other walking in the back room taking a break or not giving notice to the long line.  To keep it brief 1 Hour Later yes 1 HOUR I check in.. I'm tired and cranky to begin with.  

TOLD MY KING NON SMOKING IS NOT AVAILABLE SORRY... Unreal, I have a confirmation and told them of late arrival and no apologies sometimes this happens. This is unacceptable. Take room as I'm exhausted give valet ticket for luggage to front desk and they tell me 10 minutes. 

30 Minutes later I call where is my luggage? FRONT DESK NEVER ENTERED IN MY TICKET.. 15 minutes later 1:45 AM bags arrive completely unacceptable.  Offer to waive ""RESORT FEES"" for my inconvenience. Nice touch but this $30.00 a day add on is a joke anyway.  

Have to give them it on the room itself as it is gorgeous sunken area for desk and TV with large couch and table..With beds on upper level Bathroom is gorgeous and enormous.  Could be a bit brighter lights wise. 

Maid service during the trip, I get turn down service from Bellagio every night not here.. Nothing also two times I filled Ice bucket with Ice which melted obviously and turned to water...Neither day were they emptied and the dirty glasses next to the ice bucket left dirty not moved again Unacceptable and after 3 days the dirty glass used on day 1 remained in front of the Ice Bucket it was never cleared.

5K credit line requested with statement to credit officers, please let me know it is approved via email text or phone that it is all set up.  NOT ONE Contact in the week up to arrival even though it was approved with no problem. 

Blackjack rules a joke in the Casino- most tables pay 6 to 5 on BJ and they all hit soft 17.   When asking for 3-2 Blackjack payoffs, they offered if I played 100.00 or more per hand No Problem... THINKING the soft 17 is also been removed and taking a bad beat on a Double down to a soft 17 that hits a 3 to beat my 19 to the tune of an $800.00 turn around I realize  I can't gamble on BJ here.    I stick to Craps rest of the trip and end up losing.

No Full Race & Sports book in Palazzo 10 minute walk to Venetian

Do they have nice shops, restaurants, pool area - grand canal shops hands down some of the most diverse around.   Already stated rooms were outstanding. 

Gaming Rules notwithstanding the customer service level from check in to rooms not being available as reserved to lack of complete cleaning by housekeeping at $300.00 per night thanks but  No Thanks .. AND THE FINAL miss-step of the Trip... Called Bell Desk to request bag pickup in Room... told 10 Minutes and waited 30 before finally hauling my bags myself down to the Taxi Stand..

First of all, this hotel provide super nice deals at weekdays. I paid 300$ for 2 nights with all fees and taxes. One of the best deals for this type of hotels. But if will stay here again I will think twice to pay full price (almost 400$ per night). Now I'll try to explain why. 
Terrible room service. I ordered dinner at my room and paid 91$. When you paid 91$ for dinner you want get nice service and delicious food, right? But food was cold and tasteless. I ordered vegan salad, but got salad with bacon. I tried to get new one, but was hold at phone almost 15 minutes and after that waited for a new salad more that 45 minutes. I waste my time and my money. 
Not clean room. I found small pieces of food at coffee table and hairs at my bed.

First, I was there for a softball tournament, and had a roommate, who checked in a day later than I did.  When he did check in, all of a sudden my room keycard stopped working, and I had to contact the front desk to fix this issue.  Then, since he had checked out very early in the morning of the same morning when I was scheduled to leave, they stopped my keycard from working agin, in addition to the internet service, even though I had not yet checked out--I was locked out of my room when I went down to get coffee.  

The kicker came today, when i went to check my credit card balance online, and found they (the Palazzo) had charged my for extra charges other than what I had seen on my statement when I checked out--it was for an additional $125.  When I called the hotel, the accounts receivable people told me they could not help me, I had to speak with ""group reservations"", then the ""group reservatiojns"" people told me I had to speak with accounts receivable.

It is obvious the management of this hotel does not know how to manage a hotel.  I will now have to dispute these additional charges with my credit card company.  I am so mad I will never, ever, stay at either the Venetian or the Palazzo againm, nor will I ever gambel there.

We just stayed this weekend and it's still the same, however there is slight aging in some of the furniture. Nothing bad, but you can see a bit in the wood of the bench etc. The room was spacious, clean and classic decor. 
The hotel smells nice and airy compared to most hotels. (we've also stayed at their sister hotel Venetian and like that as well) What we love the most is the location. Central on the strip and close to all the action. Everything you need is here. Restaurant Row for foodies (Puck, Batali, Legasse, Keller and even a new place by the cake boss) and also midlevel food options italian, asian noodles, grimaldis, Burgers and Beer and even coffee bean, a juicery, espressamente (gelato\/ expresso etc) Walgreens is out front if you forget anything. There is also a higher end mall within. But you can also cross to get to fashion show mall. You really don't have to leave these 2 hotels. 
The pool is great for us since we have a toddler and there's a large portion that is 1.5 ft. deep so he had a lot of room to swim\/play. You can access all the pools at Venetian\/Palazzo so you have many pool choices. There are several bars, Tao Club (Venetian) and also a day club so you if you're attending those, you don't need to walk far. The crowd is mixed with partiers, families, couples etc. Unlike the Cosmopolitan which is mostly younger\/ partiers so if you want a nice solely ""party hotel"" chose the Cosmo, however they did have a lot of good-looking people dressed to club \/dinner here as well. Bellagio & Wynn are comparable but a tad more upscale crowd.
Everyone was super friendly friendly to us as soon as we walked to the directory, we we were asked if we needed help, same at the pool area, elevators that i'm quite shocked by some bad reviews. Luckily we didn't have any power outtage issues like a reviewer experienced. 
If you park close to where it says Front Desk, you'll have a short walk to registration and to the rooms. 
Only cons are that the tub is a bit smaller (Trump and caesars palace had a huge 2 person tub while this is just a single) No free bottled waters, no fridge (it's a mini bar you have to pay for if anything is moved) So if you're looking of more of an apartment\/suite type, maybe the trump or vdara.",0,0,0

For years that I've been going to Vegas, staying at the Palazzo has been nothing than an expensive headache and inconvenience that I question myself, WHY DO I KEEP BOOKING HERE ?!

The rooms here are lovely. I love how they are all mini-suites, with plenty of space. Bathrooms are large with a separate shower and tub, and closed toilet. A large double sink vanity and a separate vanity for the girls to do makeup. There are sunken living room areas with a pullout and a sectional sofa. Two large TVS. A desk, plus table that sits 3. Plenty of electrical sockets for charging everything. The rooms are so accommodating, of course I want to stay here.

HOWEVER, checking in is always a NIGHTMARE and no matter what, I am ALWAYS given wrong information from the front desk, that it just makes the stay frustrating. For example, last year our room was not available until 6pm, in which they transferred my stay to the Venetian (even though I booked it at the Palazzo). And my past trip this past weekend was a nightmare. I originally booked MGM for Saturday for $180 (taxes and fees included). However, knowing check in was at 3pm and MGM was sold out Friday night and we were going to arrive late Friday night\/early Saturday morning, I decided to book a stay for Friday-Sunday at the Palazzo for roughly $370 per night including taxes and resort fees. I called Palazzo to explain to them that we were coming from CA and we were driving, so our arrival time might vary. They assured me since the room was prepaid that we would have no problems checking in. Well thanks to the long 9 hour drive, we ended up getting to Vegas around 7am. Went straight to Palazzo hoping to get some shut-eye before heading out to Wet Republic, but once at the Front Desk, I learn that my reservations were cancelled, I ""forfeited"" the $370 for the first night, and our room will now not be available till 3pm, or whenever rooms become available... GREAT. They issued us keys and told us that they will give us a call once the room was available with the room number so we could just go straight to the room. The lady checking us in told us that we are more than welcome to use the Spa facilities to use the bathroom, shower, get ready, etc... or so we thought after lugging our luggage to the spa just to get rejected. We ended up changing in the bathroom and leaving our luggage in the car and headed out. Around 2pm I received a message from a lady from the Venetian front desk saying our suite was now ready. Great. Moving us to the Venetian (again!?) So we lugged our luggage from Palazzo to Venetian to find out, oh sorry, our room was at the Palazzo. Seriously !? And of course, no one at Front Desk took responsibility. No sorry. No anything. Just ""I hope you enjoy your stay at the Palazzo and we hope to see you again!"" You got to be kidding me. 

No, Palazzo, I don't ever want to stay here again, even though I love your rooms and I have the best luck at your casino. And yes, I want my money back. And YES, I am cancelling my reservations for this coming up October. And Yes, I will never recommend your hotel to anyone ever again. It's a shame, really.",3,2,0

We've been coming for the past several years here annually. I don't know exactly what ur us about this place but it always treats us well, so to speak. 

One of the higher-end casinos, imho, but here's a lot of ""conveniences"" here as well. Restaurants are super close and easily accessible from the room suites, there's even a coffee bean right outside the access area to be guest rooms. 

Also, the kids totally love it here.  The pool is nice during the summer and they love he suites so much that they are totally fine hanging out in the room during the colder parts of the season.  It's very important that the kids like it here, but even more important that kids are WELCOME here. Friends of mine have been to hotels like the Wynn with their kids and other hotel guests were actually giving them dirty looks! Some people can be very elitist I guess, but not palazzo. =)

The rooms are nice, spacious, and clean. Never any issues there.  

Staff has always been awesome. Never a problem with them and they take care of all our needs. 

Parking is VERY close to the rooms, which is a big plus to me.  I've stayed at my fair share of hotels in Vegas and most of them have a pretty hefty walk from self parking to the rooms. And the icing on the cake is that you can access self parking OFF of the strip!!!! That's a mega-plus, knowing the traffic around these parts.  We usually go straight down to P3 or P4 and park near the elevators into the casino(not the front desk area, a little further to the left). Super convenient, esp when you're leaving the hotel.  

Prices are typical for this style hotel, but if I've learned anything in my many many MANY trips to Vegas over the years, it's that you absolutely get what you pay for.

And frankly, this review is for both the Venetian (for the check in) and the Palazzo (for the room).

As luck might have it, I actually bid for my Vegas hotel on priceline and I was crossing my fingers hoping that I would be placed at the Venetian. And guess what? For a low nightly rate of $135\/night (not including tax and\/or resort fees, obviously), I won myself a room at the Venetian.

Fast forward to Vegas trip back in October 2011 (my first Vegas trip, mind you), I drove from the airport to the Venetian and I had no problem finding parking in the underground garage. The traffic on the strip was not too bad, but hey, it's the Vegas strip. I thoroughly enjoyed my view during the ride to the hotel.

So I parked, and went up on my happy way to check in. The line was pretty long, but it was moving along pretty fast. As a matter fact, when it was time for me to check in, a staff at the front desk actually called me up to the side reception area (I think for preferred Grazie members or something like that).  She was VERY friendly, and VERY helpful. Why the capital ""VERY""? Well, I'll tell you why! After she looked up my information in the system and knowing that I had made reservations at the hotel through priceline, she didn't treat me any differently (I'd been to hotels where they treated me differently if I'd reserved through priceline even thought I was a gold member at the time. Ahem Marriott! Ahem Hilton!)

Anyway, as she was trying to check me in, I asked her if there was any complimentary upgrade that she could throw my way. She looked at me and said, ""let me see what I can do"". And while she was looking in the system, I asked her again if I could get a room at the Palazzo instead of the Venetian.  She smiled, and said, ""that shouldn't be a problem"". Long story short,  I was put up on the (if I remember correctly) 24th floor of the Palazzo looking down on the strip, right across from the Treasure Island. And the best thing about overlooking the Treasure Island is the fact that I was able to just look out the window and watch the pirate show at TI.

On top of all this, I had asked her about the clubs at the hotel (Lavo and Tao) and asked her if I could maybe get passes for the clubs. She provided me with passes to Lavo and politely informed me that Tao never provided free passes because it's the more popular clubs between the two. Whether or not this was true wasn't really an issue for me because hey, I got me a couple of free passes to Lavo which was good enough. She also told me that if I were to contact the concierge, there was a very likely chance that I might be able to get in for free to Tao. I didn't bother doing that, though. 

The suite that I stayed in at the Palazzo was wonderful.  The bed was comfortable. It was plenty big for me and one other person. The bathroom was beautiful and the couch was comfortable and big enough for maybe for a couple of other people to sleep in comfortably if you're thinking about staying here with a few more people.

The only downside about staying at the Palazzo\/Venetian is it's located almost all the way North of the strip so if you want to be in the center of it all, this is probably not the best place to stay in.. However, considering the rate that I had, the upgrades that I received despite my priceline reservation, the free club passes, I wouldn't think twice about coming back and staying here. 

In conclusion, easy parking, friendly\/awesome customer service, nice suites, I can't ask for more.

P.S. If it's not obvious yet, the Venetian and the Palazzo are sister hotels that are connected to one another with Palazzo being the newer one between the two.",1,0,0

Place was nice. Parking was idk, I didn't like it. Felt like the mall. And it was HOT as hell in there! Like, more hot than outside. 

Our room was really nice. Got a suite, 2 queen sized beds, and a conjoining room with our friends. :] 

Total 8 in our combined rooms. They have a remote control to open up the blinds. It was pretty amazing haha. 

BUT..OUR ROOM WAS HAUNTED. 
SWEAR.
First, friend was showering and she asked if I came in (the doors don't lock..nor the bathroom) and I said no, why? And she said she saw a person with a lot of hair walk by. D: WTFF. 

Then, all the girls were in one room and all of a sudden, we hear something fall in the bathroom. We run in, and my make up palette is scattered all over the floor. I put it on the table where it wasn't hanging off..so there was no way it could just fall. It was really weird.

I cleaned it up and closed the palette..when we came back, my palette was open again. :\/ so weird. So we were scared for like the majority of the time haha. 

I honestly don't like the smell of the place though. It doesn't smell like a fresh hotel smell. Kind of like baby powder mixed with some flowery smell. 

It does take a while for service. Asked for some extra towels, took them about a good 20 minutes or so to bring em up. 

Generally a good experience.",8,11,7

The front desk staff was extremely helpful. We checked in quite quickly and were upgraded to a better room. We were also told that we would be allowed to get a fridge if one becomes available for no extra charge.  At check in, they ask if you want to pay the resort fee ($20+tax) with gym and WiFi included. If not, it's a lot more expensive to get gym privileges. We went with the fee.

Our room was amazing. It was about 700 square feet. There were 3 TV's (one in the bathroom?), two queen beds, a desk, and a huge living room area which was great. It was very quiet at night and the bathroom had a tub, shower, sinks and a vanity which comes in handy for putting on makeup (not for me, seriously?). 

The casino is spacious and pretty clean. Smoke can be an issue, but not anymore so than any other casino.  The Grand Lux is worth checking out if you're hungry. 

The shops are nice too. Very high end and some nice restaurants as well. The Palazzo is attached to the Venetian which is nice as well. Both are quite beautiful hotels and treat their guests well.

We had a problem with the WiFi so they waived the resort fee. Awesome!

Note. The Grazie Shuttle departs every half hour from 6am-6pm from the VENETIAN! from the Palazzo, it's only every hour. Trust me on that one.

Its beautiful inside and out and I can never say negative things about Palazzo! I have been to The Venetian but I prefer coming to The Palazzo over Venetian anyday. Even though theyre literally next to each other and is connected through The Grand Canal Shoppes (GCS), I still like Palazzo a lot more :)

The GCS is nice! It's pretty big and beautiful inside. Look up and you can see the blue sky. They also have Gondola where it goes through GCS and to outside I believe. It's not that expensive if I remember it correctly. It's worth it if youre with your loved one, whether it's your family or your loving husband\/wife. GCS has so many great restaurants and shops I like. Basin White is one of the favorites to buy bath bombs, soaps and I really love their Lip Scrub :)) Barney & New York is pretty big with its own entrance from outside the hotel with valet service. Morels is a nice steakhouse. I really enjoy eating there though we have it in Los Angeles as well.

The representatives at the front desk are superb!!! They always give me the best suite available. Also when I dont like the room I was offered, I usually reject and ask for 'better' one and they ALWAYS accommodate my needs without questioning. Thats probably why I keep coming back to the Palazzo! I get complimentary stay very frequently and nothing can beat that! Even with comp stay, I always end up staying at the suite I like on the highest floor they can offer. If you like that 'sink-in' suites then dont get anything above 45. Those rooms dont have it and to me, it looks smaller and less special.

Grazie rewards are awesome too! I never know but sometimes I have free slot credits in my account so thats always good! I have won a lot of money using that free slot credit, hehe. Any rewards desk at any other casinos, they dont stay open 24\/7. So try going there during their business hours. Theyre usually open til 10 PM or midnight, I forget.

But one of the BEST parts of the Palazzo is their SUITE. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the sink-in concept of the living room area from the bed. That 2 mini steps makes everything much more spacious and special! Love the vanity table in the bathroom with makeup magnifying mirror! I know us girls are crazy about having a good bathroom! Their Bathtub and just everything they have to offer, is what I truly love!

Yes, the suites here at the Palazzo arent the cheapest and they can get expensive but hey, its really beautiful, convenient and you will LOVE your stay here. Great housekeeping and room service as well. You can always ask for housekeeping later if you didnt get it when they usually do it in the mornings. Just call them and let them know. Dont forget to tip them! They work hard to go after your mess you made last night. Theyre usually always kind and welcoming!

Do you want to hear something EXTREMELY odd BUT  interesting? This summer, I came to the Palazzo stayed for 4 nights with my best friend. Then we checked out in the afternoon and headed to the airport in the evening to catch my flight to Germany for my second vacation. My friend left way before I did. Hours later; I was in line to check in and guess what? I randomly remembered that I left my CHANEL BAG and a bag full of miscellaneous stuff. This was like 9 hours after I checked out! I immediately called the Palazzo and got connected to Lost & Found. I gave them my suite number and said I left my Chanel Bag and a bag with a lot of stuff in it. WELL, THEY HAD IT! I was soooooo relieved when I heard that!!! I took Uber back to the Palazzo, picked up my precious bags and came back to the airport JUST IN TIME and left for Germany, LOL!

I was so happy, you dont even know how I felt that night. I thought they wouldnt have my bags because last time I left something really valuable at another hotel, they told me they didnt have it. I was devastated...cried for days for that. Well, dont you guys ever leave anything behind like me. My fault for leaving them and not double checking anyway -_- PLEASE CHECK, CHECK and CHECK AGAIN!

ALL IN ALL, I LOVE PALAZZO AND THEIR STAFF! HOTEL IS BEAUTIFUL, SUITES ARE AMAZING and SHOPPES ARE VERY CONVENIENT! Hey, they have Honolulu Cookies AND Royce Chocolates!!! PARIS BAGUETTE is also extremely fancy here compared to ones back home in Los Angeles or even the ones in Korea, haha.",17,14,17

The room are the same as the rooms at the Palazzo but you pay $100+ more to get this level of service. The other reviewer has given a good summary of what you get for your money. That is: access to the lounge with the food and drinks, short check in and check out on the 23 floor, free newspapers, concierge services at the desk on the 23rd floor. We wanted luxury, pampering, shopping and shows.

the good: 
It is the Palazzo, go online and check out the rooms if you have not stayed there the SUITES ARE EXCEPTIONAL. Continental Breakfast, snacks (candy and fruit), appetizers in the evening and free drinks including alcohol. 
Responsive to requests- when I checked in they had a stack of newspapers at the desk I asked if they had a Wall Street Journal the clerk gave me one and said they would make sure I got one every day, and it was faithfully delivered to my suite every day. I also got a shower chair.

the bad:
The standards in Las Vegas are low compared to other cities, the Prestige at the Palazzo is no exception. We did not have any glasses in our suite when we got there, and some of the drawers did not work in the dresser, and the nightstand clock was not functioning, at $350+ a night I expect everything to be correct. 
The lights are complicated, my daughter slept with the lights on in her suite, because she could not figure out how to turn them off.
Zombie Connecting Room charges, they will not stay dead- we had two suites and when we booked the agent said she would drop the ""connection charge"" if I booked with her right away. They were back at check in and removed AGAIN, at check out because we complained about the noise they offered to remove them... AGAIN, because they had only been removed from one room.
WiFi is included and worked well in the mornings but not in the afternoons.

THE UGLY: 
The Palazzo had a private party going on while we were there the music was so loud on the pool deck that our suites, ON THE 25 FLOOR, were throbbing with the bass of the music. So much so that the TVs in our suites were shaking noticeably, not only could we HEAR the music but we FELT it in our bones. (I have no doubt the participants have hearing damage) I called the desk about 11:40 PM and asked when the music would be ending and I was told that guests all over the hotel were complaining and the music was supposed to have ended at 11 pm and security was already on their way to shut it down. The volume went down some time after midnight.

The response:
I enquired about the noise policy when we checked out, ""When could I expect to have quiet enjoyment of my rooms?"" - 2am. The clerk was very understanding and removed the remaining connection charges and some room service charges. Nice, but really did not address our lack of sleep due to the noise. She did recommend that if we came back we try the EAST Wing as that overlooks a golf course and the Wynn and there would likely not be a noise problem there.
We were told that the manager was not in yet but she would give us a call, she did and she removed ONE room night from ONE of our suites and told us if we came back to call her and she would take care of us personally. I have no doubt that she would, and throw in some extras, but I am not anxious to return, we have so little time off, it seems imprudent to risk it.

If you want to party this is a great place to go for all the reasons mentioned, if you want luxury, and pampering- I suggest you look elsewhere. My friend who first recommended the Palazzo to me, now stays at the Wynn. I may try that or I may just stay-cation at a nice place in San Francisco.",9,3,0

The restaurants were decent, and having the Venetian and their shops and restaurants right next door was convenient.  Since this was my first stay in Vegas, I had nothing to compare it to. Over the summer I returned to Vegas and stayed at a different hotel, and let me just say, it made me miss the Palazzo and wish I had shelled out the money for it. Sure, when you're in Vegas you don't spend a lot of time in your room, however, being a girl, I want to be comfortable, I want a spot to do my makeup, I want a tub that doesn't look sketchy (even though I probably won't use the tub), and the Palazzo provided all of that.

Apparently players club cards are truly worth the 5 minutes!!  I hit a couple of good wins and I've been getting great deals here ever since - sometimes free!

The rooms (suites) are enormous and lush.  Rock star.  Big enough for a small party before you hit the town.  Big enough to live in for days on end... which I've done.  In this price bracket, Palazzo makes perfect sense.  It's hard to justify anything else with the exception of the Encore, perhaps.

The restaurant selection is killer.  There are about 7 pools which are shared with the Venetian hotel.  There's an easy bridge to the Wynn.  The club (LAVO) isn't bad.  Tons of shopping and sites, of course.  I think it's overly perfumed - only gripe.  Returning soon!",3,2,2

This end of the strip is the place to be and you will have all you need without having to walk past the Venetian. Here's why...

Check In- Quick! So many of the hotels in Vegas have horrible long check in lines but not here. They were full staffed, friendly and efficient. I acknowledged that we booked the cheapo off strip room but asked if they had any strip views and they were nice enough to upgrade us. He also offered us late checkout and i thought that was very nice.

The room: All rooms in this hotel are suites. You will get a full living room with television, sleeping area with television and an extra large bathroom with...you guessed it...a television. We had a strip view and it looked out onto the Treasure Island pirate ship show which was fun. The room was clean with comfy couches and beds. It was perfect.

Housekeeping: They do a great job here. We spilled a drink on the comforter (oops) and called for a new one to be brought up. Not only did they bring up a new comforter but she cleaned the entire room again and changed all the sheets. I thought that was a bit above and beyond.

Casino: Maybe because this is a newer casino the ventilation is extra good but you won't ever call this casino smoky. It's clean with great lounges.

Clubs: The Palazzo is host to LAVO. This is a smaller club but a lot of fun. If one of the promoters speaks to you during the day don't snub him. He is legit and will get you on the list which will save you a long line or worse being turned away. All I had to do was text him and he got us in without a cover.

Location: Next to the very posh Wynn and Encore. These are great casinos with crazy clubs. Take a stroll over there. The Palazzo is connected to the Venetian so you can enjoy the shops without having to walk the sidewalk. The Mirage is right across the street which has some great restaurants.

If you want old school Vegas maybe this part of the strip isn't for you. If you want new and fancy this is the spot for you. This all-suite hotel is worth every penny. Enjoy the luxury and hopefully win big. Good luck!",1,0,0

Their suites are spacious and well worth the price especially if you're planning a ladies outing or with the family. This was my fourth trip to Vegas and one of my top two suites.  There are three televisions (bathroom, bedroom and living room). Vanity, walk-in closet, sitting area. I joked with my mom and told her that mysuite was larger than my 1200 square feet one bedroom but its the truth. 

The casino wasn't overcrowded, they had nice shoppes and a nice selection of restaurants for the most part. 

Just DO NOT eat at The Cut....The food was phenomenal but the waiter informed one of my guests (European male) of that gratuity was not included, which did not rub me the right way and I expressed myself accordingly. Please do not assume that all Europeans do not tip because he is quite wealthy. 

I would have scored them a 4.5 but my experience at The Cut took the taste from out of my mouth.",0,1,0

The guy said it would be a view of the golf course, but it actually was a view of parking decks and roof tops. The GF didn't like this, so we went down stairs and request a room with a strip view. They charged us for the upgrade. So I'm going to deduct points based on this mishap. But service was good with the housekeepers. 
After we got over that episode, the room we got was nice. The pics tell it all. Nice bed with cool bed post lighting, two tone carpet with a dark gray background with these black swirling design. Sunken living room with a nice couch & ottoman. Marble foyer leading to the French doors marble bathroom with shower cabin and tub. His\/Hers sinks, vanity and stool for the ladies and their makeup. TV in the bedroom, living room, and bath room. The top of the dresser at center of the bedroom lights up reminding you of being in the lounge at Tao, nice touch. Also a small dining table and work desk with printer. Being Palazzo, the decor was elegant and classy. 
We didn't get a chance to hang out at the pool but from what we saw it's nice. Also staying at Palazzo gets you into the club\/bar and pool at Venetian and vice-versa. 
The location is another selling point. We had friends staying at Wynn and we hanged out a lot at Encore & Venetian. So it was convenient to stay here. 
I thought the casino itself was a huge open-space that resembled a warehouse or airport hanger. I guess b\/c to me they have a lot of unfilled open space. Lots of high end shops and eateries as you probably know. We saw our friend's room at Wynn and as much as I like Wynn, our room was definitely better, hands down. 
The rooms are big and there is a pull out sleeper, so you can pile some friends in and cut down room cost.

The rooms are excellent! We had a sunken living room withthe most comfortable sectional couch ever. 3 flat screen tvs and a bathroom almost as big as the second bedroom in my apartment at home. Bed was comfortable.

Canyon Ranch Spa is outstanding. Best spa I have been to. Expensive but you get your moneys worth. And you can use the facilities all day.

I took away a star because of some issues - in our bathroom, the mirror knob coverings were missing in some areas and our vanity mirror stool was broken! Whoever broke it tried to glue it back together which didn't work. I stood up and it broke! I also was not that impressed with the casino, probably because I hate video poker and it was everywhere!

Even with minor issues, I've stayed here 12-15 times over the last few years and it's been the most reliable place to book in Vegas for me.

Parking is still free here... at least for now. Props to V\/P staff for not succumbing to that latest Vegas trend.

Decor is sophisticated and elegant. This past weekend, they had all the decorations up for Chinese New Year, and all the red and gold lanterns and added decorations made for spectacular pops of color. The ""love"" statue in front of the water fall on the way up to the Venetian from the Palazzo also made for a perfect photo op! 

SUPER spacious rooms with understated sophisticated decor. Bathrooms are HUGE and beautiful (no locks on the actual toilet room door though... so knock first :)) All-tile, with a separate shower and bathtub. Bella suites sleep 7 (2 queens, pullout bed, and L-Shaped couch), although the hotel charges if you book more than 2 adults for the room. Their King Bella with Views is GORGEOUS, and perfect for a *romantic* getaway weekend. Both have a ""bedroom"" area, three steps don is a ""sunken"" living room which has a couch, TV, a table, and a desk. Plenty of space to lounge around and chat means that it's a welcome respite to catch up with friends and enjoy a drink off the craziness of the Strip for a few moments here and there. We splurged on the Fortuna suite one year, and while the wet bar area was AMAZING, and the foyer was gorgeous, we ended up sticking to the luxury\/bella suites because they're a lot more open and better for hanging out as a group. 

I way prefer Palazzo vs Venetian for two reasons: 1) It's newer\/nicer, and the rooms definitely show it! 2) It's SO MUCH EASIER to get in and out of. Being next door to the Venetian means it's always easy to go shopping\/find quick food when you want it, but navigating Palazzo is so much easier. The casino\/hotel itself is much smaller, marketed more towards a high-end experience (Kate Spade, Louboutin stores, and LAVO, which is the best brunch I'll never remember) versus fast food. I think this generally keeps the hotel a little quieter, which I really like.

One of the things I love the most about staying here is the staff. Everyone from the concierge, to check-in staff, to the maids, to the security guards are nothing but helpful and courteous. Had a minor issue with the wi-fi this past weekend since my friend was trying to get a few hours of work done; not only did they fix the problem, they STILL sent someone from IT to the suite to make sure it was fixed and check that she didn't need anything else. Maids are always wonderful, and concierge never drops a beat. They send things up in 15 minutes or less 90% of the time. This service is really what has separated out Palazzo for me; even when we looked much younger, it was one of the few hotels where we were still treated with respect, and you'd better believe I've never forgotten it.

Minor Gripe: One, their ""grazie"" rewards program is a joke. You can sign up for emails that get you deals (i.e. half off on weekend sweets a couple summers ago, recent ""third night free"" promotion) but it doesn't have anything to do with how often you stay there. They go based on the past 18 months of reservations. They're also extremely vague about what exactly the benefits are. Sign up for the emails to be kept in the loop, but if you find a better deal elsewhere, I would go for it!

I left this weekend SO HAPPY to have spent another fabulous weekend at this hotel, and I'm sure I will be back again. 5 stars despite minor annoyances because Palazzo, you've been so good to me over the years, and staying here is really a great value.",2,2,1

I don't know if it's some perfume that they incorporate into the ventilation system but this place smells nice without overwhelming the senses.

Service was good but not the best I've ever encountered. When I was checking in, the person at the front desk could not answer what the sales tax was. She looked completely caught off guard and didn't even bother to ask a colleague for that simple request. Her only response was ""I don't know, I am from Texas."" Huh, but don't you work\/live here now? She wasn't being mean, just a bit clueless for such a nice hotel.

I stayed in the bella suite with 2 queen beds on the 32nd floor but was facing the back of the hotel so no view of the Strip for me. I paid $189 before tax. There is a $20 per night resort fee. I think the resort fees are stupid - either include it in the quoted price or get rid of it. I didn't think the ""services"" validated the $20 per night especially when my free wi-fi that should have been provided in my room didn't exist. So I called front desk and told them to waive the resort fee and they did. 

The rooms here are extremely spacious! It's probably the biggest room I've ever stayed in - I think it's larger than some people's apartments! This is the type of room where 4 people can stay in comfortably.

As for transportation, plan to walk in Vegas, but if you want to take the monorail, I'd book another hotel instead of the Palazzo. Preferably book a hotel that has a monorail station behind the hotel you're staying at. You have to walk through the Palazzo, then the Venetian, then outside around the corner, across some street to get to the Harrah's parking structure, then through Harrah's casino, then up the escalators after starbucks and then you have to walk further to get to the monorail station. Um, no thanks unless you have comfy shoes

Pros:
- spacious ""luxury suite""
- bathroom is very large; tub, stand up shower, double sinks, additional vanity area and includes a toilet that's housed in a separate small room
- bed and pillows were comfortable
- good airflow and room temperature
- 3 TVs - living room, in front of the bed and in the bathroom 
- Walgreens is really close by, same goes for the Fashion Show Mall (10 min walk or less).

Cons:
- the $20 daily resort fees are in and above your quoted rate. the fees include: access to the gym in the Canyon Ranch SpaClub for up to two guests, free wi-fi in your room, unlimited local and toll free calls, newspaper, free boarding pass printing, one free regular coffee at Cafe Press and some 2 for 1 drink at some of their lounges. Um...rip off! there's lots of free wifi around the area so save your money and try to talk your way out of it.
- room wasn't as clean as it should be...nothing terrible but stains here and there that should have been wiped
- pricey and not very good restaurants attached to this hotel 
- no complimentary coffee\/tea\/water in the room
- not close to monorail
- TV quality was medicore and channel selection was below average. No Food Network?",5,0,0

Service was great too. Checked in and out with no problem. We also called for extra towels and blankets on separate occasions and they sent people up as soon as they could.

My only complaint would be that the beds were a little too soft and the pillows were so high and fluffy that I woke up with my neck and back aching... but that's hopefully just because I'm not used to such a soft surface and not because I'm getting old. :'(",12,10,9

The suites have the bed area with comfyass sheets and blankets along with a flat screen, then a sunken living room area with comfy couches, a desk, and another flat screen.  The windows had a really great view of part of the strip too. Now on to my favorite part of the room...

the BATHROOM. Ladies, this bathroom is heaven. It has his and her sinks, a separate tub, and a glass shower. A flat screen. And a little vanity area with a makeup mirror and cute l ittle stool to sit on. It's nice and big too, so your man can fuss over his hair and shaving in his area, while you still have lots of space to fuss over your own hair and makeup. I love itttt!!!

The drapes over the windows in the living room area also operate by remote, so you dont even have to walk over and pull the drapes yourself at night. All the little touches and details of the suite were superb.

I also really enjoyed their casino. They have a lot of brand new slots that are pretty high techy, with their 3D screens. I found lots of things to play.

One of the things that I like the most about this hotel is that it's an all-suites hotel! Yep!

If you are like me and those super small 300sq ft deluxe rooms bother you then The Palazzo is a perfect match for you. 

I literally stayed at the Venetian the night before and quickly remembered why these two properties are like brother and sister ha-ha!

Seems though that the Palazzo is definitely going to offer you a more remodeled look that's for sure. The Fortuna suite offers you 940sq ft of pure luxury! I was just in heaven. Although we didn't get a Strip view the Pool View wasn't half bad. With booking this type of suite you are sure to receive either a Pool View or Strip View. Honestly you can't go wrong with either.

The appearance of the Palazzo's lobby was very elegant and grand. There's a fountain at its center that stands under a large glass cupola. Old world Italian design is the main architectural theme of the hotel. The casino was sparkling clean and was not yet imbedded with the scent of cigarette smoke like some of the other long standing casinos on the strip. I later learned that the hotel is a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified property, smoking is off limits for the majority of the hotel, including 50 percent of the casino.

The hotels that have been here awhile really have nothing on the newer ones (i.e. Aria, Cosmo) and that definitely colors my view of this hotel. That and their crappy customer service.

The ONLY reason I even bothered to get a room at this hotel is because my boyfriend wanted to go to Cut (a Wolfgang Puck restaurant) in the Palazzo. In order to cut down on travel time because we'd be drinking I chose to get a room here. Next time I'll just pay the cab fare. 

Checked in and asked if there were any upgrades available. Please note that EVERY SINGLE TIME I've stayed at the Aria I've received an upgrade for NOTHING when I asked. I wanted a nice room for my boyfriend's birthday and was definitely willing to pay a little more than the $300 I'd already paid for this overpriced monstrosity. The girl at the desk tells me, as I'm rushing her along telling her I have reservations and need to get ready, that it will be an extra $100 with a GUARANTEED view. I say okay, I'll take it. She comes back and apologizes and says that it's actually $150, but she'll talk to her manager and see if she can get that reduced. I ask her what about honoring the rate she JUST gave me. She says she can't and comes back and says $125. At this point my boyfriend is on his way to meet me and we have to go so I don't argue. I get to the room I was overcharged for and find out that the 'view' is actually the back of Treasure Island a huge parking lot. I suppose that it IS a view. I should have been more inquiring about what the view consisted of. My bad. 

We go to eat at Cut (I find Strip Steak at Mandalay is much better, although the service is amazing) and then get back to the room and go to bed. The bed and linens are quite possibly the worst I've slept on in Las Vegas (I've stayed at almost every hotel on the strip). The sheets are scratchy, the pillow have zero support and the comforter feels like the one I let my dogs sleep on in the winter. Never mind the mattress (they try to sell this to you with a pamphlet on the night stand - don't fall for it!). It felt old and unturned. It was a sad stay for me. 

I love decadence and luxury. This hotel tries to make you think it offers that, but it's really a facade. It is none of that. It is a hotel that needs to catch up with its newer rivals and fast. 

On a final note: I called the front desk the next day (as we were so busy the night before with dinner and activities that I didn't have time to address the myriad of problems this hotel presented) and told my story to someone (15 minutes of it) and was then told 'oh, I'm sorry, I thought this would be something I could help with, let me transfer you to guest services.' She comes back and tells me after having me tell this ridiculous story that she can't help and also that guest services is closed, she'll have them call me back. WHAT? Could you waste any more of my time and money? I don't think so, I won't let that happen. 

I wouldn't stay at the Palazzo again if they gave me an upgraded room - I can already tell the view would suck because it sucks from where I'm standing.",3,1,1

Then was put on hold while they had to listen to the conversation they had recorded to make sure I was not lying after they made the mistake... I should of known then not to stay here...

I asked for a little bit of a early check in because it was my anniversary and I talked to to concierge about having something ready for my girl friend in the room at check in time. We got there at 1:30 PM. and the room was not ready... That was fine with me, I though we could gamble and walk around till it was ready, 3 hours went by and no call on my cell to tell me my room was ready! so i called the front desk and asked what is taking so long!? We had special dinner plans at 6:14 because we were seeing Justin Timberlake at 8 and wanted to eat before... Our room was still not ready by 4:30 so i said ill take anything so we can get ready... get to our room with nothing set up like I asked and called down for our bags so we can get ready and make it to dinner... 30 min go by and no bags... 45 min no bags.... i called 3 times and still nothing. they said they were on the way up.....ONE HOUR later still nothing.. Every person i called down to said they are on the way up and seemed to care less our bags are missing!! 2 HOURS later we get out bags and by then we did not have a chance to get ready and make our special dinner was had planned for weeks... Come to find out the put our bags in ANOTHER room and just left them!! I called to complain that we missed our very special dinner and that is there anything they can do to help make up for THEIR mistake??? they said 2 PM. check out is all they can do... and get this.... Monday when we were checking out we got a call saying we will need to be out or they will charge us...

However, recently they have put water saving devices on the showers and the sinks so the water pressure is terrible except for the bath tub. I used to really enjoy staying here but this hotel has been very disappointing lately. They do not treat their customers well here anymore. The dealers are the rudest I have ever encountered. Some will not speak to you or offer a friendly greeting. Many seem to really enjoy it when you are losing and flat out  ignore you when you ask a simple question. One time I witnessed a blackjack dealer berating a couple about their play. They complained to the pit boss who couldn't care less. During another visit I had a dealer who would not speak to me and did not give me a chance to ask for even money on a blackjack. I tried to ask her about it and she completely ignored me. I called over a pit boss to ask him to please tell her to give me chance to ask for even money. He just walked off. It was incredible. I think it is appalling to be treated this way in a casino. The employees can be very condescending and rude throughout the hotel. Some of the employees are very nice but too many of them are not. There is a general feeling of not caring the least bit about customer service. I have stayed there more times than I should have because I like the rooms.

I know.. sleep in Vegas?  Who'da thunk it, but it's true.  (not that the copious amounts of alcohol had anything to do with it but still)

We stayed in the Bella Suite which was enormous and posh but really... what's with all the dim lighting?  I mean, I know people generally look better by candelight and all that, especially if you've got a massive hangover, but I swear to god, in EVERY single hotel on the Strip there's never enough light to put on makeup to go out.   If I put on enough makeup so I can see it in the room, I end up looking like a $20 hooker when I go out in public.   NOT the goal.  

Still, down bedding and fluffy pillows galore...  loved it.   

On the other hand I do not love the spa here.  (Canyon Ranch) The services are fine, but its ridiculously large and difficult to find your way around if you don't check in at the Venetian side.   Also the product they have and all that are not my favorite.   Bellagio still has the best spa I've experienced so far.

Hats off to our check in Danellia was professional and charming.

Comparing this place to top resorts like The Cosmo, Aria, Caesars, and Wynn, I always find my experience here & at The Venetian most pleasing.

The reasons why they won me over..

ROOM: there are definitely some amazing suites at other hotels but i'm just comparing the basic rooms... besides being gigantic, the decor is very elegant and is always clean. The spacious layout with all the furniture can accommodate a good amount of friends.

HOTEL: the luxurious feel without being over-the-top classy. Beautiful decorations in both Palazzo and Venetian, with rotating themes throughout the year. One of the best hotel scents.. you can stay around the casino all day and you won't reek of cigarette smell.

CASINO: I love the small square layout of the casino area. It's very wide and easy to navigate around. The atmosphere is a bit on the calmer side but can still be loud at night.

LOCATION: it is a walk away from the wild and crazy heart of the strip. You can party hard without having to travel far.. but you can also stay in the hotel and have a classy, medium-crazy time. Sometimes you may need a break from the real Vegas and just need to relax.

This place is definitely my #1

3) Caesars Palace

When we arrived at the hotel, an employee from luggage services was quick to assist us with our bags. It was only 9 AM, so he said that they would be able to hold the bags for us until we were ready to check in. At the check in desk, we asked the employee if we could get a view of the Strip. She said that none of the rooms were available but she offered to upgrade us to a suite at no additional cost. We graciously accepted her offer.

We decided to get coffee and then spend some time on the Strip assuming that our room wouldn't be ready until around 3. However, I received a text at 9:30 that our suite was ready. They put us in one of the hospitality suites on the sixth floor. 

The room was definitely one of the best suites I've ever stayed in. It was super spacious, had a comfortable sectional couch, had three TVs (including one in the bathroom), and a large window with remote-controlled curtains. The only downside of the room was that it lacked a mini-fridge and a microwave. Given that we were staying in a suite at a resort, I don't think it is unreasonable to expect these things. I guess they just want you to buy more food and drinks in the casino. The room did have really good wifi which I used to send some work emails at the start of each morning. Overall, I'm sure you could do worse for a hotel on the Strip.

The hotel itself had some great restaurants, but they were all sit-down restaurants. It would have been nice if they had a couple of counter service places that were open late so that we could have grabbed something to eat after getting back from bars. 

In terms of location, I liked that the Palazzo was at the north end of the Strip. We were still close enough to walk to anywhere on the Strip and we could easily get to downtown Las Vegas without getting stuck in all of the Strip traffic. 

The service at the hotel was good but not great. They wouldn't let my wife borrow some scissors to cut some yarn in the blanket she was crocheting. I understand that people are super on alert given recent events in Vegas, but this is bordering on ridiculous. The only reason she didn't have her own scissors is because she couldn't bring them on the plane. I felt like the hotel should have been more accommodating of this. 

Overall, I think the Palazzo is a good place to stay but I will probably still shop around next time when choosing a hotel on the Strip.",1,0,0

I loved the decor. It was beige, brown, and black. My fiance said that he wanted to decorate our future home this way.

Very nice, sun doesn't hit until 1:00, but I read other reviews and was aware of that.  The next day we sat at the other pool which gets sunlight earlier.  Drinks were a little pricey, I switched to beer the second day.  The first cocktail waitress was dumb as a door nail, didn't remember what we ordered, who we were, the second day much better, asian gal (japanese I believe) very nice, had a refill every 1\/2 hour.  Morning coffee was a joke, coffee bean did not have any decent juice (Naked Juice or Odwalla) and there coffee was just okay.  I went to Illy the second day, much better selection of juices and pasteries and probably a little more expensive.  I guess you stop counting when you reach $15 for two coffees and a pastry.  The casino floor is tiny, worthless and was usually empty.  You don't get a very ""Vegas"" vibe, its boring.  I won a baseball bet and didn't watch in the sports room because it was also empty.  The retail shops were empty and were offering 40% those $400 shoes, no one was buying retail.  The service was good, but honestly I would have been happier at a 4star with more action.  And so every night we went elsewhere and had fun at other casinos.  To its credit Lavo had good food and the club was pretty good, but I don't think I would have paid, they included a free voucher at check-in.  The staff was good and house keeping was on it.  I read other reviews and should mention as well their shampoo, lotion etc. dried my skin, I'm a guy and thought I wouldn't need any foo-foo lotions, but by day two I was using my wife's lotion.

For me, staying at the Palazzo was overly extravagant and unnecessary.

Let me qualify, yes the hotel rooms are absolutely gorgeous and amazing. They look the same as the Venetian ones and are of the same size as well so if you're looking for just the experience and the Venetian is cheaper, I would recommend that instead. Also the Palazzo seems to have this intense perfume-y smell that I cannot get rid of and it gives me a headache downstairs especially in their lobby area. I almost feel like they need some smoke to de-intensify the perfume. I just think the rooms are too big and unnecessarily so. Most people come to Vegas and they go out, and they're out all day and all night and only in the room to sleep. So basically you're wasting all those crazy couches and all that space. I think unless you go with a large group of people and are planning to share a hotel room this place is just plain excessive.

Other than that, all the amenities are nice but I don't really like how there's nothing in the shower to put your own stuff on or no ledge at all.",6,2,5

For similar prices as other Hotels, you get double the room space!  With 2 kids, we definitely appreciate this.

I personally favor the Palazzo over Venetian because it's newer, and the Hotel Tower is in a more convenient location than the Venetian (where I always get rooms in the Venezia Tower for some reason, which can be quite a walk just to get to).

The Palazzo proved to be a stellar choice for our Girls' Weekend Getaway, and it made all the difference in the overall fun that we had. 

Our suite was as spacious as it was impressive. Decked out with a stand-up shower, huge separate tub, double sinks, our very own living room, comfy beds, a pull out sofa bed, dining table, desk area, telephone in the toilet area (also separate from the actual bathroom), two TVs (one in the bathroom, the other in the bedroom), electronic window shades, comfort and extravagance were not lacking. We were situated right on The Strip which made all the difference as we desired to be in the mix of everything and to walk, rather than cab it to our destinations.

So there you have it. The rooms are lovely. But what about the facilities and overall resort? Gaw-jus. The entrance is grand, the property is massive, and the staff is helpful and courteous. The Palazzo is an addition to The Venetian, another lovely hotel option. So lucky for us, a suite at the Palazzo granted us access to all of its 11 pools. And there really is a pool for everyone. Want to relax with the family? Want to lay out in some peace and quiet by your lonesome? Want to swim with your honey and get some jacuzzi action in? Want to people watch-- beautiful people at that? Want to strut your stuff, party or day drink? You get a pool! You get a pool! And you get a pool! Our group chose the best of both worlds and opted for both fun and relaxation. But the most memorable aspect when it came down some pool action was Tao Beach (review to follow).  Fun! Crazy crazy crazy fun! Great music, decent food, and overall everything that a Vegas pool party should be.

The restaurant options are plentiful and the shopping options are .... well... expensive. Reviews to follow on these too. The nightclub was fantastic too. Very different feel from the outdoor clubs we experienced the night before, but equally as good- if not better. We had an over-the-top great time. Best of all, it's right in the hotel so no mile walk in your high heels, ladies.

Lastly, I'm not the type of girl to gamble so the casino was my least favorite. Though large and updated, it wreaked of smoke and we didn't spend much time there. Also you have to walk through it to get around the property. Meh. I did like that they had phone chargers on some of the slot machines. Another way to keep you there longer, but very convenient.

Overall, the property was everything that we needed and more. Most rooms, like ours, offer a beautiful view if you are a few floors up. And most likely if you get in early enough and ask for one, you shall receive. Of course there are lots of places to choose from when it comes to hotels, but this is a solid choice for a weekend getaway. I'd definitely stay here again.",7,4,5

The boyfriend suggested that we stay in one of the Palazzo suites that has access to a ""private"" outdoor balcony, or so...that was the way it looked 20 floors up from our room the last time we stayed.  We called the Palazzo and asked about that room specifically.  It was a Monday night and a slow time and so the price we were quoted was amazing.  We obviously took it and were super excited to check in.  This is after we had cancelled our prearranged plans to stay a second night at the also amazing Aria hotel (whole other review).  We show up to check in to the Palazzo and the man checking us in looked surprised at his computer and quiet for a moment.  My boyfriend asked ""did we get a good price?"" he responded ""did you book this online?""  we said ""no, we spoke to a women on the phone through reservations."" He then said he'd be right back and went to see his manager.  He came back saying that they were going to need to charge us $50 more a night for the room because it was a mistake.  My boyfriend argued politely that it didn't seem right that we were told the room was one price on the phone and we haven't even seen it and they're trying to tell us its worth more just because they say?!  The guy went away again, came back again, said we were right and that they would honor the price we were quoted which was cool of them.  

We got to the room and I understand why they wanted to keep it on lockdown!  It's so amazing.  Imagine a super awesome upper westside New York apartment with a patio.  The Palazzo suites feature several ( I believe 7 or so) different floor plans.  This is the only one with outside access. The bedroom flows into living space with super comfortable ""L"" shaped couch that is so easy to just slouch into all night.  Two double frosted doors open out onto an outdoor area that includes a fireplace and some comfortable outdoor furniture.  These rooms are on the 3rd floor so the view is strange but cool all you can see are the tall towers of venetian and palazzo.  The walls on this patio that separate rooms and balconies are a little weird and a little cool.  Half of it is a 10' stucco wall but its interspersed with some iron wrought gate work that is quite pretty but not as private as you'd expect or want.  Although if you have this room in the middle of the summer in the middle of the night I can assure you you'll be the only one outside with the fireplace on.  Unless I'm there.  The other note about these balconies is I feel like they could really use an infusion of new stuff and ideas.  it seems drab and bare and a little prison like.  At night the lighting of the outdoor topiary is nice but they could go further to make it a little more luxurious outside.  Maybe I'm the only one who's outside in summer in Las Vegas? 

Needless to Say, despite the initial troubles checking in this place is amazing.  Lovely room and, lovely hotel.  We didn't get to try the pool I'm sad to say but we will be returning shortly I'm certain.",1,0,0

The layout of the Palazzo is relatively simple and  straightforward to get into the hotel room. Our taxi dropped us off at the front of hotel where we walked straight to the registration desk. Checking into the hotel was relatively simple and expedient. We then walked through the casino to the elevator doors. Be careful about which elevator you are taking as each one goes to a different section of the tower.

We had a corner room overlooking Wynn which was really nice. The electronic shades added a sophistication to the room. The only gripe about the room was the pull out sofa bed. They don't provide a comforter for that particular bed so you have to request it. I had to ask multiple times and they still didn't bring me an adequate comforter which was so disappointing. 

We also used the pool amenities as well. However, when we got to the towel dispensary, they ran out of towels. We were annoyed by this but luckily, we just asked out friend who happened to be in the room to bring some of the room towels until they restocked. There were two different pools, both of them quite shallow. The pool was decent, but felt they cold have made the pool area better. Also, we ventured to Azure which is Palazzo's ""equivalent"" to a day club. However, I would recommend not going there as we witnessed a verbal altercation between some of the guests and employees which would have made for a good reality show.

In all, Palazzo was very comfortable. I just wish Palazzo was more centrally located as we ended up taking so many taxi's to get to the south part of the strip.",3,0,0

We tried to check in 4pm, an hour after check-in time and were turned away because our room wasn't ready yet. We came back at 5pm and were told the maid had JUST gone to our room to clean it. We came back at 6 and were told that the room still wasn't ready yet. I was frustrated and asked what time the room would be ready so we could plan the next few hours accordingly...do we have enough time for a sit down dinner? Should we get fast food? Do we have enough time to walk to Caesars and get a Fat Tuesday? Tell me?! Well, unfortunately the jerk behind the counter told me they weren't ALLOWED to give me an estimated time. I told him to take my number down and call me when the room was ready....

Care to guess what time we checked into our room? Not 7. Not 8. But NINE O'CLOCK!. They, for lack of a Yelp appropriate word, screwed with us for 4.5 hours....

I first tried to calmly explain to the guy that this 4.5 hour wait was completely inexcusable. We paid a premium to stay at the Palazzo and should NOT have to suffer the consequences of overbooking and understaffing at the hotel. After getting BS excuses about it being March Madness weekend and to please take it into consideration, I was offered a $50 voucher at the hotel. This just made me even MORE upset! I said....""REALLY?! I'm spending close to a thousand dollars for two nights and have just been DI@#CKED around for almost 5 hours!!! $50!?! He then raised it to $100. I was so annoyed and frankly didn't want to waste anymore precious time, I took the $100 and swore to never return to Palazzo again.....

The only difference I would say is Palazzo is even nicer than Venetian, but only because it is a newer hotel\/casino. Other than that, it has the same pros as Venetian, but I will say the casino, while nicer in terms of design, doesn't suit real players as well as Venetian (IMO).

I could go on and on about this place, but all I need to say is this is the kind of experience you want when you come to Vegas. 5 star rooms, friendly staff, amazing amenities, great restaurants, and experienced\/friendly dealers (if you gamble). They have always taken care of me for the past few years and have made me a loyal patron after bouncing around other properties on the strip for prior stays. They also take care of their rated players (speaking from experience).

I guess you could call it a more sofisticated experience. There is no buffet (thank God), and the property seems to not appeal that much to the short-wearing, beer-gutted slobs that you see all to often elsewhere on the strip. I'm not saying you won't see them here, but there is definitely an air of relative class at Palazzo that is lacking in most other proprties on the strip.

And for those new to the strip, the Palazzo is located on the end of the strip that you want to be on. Close to all of the shops, restaurants, and casinos worth going to. All within walking distance. You won't need luck in having a great vacationing experience when you go here. A sure bet.",0,0,0

It was really pretty and comfortable! I loved it.

The room was HUGE, you can have a good 10+ people in there if you wanted.  The only thing that bothered me was that none of the doors had locks on them.  I mean like the bathroom door, the door to the shower.  But that wasn't a huge problem, it was just odd.

I liked the set up of the room too.  You walk in and there's the bathroom, which has huge bathtub, and a separate shower with glass doors, with a flat screen in there, and the restroom has a separate door. Then there are two beds with a plasma in front of  them.  Then you can go downstairs (like 5 steps) and there's an L-couch, and doubles as a couch bed.  And a little round table, and an office desk.

You also get free wifi here if ever you needed to surf the net and had a laptop around.  You'll have to login first and they'll ask for how you're going to pay and stuff, but when you get to the end of it it says $0.00, so don't worry about that.

I was here for a board meeting and charmingly asked for a room upgrade & got it!** 
I had been booked into a luxury king sweet but ended up with the 1,280-square-foot  SIENA SUITE! 

The Suite Life
The 2 room suite featured double doors opening to a long marble hallway which led to an expansive living room with a granite wet bar and a big flat screen TV. 

The adjoining bedroom was HUGE with a lovely king size bed,  the dressing alcove had a granite vanity leading into a gorgeous marble bath with a jetted tub and a stand up shower with multiple shower jets! Whew!  This suite is so big that If someone rings your doorbell (Yes, a doorbell for a hotel room!) while you're in the  dressing room, it takes a while to get that door! 

The SPA
The hotel offers great SPA which I enjoyed before our meeting started and it was the BOMB! The salt room is a must visit and there's also this trippy room where there's an ocean on the ceiling!  

Room Service
Because I was here for a board meeting I didn't get out to the restaurants - but I did try the room service - and let me tell you, WOW! I ordered a cobb salad & french onion soup and my goodness - it was delish and the white glove service was amazing!

I would definitely come back here! 

**(When checking into any hotel, it never hurts to ask for an upgrade!  How do I do it? I smile a genuine smile, look around the lobby & compliment something about the property, I say how happy I am to to be there & then I ask ""Do you have any complimentary upgrades available?""  Or balcony room? 

If they don't have the avail rooms, then maybe ask for access to the club level where there's usually free nightly hors d'oeuvres, drinks, and a complimentary breakfast (bottles of free water are my fav perk!)

If they say no, just smile and shrug & say ""Thanks for checking it never hurts to ask!""  They also may come back with an upgrade offer - say for $30  extra a night they can upgrade you to a better room - then you can decide...it's usually a bargain! A $159 a night room can be transformed to a $459 a night room for only $30 bucks? Yes please!",5,1,2

{ WHY STAY HERE }

1) (Semi) Centrally located on the strip
2) The rooms are SPACIOUS and has its own livingroom with very 
comfortable, cushy couches
3) The bathrooms are luxurious
4) There's always good deals on this hotel
5) Just like the Venetian, but better rates
6) Connected to the Venetian where all the restaurants and shops are
7) Right next to Encore, where the hottest night club is...XS.  So you can walk home after a night's of partying!
8) If you have a large party, I suggest getting the 2-bedroom suite...it's P-I-M-P.

{ TIPS }

* If your friends have already checked in and you're having the bellman take up your luggage, call your friends if they're still in the room. Have them call for your luggage. Give them the claim\/ticket #, the # of bags, and the name your bags are under. So by the time you get to your room, your bags will arrive @ the same time.

* When you check out on Sundays, don't even try to call the bellman to help you take down your luggage.  It'll take you 2 hours for them to arrive to your room to get your bags!",2,0,0

It's on the strip, but because it's not RIGHT in the middle, it has a nice elevated ambiance to it (i.e. not full of drunk 22 year olds). The pool deck is gorgeous, peaceful and quiet for the most part (although some of the pools have a bit more action). It is shared with the Venetian and there are over 1\/2 dozen pools to choose from. 

The rooms are some of the nicest (if not THE nicest) on the strip. Every room is a suite with a sunken living room, HUGE bathroom, and very nicely appointed. I am typically hard to impress in this area, but they really did not skimp on the accommodations. There are more shops and restaurants than you could imagine or see in a week. They have an entire mall on the second level.

The casino is relatively small by comparison to some of the other hotels I visited, but it has a nice ambiance. You can also walk down the hall to the Venetian casino which is bigger and has a more busy vibe. I was disappointed with the video poker. There is not a single JoB machine with a 9\/6 payout scheme. In fact, I came across several with 6\/5. Come on Palazzo, you can do better than that. People that know what they are doing are not going to play with 6\/5 payouts. You are alienating people who know what they are doing by not having a single machine with decent odds among the mix of money suckers for suckers ;) Consequently, I had to spend all of my money across the street at TI where they have 9\/6 machines. Would love to be able to just go downstairs to gamble though.

We booked the Sienna and Bella suite connected together.  It wasn't cheap but there was a lot of room.  I took advantage of all the space by putting my belongings in the dresser and bathroom vanity drawer.  Having stubbed my toe on the clear weight scale when leaving the restroom to go into the shower (beware of this placement), I needed assistance to walk around during the last hour of our stay.  EMT checked out my foot and advised me to get it checked by a doctor.  I got it checked and I have a broken bone.  Additionally, the items I left in the drawers were not packed.  I called the hotel the night I left to see if my friend who is still staying there could retrieve them.  They said they could not allow that.  I was being understanding so I requested the room to be checked asap since housekeeping failed to turn in the items.  They said they would look into it but I did not realize it would take four days!  I finally got an email letting me know they did not find my items which only means housekeeping either kept my belonging or threw them away.  I know for a fact I left my items and they were not misplaced.  But I guess it should be expected that my items are gone since it took several days for this to be looked into.  What's unfortunate is the hotel establishment did not call me to investigate my injury.  They brushed it off by writing in an email, ""There were not any hazards, construction or defects in the event area.""  How would they know if there was any hazards or obstruction if they didn't call me to find out details?  The absurd comment in the email stated, "" Should you honor us with the opportunity to host you again, please contact my office directly once your reservation has been secured, so we may assist with preparations for arrival and ensure a perfect start to your return.""  Why on earth would I make another reservation and pay the deposit after the lack of service I just received?  There are so many great resorts to stay at in Las Vegas, my friends, family, and I would not invest another penny at The Palazzo, nonetheless a Sands Resort ever again.  And fortunately, I am able to share my experience via social media.

My husband and I have stayed at various hotels throughout the strip and this one was by far the worst. First off, their parking structure has to be the oddest and most confusing parking structure I've ever seen. Upon check-in, the receptionist was rude and condescending, mind you, check in was not busy so I didn't see any reason for attitude so early on in the day. We arrived to our room and the first thing we found were hairs on the bathroom floor (gross)! We then noticed dirty water ringlets on the exterior office desk and section by the curtains. To top things off the couch had sand (or what we assume to be sand) beneath the cushions! Needless to say we were quite turned off by the cleanliness of the room.

Lastly, the canal shops were a maze! We had friends staying at the Venetian and finding our way through all the shops was absolutely ridiculous!!! I recognize many hotels and shops are designed to maximize spending potential but after our experience with parking, the front desk and a dirty room, walking through a maze was the last thing we wanted to do.

I've stayed with a friend at the Venetian before and had high hopes from the Palazzo. Mind you, my husband does not complain about much and is always very considerate, however, he was very disappointed with this place.

2) Amazing shops - Barney's New York (bigger and better than the one in SF) is attached to the hotel, along w\/ Christian Louboutin, Canali and DVF just to name a few that we don't have in SF
3) Great selection of restaurants - CUT, Valentino, Restaurant Charlie

You could easily and comfortably fit 6 people in here but if you really want to push it, you can probably fit 8 people here...with beds of course.  Go nuts and have people sleep on the floor if you must because it is very spacious!  The beds and comforters were super duper comfortable and the automatic curtains was totally amazing!  Looks can look so deceiving!  Sleeping throughout the night and into the morning, the room was still pitched black thinking that it was still night time!  I LOVED that feeling of it still being dark outside.  The bathroom was spacious as well. Wish that the shower was sort of private and secluded so that way, people can shower, as well as others can get ready as well.  The bathroom was secluded so that was a problem with no ventilation and if someone did their ""business"" it was not good ;)  With a nice mini suite like this, i would expect to have a fridge but sadly there was none because that definitely would have been useful to store our food so when we get our drunk ass back to the hotel, we would have food to eat!  Also with a nice place like this, no hair dryer?? What is up with that?!  Overall, pretty nice place to stay and it was great that they accommodated adjoining rooms for us!

-housekeeping is a bit slow
-lots of elevators to get to different floors",3,3,4

We're no strangers to nice hotels in Vegas but Palazzo room designers really out-did themselves on this one!

Right when checking in they gave us a free upgrade to a strip view suite. Palazzo is centrally located so we could easily walk to the mall, Wynn, Venetian, Mirage, Caesars, & Bellagio. We usually stay on this side of the strip for colder months anyways.

The Venetian\/Palazzo complex is very nice, with lots of great dinning options, from casual restaurants to high-end establishments. We received good service from almost all of the employees and check-in was quick and easy. The pools were quite nice, very relaxing with plenty of seating available on a busy holiday weekend.

There was only one downside to our first stay at the Palazzo and that was our room, a standard King Suite. The room itself was very nice and quite large, with a separate living area and very large bathroom. However, our room experience at Palazzo was greatly marred because of an overpowering and pervasive fried food odor that we smelled right off the bat the moment we entered the room. 

I immediately called the front desk and asked for a different room. The girl first blamed it on Harrahs (which was odd since we were on the side of the tower that faces the Wynn) and said something to the effect of ""Harrahs cleaning their vents and this happens every once in a while."" She said that the only other room she could move us was in the same location (one floor above us) and basically that we would have the same issue. I was really shocked honestly. The Palazzo is not an inexpensive hotel. I think it's safe to expect that your room will not have the overwhelming odor of fried food. I was not pleased, and I asked again what could be done because the smell in the room was not acceptable. She sent up an air purifier, which we ran all weekend but it honestly did not help. And it was extremely loud. In hindsight, I wish I would have been more forceful and had the issue resolved one way or another, even if that meant moving to the Venetian side of the complex, or even getting a refund and moving to a different hotel entirely. 

Based on my conversation with the girl at the front desk, it seems to me that this is an ongoing issue, and I am quite perplexed that they have not resolved it one way or another. The woman at the front desk was very resistant to moving my room and asked that I give the air purifier a try and then we could discuss further action. Of course, by the time the air purifier arrived and we gave it time to see if it would work, we had already unpacked and showered, we had a dinner reservation to get to and we just didn't have the energy to fight it any more. I am certain that this is the procedure they have in place for dealing with room complaints due to this food odor. They hope that you will simply decide not to move, which is exactly what we did. If I had to do it over again I would've insisted from moment one that they move us and not accepted an air purifier as an option.",0,0,0

I married my honey on March 1 and although we plan to go to Italy next year we were pressed with time so we decided to go to Vegas with a couple of friends and stay at the Palazzo Resort. WOW - We knew it would be great because we had been to the Venetian in January and all I can say is that it did not disappoint.

The place is still fresh and the rooms feel like new - not sure if they have been redone but unlike some Vegas Star hotels who tend to get shabby, the Palazzo has kept up with their decor and room amenities. 

The sunken living room makes the stay seem like you have booked an apartment rather than just a room. The Internet works well. unlike the connections we have experienced in other places. 

Although you can walk to a few other casinos in the area, we were content to move between the Palazzo and the Venetian except for the early mornings where we went down to Fremont so my husband could play craps on the cheaper tables, $5 as opposed to the minimum $10 and up on weekends. As a slot player, the Venetian and Palazzo had plenty of machines that perked my interest and took my money but hey - I really don't go to win. LOL It is a rare occasion when that happens at all. I go for the fun.

Many great places to eat - Noodle Asia comes to mind - a new one we tried this trip. 

As we exited the Palazzo to pick up our car I noticed a sign that said $9.99 breakfast so the 4 of us opted to go into Dal Toro Ristorante and were quite impressed by the delicious breakfast with eggs, potatoes, bacon, toast, pancakes - yummy. Put that in my data bank for future stops!

All in all another great trip and we are looking forward to returning next month! Yeah!",1,0,0

There was construction going on right above us and all we heard was a hammering pounding non stop from the early morning hours thru later afternoon. Along with the fact our TV was not working to drown out the noise. I went down stairs after 2 and a half days of hardly no sleep and was greeted with a Bit of attitude when I wanted to switch rooms. Long story short we finally got to switch rooms and packed up all of our things and moved to a different floor. When we got to our new room the shower was broke and water poured out of the shower onto the floor. We were done with switching rooms and dealing with the front desk we cleaned it up ourselves and dealt with it.

After my fourth trip to either the Palazzo or the Venetian (their rooms are exactly the same, but the Palazzo is a few years newer) I just had to sit down and share my consistently outstanding experiences here.

There are often long lines to check in (when you have 7100 rooms, there are a lot of people in and out) but, they move quickly and the front desk staff is friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. They give good directions to the guest elevators (in such a HUGE complex, it is very easy to get lost) so you can find your room. Keep your key envelope with you so you can remember your room numbers ... you might end up with something like 41-836! No ""room 103"" at this hotel!

The suites are gorgeous, a large bedroom area and a sunken living room with (hopefully for you) a great view of the Wynn golf course, or the extensive pool areas, or if you're really lucky -- overlooking Las Vegas Blvd and a view of the Treasure Island pirate show and the Mirage Volcano show across the street. The bathrooms are HUUUUGE with a separate shower, bathtub, two sinks and a separate\/private room for the toilet. I love the makeup stand with mirrors so you can sit and put on your makeup for the day.

I've been very impressed every time I see housekeeping staff on the floor, they always inquire about my suite and if I'm having a good stay. The elevators are typically quick, and they do have express elevator banks for low, mid-tower and high floors so you're not stopping on every floor along the way.

Be careful of the mini-bar, it's pressure sensitive and if you take out a snack, it will be put on your bill immediately. The only down side is that they allow smoking in the casino. Maybe some day there will be non-smoking casinos ... one can only hope.

I've been to the Venetian and Palazzo for several different reasons: two conventions, one business trip and one personal trip. Every experience was outstanding. I could not have asked for anything more. Our conventions (with 7000+ attendees) were executed flawlessly. The banquet staffs greeted us by name as we were going through buffet lines (yes, we were wearing conference badges ... but they NOTICED and USED our names!)

They do have an extensive pool area, the Canyon Ranch Spa and a huge fitness center, none of which I have had time to use while I've been there. I usually go for a run out on Las Vegas Blvd. in the mornings before it gets busy instead of paying the $17+ ""resort fee"" which includes access to the fitness center and wi-fi in the room. If you're going to use the gym or the wi-fi, it's worth signing up for the resort fee. Access to the gym is $40\/day a la carte and wi-fi is $12.95\/day.

They have some INCREDIBLE restaurants in the hotel complex, many with celebrity chefs such as Emeril Lagasse (Delmonico's steaks, Table 10 or Lagasse Sports Book), Mario Batali, Thomas Keller, Wolfgang Puck. Or more casual fare. The Canal Shoppes offer some high end shopping ... you can easily spend your winnings right there!

I wish there was a Starbucks in the complex, but there are only Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf cafe's instead. But, walk across the street, there is a Starbucks right on the corner across from the Palazzo entrance. I love the change of the seasons in their decor near the fountain and the staff is always warm and welcoming.

The hotel is a great choice for anyone wanting to be the Center of attention-- or where all the fun attractions are on the Strip.

Connected w the Venetian, Palazzo offers newer suites with better upgrades -- such as the 3 TVs (Plasma HD in the living room, an even bigger screen in front of the bed(s), and also a small LCD in the corner of the bathroom on the ceiling for those serious shower\/tub potato watchers!)  Digital scale =maybe not a good idea for those weight watchers coming back from a buffet...hmm
The beds are comfortable, cushy with 4 pillows, and the sofa in the living room turns into a sleeper if you have extra guests.  There is a safe, and printer\/scanner\/copier & WiFi for a charge, but beware of the mini-fridge!  Loaded with unnoticeable sensors, items that are moved or taken out may cause the automatic computer system to go trigger happy on your suite and charge up a hefty room tab for uneaten snacks\/unopened beverages.  Front desk can take care of that for you if you decide to keep your own drinks cool in there.

We arrived around 4:30pm on Thursday and waited in the VIP lounge which had a separate check in which is so nice and convenient! I always see long lines for check in. The VIP Lounge deserves an honorable mention as well, there's always fresh fruit, cheeses, pastries, desserts, coffee, tea, juices and water for your convenience. The next morning I got a chocolate croissant and grapefruit juice, and the chocolate croissant was sooo good! There is also a concierge person waiting inside a secret door so when you come when it's empty and need something they'll magically appear like an oompa loompa and help you. It does close though fairly early (in vegas time) around 11pm. 

We were only in the casino ever to get across to a place but it was still relatively classy and I think they had a better ventilation system than most. (I'm very sensitive to cigarette smoke) They were also a little stringent about hotel security though, every time we got on the elevators to go to our room we had to show the man at front our room keys. 

We had the Fortuna Suite which was humongous! I just looked it up and 940 sq ft! A little excessive for 3 girls but hey we're in vegas!!!! We had a large king bed, and a sofa pullout bed as well. There was also a business area complete with a printer\/scanner\/copier\/faxer and a working station. A HUGE walk in closet, two TVs in front of the bed and the sofa, as well as in the bathroom. The only issue with the bathroom was that the shower was completely clear see through, so the person taking a shower just had to deal with others getting ready. There was a sunken level where the sofa was, and also a little dining area that seated 3. We were up on the 32nd floor and the views were pretty amazing especially at night! Also during the daytime it was fun to watch the shadows cast on their many pools. 

We were also by the pools on Friday morning around 10:45 so we were able to get chaises. They have excellent towel service and good food too! There is also a guy to help you out to get the chaises so you can tell him how much sun you'd like to get. He told us of a spot where the sun wouldn't hit us until about 1pm so that was perfect for us deathly pale girls. 

The place was overall amazing, opulent, clean, and everything that a hotel should be but the service was extra amazing. We forgot toothbrushes and razors so when we called up room service they brought up everything in little cute red bags and brought mouthwash, toothpaste, and shaving cream too.

There were only 10 other people there so the bartenders were very attentive and such nice service. They have 2 televisions at the bar. I enjoyed my whiskey and ginger ale while the bartender recommended some great wines for my husband. At the end of the night, they were cleaning up the bar and gave us free cupcakes. Always a bonus. =) GREAT SERVICE!",0,0,0

But it was my stay at The Palazzo that made Las Vegas a pleasant experience.  This is a beautiful hotel with amazing rooms and an attentive staff.  My suite was elegantly furnished, perfectly chilly, and I would have gladly taken that massive bathroom as a permanent residence.

This hotel is massive - bigger than anything I have ever seen, in fact. But that seems to be the case with the entirety of Vegas.  So if you're looking for a classy hotel amidst all the chaos, walk through the casino and up to your suite at The Palazzo.  You won't be disappointed!",1,1,1

We self parked, which was very conveniently located to the casino and lobby. We checked in, the man gave us a room, and as we walked away, he yelled at us, because that room was occupied. We then had to wait for him to get us another room.

Made our way up to the room. It was nice, identical to the Venetian, just different decor. We had a strip view, overlooking Treasure Island. The beds in the room were not very comfy. I have a hard enough time staying in beds that aren't my own...but this one was kind of hard and made it difficult to get to sleep.

The casino? I was disappointed. I thought it was small, compared to other casinos (smaller than Venetian for sure) and I swear in the hours I spent over the past 3 days in their casino, I didn't have one cocktail waitress offer me a drink, until we were leaving yesterday morning...well, no, I don't want alcohol NOW, I wanted it last night when I was gambling!

The biggest let down to me was the $$$ I was comped. Last time I stayed at Venetian I gambled less than I did this trip, and they comped all my meals. This time? Not only was I gambling, but I had BF and my friend using my player's card, so we were racking up way more points, and they only comped me $60 off the 3 meals we charged to the room. I was really put off by that. 

My mom, who is a big gambler, also is no longer getting freebies from Venetian\/Palazzo - she has switched to the Harrah's casinos, and I think I am going to be doing that as well.

It is a nice place, but for the money we paid for the room and the money we spent at the casino, I think I should have been comped way more than I was, and I think they need to have a more attentive staff bringing drinks around - that is what makes Vegas fun - free drinks!",0,1,0

The casino: nice and spacious. Decent amount of table games with decent limits ($10 minimum). High ceilings make you feel not so enclosed and confined. Venetian's casino is easily accessible, too. Waitresses came around frequently!
Hotel: Spacious rooms- all come with a seating area so they are considered ""suites"". Nice big couch, coffee table, desk\/chair, and table\/chair set up. HUGE floor to ceiling windows with amazing views (floor 46's view was pretty spectacular.. watching the planes fly in and out was fun) Beds were huge and comfy. Bathroom is nice a spacious. Private toilet (no fan), vanity with light up mirror. Jacuzzi and separate glass shower. No fridge.
Food\/ Shopping: just like all hotels in Vegas.. lots of shopping options and food. Food was good but will cost you! But, you get what you pay for!
Location: This property is at the north end near Encore and Treasure Island. Not in the middle of the excitement, but within walking distance of everything. If you don't want to walk, the tram drops you off near the Linq i believe- or taxies are everywhere! 
Pool: They have a few different pools to offer. Plenty of chairs! There is a ""party"" pool and some more family \/ low key ones, too. Bartenders walking around. No glass allowed at pool, but i was able to bring plastic tumblers with my own alcohol out there. (aka stock up at a liquor store and bring your own!

The pool area is also lovely but was crowded when we were there.  However it is still nice to look at.  I saw Mandalay Bay's pool though and it looked a lot nicer but I'm sure their rooms aren't like the Palazzo's.

This hotel is basically an extension of the Venetian.  It's honestly a lovely hotel.  It's HUGE though, I dunno if this is what it's like at other hotels but I always felt like I was walking for forever to get anywhere.  There are shops and casinos and they're all nice.  It's also a great location right in the middle of the strip, close to all the happenings.  I could also see Treasure Island's show from our window.

My family and I were here for a Grand Reunion for my parents hometown.  The ballroom was ginorous and beautiful.  I really had a great time at the event.

The ONLY reason I'm giving this hotel 4 stars instead of the 5 it should have is that our check in was a NIGHTMARE.  They totally screwed up our reservation and from the looks of it, they screwed up a ton of other people's reservations as well since there seemed to be a whole mass of unhappy people waiting in the beautiful lobby.  I have never ever yelled at a staff member before.  Maybe it was my lack of practice but the manager just basically laughed at me and didn't even try to comp us at all for all the inconvenience we were caused.  TERRIBLE!

I'm the type of Asian guest that the Palazzo doesn't want, and they do cater to Asians since over 80% of the whales and hi-rollers are Asian. That's why you'll be properly accommodated if you want to watch Korean, Chinese, and Japanese TV shows (I hope they have Viet channels cuz Viets sure do throw down big money in Vegas).

I only have some small issues with the Palazzo because after all, it's supposed to be a 5-star hotel?

PROS:
- Overall big spacious rooms (everybody's reviews below spells out the specifics).

CONS:
- The design of the Palazzo is very middle-of-the road, and it doesn't take the themed gimmick route like the Venetian, New York New York, Paris, Excalibur, etc. Instead, they've designed a fairly lackluster interior that's very forgettable. Even the lobby seems indistinctly tucked away into one side of the main rotunda which can be overlooked if you're not paying attention.
- The management was gracious enough to let us check-in early since we got in prior to 3pm, but I don't know if room service would have put the finishing touch on everything, but I noticed a bunch of annoying details:
  1. the lamp fixture in the bathroom was tilted, and it needed to be straightened out.
  2. Small gripe, but when someobody's in the bathroom frantically spinning the toilet paper roll, you can hear it while your laying in the bed. This could take a toll on having ""sweet dreams"".... I imagine dreams of trying to balance yourself atop a log while cruising down a river of chocolate... yea chocolate.
  3. Design wise, the door knob they decided to use on the doors is deceiving because I had a friend say ""there's somebody in the bathroom"" because they couldn't turn the handle thinking it was locked. Instead, you just have to pull on the door - either you're a moron, or it's intuitively ingrained in us to turn a handle. 
  4. Like the Se Hotel in San Diego, there's a gap in the bathroom door which is a huge perverted plus because they also don't have a lock on the doors. So if you have female guests, they'll have to barricade the doors if they can't trust you. My friend didn't shower.
  5. It would have been nice to use the refrigerator in the room, but any sort of movement in the mini-bar would have resulted in additional room charges. Not to mention, the ice bucket they provide you is extremely tiny. 
  6. The bell check didn't bother helping us with any of our luggage when we drove up!?! They only assisted the people getting out of the taxi cabs. What's up with that? I know they don't offer valet, but isn't this the simplest thing they could do because it set the tone for the remainder of our stay.
  7. Out of the 3 bathrooms, the bathroom TV wouldn't turn off, and it also didn't have the same channels as the other two?! So we couldn't find the shows we were watching on the other two.

Overall it was a decent stay on NYE at the Palazzo because the rooms are so spacious which is great for hosting a bunch of your friends prior to going out. I bet Chinese New Year would be even better in Vegas. Maybe, I'll have to get a room number with 8's in it and take up gambling.... well Happy New Year!",7,7,6

They have a baggage hold and we left our baggage on check out day with no problems.

The casino is small but I thought it was the nicest of those we visited on the strip, plus it connects directly to the Venetian if you want something bigger.

There is a Walgreens next door (though you can't keep anything in the mini bar so don't buy any cold snacks that will need to be stored) and Fashion Show Mall is just across the road. It's not a far walk to major casinos such as Bellagio and Ceasars.

Connected to the Venetian, you get the benefit of two casino resorts without having to spend money on cab fare!  The rooms were so nice that my friends and I commented that we probably lived in apartments smaller than the suites.

It is one of the nicer hotels on the strip, at least in my opinion.  It is so convenient and the pools are so much fun not to mention the fact that it is also connected to the Venetian.  So it is like you are getting two hotels in one.  

They have several pools on site and also Tao day club, which is not all that great, way too crowded.  Like I mentioned before the Palazzo and Venetian are connected so if the Palazzo pool is too crowded you can always just walk over to Venetians pool or vice versa.  

My group and I stayed at the Bella Queen suite, check in was a breeze.  It was fairly quick and we were given a coupon booklet and some offers for the day club that they have there.  

I love the rooms there.  They are incredibly spacious and the beds are very comfortable.  The room is split up into three parts.  There is the bathroom which is accessible through double doors on your left when you first walk into the room.  Then you have the beds area, which has two queen beds a little mini fridge in front if the beds.  Fair warning, they do not allow you to put your own things in the fridge and charge you if you remove what they have inside.  There is a sensor that notifies them if you remove the products inside the fridge.  There is a flat screen tv above the mini fridge area in front of the beds.  

The last part is the sunken living room which is a few steps down from the beds area.  There is another tv there along with a L-shaped couch that folds out into a pull out bed and also a business area with a phone and a printer.  

My favorite aspect of the room though is the bathroom.  Ladies, the Palazzo Bella suite bathrooms are the best bathrooms to get ready in.  They are huge, we managed to fit 5 girls getting ready, pretty comfortably in the bathroom and the best part is there are mirrors everywhere in the bathroom.  They have a mirror above the bathtub.  A full mirror that runs the length of the bathroom where the sinks are and also a nice little vanity with a chair by the doors to the bathroom.  The best bathroom ever to get ready in, mirrors everywhere, awesome lighting and so much room to unload all the makeup, fake lashes, hair extensions, curling irons, hair spray and all that good stuff.

Check in was awesome\/pleasant and the valet was super nice. I have to give props to this casino's architect for finally building the parking lot underneath so that the walk from the car to room elevators are easy and quick; no need to do the long walk like other casinos!

I think they are a little lacking in machines\/tables\/gambling since they are connected directly to the Venetian.

I called the front desk and I spoke to a gentleman named Spencer. He was kind enough to understand my concerns and offered me a different room in the same hotel. Once again, I was incredibly disappointed with that room as well. Going above and beyond, he offered to move us next-door to the Venetian at no extra charge.  Everything from the hotel lighting to the room decor was so much better than the Palazzo.

Check in was a breeze. You have to walk through the casino to get to the elevators so you can check out the action. 

The room has great WiFi. Stayed on Floor 27 room 909. Had a pretty good view of the Wynn and encore and part of the strip. 

The bathroom is fabulous. Two sinks to get ready, the shower has fantastic water pressure. The toilet has it's own room and there is a soaking tub. The staff needs to do a better job cleaning the counter tops and they need to add more towels, but otherwise the bathroom was great. 

The bed was comfortable, but the pillows left a lot to be desired, they were as flat as could be and offered no support. 

The air conditioner kept the room cool, however everyday the housekeeping turned it off so when you got back it was as hot as a oven. 

The room has a lower section with a couch and table. The table is great for room service and looking outside. 

Had room service 3 times for Breakfast and each time was different on how they set it up. My only complaint was the fact that when you order and pay for the food they charge 18 % tip, then when the guy brings the food he wants twenty percent on top of that?!? Well who is getting the eighteen percent then. The room service breakfast is pricy for what you can get, but I thought it was pretty good, everything was prepared well, hot, and fresh.

The room is exactly like the Venetian rooms except for the decor. Out of the two, I preferred the Venetian's decor a bit more but this one was still nice. One of the reasons I stayed here again is because of their mini ""office"" area. I actually needed a printer and my room was perfectly equipped with one. I  didn't even realize it until I walked over to my phone to call the concierge about finding a nearby kinkos and lo and behold, there it was! 

I checked out the pool area the last day of my conference and ate at the restaurant there while I did some work. It was nice!

Once again, the Palazzo also had great dining options. My first night there, I went to Sushi Samba (which I recommend), and then walked over to the Palazzo shops where they had a cool show called Carnevale. I almost went back to my room before seeing this, but their Independence Day display was too pretty not to check out.

Choosing a hotel in Las Vegas was turning into one of those decisions, so I decided to let Priceline's name your own price feature do the deciding for me. Luckily, I ended up at The Palazzo, which turned out to be probably the nicest hotel room I've ever stayed in.

Seriously luxe, I felt spoiled rotten staying there by myself. Huge, huge room with two levels, a gigantic couch, an in-room office with a working printer (that saved my life), an insanely large bathroom with a separate bath tub and shower, and a totally unnecessary three TVs. There was a remote control for the window shades, y'all.

I didn't really feel inclined to sit on the gigantic couch, as it was made of velvet and seemed pretty porny to me. But know that you could accommodate a fuck ton of people in even the lowest level room they offer. My room could have easily, comfortably held four people.

Even better is the fact that The Palazzo, being connected to The Venetian, has about 15 thousand million options for food, drink, and other distractions. I rarely left the hotel to dine and managed to have totally unique experiences at each place I went.

The major drawback is the smoky casino noise you will have to trek through to get anywhere. The claim a smoke free main passageway, but my clothes, hair, and throat beg to differ. A smaller, more specific drawback for me was the lack of HGTV on their cable options. Waaah!

Oh, and they charge a $28 daily resort fee separate from the Priceline fee that was probably explained somewhere, but I missed it and didn't realize it until I got home to an email explaining the charges and money missing from my account. So buyer beware.

Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high, however when you're paying these types of rates for accommodations I think the Palazzo could do a better job. We checked in on Friday and the check in was flawless by Minh. From there however it all went downhill. Upon entering our room we called down and asked for four wineglasses. It's almost midnight on Saturday and they've never been delivered. We left our room by 10 o'clock this morning assuming by the time we came back to the room, it would be cleaned. Fail. No such luck. I called down at 4 PM and asked them to come clean the room after 5 PM as we were going to dinner at Giada's and would be gone for a few hours. Again, it's almost midnight, I enter my room and it's still the same way I left it early this morning. I expect better from the Palazzo. I hope others had a better experience.

I will admit the Palazzo pools are not as great as the Venetian (although they are more secluded and have more shade, if you like that), BUT you have full access to all the Venetian amenities anyway, so you're set!

I didn't handle the check-in other than to sign that allowed me to charge stuff to the room, but from what I've seen, the whole thing went smoothly for my parents who were doing  the checking-in stuff. 

The room: HUGE! Sure it was just the regular standard suite, but you can easily have 6 people sleep in here and still have enough space unlike the Aria. The room has 3 TVs, one in the 'bedroom', one in the living room, and one in the bathroom. This is pretty good if you have a lot of people in your group or if you have kids. No worries about fighting over the remote. The room has a remote for the curtains which is pretty convenient. No more having to close the curtains yourself.
The bathroom has two sinks, separate shower and tub, and a room for the toilet. They renovated the shower from the last time I was there. Instead of just a shower head now, they also have those fancy shower spray things that you would find in a spa. Really great! The issue I had with the bathroom though was the placement of the tub and TV. It's kinda hard to watch the TV while taking a bath because you sorta have to sit sideways in order to watch TV, which is kinda annoying because I want to relax, rather than sit crosslegged trying to watch TV. 
If you're someone who needs a lot of space in the room, Palazzo is a great place. Unlike Aria, you've got a ton of room for putting things. The bathroom at Palazzo had a vanity table where you could put your makeup stuff there whereas at Aria, I had to put them in the main room since there wasn't a table at all. Overall, the room or suite at the Palazzo is pretty damn good.

The casino: Basically they have your standard stuff. Slot machines ranging from 1 cent to $500 (or was it $1000?), tables with plenty of different games, and such. One thing I do like about this casino is that it's very easy to navigate in comparison to other casinos and you're able to find things pretty easily. As well, it's connected to Venetian.

Location: It's in the heart of the strip with Treasure Island, Wynn, Fashion Show Mall, and Harrah's all being within walking distance. As well, it's connected to The Venetian, so if you're bored with Palazzo, but too lazy to go out, you can walk to Venetian and maybe do some shopping along the way since the area between the two contains a lot of shops and restaurants.

Parking: The self-park parking lot is pretty big with a few levels, but if you're searching for a space near the elevators, good luck, especially if it's during the high season.The one thing i liked about this parking lot over Aria's is that each level has a elevator that takes you directly to the casino whereas at Aria you still have to walk a bit to get there.

The hotel elevators: They need to get rid of the POTO music. And I say this as a POTO fangirl who ships the Phantom and Christine pretty damn hard. 99% of the music I hear in the elevator is the main theme song or Music of the Night. At the very least, give me Past the Point of No Return! And the music is from the movie soundtrack, rather than the original recording with Crawford and Brightman. Yes I know, they're trying to promote POTO that plays at The Venetian, but come on!

Overall I recommend Palazzo if you have a lot of people staying with you and need enough space for everyone's things. Also good if you don't want to walk too much, but still cover enough casinos and shops to go to. It's definitely not very tech savy unlike Aria, but it does its job very well.",0,0,1

I had great encounters with the front desk personnel and my favorite new bartender on the strip (pro tip- go see Wendy. She'll get you very pleasantly drunk).

If you'll be hanging at the pool, and I recommend you do, be aware that in the fall months the sun shifts drastically and quickly.

When I couldn't figure out the temperature gizmo (it's the opposite of ours at home), someone was sent immediately up to show me how it works. Wish it lit up at night in the dark, but other than that, trick was to just push one button and leave the rest alone.

Not so okay- Showed up pretty much at check-in time. Our room wasn't ready. Waited half hour and was told I'd be told when it was. I walked back to the desk and asked. Yes, it was ready but no one had bothered to let me know. For such a nice hotel, that seemed a little disorganized. 

Played with the TV remote for half an hour. It turned the TV on, so I figured it worked and I was just being a klutz. After half an hour, I called room service. Someone came up to the room promptly with another remote, without looking handed me a new one and said, ""Yours is totally dead- don't have to check it. Here's one that works."" It was pretty obvious that happens quite a bit by his tone. I would have loved not having to feel frustrated for a half hour. Remotes need to be checked. Ditto the curtain remote- only one worked. Also, our curtains opened on their own one morning and work me up. 

So basically- GORGEOUS room, can't say enough, but three stars on details like remotes, check- in times.

Last thing? I asked, since I was staying many nights, if the resort fee could be waved. This would have been nice since the room wasn't ready when I arrived. I know these were being given out at random because, while waiting for my room, I was sitting on facebook dabbling. Someone in my exact position had asked for the resort fee to be waved and it was. So this ""honor"" was obviously totally random and at the whim of the desk person. Maybe my skirt wasn't short enough? haha 

We come to Vegas quite a bit for conventions and, by far, this was the sweetest room we've ever stayed in. I would definitely come back. But check your remotes, check your curtains, and don't assume you'll check in on time. All in all, the bed was too great to complain much. And everyone who came to the door to help was really nice.

- Very generous-sized rooms - a bedroom area and a ""living room"" area along with a large bathroom and yes a flatscreen TV in every one of those 3 rooms.

- Some of the fixtures were missing (like the mini bar handle) and there was a drawer that was not on the rollers properly.  Small things, but surprising that the upkeep of the rooms were less than I would expect for such a fancy place.

- Pool area was nice and the waitstaff even hands out cucumbers and chilled washcloths at various times.  However, the struggle of finding a lounge chair on a weekend is ridiculous as most people just leave their shit on a chair per person, even if they never sit on it and you can't tell when people have left.  Also, due to the positioning of the pools between the towers, you can't catch any sun until around noon time.  

- Other than Grand Luxe cafe, not many casual dining options other than the food court at the Palazzo\/Ventian shops and no buffet available!",1,0,0

Spent a total of 7 weeks here in 2011 and if I hear another two bars from ""Music of the Night"" I'm going to run around back of house until I find a pencil to gouge out my eardrums. The rooms are spectacular always. Don't get off where people claim that one side is nicer than the other...they're both the same, people. In neither tower can you sit in your bathtub and watch the bathroom tv at the same time (what is the point?). The handicap rooms seems smaller, just because the living room isn't sunken... but they're still pretty close. 

Everytime I come to the Palazzo\/Venetian, I have a bit of an Indiana Jones moment where I try to swap something of similar weight with the minibar items. I don't know why I bother, but one day I will get it right. 

The St. Mark's Square area is downright creepy... I don't care how many times you've seen it. Truman Show needed an inspiration, and I'm sure they got it from here. I don't get the indoor gondola rides, but I don't claim to understand the thinking of people who go to Vegas for fun either. Lost my small fair share of money in the casino. I always start out as a good blackjack player, but rarely do I end up as one. 

Everything is expensive, as it would be at an expensive hotel. $8 lattes even get me though. Grand Luxe is one of the more affordable restaurants and quite good. They also have the food court off the casino (mediocre) and the food court off of St. Mark's (where you can see the Johnny Rocket's staff painfully...and I mean PAINFULLY... do their song and dance every so often) which has a Panda Express, aforementioned JR, and a few other random places that seem to switch out occasionally. There's also a froyo place, oxygen bar, frozen alcohol bar, and some other places that you rarely see people frequent.

High end clothing stores are nice to look at...Michael Kors, Kenneth Cole, etc. but there's also a Walgreen's attached near the Barney's New York where you can stock up on vitals for only slightly exaggerated prices. 

Banquets and convention staff are hot and cold. Have had them been effing amazing and downright mediocre. Blue Man Group, Phantom of the Opera and Jersey Boys are all housed in the V\/P. Tao is an ok nightclub, but I'm glad I've never had to pay to get in. Lavo's pretty good as well.

A couple weekends ago, I visited Las Vegas with my boyfriend and a couple friends. We were supposed to stay at the Trump but after a terrible check-in experience (as in we never got to check-in after waiting three hours), we were moved down the Strip to the Palazzo. Thankfully, the Palazzo quickly erased our irritation and replaced it with a smile and sigh of relief. It took only 15 minutes to complete check-in and arrive at our room. Another 10 minutes and our bags are being delivered at the door. We finally crashed at about 4:30 a.m. 

When we awoke the next morning, we could finally take in the beauty of our room. Our two queen bed suite was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was especially gorgeous with a separate shower and bathtub, and my boyfriend loved the TV in the bathroom. The sunken living room gave us room to spread out and the remote controlled blinds were a nice touch. 

The location can't be beat with a nice air-conditioned passage to the neighboring Venetian and it's directly across the street from Treasure Island. We easily walked to Caesar's Palace in less than 10 minutes and made it all the way to Planet Hollywood on foot in less than 20. 

My only minor complaint is the lack of free wi-fi. Seriously, $15 a day!?! I think with how much the rooms are there, they could comp the wi-fi. Thankfully, I was able to take my laptop down to the coffee shop on the second floor and hook up to the wi-fi for free. 

I will definitely keep the Palazzo on my list of favorite Vegas hotels!",0,0,0

I wanna go more often but the hubby thinks I have a gambling problem hence the 2x a year restriction.  

The Palazzo is a great place to stay, even without comps, because it is new, centrally located, clean, large spacious rooms, with two flat screen tv's.  The bathroom has a sinkin tub, glass showers, and granite everywhere.  It's a really classy hotel, with great restaurants, and good casino floor. 

Now about the casino area, I stay more at the casino area than the room during our visit, so I must say the casino area is adequate.  There's two main rows of tables with various games, and a separate section of asian games.  There's no theme to this casino, so the design is pretty bland.  I would describe the interior as ""upscale vanilla"".  

The limits are anywhere form $10-$25 and up.  and the dealer are pretty friendly.",0,1,0

We had booked our rooms through Hotwire, because somehow RF was able to figure out before the booking that he got this hotel. Pretty brilliant. You can do valet parking or self parking, so we chose the latter.

Because the reservation was under my name, my friends were unable to check in until I arrived... and I happened to be the last one to arrive. Because we checked in so late, we were told that they did not have rooms for us available at the Palazzo so we would be placed at the Venetian instead. We ended up having to ask for the manager, and she was able to find us rooms in the Palazzo after we told her we were fine having the two rooms be apart from each other. They actually had to upgrade one of our rooms to make this possible, which was nice of them. But later I found out they charged me for the upgrade, so we had to have another discussion with the front desk to have the charges removed.

Apart from those hiccups, however, we had a great stay at this hotel. I never visited the other room, but we were in a suite on the 34th floor that had a great view. The room was really spacious, with a queen bed as well as a pull-out sofa bed. We were able to comfortably fit four people in the room and I thought it was really nice. We lounged by the pool one day--they have several pools, with the main large one being really crowded. A couple of us were able to find seats by the main pool but the rest of our group went to one of the smaller pools to relax in peace. Apart from the pool we didn't use any of the other amenities here, but everything looked nice.

It is convenient being connected to the Venetian, although some of the places that we wanted to go to were a bit of a walk from us. But we could use the exercise since we spent our entire Vegas stay stuffing our faces full of carbs :P 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 for this review.",1,0,0

Slot machines were ok, not too ""tight"".  Food was expensive but that's every where in Vegas.  Overall, we had a great time in the hotel.

I should have know by the ridiculous hold times when I called prior to my arrival that the service of the hotel was not up to par.  This hotel is nothing like the Venetian.  Don't be fooled.  

I was going to the Palazzo for business but my family would arrive later in the week for fun.  The multi billion-dollar company I work for was holding a manager's conference in the hotel.   I called a month in advance to confirm my reservation and make sure we had a crib and a refrigerator in the room.  I was on hold with reservations for at least 15 minutes before I spoke to anyone.   I was assured it wouldn't be a problem by the reservations department.  I worked in the travel industry for many years so I know requests cannot be guaranteed but I figured this was a pretty standard request.  

At check in, we were giving a ""suite"" on the 8th floor 922, corner room with a view of the back of another building, horrible eyesore. It's old and dated.  Bathroom fixtures were old.  Pieces of the mirror had fallen off.  The desk in the living room was worn, missing paint.  The bed comforter was thin, white sheets covering a thin blanket.  The crib and refrigerator had not been put in the room.  We called down to the front desk and after being on hold for 5 minutes were told it would be a 15-minute wait.  OK.  We ended up paying close to $200 dollars to have an old loud refrigerator plugged up in our living area.  

After 15 minutes the crib was brought up.  It was more like a bassinet.  My son fit in the crib... sleeping diagonally.  We asked for a larger crib and were told they had nothing larger.  I've stayed at the MGM and they have full size cribs.  We spoke to the Manager- Matt or Mike and asked to move to a different room due to the view.  We were told it could be done the following day.  We just checked in, what's the problem? We were told we would have to pay a $45 per day upgrade but the Manager would wave it tomorrow.  We weren't asking for a high floor, we just didn't want a room with a wall view.     

Next day we called after 12:00 to move rooms therefore we didn't get the room serviced.  When we called down the front desk, they had no record of us asking to move or us speaking to the manager.  Again, we were told if we wanted to move we had to pay extra.  We told them we weren't going to be doing that so forget the move, $45 bucks an night extra to NOT have a view of wall.  I was shocked that this hotel wouldn't do a thing to make its customers happy.  Our reservation was for 6 nights apparently they needed the money. Within 5 minutes someone was at our door asking if we needed help moving.  No, we weren't moving.  5 minutes later housekeeping was there to clean the room under the assumption we had moved and they woke my sleeping child.   I told housekeeping ""no we weren't moving"".  5 minutes later front desk called to the room, wondering when we would move.  I explained we weren't going to move if we had to pay extra, and again they woke my sleeping child.  Do any of these people communicate with each other?   

At 4pm I spoke to housekeeping to have the room serviced, they made the bed while we were out.  When we came back I called housekeeping again to have them vacuum the room since it was clearly not done.  Waited an hour.  No one came.  I called to cancel so they wouldn't wake my child who asleep for the night.  

If you would like the paper that is included with the resort fee, you have to go to the lobby and get it.  No one told us that. Palazzo gym was old and run down.  The only positive of the whole stay was Wolfgang Puck's Cut.  Wonderful meal.  When we approached management with our complaints they told us to ""write a letter. ""
They refused to do anything during our stay.   The restaurants on the premise are extremely expensive after paying extra for your view and\/or a refrigerator and resort fee, the cheap rate you get on a suite is simply not worth it.  I would rather not be nickel and dimed and just pay more at the time of booking.       

If you have never stayed in a suite while in Las Vegas then by all means stay here.  If you don't value service, then this is your place.  If you are impressed with merely a large room, then you will love it here.  I've stayed in suites all over the Strip and the Palazzo didn't live up to expectations.",2,1,0

My husband and I usually stay at the Wynn in their suites and love it, but this weekend the rooms were pretty expensive due to March Madness, so we decided to stay at The Palazzo, I heard it's comparable to the Wynn...no, no ,no, it's not.  When we got here we decided to upgrade to one of their bigger suites, it's our 26th wedding anniversary.  The first suite they booked us in had beer bottles and garbage in it along with hair clips and garage on one of the tables.  Called downstairs and they were happy to move us to a different suite.  Although, this suite was a little cleaner, my husband did find a container of lipstick on the shelf next to the couch.  Nothing like the pictures on line, the couch cushions didn't match and no pictures on the walls or decorations.  Decided to go downstairs and talk to a manager to downgrade, because it wasn't worth the extra money.  Of course they had no rooms because they were sold out.  Since we already paid in full, decided to stay and make the best of our 26 year wedding anniversary weekend.  I paid for the smart plan which included some extras like 2 free latte each day.  After talking to the manager went to get my coffee and was told ""oh, no it's only for regular coffee"", so I paid cash for it and went up to my beautiful suite JK, and called downstair, was told ya you have the smart plan don't know why they charged you.

Palazzo is still relatively new so it's got the fresh look and feel to it.  The rooms are really spacious and perfect for up to 5 people to stay in comfortably (but i have to say, i was happy that we didnt have to accommodate that many).  The pool is really great but unfortunately doesn't get the early  morning sun so the majority of the pool area isn't truly enjoyable until about noon.  Kinda blows if you want to get your pool time in in the late morning so you can go spend the rest of your day doing something else (like...gamblings or shopping).  But definitely go back when the sun is out in the early afternoon.  The bar's great and the pool chairs that are sitting in the water are awesome. 

A couple of complaints that brought it down a star: 
- check in delays.  We got there at 7:30pm. We didnt get into our room until nearly 9pm because they were cleaning.  Seriously? 
- Restaurants choice.  The only restaurant i really wanted to try was Cut, other than that, it was pretty slim pickings.  We ended up going over to Palazzo's sister hotel (The Venetian) and having dinner a Tao on our last night.  AMAZING.  There'll be a separate review that one visit.",0,0,0

No charge to valet or self park your car.  Screw you MGM and Caesars you greedy bastards.  What, you guys don't make enough money already?  Fuck you.  I appreciate Las Vegas the way it's always been from the beginning.  Free parking and valet.

Comp drinks while playing video poker at the bar.  Screw you Steve Wynn.  You don't even do that.

No bullshit ticket for a drink voucher system.  Don't make me play until a little drink ticket appears.  Screw you MGM and Caesars.  I've bought many $20.00 Corona's!  You can afford to throw some drinks my way if I'm playing.  After all, the longer I play the more I stand to loose.  The house has the odds.  Always.

This property is absolutely gorgeous.  Marble everywhere!  The art, the statues!  The staff was fantastic from Valet, Front desk, Bartenders to Housekeeping.  Great rooms, great location on the strip.

Pro tip for people who like a softer bed, ask housekeeping to put a pad on the mattress for you.  It really helped.  You can ask for softer pillows too.  

Only draw back, no 24 hour restaurant.  Room service not an option for me.  $23.00 burger, $7.00 service fee, plus tax, tip not included.  Do the math on that.  No can do.  

You have to truck you country ass all the over to the Venetian to get a late night bite.  Quite the hike when your hammered at 3:00 a.m.  One of the bartenders did say they are putting in a food court that will open next year.

On the second day, we realized that housekeeping never came, even though my friend had told them we would be heading out in ten minutes, and we left the room no later than 11:30am. We had to call for extra towels, and told them we could skip the housekeeping, but really needed someone to empty our trash cans. They told us they would send someone up, but no one ever came. Fast forward a few days, and I notice they overcharged me for the upgrade. I called their customer service and they accuse me of misreading the charges in a snooty tone. When I point out that I wasn't refunded for the $100\/suite deposit, they realized they were in the wrong and had to backpedal and give me a refund, and barely offered up an apology. After writing an email to the Palazzo about this, they just made sure I was refunded and confirmed that to me. THAT'S NOT THE POINT- the point is that I'm lucky my credit cards weren't close to their limits when I was overcharged, and they can't go around thinking it's ok to overcharge their customers and then refund them later. One of my friends also had a bad experience with their level of customer service during her recent stay. I won't be back to the Palazzo and have made sure to tell my friends and family about my terrible experience so that they will stay away as well. There is no excuse to treat your customers so poorly since there are way too many other nice hotels to stay at in Vegas. The casino floor was dead at the Palazzo and after my experience there, I assume that others have received the memo to go elsewhere as well.

One more negative- the bathroom design at the Palazzo is one of the worst I've seen. There are no locks for the main bathroom or the toliet, and no fan that you can turn on in the separate toliet room. The shower is glass, so people can't use the sinks and take a shower at the same time.",1,1,0

I love this place for the rooms, the location, the shopping downstairs and the A\/C during the hot Vegas summers. They can actually get the rooms cold, something Wynn and Encore cannot do.

Lately I've had some challenges with the reservations department screwing up reservations, but eventually things get straightened out. I don't like the sheets though. I find them to be synthetic and scratchy feeling. Other than that, this is a fabulous Vegas choice and you can get rates as low as $109 a night during the week and $219 during the weekends if you get on their Grazie club list or check the Smarter Vegas fares.",2,0,2

There was enough space for all 6 girls in a room to get ready for anything.  Our view was great, it was of the pool in the back and in front of treasure island so at night, we got to see fireworks from their show!

The only thing that I would say that totally sucked was the room service.  We ordered our food and they said it would take about 1 - 1 1\/2 hour for our food to come!  Plus it was really expensive.  I got a chicken salad sandwich for $20 including tip!  Outrageous I tell you!!

I also got to check out other rooms in the Palazzo and Venetian when I went room hopping on this trip (4 suites total) and in my opinion Palazzo rooms are better but although there was one suite at the Venetian was pretty nice when I slept over one night. The pool was nice also pretty chill and good service and bartenders too..

The only beef I have is that there was no bathrobes in the suite this time. I guess they remember me from last year and how I was walking around the casino drunk in my bathrobe (with clothes on underneath) hitting up the tables and stuff not caring what people said and crap.

For a Vegas hotel, everything is laid out well (e.g., I don't spend 30 minutes walking from my room to the cab queue), and there's some solid restaurants on site.  

The Palazzo as a *casino*, on the other hand, is a pretentious, unfriendly, miserable place.  

""But Derek, you're just saying that because you gambled and lost!""  

No, dear Yelper, I'm not.  

Look, I've been gambling for over a decade.  I've been in at least 20 different casinos (probably more) and slung cards in all of them.  I've had good runs and bad runs.  But never in my entire lifetime -- until playing at the Palazzo - have I had a Pit Boss raise a table minimum the second after you win an amazing hand (huge bet, doubled, won etc) AND not grandfather you in at the table minimum you sat down at.  ESPECIALLY when you've been playing for an hour already at that rate.  

You know what that is?  That's them just completely removing the understood facade that gambling is a game and a source of entertainment for the player.  That is the house just saying: we're going to take your money, one way or another, and don't care about you.  That is what the people that run the Palazzo's Casino do.  They don't want, on any level, for you to have a good time.  They want you to sit down, lose all your money, and then free the seat for another person to do the same thing so they can build another Mario Batali restaurant.

So if you're in Vegas and you're going to gamble, do yourself a favor and do it at any of the similarly high-end casinos nearby where the dealers and bosses understand their advantage but still want you to have a good time (like Caesars).  Because we all know that the house has the edge and will win in the end, but we want to have fun while we're doing it.",15,3,5

If you are looking for a great deal on Palazzo rooms, try hotwire.com . Try guessing the hotel from amenities and the map, it's not too hard, I was always able to guess that it will be Palazzo\/Venetian. When the prices were $309\/night, I was able to get it for $125\/night through hotwire! Not only that, I was there with a group of girls (4 of us) and we were celebrating one of my friends bday. At the check-in desk, I was able to get a free upgrade by simply telling them that it's my friend's bday and that we wanna have crazy fun. We got upgraded from a regular room to a room with a patio on 3rd floor. The patio had a fireplace. The room was spacious and elite. We were also on the same floor with the pool and the breakfast cafe. The service is top notch! Of course you can't always count to get a complimentary upgrade, but hey, at least its possible. Some places are empty and they will never give you any deals. GO PALAZZO! 
BTW, GRAND LUX cafe in PALAZZO is the way to go for Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner! They have everything there, from Salmon plates, to shrimp, to beef, chicken, salads, appetizers etc. FULL BAR.

We have stayed at the Palazzo for the last four years at Christmas and every year previously it has been a wonderful experience.  This year it was obvious that the hotel is cutting corners to save money and it shows in the physical plant and in the service.

The suites are still huge and the extra room is wonderful, but they need to refresh the furnishings.  The rugs had stains.  The couch cushions were so old and beat up that they barely offered any support.  There were chips and stains on the paint, things that by themselves were small but made the room look old and dingy.

The housekeeping staff is poorly trained with very low standards.  We stayed for 7 nights and the suite was not vacuumed or dusted at all.  Twice the beds were so badly made that we had to have them redone.  The maid had put the bottom sheet on horizontal rather than vertical so that there was at least 4 inches of bare mattress at the bottom of the bed.   

They only give you the bare minimum of towels and requests for extras get ignored.  Since there is not longer a turn down service in the evening, if you need extras (like if you take a swim and need to shower before going out in the evening), you won't have clean towels in the morning.

I had very unsatisfactory experiences with the concierge staff and has a guest services staff member (bell\/valet) be downright rude over a problem with a motorized scooter that I had rented.

We were able to secure 3 rooms at the Palazzo through our booking on Hotwire, score right? Well that is what I thought initially until I checked in. The plan was that everyone would sleep on a bed, they typically have rooms with 2 queens and a pull out couch and my goal was for no one to sleep on the pullout. Checking in at 2 PM (1 hour before check in time), I was told by the lovely front desk agent that Hotwire only books king bedrooms and that is what we were getting. A setback but I can roll with it, I also requested if two rooms can be conjoined while the third room be located in the same wing. Did not happen. Got two rooms that were 4 doors apart and the third room was going to be in a different wing. Frustrated, I accepted this offer since that is what she could do. She gave me 3 sets of room keys and told me that she doesn't know which rooms they would go to and that I would need to check each set of keys against the room. She's joking right? Nope, this was her truth and I was dumbfounded at what crappy service I was receiving at a luxury hotel, a hotel I've stayed at before but never received such horrid service. I was also told that the rooms weren't available and that they would call me when they were (she mentioned that rooms aren't guaranteed to be available at 3 and that we may have to wait till 5 to get into our rooms, again, what the hell am I paying for?). I left to grab some friends at the airport and returned at 3:30. Still no call, I decided to check back and see if at least one room was available since the bride-to-be was on her way there. I got a more pleasant lady this time around. She completely understood my frustration and offered me a solution that we couldn't refuse. For an upgrade fee, I could stay at the Venetian (adjacent sister property) with the requests I was looking for and that I would be getting more space in those rooms than I would have at the Palazzo. Sure, let's do it. We were guaranteed a King size bed, a pull out couch, and complimentary roll away in each room. When we got into the rooms, grand yes, couch no. I called the lady back and she told me that she understood those rooms to have a couch and that she would see if we can move. No other rooms were available so she said she would send an additional roll away to each room which we were fine with. After about an hour or so, still no second roll away. I called housekeeping to see what the status was and they said they were sending it. Another hour, still nothing. I call again, same answer. After waiting about 3 hours, I called again and this time I got some housekeeping manager that told me that having a second rollaway was a fire hazard. There is 500 sq. ft. of empty space in the huge room so I'm not sure why this is an issue but I can understand hotel policy. What I can't understand is why I was guaranteed a product that I paid for which couldn't be delivered and why after numerous calls, I was finally getting this answer. I called the front desk agent back (the nicer one) and she was looking into other options. Unfortunately, no other options existed and we were stuck in a situation where folks would have to pair up on roll away beds (we're not in college anymore so this dorm style living was not ideal). Fortunately, the nicer front desk agent was able to reverse the upgrade fees but after about 8 hours of crappy to good to crappy service, this hotel just isn't for me.",1,1,0

My little sister is getting married, naturally this is a great excuse to go to Vegas for a trip with the girls! I was not disappointed! Palazzo is beautiful, classic yet modern with many options for dining, shopping and, of course, gambling. Since it's attached to the Venetian you get two resorts in one.

RESERVATIONS & CHECK IN
I was able to get the best deal for 3 Bella Suites directly through the Palazzo web page. They even offer a lowest rate guarantee. I found rates to be a bargain for a property of this caliber. Check-in process took a while, we arrived during peak hours and the hotel should have had more front desk agents available. However, the young gentleman checking us in was fantastic, he made sure our rooms were on the same floor and had great views of the strip, answered all our questions and even waived the resort fee, because the reservations did not explicitly state it.

ROOMS
Our rooms were on the 44th floor with a beautiful view of the strip. Slightly over 700 sq ft with comfortable beds, cute sunken living room and a modern bathroom. And yes, they DO have hair dryers, in the vanity drawers. Double sink, glass shower and big bath tub - perfect for relaxing in after a late night out. Plenty of closet space and drawers to organize all of your belongings.

POOL AREA
I think I counted 6-7 separate pool areas you can pick from between both properties. You can choose sun or shade, shallow or slightly deeper, loud or chill. You don't need to checkout towels they are just available, comfortable lounge chairs everywhere. The resort was busy and even in the middle of the day I did not have trouble finding a great spot to sunbathe (with tons of sunscreen, of course). Cocktail servers could have been a bit more available, but you can still flag one down very easily. 

Overall we had a fantastic time. There were no major issues with service and I would stay at this property again in a heartbeat!

FOOD:
- A few good places to eat at. The Shoppes of the Palazzo have enough to browse through and since it's connected to the Venetian, it's easy to walk there without noticing it and enjoy everything over there.
- Dal Toro is nothing special, but if you like Lamborghini's it's worth coming here, although if you can't sit inside next to the cars, it's probably not worth it. Haven't tried the other movies to say anything more.

From the second you pull in there are an abundant amount of assistants happily ready to help you. The check in comes with complimentary valet and luggage service up to your room so you have a nice and easy trip through the hotel without any hassle carrying anything. The luxury suite is absolutely stunning!!  there's a ton of great shops and places to eat right there on the first floor so you don't have to worry about finding a means of travel or even going outside in the scorching heat. There are multiple pools you can choose from and a good amount of lounge chairs even on this 4th of July weekend. Check out was just as easy! My favorite part was how family friendly it was! There was no encounters with obnoxiously drunk people! I highly recommend this place! 5 stars guaranteed!,0,0,0

We got word of the MANDALAY BAY SHOOTING while we were dinning at one of your restaurants. We heard so many crazy things like there were multiple shooters, at different hotels, on the strip, it was horrifying and I am prone to anxiety attacks, I came up to your desk looking for a room for the night, praying with the look of the place (beautifully luxurious) I wasn't gonna be gouged. 

You had a clean cut Asian gentleman who's name I didn't get in the panic of finding out if my dad was safe, he was a saint, he charged me a rate I don't want to say for a room that was so beautiful. That man made me a customer for life, that man could have very well saved me and my fiancés life. I was staying at Caesar's Palace that night and how they treated me the next morning I will never go back, but you people you really cared, you showed compassion, grace and charity and those are values I want to invest in and support with my patronage. I will let everyone who cares to ask, know about what you did for us in that critical moment. 

Not to mention you gave me complementary late check out because you knew I had to settle business with those monsters at Caesar's.

Based on my list of likes and dislikes, I should give the place 4 stars out of 5 but I had such a wonderful stay despite the few dislikes that I am giving it a 5. I can't wait to go back.

Things I liked:

-We ck'ed in early without a problem at all.
-We were upgraded without a problem.
-We rec'd several coupons for the restaurants which we used.
-There were 3 TVs in the room including one in the bathroom.
-Superhuge, gorgeous bathroom and spacious room overall with a living room area
-Plush bathrobes for him and her
-Loved the makeup\/dressing table in the bathroom.
-Room was very quiet, I never heard anyone slamming doors or yelling, etc.
-Remote-controlled blinds and curtains
-Great view of the pool area and the strip
-There was a ""Priority"" button on the phone for a quick answer to anything you wanted.
-All the restaurants were insanely good, especially The Grand Lux (we went a cpl times)
-Everyone in the casino, hotel, restaurants, shops were SO nice and helpful.
-Pools were upscale, nice and relaxing. 
-Cabana we rented was awesome. Best I have ever been in. Great service here, too.
-Went to see Phantom here and it was also awesome. Great show!
-There's a Walgreens right out front to hit for cheap supplies.
-Super easy check out. Just dropped the key in the box.

Things I disliked:

-We couldn't get the room as cold as we like it but it was about 90 degrees there then.
-The towels could have definitely been softer. They were kind of rough.
-One of the drawers in our dresser was busted.
-The light on the magnification mirror didn't work. (prob could have asked for another)
-They need more HD channels for the wonderful HD\/LCD TVs in the room.
-The fridge won't hold your own stuff. There's no room. It is filled with their beverages that are pricey. You will be charged as soon as you remove one from it's place. It's electronic.
-We were told the fax machine was free but weren't told that there was a charge if it was long-distance. We had a TON of fees upon checkout and they only refunded us half.
-The spa is horrible, didn't like it, not relaxing and was like a factory in there. 

So despite the few bad things we really had a wonderful trip and will be going back to either the Venetian or the Palazzo next trip to Vegas. We go a lot and usually stay at The Flamingo. For almost the same price (with the special the Venetian was running) we stayed in way nicer accommodations with much more to see and do. We hardly left the area of Venetian, Palazzo, the Wynn. Also, the cabanas here were as much as the ones at The Flamingo and way, way better. These cabanas have an AC in them!  

When you step into The Palazzo you really are taken aback by it's beauty. It is a gorgeous hotel and they have it decorated beautifully. All the restaurants were sleek and modern, too. I have been to many hotels\/casinos in Vegas and this is one of the prettiest that I have seen. It's definitely worth a try.

*****As a side note, I am going to post some pics of their cabanas. This was something I was looking for before I went and could not find. They are insane, so awesome. They even have AC in them!*****",0,0,0

They have offered us another try.  We will return next year and I will let you know how it goes:)





The concierge staff is all a bit snotty, they should be a lot more personable.  I don't understand why it is so difficult to help you.  They should have jumped on the issue with the Strawberry delivery, taken ownership and called guest services and the front desk for me.  They should anticipate my needs rather than me having to pull their teeth out to have my needs met.  

Dear Mr. Adelson, 
My husband and I recently stayed at the Palazzo Hotel in Las Vegas with two close friends of ours.  We stayed from Friday to Monday and they were in their room, from Saturday to Monday.  I have stayed at Venetian a number of times in the past.  As well, we have stayed at the Bellagio, the Green Valley Resort and other hotels too, as we come to Las Vegas 1-2 times a year at the very least.  
I am writing to you because we had a number of negative incidents occur during our stay. As the former Assistant Manager of Visitor Services for the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau, as well as a concierge and front desk agent at five star properties in California including the Sonoma Mission Inn and Spa, I know what to expect from a luxury hotel.  I did not receive the service that I expected from the team members at the Palazzo.  
The following issues came up during our stay.  
1.  Because our friends were celebrating birthdays while staying with you, we pre-arranged a delivery from Sherries Berries.  The chocolate covered strawberries never made it to our friends.  Although, they were signed for by an employee of yours, M. RIVERA at approximately 10:15 am on Saturday, December 3.   I called your concierge to inquire about this delivery and was told that they don't handle deliveries like this.  I was then transferred to the guest services department.  They told me that the item had never been delivered.  They then sent me back to the front desk and I was told the same thing.
2. We ended up having to have your concierge deliver another gift of balloons and truffles to them.  I was disappointed as this was now Sunday and they were leaving on Monday and unable to take the balloons on the plane.  The concierge said they would be in their room when they returned from lunch at 1:30.  We returned after 2pm and they were not there.  I called down and was told that the florist didn't have a key.  Apparently, the concierge didn't deliver it him or herself...was this because there was no tip for them too as it was a phone order?  I don't know.  
3. Speaking of the concierge, I was looking for tickets to the Sunday showing of the new Michael Jackson show at the Mandalay Bay.  I had done some research at home so I knew there were still some $50 tickets available.  I figured the concierge at a luxury resort could help us.  Well, we met the not so friendly concierge on Saturday afternoon.  We asked him about tickets to the show, he grunted and took a look.  He told us there were TWO prices ....70 something and 100 something.  I told him that no, we had seen that there are $50 tickets.  Well, he insisted that there were not any of this sort and he couldn't help us.  We went to our room; I used my iPhone and purchased 2 x $50 tickets.  Seems to me the concierge wanted a commission and there must not have been one on the $50 tickets?
4. Who in the world decided to block the entire entrance to the hotel from the lobby with the Stiletto Race?  There was barely any walk space alongside the viewers, the tables were blocked and we had to walk all around to get where we wanted to go.   We tried to leave for the KA show at 5:45 But, getting out of the hotel proved to be a pain in the -s.  We eventually got to the taxi line and it took us a good half an hour to get through the line.  We barely made the show.  Why on earth did this get scheduled at such a ridiculous location and why were the guests not warned about how long it would go on and how difficult getting out would be?  
5. Sunday: Your front desk agents could have averted all this stress by informing us when we checked in that there were a number of events including the Marathon that would cause travel issues.  The entire strip was closed!  Why was there no notification in the Palazzo about this?  We had tickets to Michael Jackson.  We left at 5pm to grab a taxi downstairs.  We learned that there were none.  It took us two hours. We almost missed it.
6. Last but not least, our room was lovely but there were some details that needed to be addressed; it took 5 minutes to warm up the shower, the vanity mirror bulb was out and the lamp next to my bed did not work either.  I had the mirror replaced but, then didn't want to have to call again for the light.  These things need to be checked regularly in a hotel of this calib",5,2,0

ok. this is another late review. i took the boyfriend to las vegas last year for his birthday. it was his first time! ( what?!!!) i went on vegas.com to find a hotel that was nice and that had a good price going on. i found the palazzo hotel and casino and it was awesome, and ive stayed alot of places in vegas. its an all suite beautiful hotel that for once in vegas isnt built like a maze. the casino is very wide and you can tell how to get out. there is no yucky smokers smell in the carpet and everything is new. 

we stayed there 4 days and i only paid $600! the room was gorgeous. marble bathroom, sunken living room, plasma flat screens, and a wonderful view of the pool. the service was fantastic and they had alot of free movies as well as pay per view. 

they have around 4 large pools with several jacuzzis, so it felt very intimate. we even got one to ourselves!! the bed was king size and soooo comfortable, i almost didnt want to get out. 

the palazzo is semi attached to the venitian on the outside and links to the venetian on the inside through the indoor shopping area. its also right next door to the wynn and across the street from the mall. i love this place sooooo much. the decor is classy and they have a huge atrium that changes with the seasons. i will stay here again and again. you should too.",0,0,2

Although I did not stay here on my previous trip, my buddy had a room here during my June trip and the majority of the time was spent in his room due to this crazy upgrade....

He got upgraded from the Venetian Venezia tower to a Hospitality Suite in the Palazoo for a mere $20 tip, remember everyone, always do the $20 trick when checking in. 

What I love about Palazzo and Venetian is LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!  All the hot clubs and pools are all within walking distance. Tao, Tao Beach are within Venetian and XS, Tryst, Surrender, Encore Beach Club is right across the street!  This is awesome cause it saves so much money on cab fare!

The room was HUGE. I have to say at least 2000+ sq ft. It was connected to the Palazoo pool where all we had to do was jump the barrier and the pool was there. It was quite nice chillin' on the patio while people were looking at the pool thinking we were ballers but little did they know the deal we booked was $300 for 4 nights which included 4 days of car rental too!

I gave my 3rd and final try and even more disappointed then the first 2 stays.  The customer service is ZERO!  Everything takes forever and the place just lacks luxury. I feel like Im staying at a Holiday Inn with a fancy name and some extra furniture. 

Without any exaggeration I was on hold for 43 minutes before the front desk picked up. I ended up calling with my cell phone and got through right away. Shows how much they care about their guest. 

My room wasnt ready 2 hrs after they said it would be and when I did get to my room it was a mess and smelled like a locker room. Huge stain on the floor and couch...just felt disgusting. After the 43 minute hold time I and saying it would take 3 hours to clean the stains etc I flipped. 

I demanded to be moved to another room which they said they were sold out. I was just a few hours away from a meeting for work when they agreed to give me a penthouse suite.  Piano, Pool Table, 2 bath 3 tv....cool! I get to the room and its 8000 degrees in there the mini bar is half empty and there are NO TOWELS!

Took 20 minutes for towels to come they fixed the AC and restocked the bar. They even took care of the room fare and gave me a $90 voucher .

Stayed on the weekend, came back Saturday morning around 3am, woke up later that morning to discover we were robbed...while asleep in the room. Granted, we were pretty exhausted, so may not have heard an elephant either. Filed a report with security and police. Close to $500 in cash missing and a pair of Jordans...all items closest to the door. Called back a few days later, was told by the claims adjuster the door didn't latch after the last time we came back in, so it was open until the robber closed it on the way out. Oddly enough, the door latched fine all the previous times we were in\/out. They said it's my responsibility to lock the door, which I did as it shut closed...it doesn't have anything else on it, except a dead bolt, which I forgot.

The hotel offers no accountability even though the door didn't lock properly. We're out about $600 and apparently it's all our fault.

We did 3 which was perfect but you never know... Anyways, the rooms are spacious, clean, beds comfy, ample light & plugs (I was here for a bachelorette party) my only complaints are:

Everything is up to speed- technology wise in the room EXCEPT for the alarm clock. It's this dino-1997 CD player. Who even has CDs anymore? It DOES have a tiny cord to connect an IPOD, but the sound quality is that of a 1997 CD alarm clock. It might sound petty BUT there is a flat screen in the bathroom and you are telling me you cant get an ipod doc \/ alarm clock?? Seemed really odd. 

Also, the customer service\/front desk\/concierge\/room service... was NOT GOOD- in a nutshell. They screwed up our reservation, told us they didn't have a non-smoking connecting room- took us to a crappy 3rd floor room and only after making a scene- gave us the room we originally reserved. They were hoarding our room. Jerks.

Room service informed me it would be $5.00 to bring extra glasses and ice. I have NEVER in my life heard this and after complaining they brought it free of charge. WTF.

They were uncaring and unapologetic about the fact that we couldn't get ready in our rooms in order to make our show reservations that evening.

The rooms were spacious but tired. Handles were missing on the chipped furniture and the lock was irreparably broken on our safe. The man who tried to fix the safe was not only unsuccessful; he was not helpful and very unfriendly.

The day we checked out, we asked for a late check out. We were denied because they said they were booked. When we reminded them we didn't get to check in at the normal time, they told us we had until noon to get out. I called the hotel on my cell phone and was told they did have available rooms so not only are they rude, they are dishonest.

I am a very nice person and usually get great service. It's not as though we caused any problems or were even drinking. There was absolutely no reason for their terrible service but there it was.

Price wise it is on the mid range+ size but like I said it's worth the real estate. Casinos down stairs are known to be on the higher minimum bet and you definitely want to get a players card if you play because they are known to give out comp rooms from time to time.

Unfortunately, the front desk told me that I had reserved a regular suite with ONE king bed. I was almost fearful that we had to cram ten people into a smaller suite than anticipated. Fortunately, I explained the situation with the front desk and he gladly gave us the room I requested.

Security are always present at the elevator entrances. 43rd floor, baby! We pretty much overlooked the TI Sirens show and Treasure Island itself. Amazing view. 

The room is a little bit run down. Coaches are weathered and some of our mirrors were missing decorations. The L-shaped couch fold out in the sunken living room was a twin size. Two-queen beds, really comfy. You can fit either two large men or three tiny girls into each bed. Three tvs located in: the bedroom, sunken living room and bathroom. Separate toilet. Dual sinks. Shower. Tub. 

Grand Lux Cafe is only open until 2 or 3AM depending on days, but the one at the Venetian is open 24hrs. However, no fried pickles at 3AM ):

Another upside, they have plenty of pools since they are also connected to the Venetian. I believe you get access to both since their sister hotels. So applies to the nightlife, Lavo at the Palazzo and TAO at the Venetian.

Overall, beautiful hotel, but I was a little let down considering I have wanted to stay here for a long time. Might I suggest Planet Hollywood Towers?",0,0,1

At certain times there will be models dressed as moving trees, as granite statues, as non-moving objects displaying clothes, and all other nifty modeling poses. The food selection is connected to the Venetian shops. I prefer the Venetian for it's location next to TAO (the best club in Vegas) and also because the crowd is a bit younger, but the Palazzo is newer.

Huge lobby, nice high ceiling casino floor that still won't prevent you from smelling like smoke, and lots of restaurants and shopping.  Integration with the Venetian is fairly seamless.  A faux-Venetian streetscape of shops, complete with gondola bearing canal and landmarks like St. Mark's square, connects them.  I'd say it's the most interestingly themed shops to walk through.  

Rooms are all 700+ sqft with reasonable prices when we traveled. Considering the $22+\/day resort fee and the fact that we stayed over Labor Day weekend it still came to under $200 a night.  Big sitting area with a sectional couch, desk, and a printer, nice bed, separate shower and tub, and all around a nice room.  Charges for Wifi, but not a big deal since the LTE coverage in Vegas is excellent.  Elevators took forever to arrive.

Location is good, but not perfect.  It's on the northern part of the casino cluster, so if you need to get pretty far south for dinner or a show it'll take a while.  The monorail will still involve quite a bit of walking since the Palazzo has no direct connection.  For what we were doing, which was mainly food and shows, I think the Bellagio has the best location since it's more central, and by far the best free outdoor show.  Speaking of the free shows, the Palazzo's clock tower show is a joke, don't go out of your way to see it.  After it finished a lot of people were wondering aloud if what they'd seen was actually the show.  

Now all that said, it's a great hotel that we enjoyed staying in.",1,1,1

We had the Bella 2 Queen Bed Suite on the 33rd floor.  It had a view of the Venetian, Venetian pools, and a partial view of the strip. Check-in took some time, esp if you go at 3pm because that's when a bunch of people start lining up.  We didn't mind. We were so busy taking pictures having just arrived in Vegas to check in to this 5 star hotel.  
Our room was exactly as pictured by previous yelpers... gorgeous. Nice huge bathroom with a fullsize tub and shower stall.  Dual sinks and 3 TV's: one in the bathroom, one in front of the sleeping area, and one in the living room\/dining\/lounge area.  It was equipped with an automatic drape and window shades control.  The beds were nice and soft and extremely comfortable.  I loved the sheets and the comforter.
We ordered room service for breakfast and that was OK.  The food we were told would take one hour, which I think it took a little less than that to come. When we ordered the omelette however, they cooked the eggs first and then wrapped it around the toppings.  Not used to that but everything else was awesome.  They do include gratuity on the bill so no need to tip extra unless you were super impressed.
We walked through their shopping hall and noticed that the hotel is connected to the Venetian so you didn't have to walk outside through the heat to check out next door.
We hit poolside about 11am Saturday morning and the place was packed.  Luckily we were able to find a couple of chairs by the pool and a chair in the pool area too.  It did take some time to order our drinks from their pool service but it looked like we had one girl in our area and she was busy... still, frozen drinks by the pool were absolutely yummy.
We had room service bring additional towels and they were prompt and helpful. 
I wasn't that thrilled with their parking structure though. They have these poles in the middle of the rows of cars for parking that you had to drive between when exiting\/entering the aisles.  I thought it was inconvenient if you wanted to park in the end rows.  One lady trying to park her van, I swear, took 15 tries at least before she finally parked her car and we had to wait forever so we could drive around her but we ended up backing out and go the other direction...it was so frustrating.  It's not the typical parking structure.
Oh and they have Emeril Legasse's sports bar downstairs right on the corner close to Wynn at this hotel so it was perfect for watching a big fight right on the strip.  We saw BJ Penn vs. Edgar UFC fight there and it was standing room only.  To reserve a table or booth it was $50 min food\/drink per person in the party.  
I'm going to do a separate review for Lavo, the nightclub at Palazzo.  Staying here at Palazzo, we were able to get VIP access into Lavo and walk right in.  We were given complimentary 4 drinks at Lavo, on top of that as well.  Overall, I had an excellent experience here and would definitely want to stay at Palazzo\/Venetian again.",0,0,0

The shopping area was cool, ofcourse not much seemed open but the atmosphere was nice.  I did notice that the music they played didn't fit with the look of the place.  Santana and Avril are good for Planet Hollywood but it just seems like  a clusterF here.  Pavarotti would've been more appropriate.

I told the person on the line that I can't log onto the wifi. She told me she can send a tech to my room to check, but she doesn't have an ETA for when the tech will arrived. I asked if I can get a text or call notification beforehand in case if I'm not in the room. Unfortunately, she said it's not possible since they're really busy.

I slept on the sofa bed the first night and it was UNCOMFORTABLE!  They did not provide any sheets and pillows even though my friend had asked for it.  She had to ask for it again the next night and they provided.  bathroom has a tv.

A few things stand out and worth mentioning:
1. Lavo restaurant- AMAZING Italian food (and I am Italian so I am a harsh critic) I loved the look of the restaurant and the portions were a lot bigger than expected

2. The Prestige (concierge) service.  We did not pay for this upgrade but after experiencing it would consider it for next time.

Because these two hotels are connected, you have more amenities like more pools, at your disposal. One of my favorite spots, LAVO is also located inside The Palazzo. 

The rooms are suite styled, and we enjoyed a beautiful view overlooking the strip. We lucked out with a room right under the penthouse floor. With two uber comfy queens, a tv in the living room, bedroom, and bathroom, amble closet space, sunken living room with large area couch, office desk area, dining room, and a large bathroom (separate bath tub and shower), the two of us lived it up during our stay. Since my stay here at The Palazzo, I have since also stayed at the Venetian. As much as I liked the Venetian, The Palazzo is definitely more sexy, modern, much better decorated and exudes what Las Vegas should be like. The Palazzo is a beautiful hotel, and also has great restaurants, luxurious shops, and great rooms!",4,1,2

Over all good experience, we had a good time even do spa has no customer service, they are a third party company renting, So can't take the blame on palazzo.

I was there for two weeks.  It had just opened when I was staying there.  Walking in, it was nice, but did not seem any different than the other casinos on the strip.  Then I got to my room.  The room was awesome.  The decor was top notch.  I had a King sized bed that was very soft and comfortable.  I had a living room area with a couch and lounger and the bathroom is marble with a clear glass shower.  There were three TV's in the room including one in the bathroom.  The room was the best I've ever stayed in.  The other nice thing about the Palazza is that it is affiliated with the Venetian, so there are lots of restaurants, nightlife and the Shoppes at the Venetian, which is some of the best shopping on the strip.  Lagasse's Stadium is a pretty awesome sports bar on the lower level that I spent some time at as well.  One annoying thing though, Jersey Boys is showing at the Venetian, so be prepared to listen to Franki Valli in the elevator all day long and try not to blow your brains out.

The rooms are known as being the largest, most ornate and classy rooms on the strip.  Like the Venetian's younger brother, the Palazzo towers next to its sibling in bigger-is-better family rivalry.

During my visit the hotel ran out of the standard rooms and upgraded me, to a 1,000 square foot palatial flat, with multiple bathrooms and a private gym!  Very nice, and I impressed my friends entertaining them with huge windows overlooking the vegas strip.

I was here only because of a bachelor party. We were lucky to get two small suites to accommodate 9 guys. I think we could fit 12. Anyhow we were able to get side by side rooms and were able to move between the two fairly easily. They both were exact rooms but just mirror images of each other. There were 3 flat screens in each room. One in front of the beds, one near the desk and couches and one in the bathroom.

I did like the fact that we were close to the strip. We walked everywhere and didn't have to take taxis anywhere. Last time I was in Vegas, we stayed at the MGM Grand suites. They were nice but the cost of staying there caused us to take taxis because it was so far. 

We walked everywhere from this hotel and also stayed here a lot. It had everything we needed. 

The pool area is nice and we were lucky to book a cabanna for the day. We had a tv and a private area to tan and lay out. I guess it was nice because we didn't have to worry about finding a spot. Plus we were close to the pool and had a great view of the people. 

We also visisted the shops in the Palazzo which were located on the second floor. There was an abundance of high end shops and some affordable ones. We really didn't visit too many just one. I ended up getting some dress shoes at the Coal Haan store. Great place for dress shoes!

I would definitely come back again. I don't gamble much so I can't say much about the experience. 

Another thing that was nice was the fact that the floors were separated into three sections. We were able to get to our floor which was on 20 and then not have to worry about a full elevator or waiting too long to get on one.

I did like the beds and they were very comfortable. The bathroom was nice. I didn't like the fact that the toilet door didn't have a lock. There were 9 guys which shared two bathrooms. The door closed on its own so you didn't know if somebody was using it. I liked the shower a lot but didn't mess with the tub at all.

The hotel?  Beautiful.

The casino?  Blah.  Dealers are unfriendly and barely speak to you, forget about getting a smile or greeting

The room? Iffy.  There were mystery stains on the chair, uneven flow from the shower head and a piece missing from the mirror.  The beds are pretty comfortable though.

The service?  HORRIBLE.

We arrived on friday night and waited for 15 minutes just to reach the front desk.  Oh yeah, there was only one person in front of us.  I'm not sure what was happening, but the people at the counter looked like they were just chit chatting because when I got up there, I was done in 5 minutes flat and off to my room.

I had reserved the room about two weeks in advance and had specified one king bed, but when we arrived, it was a two full bed room.  Ok, not the end of the world, whatever.  I call the ""priority help line"" for ""immediate service"" and get put on hold for 20 minutes before someone comes on the line and says ""oh sorry, no king beds available.""  Alright...I'll deal, I guess.

Everything else was fine up until the day we left.  We checked out at 11 and went to go eat.  I realized at lunch that I had forgotten my watch in the room so I call in and they put me on hold yet again, then come on the line only to tell me that they'll send someone and call back in about 20 minutes.  

30 minutes later, no call.  I call again and she says that she'll send a security guard and call in 20 min to an hour.  Ok, so what happened to the other person?

This all happened on Sunday and now it is Tuesday night, 9 pm.  Still no call.  To me, this is just an example of sheer laziness and bad service.  If you're going to charge $300+ per night, at least have the courtesy to answer my phone call and tell me that you didn't find the watch.

I love craps and I love winning.  On this night I made some money for me and for all the people betting on me. Our table was packed and we were sending off positive vibes which led to more people coming over to play and watch.

I can say the highlight was us being invited to some chocolate tasting in the ballroom as guests of the casino-but we declined. The other?  Standing next to a high roller with at least $100,000 in chips!

When we called to ask to change the rooms, they changed us into another room that had the same problem. On the second complaint call the answer was the hotel was 100% sold out and they couldn't do anything but to provide an air purifier - that didn't do much against the rising odor from the vent itself - and that they were cleaning some systems!??

just like the adjacent Venetian, this place is a total winner!; classy & comfortable everywhere; the hotel check-in and a few other areas have nice displays for our Asian tourist friends to snap lots of pictures of!; the restaurants are all very nice & destinations in their own right - I especially like the sexy vibes of Morels and Lavo, located next to each other, both with cool al fresco dining tables; the lower level Lagasse's Stadium sports bar has to be seen to be believed - it totally raises the bar on what a sports book\/bar area can be; the 2nd floor has more affordable eateries + lots of shops that connect to the Venetian Grand Canal; best craft beer bet = ya gotsa goes to the 2nd level - Emeril's Table 10 has a very solid tap selection, but they are bested by I Love Burgers, which gets much love for both their big juicy burgers and their great craft beer offerings.",2,0,2

My first time at the Palazzo equaled a 10 night stay as I was there for work. Yes you're reading the right. I said TEN! That's a really long time in Vegas but at least I could stay somewhere nice. 
My suite was located on the 15th floor (15-709). I like how they divide the floors into different sets of elevators. This cuts down on the wait time for sure. Upon arrival I passed off my luggage to the bellman who would later bring it to my room. Normally I don't do this but these Vegas properties can be huge & I was unsure as to how far I'd have to walk. So why not let someone else deal with it. 
The check in process was very smooth & quick. The lady who checked me in was very friendly. Off to my room I go. You walk through the casino to get to the guest room elevators. I noticed on the walk that the casino never seemed to reek of cigarette smoke like some of the other Strip hotels. Another +1 for Palazzo. There's a security person there at the elevator entrance & you have to show your guest room key card to go through. I like that added level of security because we all know Vegas has a lot of crazies. 

Room: the room is very spacious and that includes the bathroom. It really is a suite with the bedroom area and then a living\/work\/dining area. There's a step down to the living area so it truly feels separate even tho it is one large open space. The bed is very nice. I wish the pillows were a bit firmer but that's more a personal preference. The suite has 3 Tvs total. One the bedroom, one in the living\/dining room and another in the bathroom. I loved watching TV in the bathroom while getting ready everyday. There is a printer in the room by the desk which is on the living\/dining side of the suite. I had a couple issues with it including low ink which they changed for me. Two things to note. 1. The shade & curtains are remote controlled & the remote is on the wall with the thermostat. Don't be an idiot like me spending too much time trying to figure out how the shade raises. 2. The suite has a mini bar. I hate mini bars. I'd rather have a fridge. When I need something I go to the gift shop & get it for less. 

Service: upon arrival my luggage took a little longer to get to my room than I was told but the bellman was nice & even got me ice. I ordered room service a few times during my stay. As with most room services it is pricey but the convenience is sometimes priceless. Room service was always delivered quicker than they stated which was nice and the staff were fantastic & professional. I never had any issues with housekeeping & having my room serviced. 

Restaurants: not much on the Palazzo side itself but the shops offer restaurants & the Venetian has a food court. The Grand Lux Cafe is pretty good. Average priced. I picked up food here a couple times in the evening. Never takes too long & its nice eating in my room alone lol. 

Overall I love this property. Clean, spacious suites, and friendly staff. It is further down on the strip so plan accordingly when walking.",2,0,0

I've been here several times and have enjoyed it every single time. Some people might say that The Palazzo is a little pricey, but you aren't just paying for the room, but rather the location. It's located next to the Wynn and Encore which has great clubs and day clubs. 

I always book the Bella Suite. It's a really nice room with two queen beds, full bathroom with both a shower and tub along with plenty of amenities. I would have to say that the room on average is around $300-$400 a night. If you book months in advance you can probably get it for under $300. 

The only negative things about The Palazzo is that they do not have their own food court so if you are hungry at night you have to walk to the Venetian or a different hotel for food. Also, they do not have a well-known club here. They have Lavo here, but I did not like it at all. At least XS and Surrender are next door. 

Overall, I love staying at The Palazzo when I come to Vegas. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are with a group since you can get 2 suites and ask that both room be connected. That is the most ideal thing for a larger group when staying here.",1,2,1

The parking is free and there is a nightly resort fee of about $40 which gets you wifi in your room, access to the gym, etc. WiFi speeds were fantastic, able to stream Netflix without the drops we've experienced in many other hotels and resorts. Decor is very clean and new and staff is always super friendly. The Grand Canal Shoppes between Palazzo and Venetian offer many places to eat good food within close proximity to your suite. There are multiple pools (family, 21+, etc) to choose from and the noise level from the rooms is very very quiet if any at all (one of the quietest we've experienced to where we had to put on our white noise machine to sleep since it was too quiet and we are used to the sound of fans lol).

The Seina Suite: very roomie one bedroom two bathroom luxury suite. One bathroom is a powder room and the main bathroom has a sunken tub with jets, a TV, and a shower with 5 different shower experiences. The TV's are smaller than in the regular studio style luxury suite, and because this room is bigger you don't get as much natural lighting from the windows, but overall a really amazing and beautiful room.

The luxury suite (base suite, king bed): one of the biggest studio style hotel rooms I've been in. Great natural lighting and roomy. Bathroom has sunk in tub (no jets) and tv and shower like the Siena suite. TVs are much larger, and decor and everything was very clean and neat.

Both rooms have electronic sheer Roman shades and blackout curtains, a bar fridge (filled with the stuff you can buy, not for you to use to put your own stuff in), plenty of storage including closets and drawers, and a means to save electricity via the master switch when you enter. Beds are in the middle of soft and firm so not super soft or super firm and multiple types of pillows for your comfort.

Overall our favorite place to stay on the strip, however there are a couple casinos we haven't stayed at.",2,0,0

We returned at 4.30 and it still hadn't  been done. We asked for them to do it later while we were out and they did but it was a little irritating with children that wanted to relax before dinner. Also, we had booked a room with 2 double beds and the hotel knew we were 4 people so why not provide glasses, robes and sufficient towels and toiletries for 4? I left housekeeping a tip with a note to leave the relevant bits and they duly did. We ate in Sushi Samba and The Grand Lux Cafe (see separate reviews) and enjoyed them.

We stayed with a large group in approximately 10 suites, both at the Venetian AND the Palazzo. Quintessence is: Almost everyone had problems with housekeeping.

When we first moved into the suite, it was completely dusty. There were hairs in the tub and in the shower, plus hair near the toilet. The sheets on one of the pillows on the bed were on their left side. Wallpaper came off the walls as well.

We complained multiple times about this situation and it took 3 phone calls plus 4 hours wait until someone finally showed up. Yes, the suite was clean afterwards but we could not use the bathroom in the meantime.

Last but not least: One day, that little Kleenex box in the bathroom was empty. Of course housekeeping didn't pay attention to this. They don't pay attention to much detail. So I called them, requested a new one to be send, removed the old one from the leather casing and put it in the entrance so even the dumbest person would see it. Well, what happened?

Housekeeping in fact brought a new Kleenex during our absence, but they neither put the new one in the leather casing, nor did they dispose the old box. It was still standing in the entrance upon our return.

I pay attention to details, and these details just tell you something about the attitude of housekeeping at the Venetian and how it's managed - BADLY.

And since housekeeping is so important in any hotel, this deserves 2 stars to be subtracted.",0,0,0

Rooms are pretty much the same as adjacent its siamese twin the Venetian. I love the sections that connect the two hotels, as they have a waterfall, small garden areas and are themed (which change each season). Great photo ops! 

The casino is newer and a lot cleaner than many others. They have great ventilation so I'm never bothered by the smoke here. 

Beds and bedding are fluffy and comfy. Also, the couch is pretty comfy and has a pull out bed if you are ballin' on a budget! 

There is a flat screen tv in both the bed area, another in the couch area and a third smaller one in the bathroom

Easy access to both Palazzo and Venetian pools! You can relax and recover from the night before, or if you didn't get enough last night you can take advantage of one of the day club pool parties, and if you have kids with you (weird, but it happens), they even have more kid friendly areas.

There were a few kids next door, but we only heard noise a few times, and even that could easily be drowned out by the three tv's (if you count the one in the bathroom).  I've read the reviews of how terrible it was to be at the pools with all the kids, but we didn't use the pool.  It was just way too hot.  We didn't upgrade our room at all but had a nice view of the Wynn\/Encore and its golf course.

I really liked that once I knew where everything was, I was able to park close to the elevator that pops up right next to the elevator to the guest rooms.  (Oh, and parking is still free!)

I had never walked up in the ""fake Venice"" area between the Palazzo and Venetian, but having been to Venice twice over the last year, I thought it was a decent attempt.  We were just usually headed to the food court, and it was usually pretty crowded on the canal-side walkways.

There are four or five different pools that you can go to.

There are pools that are closer to Palazzo or Venetian, but since it's a shared property, you can go to either one. Just make sure that you have your key card. You get asked EVERYWHERE to show your card. I guess people try to sneak in or something. hah.....

The rooms are nicely decorated and if you get a room with a good view, you can see the strip with all the lights at night. The rooms come with 2 flat screen TVs, one in the bed area and the other in the couch area. There's also a small TV in the bathroom.

The casino itself isn't that big. They have slots and table games in the aisle way to the Venetian. Compared to the Venetian, the Palazzo casino area is pretty small. It seems like a lot of young people come stay at the Palazzo. They don't have a club or anything in the Palazzo but a few restaurants and the shops between the Palazzo and the Venetian.

My wife attended the summer grazie gifts giveway. That was the second time I've been to that. It's a pretty nice event! It was located in one of the convention rooms. They give away gifts in exchange for points you've earned. They had a lot of samples on food to try. We also were able to take a complimentary picture that was really nice and included a nice little booklet to put the picture in. This event was for people who earned enough points to get gifts. This is a nice thing that they do for their players and was the reason why we stayed here during this trip.

Overall, this casino\/hotel is pretty nice. The rooms are big and good to share with a big group since there's 2 beds and also a couch area. I can't remember if it pulls out into a bed, probably not but I just can't remember since I never really use it. Gaming wise, the table stakes are pretty high.

The service was excellent.  The food was delivered and set up very nicely in the room.  The food however was really lacking.  We had three items.  All terrible.  The steak steamed buns were literally inedible. They were not actually steamed buns.  they were sort of bun like tacos.  While the meat filling was good the 'bun' itself was so hard it appeared to have been microwaved.  They had the consistency of balsa wood.

The Italian antipasto plate was a selection of inferior grade sliced deli meats laid flat on the plate and drowned in olive oil.  the bread served with is was not Italian bread but rather some sort of heavy whole grain bread, one with what appeared to be fruit baked in.

Grilled octopus salad.  Sounds delicious right?  Well not so much.  The accompanying bell pepper tapenade was great!  The octopus itself was served in carrot like pieces that were tasteless and had the consistency and texture of old play-doh.

The highlight of the $100 meal was the packet of Palazzo crackers topped with the bell pepper tapenade.

Best advice - is that no matter the time of day go out and eat elsewhere.

***** Casino staff lacking *****

I have had several experiences in the Casino at the Palazzo. I play the craps tables.  Sometimes I win a bit, sometimes I lose a bit.  I always enjoy playing.  But in order to enjoy the game the table staff all of them dealers, stick man, box man and even the pit boss has to be paying attention to the game.  The pit bosses and boxmen seemed to be ore interested in conversation about someone who is definitely going to get fired than the games.  One stick man was busy looking at passing girls or staring off into space that when he did pay attention he would push the dice out early resulting in late bets, chaos and missed bets.

The dealers themselves were not paying attention.  Twice my bets were placed incorrectly and paid to another player.  I was short changed $25 on color change.  And the same bet paid out with different payouts twice. 

The topper for the bad casino experience was prior to my check-out from the hotel.  I called the table credit desk to see what comps I had earned.  For the time I spent at the tables and my average bet I would normally get my room comped for one or two nights, cover room service charges, maybe a show.  As it happened the pit bosses on all three of my visits tot he tables were not paying attention.  Less than 1\/4 of my time was recorded and the total of my comp value was not even half of the lousy room service meal.

***** Staff unable to provide customer satisfaction *****

What I found most amazing about this visit was that the first staff person at the Palazzo, from the hotel and casino to ask me if I was having a good time, of if I enjoyed my visit, or if everything was OK was the valet who took my bag for storage upon my exit.  I talked to a pit boss about the lack of time registered, no help.  No offer to get someone who could help.  The front desk person who checked me out, was very nice, but never asked me about my stay.

good bye Palazzo

PS - I may use your valet to get a taxi if I am in the neighborhood.",1,1,0

- The check-in person was super friendly, great service and explained everything very well. Plus. 

- The room wasn't clean. The marble-topped divider separating the sleeping area from the sunken living room was stained with dried alcohol and juices; we could clearly see the rings left by glasses and such. The dresser drawers were covered with dried splashes of juice or ketchup. We called two separate times on two separate days to get all this cleaned up. It didn't get cleaned up.  Double minus.

- The bathroom toilet area smelled like stale urine, much like a public restroom that was simply wiped up but not sanitized. The stench was strong enough where I actually preferred to use the bathrooms in the lobby to take care of business.  A lot of minuses because a smelly unsanitized bathroom toilet area is just gross. 

- The check-out person was much less than friendly. In fact, compared to the check-in person, she was incredibly unfriendly and got even more so when I said I'd like to point out several things about our room. To her credit (or to the hotel policy's credit), she refunded the resort fee for the 3 nights we were there. Minus. 

- Beds were ridiculously comfy. Plus. 

In short, everything would've been great had the room been clean. It wasn't, despite our repeated requests. Here's hoping management sees this review and actually does cleanliness quality checks.",6,3,2

To stay at the Palazzo is most enjoyable when my wife & I decide to escape to Vegas. We never had any disappointments and most our requests are always granted with a smile. The casino floor has everything you really need except for the drinks. I found them to be weaker and weaker and you don't see the servers very often so we decided to go to the bar instead especially the Champagne Bar.Play a little machine and get a great drink with the alcohol of you choice.

The Bella suite that my buddies and I stayed in was first-class. Two Samsung flat-screen TV's, one in the living room and one in front of the two queen beds. There's even is a flatscreen TV in the bathroom as well.

And a huge bathroom it is. A glass enclosed shower and Roman bathtub are on the left as you enter. Double sink vanity straight ahead. An armoir and entrance to the toilet room on the right. Curious to see a phone in the toilet room and no switch for air circulation in cases of severe #2's. I'll have to knock off a half star for the need to light matches to compensate for this lack of foresight.

I slept on the L-shaped couch and it's one of the most plush couches I have ever slept on. A bed pulls out of the couch, but I didn't care. The couch on its own was more than comfortable.

There's a fax\/printer\/copier for use as well as wireless high speed internet. These are paid uses of course.

Tons of amenities like shampoos, lotions, conditioners, bathrobes, slippers, etc. Even small individual boxes of chocolates that were given one night during turn-down service. You feel like you're living the good life when you stay at the Palazzo.

My boyfriend and I stayed here for the first time over Memorial Day weekend.  We are frequent visitors to Las Vegas and have stayed almost everywhere (I'm talking 100+ trips).  My check in was a breeze, they had the room I wanted available and it only took a few minutes to get the keys.  (We've stayed at other places [MGM] where we book one room, but by the time we check in they don't have any available - nothing irritates me more!)  

Our room was on the 27th floor and we had an amazing view of TI and the Trump.  The bathroom was spacious and included a vanity area, shower, tub, 2 sinks and a TV.  The sunken living room area had an L-shaped couch, TV and desk\/office area complete with a printer.  The bedroom area had a 2nd TV.  My only complaint about the room was that bed could have been more comfortable, not that it was uncomfortable, but stay at the Trump once and you'll want to sleep in a bed like that every night.

We went to the pool Sunday afternoon and after getting a late start I was sure we would not be able to find chairs.  When we went to go get our towels they asked us if they wanted them to look for 2 chairs for us.   It took them about 15 minutes, but they got us 2 chairs next to each other and away from most other people.  

Hungry, just head to the 2nd floor and take your pick of amazing restaurants.  Table 10 is one of our favorites.  Entertainment, the Zebra lounge had an 80's cover band playing Sunday night and we had a blast listening to them!

The Fitness Center had a great variety of machines- I'm the cardio type so I had my choice of the eliptical, stairmaster, treadmill and stationary bike and they had plenty to accommodate the guests. My husband lifts weights so he was able to get his workout on also without a problem. 

After our workout, I visited their salon to get ready for our evening and they were all so helpful and attentive without seeming aggressive. 

Their valet service was great each day throughout our stay. They were quick to get us in and out of our car. They were also always gracious when bein given a tip, not like most valet persons who expect it. 

All of the employed staff we encountered gave impeccable service and there was not a moment of disappointment during our weekend stay.

I've stayed at the hotel before (7 years ago) and had a pretty good experience. I decided to have my wedding at the Palazzo over the Easter weekend and was hoping that the experience would be just as good, or even better. Boy was I wrong. Once my guests and I were all checked in to our rooms, we noticed that they were pretty much filthy. There was dust everywhere, the floors hadn't been vacuumed, and there were even crumbs and old food under the couch cushions and in the pull-out bed. I had to call for housekeeping to clean so many times that I eventually just switched rooms. The second room wasn't any better, but the upside is that there was no food crumbs in the couch or bed.  In addition to the rooms being filthy, my guests and I sat down for dinner at Aquanox the night before the wedding to have a nice dinner. Sadly, everyone who ordered a dish containing lobster acquired food poisoning. The biggest problem I had was that on the day of my wedding I reserved a bridal suite so that my mother and I could get ready for the wedding and maybe have a few people join us. I was very rudely confronted by individuals who introduced themselves as the Salon Manager (female), and the Sales\/Marketing Manager (male). The two questioned the fact that I had a friend in the room doing my hair and make-up for me. They almost insisted that we leave despite that fact that their staff was informed ahead of time that I would have someone in the suite helping with my hair and makeup. They insisted that their staff would approve no such thing and stated that they would have to ""figure out what to do with me"". Despite the fact that no one ever told me that you could not have someone do your hair and make-up in the suite (and its not listed anywhere on the website or in the brochure), and there is no signed contract for the suite, they were going to attempt to put me out on my wedding day as I was getting dressed. To make matters worse, they proceeded to overcharge me for the bridal suite because there was a ""miscommunication"" between the salon and the sales department. Once I complained to the hotel about all that went on their solution was to give me a $95.00 credit. Big whoopie. I spent several thousands of dollars in that establishment, to be completely disappointed, and get $95.00 back. So much for good customer service. 

The only positive thing I have to say about the weekend is that the Grand Lux Café was amazing. They food was consistently good, the staff was friendly, and they managed the make my wedding reception the highlight of the weekend.

I wasn't a big gambler nor was I there for  business\/convention work. It was just me and my girlfriend before the week before Memorial Day and we wanted to relax.

Entering the main hall of the front of the hotel reminded me of going to a museum or the opera in Europe as check in area was small by comparison and it was very easy. Once we got to our room on the 40th floor, we had a stunning Southeastern view of the Strip and the city and we found the best view was the room itself, which was lavishly appointed with two tv-s and marble fixtures. The sunken living room was also stunning as we hung out at night and watched movies when we were not out at events. 

What told me a lot about the hotel was that there were things missing that other places highlighted in their ways: no cheap buffets, no discount places, no ""value-added"" comps, and no shaggy hordes of people tied to slot machines all night. Omitting those things worked well to ensure one was getting a great venue, just like the sister hotel The Venetian it was attached to and the Encore on the other side. Nothing pretending... it was luxury.

Besides the ornate and decorative style of the place, the people who worked there were very friendly and helpful. I have to make special mention of the Concierge Dept as they really guided us to the best of Las Vegas that the average tourist might miss. They set us up with reservations all over the city and we had a wonderful time.We talked about what we wanted and they made the plan work. It didn't matter to them if the place we visited was in their area or hotel.

We did crazy things like driving Aston Martins at Exotic Racing and learning how the US Marines put pressure on the Taliban with a SAW (Squad Automatic Weapon) at a gun range. Our travels took us to the Encore hotel next door, which was strangely opulent, but a sight to be seen.

Most of the restaurants we loved were in The Palazzo or The Venetian complex, but we also went to Paris as well as to the old-school Stratosphere restaurant over looking the city. Each of the ones I will note are practically must visits, if you stay this hotel:

Thomas Keller's ""Bouchon""-outstanding French restaurant on the Venetian's 10th floor. Go to breakfast there at least once, you will not forget it.
Wolfgang Puck's ""Cut""-steak with innovative dishes and atmosphere.
Morels-European luxury, awesome breakfast.
Grimaldi's Pizza-a real slice of NY style pizza

There were many others that it would take me a month just to visit all of them.

My girlfriend and I also spent a half day in the Canyon Ranch Spa, between The Palazzo and The Venetian, near the end of our stay and I think that was an error. It was so good, we should have been there the first day and everyday afterwards. There are girl's and guy's sections, but we managed to see each other for the couples massage, which was so good to us.

One of the keys to staying at The Palazzo is knowing there is a great Walgreens attached to it with a full craft beer selection, drug store, mixers, sandwiches, and chips, but one has to go out side and around the balcony or corner to find it. We stocked up on supplies to ad to our mini-fridge for the times we spent hanging out watching movies together.

I should note I enjoyed gambling here as I love to play ""Craps"" because the action is fast, the House has only a slight edge, and the rewards can be great, if you stay focused.

I look forward to returning to The Palazzo again in the future as it presented real luxury in a town where surrealism is the soup of the day.",3,2,0

The lobby of the hotel is supurb. An excellent sculpture and fountain sits below a glass domed ceiling (photo included).
There is convenient access from the Venetian from either the Grand Canal shops or by the Blue Man Group theatre box office.
The casino seems to be a bit understated for what I expected from his hotel. 
The entrance to the Palazzo three story shopping area is accented by a one story waterfall.
The Venetian wanted to get the hotel open before the 140,000 delegates of the CES convention showed in the city so there are a few things not quite ready as one might expect.

Here's what happened in the second part of our honeymoon at the Palazzo so you should think carefully before booking in that hotel. If you are paying around $300\/night, you can expect at least a coffee maker at your suite ""as most of respectable hotels would do"" instead of going down and purchase a cup of coffee at the main entrance of the ground floor from coffee beans store. 
Secondly, I found later on a sign ""Attached a photo""in the restroom which mentioned that if you would like your linen to be changed, place the sign on bed..I have never seen at any of the hotels which i go to such a sign to change your linen..never. Unhealthy, unprofessional.
Another thing ""in 3 nights, got one time room cleaned"", when we found that our room wasn't cleaned, I asked the housekeeper on the next day about the reason, she responded that they leave at 5 pm!!

Staying at a world-class property becomes particularly enjoyable in this situation! The Palazzo Resort made this last tradeshow actually enjoyable. Great room, great service, excellent dining and winning in their casinos along with clients is a formula for success. 

I had a wonderful time and the room allowed me to sneak away, get caught up on daily tasks and most-importantly just relax.

Their rooms are huge and the bathrooms are decadent. There's a nice area to work, should you actually need to and there's room in the refrigerator for whatever. 

Service the entire time was wonderful. The Guest Relations Coordinator even sent an email thanking me!

Great stay and I hope I am back soon!",1,0,0

The long of it:
I finally got a chance to relax and see what this hotel is all about. Normally I'm always out and about in Vegas and never truly get to enjoy the hotel and the amenities it has to offer. During my last trip I was able to get a complimentary upgrade to the 49th floor with an amazing view of the strip (especially beautiful at night). The rooms are nice and quite large. Service was really quick on the 49th floor and we didn't have to wait long for extra towels, etc. There's a variety of restaurants to choose from downstairs, my fav is Grand Lux Cafe (same group of restaurants as the Cheesecake factory). The hotel also has a great spa and a variety of pools outside. I also love that they have a Coffee Bean in this hotel right by the guest elevators. Palazzo has a bar\/club\/lounge called LAVO which is free for hotel guests. I think this hotel has really spoiled me and I'd love to keep staying here over and over again.",2,2,2

All rooms are Suites. Comfy beds, 2 flat screen TVs, excellent maid service, in room wi fi is pay but cellular coverage is 4g and full bars for Verizon and T mobile. Overall the regular rooms are better than anywhere else in Vegas (including the Encore).

Restraunts, clubs, and shopping are varied to appeal to all demographics.  Attached to the Venetian via the Canal Shoppes. Lacking a buffet at either hotel is an oddity. That said, having the Walgreens is a great PLUS.

Casino is well laid out at the Palazzo, but the ""traditional"" sport book is over at the Venetian. Casino floor is ringed by restaraunts, bars, cigar shop, Swarovski shop, and the Jersey Boys showroom.

Hotel lobby has an impressive fountain and check in is easy.  VIP lounge if you are snob and don't want to mingle with the common...

Valet service is well laid out with seperate levels for drop off and pickup.

We were asked if we wanted an upgrade to The Palazzo and ended up with a beautiful room on the 49th floor with a view of The Strip.

Wonderful room, very nice restaurants, great pools, outstanding service.

We noticed walking around The Venetian that the clientele seemed much younger and more party-oriented, we were glad to have moved to the sister property.  Both properties are included, so there were plenty of places to eat, shop, and plenty of pools available.

We couldn't have been more pleased and were so happy to have upgraded.

If you enjoy card games, but don't necessarily enjoy sitting at the tables, I'd recommend the mobile gaming here.  $5 minimum and I walked away with a couple hundred dollars from mobile Blackjack.

The only downside.  Being this far down the strip you will have to do a LOT of walking to get anywhere.  Even the nearest monorail stop at Harrah's is a hike, and after a long day and night of being out, it'd be nice to not have to undertake such a trek to get back to your room.",0,0,0

I have stayed at the Venetian and the Venezia many times and can say this place is well designed.  First, there is not a long walk from your car to the casino to the pool or your room.

You just have to get the hang of parking in the right place and the elevator will take you up straight the casino.  Then turn the corner and there are the elevators to your rooms.

It was really easy for our group to get in and out of the hotel.   If you park in levels P2 or lower, there are two elevators.  One leads to the check in lobby.  The other leads to the casino\/rooms.  Guess what, once you check in, park next to ""the other elevator"" and you will be fine.

You don't have the hike like the Venetian\/Venezia.  Which is park in the garage, then take the elevator down to level 3.  If you are in the Venezia, take the express elevator to level 10, then another elevator to your room floor and walk to your room.  If you are in the Venetian, go pass the food court area to your room elevator, then walk to your room.

The Palazzo is a snap once you learn the system.  You walk toward the waterfall in order to get to the Venetian casino.  Pass V Bar and Aquaknox and you are in the Venetian Casino.  If you are on level 2, walk through the canal shops and you will be in the Venetian food court.

There are many non-smoking walkways and also non-smoking gaming areas.  If you are used to a high power shower in the Venezia, the Palazzo may disappoint you.  There is a ""green"" design to this casino.  The shower is designed to save water.  I wouldn't call it low flow but it was half as strong as the one found in the Venezia and my room shower didn't have the middle spray to massage your back.  The AC turns off when you are not in the room and there is a master switch at the door to turn off all the lights.

Since all the rooms are fairly new, they look like the renovated Venetian rooms and have flat panel TVs mounted on the wall.  Service was a bit spotty at times but they are still working out the kinks.

No other hotel has suites for every guest.  The pool is on the 3rd floor and a walkway will connect you the Venetian pools and Tao Beach.  To get to the Venezia pool, you will just have to make your way up to the 10th floor.  There is no easy access from the Palazzo or Venetian pools.

I don't know why there are so many complaints about parking.  It's a snap once you get the hang of it.  I was here for 8 days and got the hang of the parking after day one.  If you park at the Venetian, you will have to hike to your room.  The Palazzo parking lot is on Spring Mountain Road\/Sand Ave.  There is also an entrance on the strip.",3,0,1

The rooms are definitely the biggest you can find in Vegas for the price. If you're going with friends you can even request two queen beds (if you're lucky at no extra charge) and the rooms have a pullout couch in the living area -- that's six people you can fit in a room!

First, let's talk service. From the moment you arrive, you will feel pampered. There is an expediter at check in, quietly ensuring that the process is smooth and pleasant. When you head to the pool, someone is eager to lay your towels out for you, and someone else is handing you ice water, and a third employee is giving you a sliced orange. When your visit is (alas) over, you'll be pleased to know that check-out is a delightful breeze. Is the bill incorrect? The error is fixed instantly, without even a moment's hesitation.

Now, on to the rooms. The bathroom is marble and makes you feel like an Art Deco movie star. The living room area is great for lounging after a long day, featuring a squishy sectional sofa, coffee table and ottoman. When you finally go to bed, after having watched the sunset, you'll sleep deliciously--the bed is comfortable, the pillows are great, and there is no noise whatsoever. None.

The next morning, start your day in one of the multiple pools and hot tubs scattered throughout the landscaped garden. Some are in shade and some are in sun, so--whichever you prefer--you'll be happy. 


The location is slightly more isolated than a mid-Strip hotel, but that's fine. There's plenty to do and good transit access. The Palazzo and the Venetian blend together seamlessly, providing for several hours of entertainment without having to brave the 100 degree heat outside. The Venetian contains a handy-dandy Walgreens, but if you need more, there's a skybridge to the mall across the street and the Deuce stop is right in front of the Palazzo.

Also nifty is that, as a hotel guest, you can skip the line, the bouncer and the cover charge at the attached Venetian's Tao club.",0,0,0

This was my 3rd trip to V\/P in the last 6 weeks and my wife's 2nd. We were excited to do some gaming, reach platinum player status and have some good food. Sadly, the trip didn't go as planned.

The first night of our trip our suite was robbed while my wife was in the unit. From what we can gather is the door didn't close completely behind me when I left for a gaming session. Unluckily for us there was a doorpusher on the floor who came upon our door while my wife was in the bathroom and since I had just left not long before she thought I had just come back to grab something I had forgotten.

The thief proceeded to ransack our belongings until my wife called out my name and then he rushed past my wife out the door with her wallet. She immediately sent me a text and I came up to the room with security who then took a report and started their investigation. We were beside ourselves because her wallet had her passport, green card, drivers license and other incredibility difficult items to replace. The credit cards I immediately canceled and while there was some cash, she at most had about $200.

Security was great with following up with us and making sure we were up to date. We ended up lucking out and her wallet was turned in sans the cash but fortunately her documentation was still there. I'm still in contact with an investigator there as we work through making a report through Metro as they work on apprehending the person responsible, although he hasn't returned my call from 2 weeks ago.

My concerns were with my host. After I arrived at the room and determined exactly what happened I texted my host, he expressed shock and mentioned he'd come up to the room and asked if there was anything else he could do. I told him to call security to make sure they are checking the cameras, which he did. But he never came up to the room. I never saw him in person the entire trip after the robbery occurred.

Outside of me texting him asking how my play for the trip was for the trip I never heard from him. No offers to have our room changed, to send my traumatized wife to the spa (she initially wanted to leave right away, but mentioned we should stay around in case the wallet shows up) and no offers to pick up anymore on the backend (variance was not my friend on the floor this trip and lost a night of gambling due to the robbery so my Theo wasn't as high as my previous trip). I only got an extra $150 on the bankend in F&B because I pushed for it to make up for the cash taken from her wallet.

Now I'm relatively new to gaming so I wasn't entirely sure if robbery was just baked in to my invite offer and it was just a tough luck thing on my side. My wife is still traumatized by the event and is extremely skeptical about going to Vegas again. She now wants to get a concealed weapon permit (she was very anti-gun before) because she doesn't feel safe anymore. We were lucky he ran out after seeing she was in the room, she is barely over 100 lbs and had recently had a surgery a couple weeks prior.

I'm a reasonable guy and believe things happen outside of the Palazzo's control, but the response is something they can entirely control and it fell flat on its face. The last straw came for me when I received the backend charges on my Amex for $400. Despite being undercomped the previous trips and being robbed this trip I had to ask to have even the basics of what was taken comp'd.

You'd think they'd bend over backwards to keep a player who reached platinum in 6 weeks over 3 trips so I sent Andy Grisnik (VP of Player Development and Host Operations) a message about my experience on the 23rd of February. I mentioned I'm willing to give the Palazzo a chance to correct the situation and I understand a series of unfortunate events can occur.

I have yet to hear back from him and so now I'm resorted to writing a negative review which I'm loathe to do, but here I am.

Be careful when you stay at the Palazzo, double check to make sure your room door is shut and locked. A poor design of the door causes a deadbolt to slightly come out if you lift the handle some as you open the door. From what I can tell this is what kept the door for closing behind me completely. Be sure to use your safe for any important documents\/cash. And lastly don't expect the Palazzo to take care of you.  Even after a bad review on another site I get nothing but a canned response, so I'll make sure it is everywhere.",11,3,0

Check-in \/ Bell-service \/ Valet were a breeze on a busier Holiday weekend. The decor and layout of the hotel and casino floor was spacious, never crowded and aesthetically pleasing in many ways with a plethora of bars and restaurants within striking distance between there and the Venetian. A ten minute walk +\/- can get you to the Encore or Paris depending on which way you're aiming for. 

The rooms were very spacious though the best strip view you'll be lucky to come upon would be of TI and Trump Int'l. While the decor of the rooms was nicely appointed and comfortable, we couldn't help ignore the fact that they came without any music connectivity.. No iPod docking station, auxiliary input or music channels on TV which are typically standard at most resorts of this stature and essentials for Vegas-ing the right way. There's also no coffee provided in the rooms so you'll have to either purchase a carafe or run downstairs for a morning jolt. (Tip: take a short walk to the illy Espressamente for an amazing espresso macchiato) Furthermore, we ran into issues with Room Service not showing up after hours of waiting up for them in the late hours. 

The staff all around were very welcoming, friendly and helpful - by far one of the best features. There's only one small pop-up store located near the tower entrance with limited items to purchase; I don't recall it being 24 hours either.

First of all, I was delighted to see only $10 minimums for table games (it was during the day, but still).  Of all the high-end places on the strip, the Palazzo seemed not to jack up the minimums too fast or too early.  (Sure, you can go to Circus Circus and play table games with $2-$3 minimums, but If you want to gamble in a nicer place, I strongly recommend the Palazzo.)  

The staff was totally nice and friendly, even the pit bosses.  The drink service at the table games was the BEST I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED, PERIOD.  (The waitresses were totally hot and scandalously dressed, and were tripping over each other to bring me free microbrews.  It was delightful.)

Also, the bartender at the little elevated bar with video poker machines did an awesome job of keeping players well-lubricated, plus was real friendly.

When I won a ton of money at roulette, the croupier seemed genuinely happy for me and was nice.  I'm not a slots player, but I will say the slots at the Palazzo were the most nice and new and hi-tech looking I'd ever encountered.

ooo la la!  

When you first walk in the registration area is very grandiose.  Beautiful. We checked in around 10 pm on Friday night.  There were just a few people in line so check in was a breeze.    

The two of us stayed in the standard suite with a king bed.  The room was HUGE!  There are a total of 3 flat screen LGs.  This was awesome in itself.  There was one in the bathroom, living room (with DVD player) and bedroom.  

Let's start with the bathroom.  The LG in the bathroom is in an awkward position.  Not easily viewable if you are in the tub.  The bathroom has double sinks, there is a vanity area for my make up and hair gear, separate room for the toilet, glass enclosed shower and double closing doors.

The living room is sunken and very spacious.  It is furnished with a table for 3, a desk equipped with WIFI and printer, and a super comfy sectional velvet sofa.    

The bed was huge and really comfortable.  The room was also equipped with fancy schmancy remote controlled shades.  Opening the curtains from bed is not too shabby!  

There are countless bells and whistles to this room to make a grown man giggle (he did!)  

Unfortunately, there were a MINOR flaws that I noticed (from some ill reviews I had read before I came).  First, the handles on the various night stands, dressers and armoire were broken\/missing.  Not good. Second, there were cigarette burns on the couch cushions.  C'mon guys, keep your friggin butts of the couch.  Third, the elevators made a horrific noise while you were in it (sounds of a struggle going up and down...scary).  And finally, we could not check out via the TV as it was not working.  Boo!

All in all, the hotel was beautiful.  Just the right size.  Not too big, not too small.  There are plenty of table games not to overwhelm you and plenty of slots to give you carpal tunnel.  I even got $30 free slot play and walked away with $70 bucks for free!  Can't beat that.

I  would definitely return given the minor flaws of the hotel.  The mere ease of the location is well worth the stay.

Note:   We were a couple of morons when we left the hotel (tried to beat the traffic).  We drove all the way home and realized that we left our house keys in the room!  I called lost and found around 6pm and got a call at 10pm saying they found our keys and will be happy to fed ex them back to me.  That is awesome customer service.  Thanks Sharon!",2,0,1

It had a king bed, with flat screen tvs, a great view, a huge bathroom and sunken living room (with a sleeper couch).  And the entire floor came smoke-free.  The casino it self was typical, but the staff was friendly and very accommodating.  If you sign up for Club Grazie, you get $15 of bonus gaming credit.  I'm not a real gambler, but it made for a great 3 hours at the penny slots.

They also offer a cheap cab-alternative to the airport.  It was $6 (per person) for a shuttle, which leaves the hotel every 30 minutes on the hour and half hour.  My only complaint is that it's outsourced, so you don't get the same level of customer service as the actually hotel gives.  Our shuttle was about 20 minutes late and when he arrived to pick us up, he ran inside to use the bathroom for about 10 minutes.  We made our flight, but it was still slightly annoying.",0,0,0

I was in HEAVEN.

I'll keep my review short and sweet. 

If you're in Vegas.. and you're a group of 4..you HAVE to stay here. Get the room with 2 king size beds! You get a 5 star experience for a bargain! Errr.. if you're 5 then there's a fold out bed via the couch but the bathroom is ideal for no more than 4 to get ready comfortably.

Of course, if you're less than 4, you definitely should still go here but you probably will have to pay a bit more per preson. Still worth it ;) ;)

Sunken livingroom, a gazillion flat screen TV's throughout (even in the bathroom)

I loved loved loved this place~! Nice and classy, great restaurants in the hotel, spacious and affordable if you split it with a group.. ahhh I love finding deals like this. And, yes.. I said DEAL. You get your money's worth here and then some!

I love this hotel and if I am taking the risk of gambling I would like to risk it where I stay but with the type of people I dealt with this weekend I am very reluctant.

We were impressed by the decor, but we witnessed an unbelievably awful interaction between a cocktail waitress and a patron.
2 African American women were gambling at the automatic blackjack machine with us and a cocktail waitress came around and asked my boyfriend and I if we wanted drinks, but did not ask the women next to us. So, one of the women nicely asked the waitress if they could order another drink too...the waitress looked annoyed and said to them....""Are you guys staying at this hotel?"" The women said yes and why are they even asking that. The waitress said, ""I have to ask."" Which is a LIE!! The women were spending money and whether they were staying there or not has not bearing on the woman bringing them a beverage. The woman pulled out her room card to show her that they were in fact staying at the hotel and the waitress said, ""don't you have any paperwork to go along with that?""  When they asked what paperwork, the waitress asked where the envelope that the key came in was and the receipt for their room was.
I was so shocked and saddened by this whole interaction.  The waitress did not ask anyone else to prove that they were staying there, and even when these women did show their room card, she acted as if she didn't believe they could actually be staying there.  It was so clear to me that this cocktail waitress did not believe that these two women could possibly be staying at the hotel and she was rude, hostile, and unbelievably inappropriate. I wish I would have said something in the moment, but I was so taken aback by what I just saw. As a law student, I was horrified at the way these women were treated and I hope they complained to the manager of the hotel.

We got a nice price on it. Room was well appointed. Even the ""not good view"" room had a VERY nice view of a golf course and the planes coming into the airport.

The pool deck was fabulous. Large and plenty of space. While there were plenty of people, it never seemed crowded. Nice and pretty.

You have to walk to the Venetian (close walk, attached, all inside walking) to find cheaper food to eat. But the flipside of that is: all of the restaurants in the Palazzo were higher end and nice!  

Bonus: there is a Walgreens that is basically attached. Awesome for grabbing an ice chest, some booze and some beers.

The casino floor wasn't the craziest or anything. But you could get around, get a slot machine, etc. Cocktail service was merely average, and they probably need to set a couple more cleaning folks per shift.

Every employee was enoucntered was kind. Even the hard-working, busy cleaning staff would say hello to you as you walked by in the hallway.

I decided to go for the Palazzo over the Venetian b\/c I know they're pretty much the exact same rooms, same prices, but Palazzo is newer and newer is (almost) always better :). 

I like the layout of the Palazzo a lot better than the Venetian (esp from the parking garage to check in to the guest elevators - it all flows very nicely unlike the Venetian where you have to bounce around a lot. Not fun). Although the casino is nothing special at all and a bit boring to be honest. It is MUCH easier to navigate though compared to the Venetian and seems a little less ""busy"" too. I would also say that the Grand Lux Cafe is better at the Palazzo than the Venetian. Also, being a guest of the Palazzo or the Venetian makes no difference in terms of dining and nightlife, so you're considered a ""guest"" no matter where you are in either place, which is nice. 

I will pick Palazzo over the Venetian from now on. The Venetian being connected makes it easy to go from one place to the other and I just appreciate the new-ness and simplicity more.",2,1,1

After 3 hours of playing, I decided to get up after losing $300. I left with a few friends and upon arrival at our location I realized I never got my ID back from the pit boss. I had to pay another cab back to my hotel to get my ID. When I got to the hotel, I asked at the table for my ID. I was told they did not have my ID. I went to security of the Palazzo and they sent me to security of the Venetian. Both told me they did not have my ID and sent me back to the table where I was playing. I went back to my table and was told by the pit boss that she had just started so she didn't know anything. I was told to wait and finally a few minutes later I got my ID back with my card to gamble. The pit boss then told me she would see what she could do for me. Of course she was LYING! The next day I asked to check my card and the pit boss put that I had only played for 12 minutes!

I stayed here because of a 3 day conference for work. I had the whole suite to myself. If I had all the money in the world, I would live here! 
If i came to vacay in LV, i would stay here!

Four stars is because of the food\/meals.
The conference arranged breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The first night was a 3 course meal: salad, entree, dessert. 
The salad was yum. The dinner was a rendition of a filet mignon that was unpleasant for me to digest. My co-worker beg to differ, it settled just fine and would have eaten my other half. Dessert was good.
Second day was a breakfast, snack, lunch.
Breakfast was mostly dry goods--bread group-- with coffee, tea, milk, and juice. Snack was a variety of cookies and chips to spike a quick energy. Lunch was my most disliked meal of the day, we had ""gourmet"" chicken pesto sandwiches. The chicken was really dry and the bread was hard to sink your teeth into. You literally had to eat the thing piece for piece with a fork. If you like pickles, peppers, olives and such...then the sides make up for the ""sand""wich. 
The last day we were given a buffet breakfast...a notch better because we had pancakes, eggs, and bacon. Also a choice of dry goods--cereal and granola with yogurt and milk. Coffee and tea of course. No juices this time. Snacks were around, constituted of a hearty protein, energy booster buffet\/bar--nuts, cookies, tea, water, energy juice. Lunch was a box lunch...nothing to really praise over since it's a grab-and-go meal. 
Aside from that, the servers and event coordinators were very friendly and attentive, they are definitely trained well. 
The same goes for the entire hotel staff; the front desk definitely follow the rules.

Provides the comfort of home away from home boasting 1900+ sq ft of room.

Each room including the living room and bathrooms had its own flat screen. Both bathrooms had their own toilet room and jetted tubs with a separate shower along with double sink vanities.

Let me just say that aside from all the above mentioned luxuries, we were blown away by the mere size of the suite upon entrance. If you're traveling with a group of friends\/family (less than 7), it makes the stay so much more comfortable when no one needs to sacrifice a night on the floor.

I went online and researched several hotel options finally settling on a ""suite"" package at The Palazzo. With the package were were allotted a room credit for use with the mini bar or movies, discounts at certain restaurants & stores, and 2 for 1 drink certificates for some of the hotel bars. 
I was met at the hotel by my best friend, who had flown in from Chicago for our celebratory weekend. We checked in at noon (bonus that our room was ready before normal check-in hours) and were ushered 21 floors up to our suite - it did not disappoint. The bathroom was luxurious and spacious enough for 3 ladies to share for 3 days. (another friend flew in from Philly later that evening) The beds and linens were plush and comfortable. The sunken sitting area\/living room was great extra space to spread out and enjoy cocktails. And the view was amazing! We looked onto the pool as well as the strip with views of Trump Tower, Treasure Island and Fashion Show. 
Within The Palazzo you'll find plenty to do. From restaurants (Dos Caminos, Tao and Sushi Samba) to bars\/nightclubs (Lavo, Tao Nightclub, V Bar, Laguna Champagne Bar) the casino, and the Shoppes at the Palazzo there is plenty to entertain you and you literally don't even have to leave the hotel. Even nicer, is the fact you can access The Venetian as well as Encore and Wynn quite easily since they are all linked by pedestrian bridges. 
For a girls weekend, birthday or any other event where Vegas calls, I would highly recommend checking out The Palazzo. Even better if you can score a deal during off season, like I did. Waking up in a comfortable, luxurious room, is well worth the hangover you're likely to incur during your visit! Viva Las Vegas!",0,0,0

So that morning I went on hotels tonight to see what hotel was the most inexpensive.
For some unknown reason the Palazzo and the Venetian were both $210 ($250 with taxes and fees), which is cheaper than almost every other hotel on the strip. I was both confused and excited by this finding. 

So my boyfriend and I drive over to the hotel at about 11am, crossing our fingers we can check in early. The line at the desk moved quickly and he man at the counter was so pleasant and helpful. He got us a room with two queen beds on a non smoking floor no problem. 

My first reaction when walking into the room was ""this can't be right."" The rooms have SO MUCH SPACE and SO MUCH CLASS. Everything about it was beautiful and inviting. The room comfortably slept six people. 

We had to call for extra pillows and blankets and they were delivered to our room within 6 minutes, and we were on the 40th floor. I'm still confused about how they pulled that off. 

The pool could be my favorite part. They let you bring alcohol in! Unlike so many other pools in Vegas. We got down to the pool around 3pm and had no problem finding chairs (which are the nice cushioned lounges btw) for everyone in our group. The beer at the pool was $7.50\/bottle which is significantly less than the $11\/bottle beer at the Mirage pool (also the chairs and service there were terrible).

There is also a Walgreens in the hotel which is soooo convenient. I really can't imagine staying anywhere else in Vegas! I'm hooked for life.",4,1,2

Everything about my stay in their luxury suite was amazing, and I can't wait to come back. Their front desk employee, Joshua was extremely nice and accommodating. He gave us a room on the 49th floor of the Palazzo, note there are 50 floors in the Palazzo and the 50th floor is penthouses. The view from the 49th was incredible.

Our room was a standard king bed suite. However, there was nothing standard about the suite. It was huge! The bathroom was giant and featured a separate tub and stone shower. There was also a separate living room area with a sectional couch with pullout bed. Everything thing about the room was modern without being cold. It was very inviting.

We have not stayed at the Venetian or the Wynn before, so I am not sure how it compares to them.  We booked the Palazzo through Priceline and only paid $140 per night when rooms were retailing on the Palazzo's website for $350 per night.

Check-in was incredibly smooth...we checked in a little after 3 and it took less than 10 minutes from the time we parked the car until we had a room key.  The room was incredibly spacious....the only negative was our view. We were on the back and had a rather unpleasant view of alleyways and service entrances for the different surrounding businesses and hotels.  Checkout went very smoothly as well, and the morning we were leaving, we arranged for late checkout which was not a problem at all.

The casino at the Palazzo is small and pretty basic, so it wouldn't warrant a stop unless you were staying there.  It's nice that it is connected to the Venetian, and there is elevator access to the Canal Shops and the Canyon Ranch spa.  My huge negative about the Palazzo is it was impossible to get a taxi on Saturday night a little before 6 pm.  In fact, we had to get a towncar because the taxi line moved incredibly slow and I think for 10 minutes, I did not see one cab pull up.  We had to spend more money than we wanted for towncar service, but it was necessary to make sure we weren't super late to dinner.  I would recommend that if you need a taxi, just walk over to the Venetian because your luck will probably be better there.

UPDATE (6\/3\/08):
I was in Vegas this past weekend with some girlfriends and we booked the Palazzo via Priceline for $207\/night.  Again, a very nice experience especially as we were able to get early check-in.  Upon arriving, we decided to check out the pool. Blah. Bad idea. It took us almost 45 minutes to finally get a cocktail waitress to come over despite asking five different employees to send one over. I understand it's a big area, but we never even saw a waitress walk around until she finally came over. Once we got her over to us once, she was good about checking on us continually.  There is a little cafe outside of the pool area where you can order food to go, but I did not find the menu very impressive at all. I think if you have a cabana, you must have a different menu (I think the same one as Tao Beach).  Personally I would skip the Palazzo pool and just head over to the Venetian for Tao Beach.",1,0,1

We situated ourselves in a relatively grande suite. The main living area is spacious and is large enough to sleep a huge party of girls. The comfy couches serve as beds while the staff offers rollaways just in case your girls aren't intoxicated enough to knock out on the floor. 

We even had a lil gym room that sported an elliptical machine. It served itself as a glorified towel rack. 

At one point, we had three blowdryers going which in turn ended up shorting the circuits, rendering all our hair gadgets  useless. Sigh. Luckily, the other room which was attached to our suite had functioning outlets. 

Anyway, the room deco struck me odd. I'm not quite sure how to explain it, but it didn't hold as much of a modern value as I would have liked. I did, however, really love the bathroom. It may have been the best part of the suite

My family and I were escaping hurricane Irma (we live in southeast Florida) and trusted that the palazzo would take care of us. I was traveling with my wife, 3 year old and two month old. Our flight to Vegas was cancelled, resulting in us missing the first night of our stay. The palazzo could not have cared less and refused to refund us for the night in spite of us calling ahead to let them know we weren't going to make it so they could reallocate the room. I called Expedia (through whom we booked the package) and they were also told by the palazzo that we were out of luck. Expedia felt so bad for us that they gave us a $50 credit out of their pocket as an apology for the palazzo's unwillingness to help us. American airlines handled the flight situation with class, rebooking us on a flight first thing the next morning with no questions asked. Then, to compound things, our jet blue flight home was cancelled on Tuesday and the palazzo was unable (or unwilling) to accommodate us for the three extra nights we needed to stay in Vegas. Again, the airline took care of us by getting us rebooked on the next available flight. I recognize that the palazzo did not ""have"" to do anything but it sure would have been nice if they had given us a break. With all of the options of places to stay in Vegas I can assure you that the palazzo is no longer on that list.",0,2,0

A few observations about the Palazzo that made me kind of regret my choice:

1. The elevators took FOREVER to arrive, whether we were on the first floor or the seventh.
2. Room service took forever.

However, in the Palazzo's defense, we placed our order right before we started getting ready to go out.  I wanted some finger food on the coffee table so we could munch while we were preparing for a big night of debauchery.  They told me it would take 1.5 hours for a $210 order.  I asked them to expedite it please.  They brought it up a half hour later.  Perfect timing, the first person had just finished in the shower.

As for the elevators, a very knowledgeable valet asked me how my stay compared to the my stays at the Venetian.  I hesitated, and he jumped on that.  Tell me, he probed.  So I told him how annoying the elevators were, how they took FOREVER, and how, on Sunday morning at 10:45am, right before checkout, getting an elevator to the 7th floor that we or even one of us could fit into, was impossible, so we climbed the 7 flights of stairs down.  I understand it was right before check-out on a Sunday morning, but I never encountered such an annoyance staying in the Venetian. 

And let's just say that the hotel probably hadn't anticipated on guests' eyes being laid on the stairs-- dirty, no signs, kind of creepy, etc.  Even a room service guy when we poked our head in on the 4th floor offered the freight elevator for our usage, but of course, we thought, hey, it's been 3 flights; now we're on an adventure! 

The valet informed me that they were trying a new ""program,"" to which I responded that they should stick with the Venetian's elevator system, because it's fast with no remarkable problems that I could recall.  He said the Venetian was trying the same program on their elevators.  I wonder how that's working out.  

Parking is also a little weird, but it's our own fault.  We didn't know where the Palazzo self-parking was, so we parked in the Venetian self-parking which is a hike.  Then, when it was time to request bell service to get our luggage down, he brought it out to the Palazzo drive, so my friend had to go get his car from the Venetian, drive it around the entire place, and somehow end up in the Palazzo portico.  A fiasco, but not at the fault of the Palazzo.

What I would change?  Faster room service (or maybe just note of recommendation as to when they are busiest) and faster elevators!

This all being said, I'm staying at the Palazzo again in 2 weeks.  Parking's been solved, room service expedited works, and if the Venetian is having the same problem with their elevators, I'll save myself the extra $20 to put toward a bar tab.",0,0,0

However, this last trip, I took my entire family (3 kids- 9,8,4y\/o) and wanted to find the right hotel\/casino.  After this trip, my conclusion is that the Palazzo is the perfect hotel for families.  
Hotel:  This is one of the newer hotel being only 7-8 years old. It doesn't look run down and still has the new hotel vibe working.  The place is clean and bright.  It is located in an ideal location, connected to Venetian, across the street (short walk) to Mirage and Wynn, and the Fashion Mall.  The Casino is on the smaller size but makes for a shorter walk.  I love the fact that from valet, you are in your room in about 5 mins. I love that there is only 1 set of elevators to take you to your room.  I never waited longer than 15 seconds for an elevator.  Lots of restaurants to choose from too.
Rooms:  Very nice and spacious.  If you get the Bella room (2 queen beds) you will have plenty of space for your family.  There are plenty of lighting in the room.  I like that the blinds are controlled by a remote control.  The only thing is that you cannot utilize the fridge in the room due to the mini bar being controlled by sensors.  The bathroom is large.  I just wished there were more outlets and plugs for the new lightening charger. Our room was 10-818 and a short walk to the elevators. Wifi was included in the resort fee ($28) and was pretty decent.  Speed was good but you would loose connection once you went to the lobby.
Service:  Overall very good.  We utilized housekeeping a few times and they responded quite fast.  Bellman were very friendly and also responded pretty fast.  The only thing that was a tad slow was valet.  They wouldn't let you call down to have your car brought out front (they would put it on the ""priority"" list).  So we would wait up to 15 mins for our car.  
Amenities:  They seem to have a very nice pool area even though we did not utilize it.  Ample shops and restaurants to eat at.  No kids arcade or hang out though.  Great shows.  My biggest compliment is their workout facility.  Lots of equipment and free weights.  Even yoga and other fitness classes to choose from.  Only negative is that it closers at 8pm.  
Value:  IT was great cuz my rooms were comped.

I was given the key and instructions that I would receive a phone call with my room number as soon as it was ready and the key would be programmed so I wouldn't have to come back to the front desk. How awesome is that!?

Within 30 minutes, I got a call, as promised. The room was phenomenal! It was spotless and I even got lucky with a room on the Strip-side...BONUS!

One item I'd like to make note of is the concierge. I rarely use concierge services but as we were in Vegas for business (a convention) we were happy to use their services. My boss used them to book reservations for dinners with clients and they were even able to get a table for us an hour before we were expected to be at a lunch meeting - oops for procrastination but they saved the day!

I stayed there for two nights, and it started off horrible.  We went through the Club members line and it takes forever.  I think the regular line was going faster than us.  The desk wasn't too friendly and it was rather obvious they didn't like to be there.  We had to wait about 2 hours for our room, and then when we finally got our room, it took them 30 minutes to delivered the wrong luggage. Then another hour to find the right one to get to us. I was tired from my almost 6 hour flight.  Needless to say, I was unhappy with the overall service.  No one really smiles or seems happy to be there.  At least pretend!

The room is nice though because its really new.  But at a place like this, I expected much better in service.  

What I do recommend is that everyone get a Club card from Venetian because they do give a lot of promotions compared to other hotels.  I much preferred the Wynn and Bellagio and even the Palm Place over the Palazzo.  For some reason, I just never really got attached to the Venetian or the Palazzo.  There's no spark, no pleasant suprises, it's just a nice hotel with regular service, nothing memorable, and that's pretty bad, because everything in Vegas should be memorable to those who visit, and they don't go above and beyond to make it that way.",0,0,0

We were comp'ed rooms from when we had played on a previous trip. From check in to baggage service we had all the same experience as the Wynn, if not better. We had a standard room, which they refer to as a suite. The room was much larger than the rooms at the Wynn. I would give them a 10 on size, compared to the Wynn at a 7. In terms of quality the Wynn still prevails (9) but Palazzo (8) is close. 

The bed, which is very important to me, was high quality and met the Wynn head on. I couldn't tell the difference between the two. 

The location is great. Between the shopping at the Wynn, Palazzo and Venetian you have everything you want. On top of that their are many top notch restaurants within walking distance. One of my favorites is still Alex at the Wynn. 

One con for me was I found the Palazzo and Venetian more crowded than the Wynn which at times was annoying.

I spoke with the hotel manager and explained what happened. She apologized profusely for it and told me to bring my receipt for it and she would compensate for the necklace so I could re-purchase.

We upgraded to a Hospitality package and it was worth every penny.  A charming continental breakfast each morning.   Whore D'erves (it prounces right, I just can't spell it right) each evening.  The staff was professional and charming.  The Hospitality Room on the Concierge Floor was filled with big chairs, big couches, plenty of tables.  We sat back and enjoyed the view of the Strip.

If I need to point out anything, it's a hotel that doesn't have a poker room. But no worries, the Venetian has covered off on that.

Being from Orange County, Vegas is just a 4 hour drive so I have the opportunity to visit frequently. For this reason I consider myself a Vegas PRO ( This time, we chose to spend 3 nights at the lovely Palazzo, the little bitch sister of the Venetian, in the beginning of June, the off season.The crowds at night roam the hotels like cattle roaming dumbfounded through a farm. I like to avoid these people as much as possible!!! Thats why I like staying at the lil bitch sister resorts (palazzo, aria towers, encore, ect) this side of the strip in general is way less crowded in general regardless of where u stay.

I chose to venture off one night and roam the strip like common folk'. I wanted to make it to the Bellagio to see the underwater flower theme, but the furthest I made it was treasure island. I  decided to turn around after the cluster fuck of people gave me a panic attack. I think I would have needed a roofie to prepare me for the shit show of ghetto @$$ people.  The crowd roamed shoulder to shoulder aimlessly like walkers from the walking dead.After the clubs let out, the  walkers followed the large mob of people we were all in. These walkers were looking for late night munchies and trouble. girl walkers had no shoes, hair fucked up, their mascara was smudged. Some sluts had been crying from picking fights  while prowling guys swooped in on them for a horny midnight meal. guy walkers were convinced the louder they yelled the longer their dicks grew.

Over all I decided to turn around and head baack to my luxurious haven- The Palazzo.It was nice to feel like  a queen and return to the sanctuary of my room- I wonder if those poppers ever made it back to their quarters? Or what about the barefoot girls? eeeeeeehhuuuuewww",2,10,1

I have stayed at nine other Vegas properties (including Bellagio, Delano\/Mandalay Bay, and many others) and Palazzo is the cream of the crop.

I have always had success checking in before 3PM (which is great after a five hour flight) and always treated like royalty by the site staff.  Everything from the casino floor to the dining options to the pool and finally the beautiful and LARGE room make the Palazzo my absolute favorite Vegas property.  

Starting with the location on the strip, it is in one of the most prime locations.  Next to the Wynn, across from Mirage and Caesars, and connected to the Venetian for many options to dine and play.  Often, you can find very reasonable rates to stay and since every room is a suite with a full living area + bedroom, I think you get more bang for your buck than many of the other ""premium"" resorts on the strip.

Onto the room... what a room.  Great views of the strip, large space if you are spending time in the room, his and hers sinks in the bathroom, and very clean and well maintained.  The bed is absolutely comfortable and when you are going back for a nap after a long day walking or drinking at the pool, it is just what the doctor ordered.  The sheets are very comfortable and ditto the bath towels. The view of the Mirage and Venetian are great, especially at night.

The casino itself has a lot of variety and although you feel like can get lost there, after a day you start to know your way around.  One great thing is it shares an indoor walkway to the Venetian, so more variety is a five minute walk away.  The casino bars are nice and if you want to just have a casual drink, perfect for an hour stop over.

The Shoppes at Venetian\/Palazzo provide you with an outlet to shop and are nice to just walk around and people watch. Many dining options are available in this area, as well as around the hotel.

One of my favorite parts of this resort is the pool.  As someone who frequents Vegas typically between May and August, having a large and beautiful pool is a must.  The pool is large, water temperature perfect, and drink\/dining service tremendous.  One good thing is you can use  both the Palazzo and the Venetian's pools, so if one is very crowded you can walk over to the other.

I had walked through the Palazzo on a previous trip to Vegas, before I became the semi hardcore gambler that I now am , and loved it! I thought it was really nice and after seeing the pics and the size of the suites on the net .

We decided to book because we saw the summer suite package with some amenities ( voucher to Dos Caminos, Woo, Lavo, and slot credit) 
Just as a side note, we only used 1 of the vouchers- didn't even use the slot credit because their casino sucks but ill get on to that later. 

When we finally booked the rates came out to be about 345\/night from the 169 we had anticipated because we requested a room on a high floor with a view and didn't really want to leave it to chance. 

We got to the hotel around 12:30pm, checked in and even though there was a huge line our room was ready right away! First impression of the room was like... is this some kind of joke???? some of the things were definitely scuffed and had the price not been so high ( in my opinion) then i wouldn't have cared but in order to make this trip awesome for my boyfriend I didn't complain and immediately warmed up to the room. 

The room itself is HUGE - we had the sectional sofa, coffee table with ottoman, 3 TVs a desk area with printer - internet access for my laptop , The beds were SUPER COMFORTABLE and are far more comfortable then the beds at the WYNN - The room was also well lit, but with the lit bar area we created a really nice ambiance when we just wanted to relax. 

Bathroom had separate shower and bathtub ( We had really nice bubble baths here!! if you don't bring your own, go across the street to bed bath and beyond and get some!) 2 sinks - which is necessary since my BF makes a HUGE MESS when he shaves. 

It also had a really cute and comfortable vanity for makeup. 

Only downside of staying here is that the casino is small , has high minimums even though its freaking empty and frankly, for about 3 minutes i can hop over to the venetian casino which is much better. 

And also good for me , we were close to the Encore which is where I left my bankroll =) 

OH!!!! I almost forgot - we had friends staying at the Wynn (THANKFULLY) cause their pool is 100000 times better then Palazzo - I took one look at the pool area and walked out - there were so many people in such small areas that they looked like ants and the chairs had no cushions -( I'm spoiled, lol )",1,1,1

It was full of fabulous sights, fabulous shows, fabulous people, fabulous food, and fabulous memories. And the Palazzo - brought much of this fabulousness to our virgin Vegas eyes with their....

Amaz-abulous prices. I believe we got a special deal since the Palazzo is new - but for $185 total before tax  (imagine that split four ways!) a night, it accommodated the three Miss Yelps and our lovely guest - Kirk very comfortably.

It was conveniently located near the fabulous Wynn and Bellagio for easy giganticous buffet access.

There were lovel-abulous oppulent high lobby ceilings and fresh scents (a mixture of laundry and a clean musk) which circulate around the fabulous space. (the Casino may be an exception)

We adored the phenom-abulous concierge Angie, who was patient, helpful, and on-point with dinner recommendations (Okada was great!).

We couldn't get enough of the sweet-abulous door guys who remembered our face as we came and went and made us feel like we were coming back ""home"" - after a long night of fabulous partying.

We couldn't stop raving about the spacious swank rooms with three fabulous flat screens (there's even one in the bathroom!), two big queen plush beds, a living room area complete with decadent chaisses for scandalous photo-ops, soft thick cotton robes, a plethora of closet and drawer space, a killer bathroom with great makeup lighting, fresh scented toiletries, a big tub to soak worn feet, and a separate toilet area within the bathroom - made for group living.

Big props to our friendl-abulous black jack dealer that gave us the low-down on Jay-Z and Karaoke spots, while he dealt us (ie: Connie) winning hands.

Who can forget the fun-abulous low-key crowd of hotel patrons here, who could care less and even celebrated my Las Vegas Ugg wearing fabulousness.

If you expect 5 star service don't come here. It's way too crowded and you are treated like a sheep from the moment of check in to check out. Doesn't help being an ambassador platinum elite member either here as your still treated like just a number.  It really irks me that after paying $450 a night you are still expected to fork out an additional $50 just to use the steam and sauna facilities.  

Don't like at checkin that you are expected to drag your luggage right thru the middle of a smoke infested casino as I didn't see a single bell boy when I arrived. (Guest room access is arranged so that you must walk thru their casino)

Pool area is great but again overcrowded and you'll battle to find a single deck chair if you don't get there before 11am.

In summary given the poor service and overcrowding I have not rated this place very high. I get the feeling though this would be typical of all the major Las Vegas resorts.",2,0,0

We booked 3 days significantly discounted off Priceline express deals. We got here expecting their most basic room, but we got a luxury king suite (which is basically a mini apartment) which they upgraded to a strip view for my birthday, and were able to check in HOURS early.
We have been treated so well and helped out so much!
The room has a separate tub (with a TV) separate vanity, double sinks, a living room with a desk, dining table and couch with a TV, a bed with a third TV, and a safe in the closet to lock away valuables.
The hotel has so many pools, and you also have access to the Venetian pools.
Free self parking with spots always available.
Free wifi using name and suite number 
Right on the strip, access to just about anything.

We walked through a hallway that turned into a really cool atrium that had real, full grown trees that were all lit up with lights and there were flowers everywhere.

You will feel so special to be part of this beautiful hotel and room. Overall this is a beautiful place for a special day...whether it be romantic or crazy filled.  I can stay here all week and cure my aching back on the awesome bed. But of course the price will kick me out after 3 nights.  

I enjoy the shower, especially the double adjustable faucets (picture shown) that serves as awesome ""masseuse"" in case you cannot bribe someone to do it for free.  I happily turn into a relaxed prune in the shower. Too bad i have to stand up to enjoy it rather than lie down.

The two things I don't like about the room is 

1) the overhead lights over the bed. It is so bright! I think they should have adjusted it in such a way it does not shine right down onto your head and burn a hole in it when it is on.  

2) housing for remote control for the blinds should be placed next to the bed. Preferable like light switches close to each side of bed. It was cumbersome to have to walk to get the remote. If it was 2 or more of us, only one will control the blinds and you keep hoping, ""don't open it yet!""
 
The ameneties are wonderful in the room, all toucheable and edible for a crazy bad price....but still looks good to have them around. Don't remove anything, even to look at the expiration date, because you will be charged a fee even for removing it from the sensored case. Watch your bill carefully b\/f u check out. You may have to dispute if you have not consumed anything.  Careful, don't even accidentally knock the nuts of its base!

Even crappy hotels these days have fridges that you can actually use and put water in.

I am a tough critic so rarely do I ever give 5 stars.

This gorgous hotel exceeded my expectations by far! Outstanding service and plush rooms. I feel sorry for those who had to deal with bed bugs because they didn't ge to experience the true elegant essence of the Palazzo.

It was my 5-year anniversary with my man so we only expected the best. Indeed, we received a free top-notch upgrade on to the 48th floor with the view of the strip, and complimentary chocolate from housekeeping. Each room has a TV: the living space, bedroom, and even the bathroom. For the ladies the large restroom has a vanity space. For those who have to go #2, there's a separate room with a toilet. Furthermore, a separate shower and bath tub.

This hotel is the epitome of excess and elegance. You will not regret staying here. I was so sad to leave but cannot wait to return.

Tips: 

1) Beware of the $1 connection fee to use the phone. Local and toll free numbers get charged too.

2)  To get filtered water for free, fill up the ice bucket with ice from the ice machine and allow to melt. You are left with crisp, ice-cold filtered water.  If you don't want to wait for ice to melt, just play the slot machines and ask the cocktail waitress for bottled water (it's free)...or free alcohol..hehe!!!

3) Make sure to pack bottled water in your luggage before heading to Vegas. You will need plenty of water to stay hydrated and save $$. Bottled water can cost up to $6.

4) Low-priced buffet (The Buffet) across the street at Treasure Island about $20\/person includes:

Unlimited champagne during Sunday Brunch.
Saute station where cooks make fresh food. They don't make it until you order it.
Generous variety of desserts
Eclectic ethnic buffet stations (i.e. Southern cuisine, Chinese, eggs benedict)",7,1,5

Also there is a nice selection of restaurants throughout the hotel. It is located in a relatively central spot on the strip right near the all the action!

 - Swanky room--well maintained, clean, comfortable, great lighting, good bathroom set-up 
- Restaurants galore downstairs w\/out the need to grab a taxi

\/\/\/CONS\/\/\/
- Highly Questionable service
As a professional having had several years in advertising and now user experience--as an experience, Palazzo does NOT pay off on it's own brand promise--nor what they actually market.
        + No one greeted us when we stepped out of the Taxi.
        + No one offered to help us with our bags--even though two door man yapped with each other and checked out other ladies. They completely ignored us. 
        + After check-in--and waiting 15 minutes to have a porter help up with bags to the room--we took off (we had a 10:45 dinner reservation and needed at lead 30 minutes to get refreshed\/changed)
        + Overall don't expect any kind of special treatment anywhere--most greeters, hosts, etc will barely acknowledge you, kind of nod--that's if they aren't rolling their eyes\/bored to death sort of expression. This was everywhere with the exception of our actual servers at Lavo, Azure and the little restaurant\/coffee shop near the main pool.
        + We called a porter to check our bags Sunday to enjoy the pool (which didn't happen, see my note below)--after being told there were NO Late checkouts available (we'd asked for 1pm--and  noon--both denied). So we had to rush to get packed\/ready by 11--only to have to wait 45 minutes for a porter. Hello, why didn't they just allow a late check-out? And we had to call to find out where they were. 

- The room
        + Be prepared to get hella smokey walking to your room--as you need to walk through the smoke filled game room (in the morning it smells like opening a bar from my college bar tending days in Philly)
        + For the room price one would expect a far superior hair dryer and products. Come on who wants to check bags for an hour flight--and a 2 nighter in Vegas? This is a baseline user need--and really surprised on both accounts.
        + If you forget something like say toothpaste, expect to pay $10 for a 4 oz tube that airport security makes you throw out bc it is over 3 oz. 
- The pool
        + ON Sunday ALL of the pools (YES, ALL 7) were ""closed indefinitely"" for maintenance--including Azure! No information on reopening--and some lame excuse about their filtration system. What? That said, vomit\/bathroom mistakes do not equate to ALL pools being closed (we've experienced this at St. Regis where ""the"" pool where the incident occurs get's closed--with a ETA on opening)--thus we wondered: did someone drown\/get killed? Or did someone tamper with the water (like did we need to get tested somewhere)? No info--and no discount. They did offer a 3 min walk to the Venetian to use their horribly small, hip-hop scene of a pool. With NO chairs available. But here is the issue--IF WE WANTED TO GO TO THE POOL AT THE VENETIAN WE WOULD HAVE STAYED AT THE VENETIAN. WE CHOSE PALAZZO TO GO TO THE PALAZZO POOLS.

- Bring your own soap\/lotion. I know, a complete pain if you don't want to check luggage--but the white labeled products are terrible for the room price--and a ""luxury"" advertised hotel.
- Don't expect amazing service
- Don't expect special treatment as a hotel guest at any restaurant\/pool
- Don't expect a late check out (as I think we've had at every other single ""World Class"" hotel all over the world)--and then expect them to make you wait if you desire a porter to help with bags\/check them if your flights is later in the day.


\/\/\/NO COMMENT\/\/\/
- In room TV, entertainment, etc...--we brought our iPad for Sirus & Pandora--but you do have 3 TV's. So if you like them--they are there.
- In room bar\/foods--only purchased the peanut m&m's--typical $9 deal, so no surprises there.

HOTEL:
- Rooms are a good value; the pricing is fair and the rooms are quality rooms.
- Hotel is very nice; clean, spacious, and classy

CASINO:
- Good size; enough tables 
- Clean
- Good number or people playing at the tables (some casinos are dead and it sucks to gamble alone)


PARKING:  
decent parking structure.  my overall feel is that it's not terribly easy to find parking here.  I did manage to find parking within 5 minutes but that one spot looked to be the only one open within any reasonable distance so I'm not sure.  The parking spot sizes were definitely spaced correctly so there isn't much worry about people opening their doors into your car.",2,1,1

Check in 

When you first arrive to the hotel entrance you don't feel very welcomed. There is no bellmen that come out to help with bags and to guide with directions. Many of the staff were just standing around not doing anything. The reason why this became annoying was because my group and I had no idea where the Prestige lobby was located. We had to haul our own bags through the main lobby of palazzo then instructed to go straight through the casino and up some eleven stirs to 23 floor. Very confusing the whole thing took us about 30 minutes to figure out. I wish a they had signage or better greater at the taxi drop off. 

Prestige check in

Now the prestige level is where palazzo Does not fail! You get sparking wine with check in, and Great customer service. Access to the prestige lounge(see review on that). The prestige lounge is amazing having made accommodations on the spot  to have my group rooms connected. 

Cons
The pool area was less than impressive! It hardly gets sun light cause of the towers blocking it till 3 pm. Great for summer weather but not for spring. The spa area really needed to be cleaned, lots of leaves and branches. To be fair there had been high winds but this is a resort so no excuses! The spa itself was not hot, and it needed maintained having some of the accent tiles come off. Palazzo and Venetian are also very hard to navigate around to get anywhere ASAP to the core of the strip (city center). If you are young night life sucks and stay away from TOA that's place is a mess. 


Overall I would stay here again only for prestige level service. If you are looking for crazy fun move over to the core of the strip. Thanks palazzo for a wonderful stay. Hope you fix the pool area before my next stay.",1,0,0

Adelson's answer:  The Palazzo.  I've stayed in all of the nice hotels in Vegas, and had to check out the Palazzo.  But, no dice on this one.

I like the Venetian.  I find the Venice theme and canals charming.  The Palazzo had no character or theme whatsoever.  If anything the theme would be boring old people.  It reminded me of the Borgata.  But the Borgata doesn't need a theme.  It's in AC-- it just needs to be nice.  The Palazzo was perfectly nice.  The staff was perfectly nice.  There's just nothing here that would make me return to the hotel.

The casino floor was boring.  All of the restaurants were empty (perhaps the crowds haven't made it here yet?).  The rooms are identical to the Venetian's, except brand new.  Totally forgettable, unmemorable, and blah.

If you're looking for Vegas at this price point, I'd still stick to the Venetian.",0,1,0

This method felt like a gamble, but hey, this IS Vegas! 

As it turns out, I saved about $50 a night vs. booking it ""known"" through the same travel site. And either way, I was more than satisfied with The Palazzo. 

I've spent a fair bit of time in Vegas, having worked there for a while. I've tried many of the higher end hotels (and some dogs), but after this stay, I will definitely repeat. 

My room had a great view, overlooking the pool, the strip, and TI. 

The suite was plenty spacious -- the sunken living room a nice touch. 

High end accompaniments, including the office space with all-in-one printer were welcomed. 

3 TV's in the room, including one facing the large soaker tub, keep you well entertained during any Vegas ""down time.""

So basically i paid $16.80 for each night for their suite. 

The housekeeper was great. I asked for extra blankets and they quickly sent someone up to deliver it to me. 

what a convenient place to stay.. only a few minutes from the Wynn and Encore (just cross over the bridge and you're there) and Palazzo connects to Venetian... go up the escalator from the atrium and it gets you in front of the shopping area of Venetian... if you're on the 1st floor of palazzo, walk through the pathway and it'll get you to venetian's casino area.

My husband and I stayed here to celebrate our 3 year wedding anniversary during the Dela Hoya vs. Pacquiao fight and we couldn't have been any more satisfied.  

Upon arrival, parking was a breeze.  There were plenty of spaces to park which made it easy for us to navigate to the casino lobby for check in.  We did get a little confused as to where the lobby was in the beginning as it looked like we were in the Venetian hotel for a second, but we just followed the crowd and signs which led us the way...  When checking in, we were offered to take advantage of the concierge free  breakfast, appetizers and cocktails on the 23rd floor for an extra $100 a night and I ended up taking advantage of this offer as it isn't too often that we are in Vegas anyways so why not right?  

After the check in process, we proceeded to our room on the 27th floor.  Our room was all the way at the end which had a view facing directly in front of Treasure Island.  I have no complaints about the room in general as it had the amount of space to breath and relax while enjoying the beautiful view of the strip.  

We also took advantage of the $50 match play which I used on playing roulette for the first time! I was so nervous to play knowing that I've never really dropped as much as $50 on a game win or lose, but I went straight with my gut and put it all on black and I won whoo hoo! I stopped after I got my $100 though because I hate seeing my money go to waste lol...It was a rush I tell ya!  We also won on the slots here so I'd have to say we broke even on our trip!

The concierge lounge was nice and relaxing, but definitely not a place you would see a lot of young cats hanging out in.  We took advantage of all the food they had to offer and not to mention the free cocktails! I made sure to get my moneys worth out of what they had to offer and we weren't let down! While eating, we sat and enjoyed the view which wasn't as great as the view from our own room, but it was still nice. 

Checking out was a breeze as we checked out on the 23rd floor's concierge lobby rather than downstairs or in our own room.  It was fast and easy!  Our stay was definitely well spent here and I'd have to say that we wouldn't mind coming back especially for the deal that we received on our stay! It's location is very convenient being in between the Wynn and the Venetian and sitting across from the Fashion mall and TI.

I actually prefer staying off the strip for better prices and bigger rooms, but being on the strip makes it easier to stay responsibly hydrated with alchy. 

I actually still remember years and years ago when I was a Vegas noob signing up for my Grazie card, the game card for Venetian and Palazzo. The gentleman helping me was so informative and sweet. I remember complimenting the pen I used to fill out my information and he said I can keep it!! Then he gave me two more!! Of course I shared with my friend!! She was thoroughly amused!! 

It's actually funny because I came back here with the same friend recently and now that we are older and employed we got one of their fancy suites. There were 2 queen size bed and a living room like area. There were TVs by the beds, in our pseudo living room and even one in the bathroom! The many mirrors are an extra plus for the girls and I to scatter in our own corners of the room and glam up before clubbing at night. 

If you are looking for a good spot to stay on the strip, I definitely recommend the Palazzo. It is newer than the Venetian so I think it's a bit nicer.

Perry who works in the VIP reception area checked us in and also took the liberty to confirm our dinner reservation for that evening. 

There was a little SNAFU with the room we were given. Housekeeping hadn't cleaned it yet, but Perry took care of that by upgrading us into a dead center strip view room. I love the suites they offer but still cant stand the size weirdness of the beds.

A seriously confusing parking lot. Pretty sure i drove around the same section three times before i started to ignore the signs promising additional parking. Ahh that's why they have guys standing outside in clothes they gotta be oppressively hot in telling people where to go.

Eventually found parking in a secluded part of the back. If it weren't for the lighting i'm sure a number of shady deals could take place but it was well lit.

The sheets were dirty it looked like blood or something, when I called in we waiting quite some time for house keeping.

I am extremely disappointed with the Customer Service and room at the Palazzo. I thought by paying such a high rate for a 2 bdrm suite you would be receiving exceptional customer service but that truly wasn't the case. One day during our stay I had called and asked for more towels. Also the room phone was nto working properly so I had to make the call on speaker. Therefore my girlfriends also witness and agreed on how poorly the hotel's customer service was. The person on the phone was extremely rude about sending us more towels (sounded like she hated her job). I had to ask for an extra pillow and blanket and still recieved some sarcasm in her voice.  In our suite we had a very tiny fridge that we couldn't even use bc it was filled with all the hotel drinks There were other things wrong in our suite but I'm not going to mention all of it. But for the amount money we paid to stay at luxury type suite on the strip I highly recommend you go elsewhere. Don't waste your money at this hotel as their customer service is awful. The Palazzo should seriously review their staff and consider teaching them proprer customer service. Honestly, I've recieved better customer service at a Motel than at the Palazzo. 
My tip would be if you are considering or looking for a suite type hotel room to spend with your friends do not choose Palazzo. You are better off staying at the Delano Suites at Mandalay or Cesar's Palace. Price is about the same but really from experience Palazzo does not care about their guests.",2,0,0

Equipped with a king-size bed and three TVs, my suite had everything available to make my grueling time there as convenient and comfortable as possible. I even had some items dry cleaned and laundered, and it was brought back to me in just 12 hours! It's really a shame that I was so busy and worn out; I didn't even have a chance to sit on the couch until the very last night when I forced myself to allocate five minutes to plop down on the velvety upholstry. I also made it a goal to wear the plushy bathrobes after showering with their nice smelling Agraria bath products. Ahh...luxurious!

I must mention the wakeup calls are FABULOUS for heavy sleepers such as myself. They will call relentlessly until you answer. They sent a security guard to knock on my door a couple of times because I did not answer the wakeup calls (i guess in case I had partied like a rockstar and overdosed in my room). 

Because even the most seemingly perfect things have room for improvement, here's a list of minor kinks that The Palazzo can work on ironing out:

1. It takes a while for the shower water to warm up. This was frustrating for me because I was on a tight time constraint.

2. Although the bed was comfortable, the pillows gave me headaches. 

3. I wanted a cold bottle of water but could not find one in the mini-fridge. I took the room temperature water and put it in the fridge to cool (knowing everything was censored...dumb move on my part). Later I took the bottle out of the fridge to drink, and left the remaining half bottle on the counter. Housekeeping threw away my half-bottle of water, which was annoying. After checking out of the hotel, my folio stated charges for TWO bottles of water (one for the bottle I drank, another for the sensor I touched in the fridge). Although they were apologetic and  took off the charges for one of the bottles when I called in to dispute, it was a hassle that could have easily been avoided had they stocked the fridge with cold bottled water to begin with.

After giving him my driver's license, he asked if the room was possibly under a different name.  I gave two possibilities and he said that none were found in the system--implying we were basically SOL.  Unable to get a hold of my friends, he continued to dilly dally on the computer and found something that remotely looked like my name and indicated that it had been spelled wrong.  At this time, he became much more pleasant and polite.  He decided to tell us about the ""great"" rooms at the Palazzo and how they are the largest on the Strip.  Whatever, you're an ass.  

We were told our bags would be up in about 15 minutes, mind you, it was about 1:00am at this time--there was no rush of people checking in.  It took over an hour for us to get our bags!

They did offer me a $50 credit .  Point being that so many things which should have been noticable were ignored. I agree with Al S.  comment .What else are they not taking care of ? 
Maybe they need a bigger work force. If I went back, I would stay at the Venetian.

- it's one of the less mobbed Strip casino properties.  They have a big conference facility so crowds tend to depend on whether there's a corporate event happening.  Otherwise it tends to be less crowded than places like the Venetian proper, Wynn, Bellagio, Caesars etc probably because Palazzo is set a little apart from the main Strip flow, you have to make the effort to walk back there.  

- free and fast valet.  If you've ever paid $$ to valet (such as Aria and multiple other places) or waited 15+ minutes for your car (which happens at a lot of the busier properties) -- you know what I'm talking about. 

- high end $$ branded shopping in the Palazzo shopping zone -- it's your thing or it isn't.  The Venetian canal shopping has a wider range, and some more touristy shops.   Across the street is Fashion Plaza which has a range of stores. 

- plenty of restaurants and bars, both in the hotel and a short walk nearby \/ in adjacent properties and across the street.  

- the swimming pools area is well designed.  There's a long string of them, from noisy crowded party pools, to quieter pools, some heated, some not, some larger, some smaller, plus multiple hot tubs.  Pool area is one of my favorite things about this property. 

- Canyon Ranch Spa is here, in the pool zone.  As a guest you get free access to the exercise area.   You can use the spa (multiple hot tubs, steam rooms, other water rooms, meditation areas, lounges, etc.) for $40 day pass, or it's complimentary if you get a treatment (as a hotel guest there's often spa credits provided to count towards a treatment).  Their cafe is nice for breakfast or lunch.",3,0,0

Got it for $120 per night on price line for the labor day weekend. It turned out to be their smallest room..the Bella suite. Trust me..this is by no means small.  It had a sunken living room, remote controlled window blinds, 3 lcd Tvs, excellent bed, fantastic bath, shower. The only minor complaint was a non-working tanita body scale.  Darn, I was so looking forward to measuring my body fat.  

The check-in process was quick and efficient. Note that they charge a resort fee which is about 20 bucks a night I think. It however pays for the wifi so it's not so bad.  The staff weren't snooty and pretentious. There is lots of underground free parking but you may have to hunt for that elusive spot at peak times.

Lots of shops and restaurants in the hotel of which the grand lux cafe is outstanding. The Hotel is attached to the Venetian and provides easy access to the canal shoppes , blueman group , phantom of the opera.

The casino is nice with the usual tables and slots. They didn't have a poker room though. The Venetian poker room is only a short walk away.

ROOMS- always perfect, I love the vanity's they have in the bathroom, it make me feel like I am back in Europe and its super fun to get ready for a night out. Some rooms have TV in the the bathroom which is fun if your taking a bath with a glass of something. Comfortable beds, wifi and desks for working.

POOL- I love the pool area, it really has great views and the layout is super peaceful (when there is a lot of people, its not so much).

FOOD- I really like Canyon Ranch Grill, love having breakfast here; food tastes fresh and healthy!

Pricey- so make it a splurge or find discounted rooms.

This is the best hotel and room that I have stayed at in Vegas.  The rooms are just amazing.  Each room can easily sleep 5 people, and possibly 6 people if you have 2 smaller people sleep on the pull out couch.  

Here is a tip, if you have 5 people going, share the same room, if you can.  Do not tell the hotel that you have 5 people, or they will charge you more.  Just make sure you get 2 queen beds.  This also makes the room very affordable if you split the cost between 5 ways.  

The only downside to this hotel is the small sports bookie.  You best bet is to either go to the Venetian to place your bets or collect you winnings at the Venetian.  The lines can get very long since it is small and the Venetian will honor any bets placed at the Palazzo.

Parking is fairly simple and it's a short walk and elevator ride to the front desk from where we parked in their parking garage.  The check-in line was only about 10 minutes long to checkin and the front desk person was very polite and cheerful.   They had plenty of staff checking people in even though it was a weekday.   Our room(more like a suite) was beautiful.   It's probably one of the nicest rooms in all of Vegas.   Huge and just gorgeous.  We did find a little bit of sand on one of the arms of our couch, and there was a little dust on part of the work\/computer desk, but other than that the room was flawless and the bed was very comfortable.  Probably one of our favorite parts about this hotel+casino is that the walk from your room, to the elevator, through the casino, and out to the strip is fairly short.  Most other casinos create a mile-long maze and\/or have a huge setback from the actual strip, but this place is much more convenient.   There were no billing issues during our stay.

We stayed at the Palazzo Suites with a few friends and granted it has an good view\/next to Venetian.. it didn't really compensate for some of the really annoying stuff at the hotel. 

A few redeeming factors were the large bathroom, separate toilet, and cool pool (it was raining the day we went and so had the whole pool to ourselves). 
 
The annoying parts: 
-People smoking in the hallway .. not just cigars, but MJ. 
There's no venting \/ window opening in the hallways so the smell sticks around the walls. UGH. 

-Walls are THIN! When we stayed at the Trump -- they had two entrances separated a distance from one another. I understand why now. Palazzo suites are built in such a way that anyone talking outside the hallway is very audible to anyone in the room. 

-Really difficult to find the elevators -- they're recessed into the back end of the casino. I'm sure that's what they wanted. 

-Furniture is outdated\/ old looking. My friends slept on a sofa bed and it's was really thin. 

I did a quick calculation ... it's about $265\/night in the suites on weekends. While it's not horribly expensive for a group, there are definitely cheaper hotels with better accommodations and cleaner rooms (I think the Trump does $120 on weekend nights).",4,2,3

When the hotel merely changed the room and didn't offer any ""makeups"" (MGM gave me 2 free buffets when something similar happened) I knew it was time to stick to the Palazzo. Well, now it's time to bid adieu to both properties as management has clearly decided that service and cleanliness no longer apply at this property.

While the rooms are less worn than at the Venetian (only because it's newer) and they have the electric shades\/drapes, there's very little else here that makes it worth spending money for, especially when other properties are fighting for our travel dollars. You are charged a $16 nightly resort fee (incl. tax) that gets you unlimited local and 800 calling (have a cell phone so I don't need it), free internet access (could never get past the sign up page ""accept"" button) and access to their Fitness Room. This is only access to the gym and NOT the spa facilities which requires an additional $20 upfee but the gym is large and has everything (it just takes forever to walk there from the Palazzo).

The rooms are spacious and the bed is comfortable but the rooms are not always clean. And the evidence I have to prove that is that during my 2 night stay there recently, housekeeping did not ONCE service my room. Even after making 3 requests and being told that a maid was assigned to my room, I was disappointed to see that when I returned to my room at 10pm that nothing had been done. Discussions with the general manager on site did nothing to rectify the situation, only a weak apology and no effort to compensate, just a promise that I would receive better service the next time (who said there would be a next time). It's obvious that management has cut back on expenses during the recession but cutting back on cleanliness makes me wonder if they're risking more serious consequences (novovirus anyone?) by doing so.

I would NOT recommend this hotel or it's sister property the Venetian to anyone, except my worst enemies (let them get sick, not me!).

In any case, the Palazzo is very nice. It overlooks the Encore pool\/ XS, so it's great that it's super close to those clubs. It's NOT walking distance to Marquee\/Cosmo (well, it is but it's freaking far; do not receommend, especialy in heels).",2,2,2

 The casino-
  Spacious with very tall ceilings, bright, nicely decorated and feels like a high end establishment.  In no way do you feel lost or trapped.  They have all your favorite games but no poker room....yet. It's very easy to navigate with a number of bars within arms reach.  I have always found the service to be stellar in the casino.

The rooms-
  The Palazzo is an all sweet hotel.  The rooms are similar to the Venetian in size and space but the decor is much higher end.  I absolutely love the rooms at the Palazzo.  Certain floors have a more contemporary feel to them than others but you can't go wrong in any suite.  It feels new and fresh (well it is fairly new and fresh)

Dining-
  If you love Japanese food and\/or South American food (Peruvian and Brazilian) and want to try something totally unique I would highly suggest a visit to SUSHISAMBA!  I can't get enough of this restaurant.  The menu is so unique and the creations are so inventive it just puts an eternal smile on my face for the rest of the night.  Look up their reviews on Yelp.  Dos Caminos is a really solid high end Mexican joint on the casino level.  Of course you also have the Grand Lux cafe which is fantastic for casual dining...it's affiliated with the Cheesecake Factory, enough said!  There are plenty of other great places to eat as well....sorry but I just keep going back to SUSHISAMBA.

General-
  The valet is easy and convenient, rarely a wait or a line when dropping off and usually very quick when getting your car.  The Palazzo is attached to the Venetian so it's very easy to utilize everything the Venetian has to offer.

Let's start with the room. I stayed in a suite, but I dunno if there is anything else... Maybe nicer suites? Whatever the case, we got a weeknight rate of $99, which I thought was really good. But then both over the phone and in person when we checked in, they were trying to ""upgrade"" us for only $40. But we were like, ""No thank you! Cheap room please!"" And our view was fine.

The stuff in the suite looked a little worn, which is weird since this place is supposed to be new. I wonder if they moved the worn out furniture from the Venetian so that they could offer it for cheap to people like me.

We ended up going down stairs and playing Craps for the first time. One of the tables had some awesome people working it. We learned, we played, we laughed. Amazing. But, another table had one guy who kept forgetting to give people their money. Ouch.

So in the end, it was a fun time. We tried new games, had some wonderful food, and entertained friends in out suite. But, there are certainly things they could improve upon.

The decor is just amazing, and is immaculately maintained. Every single employee I encountered, from the front desk to poolside, was exceptionally helpful & pleasant. 

Booking nine rooms for my company at a corporate rate was fairly easy. Later, I had to add a couple of rooms, which necessitated a second call to reservations... Both phone reps were very friendly & helpful. In fact, on my second call, I was able to get complimentary late check out for my own room, along with the upper-tier Internet access, because the rep was sympathetic to my planning responsibilities. Definitely outstanding customer service! 

Check-in was fairly easy, especially considering the number of rooms we had. I was able to get everyone checked-in within about 20-30 minutes, which I felt was very reasonable with that many rooms. Because it was very early in the day (around 10:30am), most of our rooms were still being prepared, but the front desk was able to issue keys & then text each guest when their room was ready. The Palazzo also offers complimentary baggage hold service, so we were able to enjoy our wait & walk around unencumbered.

My room was simply stunning! I later discovered I had the highest-floor room of my group, on the 42nd floor, overlooking the pools, Vegas Strip and the mountains to the west. What an incredible view! The window had a wide ledge, and I spent much time there, just gazing out at Las Vegas. And this *standard* room was HUGE! Two queen-size beds in the bedroom area that opened to a sunken sitting area with a corner sofa, TV cabinet and a desk. Unfortunately, I did have to use the desk to finish payroll that week, and found the view a bit distracting! But the desk was an ample size; I had no problems with the Wi-Fi, and it did seem to be very fast. The bathroom was gigantic, with a double sink and a separate vanity table with mirror, plus soaking tub, large glass shower stall, and toilet room. As the organizer in the *extra* room, I ended up with a couple of different roommates throughout my stay, each for a night or two, and then enjoyed the room by myself on the last night. On that final night, I managed to find time to soak in the tub and finish a cocktail. My only *complaint* was that housekeeping assumed all the female toiletries belonged to one person, and they occasionally co-mingled my items with my roommates'. Not a big deal, and we actually found it amusing.

While here for 5 nights, I was able to patronize many restaurants & bars within the Palazzo, as well as the casino, and the adjacent conference center. The variety of dining options is astounding! I dined at several restaurants more than once, and enjoyed consistent food quality & service each time. On my final day, I was delighted to have a few hours to relax by a couple of the pools, and was equally impressed by the cleanliness of this area as well. The Palazzo offers several gorgeous pools on the west side of the building, which of course made sunbathing early in the day difficult. I actually had to find another chaise at the south end of the pool deck just to get a little more sun. But the pools were refreshing & the entire area well-landscaped. Overall, my stay at The Palazzo was incredible, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",7,4,5

That person went on the back to check and disappeared. We literally spent 2 hours there while no one was really helping us. Finally after getting a little crazy someone recognized that we needed to be help. They told us there was a mix up on the reservation but they have it now.

I've certainly overlooked it for years.  It has a lot going for it, and, at least during my stay, was quite a bargain relative to what other and in many cases lesser strip properties were charging.  

Some pros:

It's a luxury property in more or less the same league as its sister all-suite property, the Venetian; Wynn\/Encore; Bellagio; and Mandalay Bay.  

The underground parking is easy to get into and out of and easy to navigate.  It also makes for an easy, off-strip drive to and from the airport.  

The rooms\/suites are generously sized and well appointed.  I would characterize the standard suites as junior suites.  There is a nice sized sunken living area separated from the sleeping area by the step down and a pony wall, but the only separate room is the bathroom.  

My bed was nice, probably not Four Seasons nice, but a definite step up from what I've found in more mid-level strip properties.  

I like the northish strip location for a change of pace.  It's on the east side of strip between the Venetian and Wynn\/Encore with TI being directly across the street on the west side of the strip.  

Tacos El Gordo is walkable from here.

There is lots of high end shopping in the attached attached mall, if you need more ways to spend your dough.

The mattress had divets where you just rolled to the center, it bulged on the sides, not sleepable when jet lag is gone.  They ""upgraded"" us for anniversary, not a real upgrade.

I have stayed at the Venetian previously and really had a great experience, so I had high hopes for the Palazzo. 
Overall we are okay with our stay, but won't stay again and here is the nitty gritty. 

Positive 
New hotel, new rooms, a little used looking but not bad. 
Concierge lounge attendants very friendly and helpful 
Bell staff and limo drivers were awesome 
Lots of restaurants to choose from 
Clean for the most part (for Vegas) 
Quick check in 

Negative 

Very, very smoky on all the floors I went on (even nonsmoking) 

Casino was very smoky with low ceilings and very dark 

Overall the hotel is very dark and the interior design is dark, sorta hauntingly, I didn't like it 

I was not at all impressed by the front desk staff, we even checked in on the concierge floor and found the staff seemed bothered by doing the check ins, took no time to explain our package which led to much confusion, basically they just wanted to check us in and move us along like cattle. 

We also mentioned whe making the reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary and we certainly did not expect an upgrade (we purchased an expensive upgrade already) it would have been nice to hear Happy Anniversary or something, well nothing! This is not the Four Season's. 

We purchased a package and I highly WARN against doing this, it is very..very misleading. We payed an extra 200.00 or so average per night and basically didn't use our ""package"" because they make complex rules for all the coupons and don't bother to print it or explain it. I spent and hour of my vacation in the spa with the attendant calling and trying to find out how my spa ""credits"" worked"". I ended up finding out later that the spa attendant let me use my credit for something he should not have and I got a ""slap on the hand"" so to speak from the front desk who had to remove the charge, WOW, how could I...LOL 

Far!!! From the main part of the strip.

The Girl above review is Clue Less! Stayed 3 days with no problems? Not here both towers no power for 2 hrs and no internet for 15hrs but she gives 5 stars what a bunch if crap! I suggest you call hotel and asked them if all I said is true in the dates provided! You will se it's sucks! 

NO Power Generators! 1hr with out power and counting over 30 floors affected And No emergency lights?.. No Phone calls And lied about how long it will take! 

This is my review for this hotel it has power issue in all floors
I am in my room for a hour with 3,000 guest from our Mike Ferry conference no power in different floors at the palazzo we have suites and all floors lost power!
In the dark typing this, phone are cordless so no luck there except my suite has office with a reg phone so I called front desk they said its weather related sorry not our fault and generator will be up in a few minutes! We'll that was 1 hr ago, called back they said it's will be up shortly! 

***** there is no way that any Generators in any hotel take 1 hr to turn on**** yes I am familiar with them they use gasoline or diesel! So this hotel does not have generators! Or forgot to buy gasoline???

This is the worst experience from dirty rooms to no electricity in all floors I called on my cell phone and 15 of my partners in our conference have been waiting also, hotel says its a power storm they can't control! well it's not raining outside and the generators they can control! So they lied

Do  not come to this hotel who cares about the free comps will get from this Stay it's just not worth it Mike Ferry should choose somewhere else to do business! Because this is not worth sitting at a conference for hours a day to come back to this crap! Stay at the Wynn hotel I can see From my room they have power! So not weather affected 7\/28\/14 I have to be here for 4 more days I don't know what will do now?.... Managers do not know what's to say except. Generator will be up shortly well it's now been 1 hr 10 minutes no power?..


Update been 1hr 30 minutes no power 
Palazzo has no emergency generators or emergency light can't wait for Nevada hotel commission to here of this unsafe issue

No lights means you better watch your step in your room since they are steps and no lights if it wasn't for my ipad or phone you would fall break something on these steps!

My gf and I booked a pretty decent deal for 4 nights in December, 2008.  It is probably the most dead time of year in Vegas, given many of the shows are blacked-out, and we paid $119\/night through the hotel website.  It was supposed to include some gaming credits and a few other small perks too but I didn't really care, the rate was super cheap.
Location is a huge factor in Vegas and the Palazzo location is decent.  It is attached to the Venetian (obviously), and directly across the street from the fashion show mall, the wynn, and Treasure Island.  If you want to take the tram up and down the strip, the nearest access point was a few hotels south (behind Harrah's).
Within the Palazzo\/Venetian complex is the gondola ride and the ""shoppes at the venetian"" as the separate shops of the palazzo.  I don't really want to write about the mall quality, so suffice to say there are lots and lots of stores (many of them very high end) and most of them can be found in the other giant hotel malls on the strip.  There are a ton of restaurants just like the other hotels.   Bar Charlie is really good but most of the swanky hotels have equally swanky restaurants.  IMHO, The Palazzo\/Venetian is beat by MGM, the Wynn and the Bellagio if you want to argue about which hotel has the most\/best restaurants (and I don't want to argue about it).  I'm not sure anyone would pick a hotel based on what restaurants are within.
We didn't check out any of the bars\/lounges in the hotel, although Lavo seemed to be fairly busy with a good looking crowd.  Tao is in the Venetian and fairly popular but we just checked out the lounge there.
The lobby and common areas were very clean and grand and as expected for vegas.  There are lots of fountains and statues and such.  One very annoying feature, at least for me, is the overpowering fragrance that is poured into the lobby and gambling areas of the palazzo and the venetian.  Apparently, a lot of money went in to developing this fragrance and you can probably buy it as a cologne in their gift shop.  I suppose it's meant to cover-up the smell of cigarette smoke.  Whatever.  It is really strong.
The rooms are ""all-suites"" and ours had a sunken living room area at the far end of the room with a nice couch and table.  The view out the window was of the Wynn golf course next door.  The bed was surprisingly disappointing given how new the hotel is.  Maybe we just got unlucky.  The pillows were all way to firm and high for our liking.  They got us some pillows more to our liking upon request.  A comfortable bed is a huge factor for me and I wasn't impressed.  Also, the drawers on the dresser were not on their rollers which was annoying.  A subtle point, yes, but the rollers were not even installed on the dressers.  A small oversight, but it just gives the feel of mass production with lack of attention to detail.
The bathroom was beautiful with separate bath and shower.
We left tips for the cleaning staff ($5\/night) but they didn't do anything special.  I like to take a few shampoos and conditioners because I play hockey and it's nice to have the small little bottles in my hockey bag and the cleaning staff did not replace them even once.  I thought that was kind of funny since I've never had that happen in a hotel before (they ALWAYS give you new ones).  In fact, they didn't even replace the soap after we used it up.  As a result, the ""do not disturb"" sign took up permanent residence on the door handle to let the cleaning staff know ""thanks for nothing.""  It made me feel better.
I can't comment on the pool area or anything because it wasn't open.  I'm sure it's decent.
Lastly, at some point my gf went to ask about the free gaming credits.  It was supposed to be $30 or something.  She even took the printout of the reservation with terms and conditions and such and the front desk refused to honor it.  I thought that was funny because they tried to argue that they were giving us a different deal than the one listed on the printout.  Not a big deal but I just imagine a different scenario where I have to argue with them about something I actually care about and have to deal with their indifference.
Anyway, in summary this hotel is nice and new but there are better places to stay.  I guess for a super cheap rate like we got, I would consider staying there again but I'd rather stay at the Wynn across the street (which I did in February).
Oh and before I finish, what's the deal with people basing their reviews on how they did at the tables???  So lame...",0,0,0

Now I can't stay anywhere else beside the Palazzo when I return.  All my friends and family always raved about the Venetian so I originally had my mind set on the Venetian.  I was going to go there and pay the ridiculous $200+\/per night to experience the luxury myself.  Then last minute before we left on our trip my friend tells me that she got 2 nights at the Palazzo for FREE.  I now get to stay at the newer Venetian property (newest resort on the strip!).  My dream is only getting better and better.

I was speechless when I arrived.  It was as if I walked into heaven.  I had also been so sleep deprived the past couple nights so my initial impression may have been overly dramatic.  All I could think was I want to go to the suite to see if its really as beautiful as the pictures online - YES it is!!  The pictures really do speak for itself.  I'm not sure what else I could say that the pictures cannot.  It was extremely spacious (700 sq ft), marble everything, two 32"" flat screen TVs, a 17"" LCD and vanity\/bench in the bathroom, double sink, separate jacuzzi from shower, and the decor was just perfect.

The pools at the Palazzo were so beautiful too and there was plenty of seating.  Some of the chairs were even IN the water which was nice.  The staff would come around and ask if we would like a cool towel for our face.  Now that is relaxation - I seriously had no care in the world at that moment!  We also checked out Tao Beach Club (at Venetian) since it was connected to the Palazzo.  Wow - Vegas really is the epitome of sin and ecstasy.  Imagine a nightclub but by day, music blasting, cabanas\/beds everywhere, beautiful women in bikinis, men with dynamite bodies, dancing and drinking in the pool.  This was like spring break minus the teeny boppers, only the 21+ crowd were admitted.

The location of the Palazzo was really great too.  You're connected to the Wynn Hotel and Fashion Show Mall.  The Mirage and Treasure Island is also just across the street.  We didn't even need to cab it when we went to eat at the Wynn buffet and later to Tryst (Nightclub at Wynn).  Before we came to the Palazzo, my friends and I were on a losing streak (a few hundreds) so we decided not to gamble again until our last day.  Either it was our lucky day or the Palazzo turned the table around for us because we all started winning - some of us played tables and others played slots but we all doubled up. 

All I can say is that the entire stay was complete bliss.  I could not be more happier with the Palazzo.",11,4,9

Getting to the Palazzo from the shared parking structure is quite a hike, but that's the method other locals have recommended. 

The rooms are all suites, and they have the Rock of Ages show on site, as well as the Grand Canal Shoppes. I do like that the casino floor isn't as cluttered, obnoxious, or smoky as other properties on the Strip. Mid-week staycation rates are decent, but I prefer Caesars.",9,7,6

The first time I stayed in Vegas (for business) it was at the Venetian. The second time I went to Vegas (for fun) we stayed at the Palazzo side. We purchased Bella rooms with an upgraded package that included daily continental breakfast on the concierge level (this was super convenient and the selection was perfect) and daily ""cocktail hour"" which was also a delight! Before heading out to dinner or a show each evening, we stopped by during ""cocktail hour"" to have snacks and beverages. Nice! 

Again, rooms are spotless, the amenities are fantastic and everything about the property is also fab.

We did have a not so perfectly pleasant experience checking in and getting our rooms organized for our group but it seemed like it was just a comedy of errors at the time so I brushed it off. A few others in our party were ticked off and were really irate about it, but I'm not the kind of person to worry about things like this. We are all only human. People make mistakes, including overworked and slammed-during the-busy-season hotel front desk employees. I think the staff does an incredible job considering they have a ton of pressure on them.

The Palazzo and Venetian are linked, with a connecting hallway and a supreme shopping center, the Grand Canal Shoppes, so you know this is going to be a nice place.  Because the Palazzo is at the end of the mid-strip and only close to the Venetian and the Wynn, it doesn't offer nearby walking to other casinos without taking a good hike.  For that reason, I cannot give it an additional star.  But pretty sure if you stay here, you will love it.  My only gripes are that with elite rankings, the table games are on the high side and the rewards program doesn't get you much.  I've gotten free comps at other casinos but never here.

I looked around all or at least most of the places to stay and compared amenities and prices adinfinitum and it was between here and the Wynn\/encore which coincidentally is right next door.

The casino is also really clean - although there was this smell that resembled the smell of a stink bomb that we kept smelling.  Wasn't sure if we were just trippin or not. 

We ate at the cafe\/restaurant there (The Lux....I think)....reminded me of Cheesecake Factory - extensive menu list and so did the ambiance. Very reasonable prices too. 

One thing that sucked, was that we were debating whether or not to play craps before or after lunch.....so we figured they wouldn't raise the minimum ($10) to anything higher within the next hour or so.  BUT THEY DID...raised it to $15 by 3pm.  OH well...",1,0,0

Palazzo is owned by The Venetian. These two are connected. I couldn't really say anything bad regarding the place. Everything is well cleaned. I'm docking one star because room service randomly opened the door when we were there already. She forgot her cleaning spray (some sort of Windex) in the bathroom. That was a pretty weird and awkward encounter.

The rooms are very spacious. We got a Bella Suite. The sofa bed was pretty big. It could fit 3 people. The curtains are remote controllable, which is expected in the 21st century (or just because it's a luxury suite).

My wife and I stayed at the Palazzo with our two children ages 11 and 9.  As frequent Vegas visitors without kids, we usually stay at Wynn or City Center properties, but picked the Palazzo as it has nice large suites and great pools.  The pools were key to our decision since we had kids with us and they loved the hot pools at the Venetian.  Since we were arriving on the 1st of January, a lot of the other hotels had closed their pools so we were very specific when speaking with the Palazzo reservation desk to confirm that the pools were open.  The person we spoke to insisted that not only were all 8 pools open but were heated to a comfortable 82 degrees.  We ended up booking through Southwest Airlines.  Upon arrival, the front desk again reiterated that the pools were open.  Not until we took the elevator down to the Spa were we told that no, only one pool was open out of 8 and this was accessed through a back-of-the-house labyrinth all the way at the Venetian.  My wife called down, sat on hold literally for 25 minutes as she was moved from one lackey to another but was finally connected to somebody in authority.  She calmly pointed out that there were zero pools open at the Palazzo and the 20'x20' pool at the Venetian was hardly the same as what we had been sold.  We were stonewalled and told that since we booked through Southwest Airlines, there was ""...nothing they could do"".  Period.  
So, we called the Wynn, where we could see visitors enjoying the pool, and booked the next two nights of our stay.  Southwest Airlines called the Palazzo and canceled the rest of our reservation.  My wife stays at Vegas several times a year, both with clients attending the Vegas Market events, but also with several girlfriends.  We ended spending lots of money over at the Wynn restaurants and shops due to our new location.  Bottom line, if the Palazzo had simply apologized and maybe offered me half off on my next meal or really given me a drink coupon, we might have stayed.  Any business knows that there will be problems, but it is the truly good businesses that know that fix to the problem is what will keep customers coming back.  Now I am writing a lousy review, telling anybody that asks that the Palazzo and Venetian are terrible and will never stay there again, all due to poor training and one idiot that we spoke to.

The hotel itself is pretty nice. Definitely not as crowded in the casino area as other hotels and has some great options for food close by including Grand Lux Cafe. The air conditioning in the room wasn't quite what I preferred as it took almost all night to finally cool down. 

The major issue occurred upon checking out. I was told that my room had been charged an extra $1100 on top of the original room rates, taxes, and fees. I then was given a print out of all the charges that had been made to my room by way of the refreshment center. My girlfriend and I never touched the refreshment center during our stay since it's absurdly priced. After bringing this to the attention of the front desk, I was told to come back in an hour after they send someone upstairs to the room to conduct an inventory check. Upon returning an hour later I spoke to a manager who then told me it would take an additional 5 or 6 hours since they are ""so busy"" and we need to essentially wait our turn. Our flight was to depart soon and after making the manager aware that I wasn't leaving Vegas nor the hotel until this was resolved he then made a call to send someone to check right away. It was as if he didn't believe us the entire time. He kept questioning us inferring that maybe we just forgot or perhaps that we were just trying to get everything for free. After another 30 minutes or so he walks over and states that we were correct. Either something was wrong with the refreshment center sensors or someone was charging things to our room somehow. In the end he took the $1100 back off of my card, but it was a horrible end to the trip. I had to fight and argue way too much to fix THEIR mistake.",9,0,1

No one brought a laptop, so I can't speak for the internet connection. There was a printer near the desk so I'm sure that would be handy for anyone bringing in a laptop.

Everyone that worked there was very friendly. The layout of the casino is actually pretty confusing, so getting lost wasn't hard..and that's sober. Imagining when you've got some alcohol in you.

Pros

Service: Cosmopolitan, Caesars, and the Venetian was already booked out for NYE, Eric that helped us on 12-30-15 came through with an open suite and made sure our check in was a breeze. Also was impressed how the front desk handled a conflict I had booked from a third party. The overall service from the front desk was professional and kind throughout the entire stay. 

Shopping: Love the fact it's connected to their sister hotel, The Venetian so there was plenty of options especially for high end designers. You can walk through the shopping canal to browse a variety of different stores or eat at one of their high end chef restaurants or get a quick bite at their food court.

Location\/Parking: You're located on the strip, but you're not in the middle of strip where it might be congested with cars, but close enough where you can enjoy all the amenities and the glam of walking on the strip. Parking is free and the parking lot is easily accessible by the freeway. Plenty of parking spaces at the Palazzo, but if it does get packed, then you can go to the Venetian parking lot which is adjacent to the hotel. 

Amenities: Free Wifi (although a bit slow - you can pay for an increase in the download speed), coupon for $25 off one of their restaurants, $15 slot machine or table play credit, and free coffee\/tea at one of their store. 

Rooms: Every room is a suite so you pay for what you get! The rooms are really spacious with a sectional couch and plenty of chairs. You also get a tv in every room (bathroom, bedroom, and their living room). It is exactly what you expect when you book a high end suite. Pay a little extra and you'll get more in return!

Cons

Cleanliness: wasn't too impressed with the overall cleanliness of the hotel. The tables still had food stains from the previous stay and some of the furniture in the living room had a thick layer of dust. 

Ventilation\/Casinos: It feels like you're downloading lung cancer when you walk through their casino. Hopefully they improve their ventilation in the casinos to avoid having to wear a gas mask when trying to reach your room.",15,8,12

Management as well as marketing hosts deserve zero stars. I received two complimentary nights and $300 in slot play. During checkout, as I attempted to close out my bill, I was told that they ""overcompensated"" me based on my play...which was a loss of $3,500.00 if not more. I DID NOT ask for anything additional nor did I expect anything in addition to what we had been offered.  I simply wanted to check out of our room and close my balance as we had dined and shopped. When I expressed my dissatisfaction to management about the casino host's attitude and choice of words, management said that's a term loosely and commonly used in their world. Since when do hotels offer complimentary rooms and DEMAND that you to gamble excessively? Was loosing $3500.00 not enough for the 2 night stay?
Sadly, I offered to pay them. Perhaps the hotel is hurting and needs money or they should consider new management and a complete casino marketing staff overhaul. Thank you Jeremy for returning my call and explaining the term ""Overcompensated"". I am happy that you also encourage your staff to communicate those types of terms with your clients. Regardless of how many misleading marketing mailers and email offers we receive, we will not be returning to Palazzo, Venetian, or any affiliated property.  For the amount of money we spent at that hotel which is well over $5,000.00 for less than 48 hours, we could have gone to Italy.  Maybe Jeremy should spend more time managing the prostitutes in the hotel (more than you can count) rather than managing casino marketing. I'm sure they bring in a lot of incoherent gamblers to the casino.

I first want to explain my circumstance as to why I'm even writing this review. I originally stayed at the Venetian in April for a random trip with the girls. After a long weekend, both my friend and I notice that we had money taken from our wallets. She was missing a 50 dollar bill and I was missing 45 out of my own wallet. Now yes, normally any one can say ""oh you were drunk you probably misplaced it"" but as an avid Vegas goer - I can clearly state that this was my weakest trip I had been on. No drunken stupors were had this weekend. When I had called the security to make the report, not only did i have to talk to several guest services employees but I also had to wait in my room on a Sunday for them to come. When the security guard arrived, he plainly stated to me that no employee of the hotel would have taken it. (First instance of blame the guest). I was promised a call back within 48 hours about their findings. In the end, the check out time took 4 hours. Did I receive a call within 48 hours? No I did not. I then had to take more time out of my day to contact guest services. Luckily I got a hold of Marcus, who by the way was the nicest man, and he could not provide me a report on what may have happened with my missing monies. He then provided me a complimentary upgrade and 1 free night at the Palazzo. I agreed and left the headache right there. 

Several months go by and my sister offers to take me back to Vegas for a graduation trip. To help save money on the room and spend more gambling, I decided to use my certificate for a free night. I called in once and spoke with Theresa in Guest Services and inquired about rates and fees and she indicated to me that it would be best to call back and book with payment so that I can lock in the rates. I waited until payday and called back and booked. All credit card info was provided. Done. 

I get to Vegas this past Friday (9\/27) and they advised me that the room went unpaid and that I owed a balance. Now mind you, I had harassed all my friends for payment. Why would I do that if I was properly told that I could pay when I got there? None of that was mentioned during the 2nd phone call when I provided my CC information. By that point I was upset bc not only was I misinformed but no one could understand why I would be upset and they continued to state that their employees would have told us the proper info (Second instance of placing the blame). Seeing how irate I was, they offered a 25.00 restaurant credit (whoopee). I ended up having to clear out my savings to cover the price of the night. They had advised me to call the guest services manager if I wanted to further complain. I advised them to contact me directly bc I wasn't going to wait in the room for a call when my trip was already off to a bad start. 

I get into our room and the guest services representative Theresa calls me back only to state that I was wrong. (Third instance of blaming) and that I never discussed pricing with her or booking. Why else would I be calling? For fun? (Fourth instance of blaming). I plainly asked her if she was telling me that as a customer, I was wrong and it wasn't her fault. By this point, I didn't want a resolution I wanted to explain why I was unhappy - what I didn't want was to be blamed AGAIN. I hung up and my friend called back bc by that point I was so frustrated I ended up taking back shots to calm myself. She spoke with Theresa manager who said nothing Theresa had said was wrong. (Fifth instance of blame on the customer). We eventually got no where. 

Please keep in mind - at no point was I reaching for more free loot. I was simply trying to explain why I was upset to someone who would listen. 

I have stayed at the Venetian\/Palazzo several time before I was mistreated without issues. Now - I will never stay there again. 

They have no respect for their customers. They will blame you to cover their own behind. And to get any assistance, it's like pulling teeth. 

So if you want to pay big bucks for a pretty place with a comfy bed and you dont care about the service, then Venetain Palazzo is your best bet.",1,2,0

I've been to the Palazzo quite a few times and I actually like the fact that their rooms are quite spacey which is a huge plus if you are in Vegas with a group of friends, especially since we also like to chill and hangout a bit in our rooms before venturing out. 

In addition, they are quite conveniently located on the strip, not super central but not too remote either. I also like that their hotel room elevators are not hidden nor far from the entrance, some Vegas hotels make it really difficult to get to your room. 

However, during my last visit (March 2017), when returning to the Palazzo after staying in a few other hotels, I felt that the Palazzo starts to feel dated:
- there is no bedside table on every side of the queen sized bed. This is unpractical, as I need a space to store glasses, a drink, my phone etc.
- the number of power outlets is limited and they are not located near the bed... I need to charge my phone while I am asleep
- the TV is small and old fashioned: no way of connecting your iPhone\/iPad\/laptop to the TV, plus the TV signal is not the greatest. Some of the channels were really unclear.
- the decoration of the room feels somehow very nineties.

Although I have enjoyed my previous stays in the Palazzo in the past, I will probably look at other possibilities for my next Vegas trip.",2,1,2

Our two bedroom suite on the Prestige level was amazing and didn't disappoint.  The hotel staff were all very friendly and accomodating.  The only reason I took a star off is because as you shop through out the Palazzo and Venecian you are constantly bombarded by pushy sales women in these body lotion shops trying to put eye cream or hand lotion or other items on you.  So pushy that it was uncomfortable to have to walk past them.  I was looking at all these fabulous stores!  Tory Burch, Louis Vuitton.  I was having a blast shopping and then I would hit another one of those stores and be confused as to why there are sooooo many of them and why they all try to make you feel like you look like crap just to sell their products.

My family and I stayed here over 4th of July weekend and were pretty disappointed.  We asked for a non-smoking room, but we were given a room where some hooligan smoked some chains in.  We complained and they said because it was a holiday weekend, they could not offer us a new room and sent up an air filter that was supposed to suck up all the smoke.  I hardly believe, that a major resort doesn't have any extra rooms.  The air filter took over 2  hours to arrive at our room. 

We roamed around the strip for 4 hours and came back to a still stinky room.  Not to mentioned that thing was extremely loud.  The only compensation they could offer us was to take off our resort fees.  

Not only was our room stinky, but the maids didn't do a good job of cleaning our room before we arrived.  A lot of toiletries were missing and small items like the bag for the ice bucket wasn't replaced.

While booking this hotel, I've been looking for more information on the concierge deal.  So on the Palazzo side, the whole 23rd floor is dedicated to this lounge.  From 5-9, they have non and alcoholic drinks and cold\/hot hors d'oeuvres serving.  When we went, they had hot tomato bisque which was very tasty and very creamy.  Sear tuna on a cracker, tomato and mozzarella on sliced bread with a pesto sauce, veggie egg roll, celery and ranch, shrimp tempura and puff pastry filled with liver wurst. They were all very good.  The lounge had enough seating all around, it was filled and food went away quickly, but they were quick to refill the trays.  There was a bar where you can walk up to order drinks or have a seat and a waiter will take orders.  They had hard liquor like Kettle One, Crown etc.  This was what the concierge lounge was all about.  When you have this offer, your card has a certain color on it where you flash your card to them to gain entry.  There is also a private elevator to the place so you don't have to walk through the front.  We did have an extra 2 friends come with us and went up the elevator way with no problem. You just need your key card to open the doors to the private elevators.  Everything offered in this lounge is free.  They even had a business room with computers so you can surf the net for free and even print out your boarding passes, etc.  

Now for the room, it was nice, different layout then the Venetian side, but pretty much the same.  There were two sinks in the bathroom, a tub and a standing shower.  Their vanity was a bit tiny. Having two TVs was a great idea since the girls and guys can watch their own shows with no problem.  The beds were super comfy, pillows and blankets were all down and very nice.  They charge 9.95 for internet connection for the day and they have a printer\/fax machine if you had anything to print.  

Overall, great room and even better when it's the concierge lounge.  I think it's worth the extra money.  Until then...",2,1,2

Check-in was a breeze and we were given the complimentary upgrade associated with my IHG status.  We were also given a special app to download on our phones that gave discounts through the Palazzo\/Venetian complex. Also, it was beautifully decorated for the holidays, which made it that much more special!

Our room was massive; much more than two people need as there were 3 TVs!  Our room overlooked the strip and afforded amazing views of the mountains beyond the strip too.  I sat in the window and just looked out for quite awhile.  Security is also noteworthy, as only guests are allowed past a certain point, which made me feel super safe. 

The bed was amazing, and kudos to the bathroom set-up.  I loved having a vanity and the bathtub was sublime.  Our A\/C was easy to use and our room was very comfortable and luxurious.  

I loved being connected to the Venetian.  Again, having one night only in Vegas, we decided to stick to the complex for meals and entertainment.  We mostly gambled in the Venetian, as the casino there seemed larger (and had the Deal or No Deal machine I was scouting out).  We also ate over on that side at Bouchon and Otto Enoteca.  We did take breakfast at Canyon Ranch Grill, which was amazing.

Sadly it really is no where close in comparison.  The hotel itself is nice, but nothing more.  Very simply decorated and nice, clean rooms.  Nothing very exciting in the ways of the casino and I was quite dissapointed that the hotel was open, but hardly any shops are, other than Barneys.

While others stay at places like Imperial Palace and come to Palazzo to gamble to look like big shots, I like staying at places like Palazzo and walking to casinos with $5 minimums like Casino Royale and Imperial Palace.

The Palazzo was really nice. The parking garage was convenient for those of us lucky enough to be able to drive to Vegas. The elevators to the rooms were right off the casino floor, another nice perk. You can also get to the Venetian through an underground walkway past all the restaurants.

The best part... the low roller I am, I was able to easily walk to the low rent district (Casino Royale, Imperial Palace, etc.) and play my $5 tables. In fact, the people I was playing with at the IP were laughing at me for slumming. I don't care, I refuse to play $10+ minimum tables if avoidable. The CVS outside the hotel was great for grabbing a bottle of water or soda to take back to your room.

Sign up for their newsletters and they will send you good discounts on a room. We stayed here for $129\/night and that included 2 tickets to Phantom and several restaurant and drink vouchers. It also included $20 in slot play, which I turned into $120, so it was quite the deal.

The only downside to the place is that the restaurants are quite pricey, so we usually left to go eat elsewhere. And their clubs attract a lot of beautiful and well dressed young women around midnight, and walking by them in my casual clothes to go slumming at the cheap casinos was kinda depressing.  ;)

If you're thinking of staying at the Venetian, come here instead. Even though they are listed as separate hotels, the Palazzo is basically just the newer and nicer tower of the Venetian, for  the exact same price as the Venetian.",5,2,1

This place is okay. I know it is the sister to the Venetian, but for some reason the Venetian's beds seem far more comfortable (I have stayed many times)

So here are the pros:
Free valet parking
Quick entrance from parking into the lobby
Reasonably quick entrance from the lobby to the room area
Decent security
Fast elevators
Free Internet
Separate living room and office area
Lots of space
Room service is decently quick
Housekeeping is thorough


Cons:
The couple of times I have stayed here, the bed was uneven. Higher on one side than on the other, and very uncomfortable
Old towels LOL run down with frayed edges.
Internet is slow
Shopping is just so so even though they boast it
Room service is very very very expensive. ($50 for one person for breakfast)
The place is appearing rundown inside the suites
Valet is pretty slow even on a day that isn't busy
The pools. Both Venetian and the Palazzo pools kind of suck. There aren't many tables, the pools are very cold, and the crowd is the ""don't really want to look"" crowd. Not hot!
Almost no service by the pools either.

Here's what I think they need to do:
Provide a separate blanket for the couch. I know I know. Would go along way to making the living room feel cozy after a long night.
Reconsider the price of room service.
Replace all of the towels
Replace the beds
Provide power outlets next to the bedroom nightstand for devices
Have the pool service people actually come by and service people. For three hours, not one person came by. People next to me were asking workers where the servers were and they just kept shrugging. One guy emptying the trash said there was only one server working all of the pools that day. 

Do some TLC to the rooms. They're looking run down - like their guests do after a long night of partying.

If you have a choice between this place, Wynn, encore or cosmopolitan, I would personally suggest Wynn, encore or Cosmo. There is a reason that those hotels sell out quickly and this one ... not as fast.

When I checked in on Friday afternoon, the front desk told me that there will be a $17 hotel fee and I said ok. However, by the time I checked out on Sunday, my bill jumped to $130. So I asked the front desk why and he told me that the housekeeping said that we took something from the snack bar. First of all, no one came to our room to check and secondly we didn't take anything from the snack bar. The more frustrating thing was the front desk agent didn't even bother trying to clear things with me. I felt extremely neglected and I told myself that I would never come back to a hotel where it doesn't appreciate my business. Also, I found out that the hotel fee was $17 per night instead of a one-time fee of $17. I am not complaining about the fee, but I just wished the agent took the time to explain the details to me.

Besides the bill didn't come out right, the hotel service was horrible. On Friday evening, I called housekeeping to ask for 5 extra towels and 2 extra pillows, the housekeeper told me that we don't have 5 extra towels and all I can only give 3 right now. I was like, this is a 5 star hotel and you don't even have 5 extra towels...? I said to myself its ok and told her to bring whatever she had to give. 15 minutes later, no one came and I was tired of waiting and called again. The answer I got was the housekeeper was on her way. My extra pillows and towels didn't come till half hour later. Another time, we called to ask for more toilet paper in the middle of the night and no one came after 15 minutes so I called again. I don't want to be an annoying customer, but when you need to use the bathroom so bad and you cant go because there was no toilet paper felt like shit.

We'd only walked through the lobby and casino a couple of years ago with friends after it had just opened, so I thought it might be interesting to stay there.

My wife did her thing - which is to find any deals she could and she informed me that we could stay at the Palazzo.  It turned out to be a little pricier than using our players club status at the Mirage, which is our old stand by.  But we've stayed at the Mirage many times and I kind of wanted to make a change - the Mirage is definitely starting to show her age, even with remodels.

I really enjoyed the Palazzo - the suite style rooms are great, especially as I've kind of lost the fire in the belly I once had for trying to win $$$ in the casino.  The living room area was a great place to relax with a drink after we'd spent the day meandering through town losing money here and there.

Ordered room service one for breakfast - the delivery was more rapid than predicted by the operator and the waiter who brought the meal was a real professional.  We had some questions for him about activities, and he was helpful and knowledgable.

Housekeeping left our rooms clean and tidy.  They did a first rate job.

Beds were super comfortable.  We have a good king sized bed at home, but the mattress at Palazzo was perfect.

We wound up eating most of our meals at restaurants within the Venetian \/ Palazzo grounds.  

Restaurants on site were really good - went to Bouchon (really good food and service) and the Grill at Valentino (food good, waiters not bad, but not first rate). 

Would go back again, but we'd have to get the same kind of room rate which was about ~140 a nite with the $*#T^ resort fee.",1,2,2

My girl friend and I drove to Vegas in the middle of the night (Swingers Style), which isn't too far for us, considering we live in LA. I hadn't slept in about 30 hours and was exhausted by the time we got into Vegas at 630am. We called the Palazzo to see if we could check in early so that I could get some ZzZz before a long night of drunken, gambling debauchery. Unfortunately, the Palazzo wasn't able to accommodate our early arrival so we opted to go into Downtown Las Vegas and get a room at Fitzgerald's(see review), an older Hotel, until we were able to check into the Palazzo at 3pm. 

Upon Check in at the Palazzo, I was taken over by the beautiful check in area. Absolutely magnificent! We were fortunate enough to be invited guests and able to check in at a special low wait time desk, Awesome! 

The scenery was pleasant and clean and the fact that the Palazzo is connected to the Venetian with all of its fantastic shopping was great for me, bad for my American Express. 

Our room was gorgeous with an awesome picturesque window overlooking a golf course with a Mountainous backdrop. 

Overall the stay was nice. The room was beautiful, very quiet, as we were at the end of a long hallway and everything had a very new feel to it. There were a few small things that could be better. Considering the Hotel and Casino were built in something like 8 months or so, I am sure some things were overlooked:

1. When we got to our room for the first time, my girl friend and I were standing outside of our door for several minutes because the door would not open. The little lock showed that the key worked, however the door was not budging. Lucky for us ""Letty,"" a very friendly person on the housekeeping staff, came over and kicked (and I am dead serious when I say KICKED), the door open for us. That seemed to be an issue for me coming back to the room at 4am, drunk, forgetting that the door was sticky and on top of that waking up my friend with the sounds of my Chuck Norris style roundhouse kick to the door and on one instances my chubby body hurling across the threshold onto the floor. 

2. There are no 24 hour restaurants in the Palazzo. We did, however, find great pleasure at the Grand Luxe Cafe in the Venetian at 3am, munching on their FANTASTIC Spinach dip and Arnold Palmers. Yum!

3. On FOUR different occasions while gambling we saw Palazzo Security hassling young ladies that were obviously suspected as hookers. In one instance, there were about 6 security guards surrounding a young lady, hassling her about being in the Casino. This went on for about 20 minutes until she was escorted out of sight. That particular instance put a damper on my ""Cops and Donuts"" Penny Slot experience. I think it would have been much more advantageous, had they ushered the young ladies to a spot out of patron's view. I have to say that I felt sick to my stomach and had to leave the Casino for a bit after the animalistic way they treated her. I mean, Vegas wouldn't be Vegas without some hookers here and there. I am kidding. But, there is a good way and a bad way at handling certain things, and this was definitely the wrong way.

4. They forgot our wake-up calls on two separate occasions! I am SO glad that I didn't have plans on those days!

5. When in Vegas, I chain smoke. Bad, Bad. The Casino is nice in that it isn't overly Smokey like Vintage Vegas used to be. There are a few areas that are clearly marked as ""Non-Smoking Areas,"" However, I found that a lot of the cool games were in that area. Boo!

6. On check-out day, there was an hour long wait for a Bellman to come help with luggage. We decided to lug all our stuff downstairs ourselves and considering I somehow ended up with more stuff than I started with (imagine that!) it was a big hassle. We were lucky enough to have bribed a Bellman on the way down to take our luggage and check it so we could grab lunch before leaving. Otherwise, we would have been stuck dragging our luggage through the crowded Casino to the Valet and grabbing McDonalds on the drive home.",1,1,1

But since I have to give something to write a review so they got a star that they don't deserve. First of all, when we get to the valet, my husband just pulled behind another parked car thinking it must be a line for the valet. The valet guy told my husband ""you need to pull up all the way up there to the right, you are blocking the traffic!"". I'm not quite sure how we are blocking the traffic when we were just lining up behind other cars. We are checking in as hotel guests and that's the welcome line that we got from them. He could have easily told us ""welcome to Palazzo! Could you please pull up to the front?"" I mean is that how the hotel trains the employees to welcome their guests???
Secondly, which also was the reason why I have to write this review, when my husband checked in at the front desk, they told him that they will upgrade us to another suite in the Venetian towel because the one we booked doesn't have a view. We bought that thinking it will be a nicer, better room. Little did we know, the place is actually smaller, 700 square feet compares to 720 square feet suite that we originally booked. The room does look older than the palazzo ones although the layout is almost the same. Not even a fridge provided which we kinda expected from high end hotels. Anyway, we had to walk across the whole hotel to get to the Venetian towel next to grand lux cafe, they stuffed us in the very last room in the 11th floor at the very end of the hall way that literally takes more than 170 steps to get there from the elevators. This is not what I expected for paying $300plus\/night for a room. I have stayed at Wynn and Encore and their rooms are a lot nicer, more spacious and brighter then this crappy room for cheaper prices. On top of that the view is not even the one that I can call mediocre. Just the view of the pool, looking down to a roof of some building and not even partial view of the strip was insight. My husband called back and asked to be back to the palazzo, to the suite that we originally booked and they said they were fully committed for that night! How on earth that you were fully committed when we did reserve our suite??? They said to call back in the morning to check on the status to be moved back to palazzo! We felt that we were being shafted with a lie from the hotel's front desk to make us feel like we got a deal to get upgraded to a better spot when they actually ran out of the room that we originally booked. This kind of service is unacceptable at a 5 star-rated hotels like Palazzo and deceptive to the guests. Now we are stuck at this end-of-the hall hole. My husband got so upset and ruining the mood of our family vacation. Obviously Palazzo put their benefit above the guests' comfort, convenience  and satisfaction! We have stayed at Palazzo before but this stay will be the last ever for us here. Never coming back and we will be sure to spread the ""quality"" if their customer service to others.",2,2,0

 - many of the pools have a 2 foot deep lip.  Again, great for small children

Usually, I stay at some affordable place like a Travelodge or Econo-Inn this was a big difference to what I am usually used to.  Mainly because the Hotel is just a place to crash out at night since you're not really much in during the day.  This time is was different as I was here with my Girlfriend visiting some of her family.

I really liked the room and my only complaint was that It was Saturday night past 9pm and the TVs didn't have BBC....and I wanted to watch Doctor Who.

The pools are amazing and really nice to go to in the morning when it's hot and they're still in the shade. 
The rooms are huge and bathrooms are luxurious.
Staff was overall friendly
The grand lux cafe has waffles that are to die for.

Cons:
Even though everything was great we had a HUGE problem with housekeeping. We got to our room and not even an hour later we hear a very quiet knock then not even 5 seconds later someone was walking in! It couldn't have been at a worse time considering my boyfriend and I were both undressed. There was a lot of screaming and running around to say the least.
I called the front desk immediately furious and the lady on the phone said they might have been double checking the room if there was a bad odor or ""something."" Which is ridiculous since we had just gotten to our room. It didn't make any sense but she said it was a mistake and wouldn't happen again. I also asked that they not come back during our stay. 
We decided to go out and were gone for about 2 hours. I left the do not disturb sign on our door just in case. We came back and everything was rearranged, new towels and such. What the hell. I had asked they not come back and our sign was on the door. 
We only stayed one night so we checked out the next morning. We were both using the tub and shower and we hear our door open AGAIN. This was at 10 and check out isn't till 11. 
If you stay here don't expect any privacy. We felt so uncomfortable the whole time we were here like someone was just going to walk in which they did multiple times.

Bed\/sheets were soft.  2 TVs, one in front of the bed and the other in the sunken living room.   I had a pool view...noticed that the blinds were electronic...awesome!!    

But the reason why Palazzo loses a star is because of the service.  I ordered in breakfast which took about 1.5 hours.  Housekeeping came around to check and see how I was doing, but they would literally knock once and come in.  The water pressure for the sinks was really low even though the shower and tub were fine.

- By the time I checked it at 10am on the day of my arrival, everything was ready. I got to stay on the 37th floor, had a very nice view room facing the Wynn hotel, Wynn's pool and its golf course. (See my pics) 

- I kept calling the front desk and received continuous excellence customer service during my stay: requesting slippers, inquiring coupons that came with the package and those in booklets that were in the room, asking for airport shuttle info and etc. 

2) Excellent Hotel Amenities 

I love everything but if I need to pick two of them, one of them would have to be the very nice bathroom. It has excellent lighting and my favorite bath tub that holds around two times of water normal bath tub holds. I also love the vanity table with magnifying mirror and the fresh cut flower. (See my pics) 

The other thing I like most would be the convenience to go to Venetian either through the pool deck or grand canal shoppers. The location for the Palazzo is excellent to go to Fashion Show mall, the Forum at Ceasers Palace and Wynn Hotel. 

3) Good Surprises 

- Nice surprise the first night I came back. There were two pieces of chocolate on my bed with an order form for in-room service for breakfast. The room has also been cleaned again since the trash cans were emptied. 

- Read the booklet they gave when you checked it as well as the booklets in the hotel room. They included free drinks and admission to nightclub, discounts on meals and Canyon Ranch Spa. My friend took advantage and went to see Lamborghini Show room for free. Just remember most of these coupons are limited to one person. 


One thing I am still uncertain at this point is the bill. 

1) Internet is $10 per 24 hour. 
2) The Canyon Ranch SPA told me they need to charge SPA passes to my room even though I presented coupons but the Palazzo would fix that for me. 
3) You definitely cannot mess up the fridge as well as the mini bar because Palazzo use the scale. If you take something out just to take a look, they would be charge immediately. I was not able to store drinks I buy from other store in the fridge at all. You can still go and get ice.",4,0,0

Checking in, I talked to a very attractive clerk who was well spoken and very friendly. I asked her what she was doing for New Year's and then noticed her ring on her finger. Strike 1.

We got into our room which was a dual queen set up. I was struck with deja vu as I thought this was a carbon copy of the Venetian just a different view. However throughout the stay, I was let down even further.

Here's a list of complaints I sent to their customer service:


When lying down on one of the beds, I noticed several strands of hair on the blanket.

A call for a refrigerator was not fulfilled.

A request for more glasses in the room  was not fulfilled.

Housekeeping did not replenish the glasses in the room.

A request for more towels was not fulfilled.

The table near the window was dirty and dusty.

Of course NYE is busy as hell but it's no excuse for them to not upkeep the standards they have.

Besides the room, I found the casino to be very nice and more spacious than the Venetian. The gaming staff was great and of course, lots of fun to be had at TAO and LAVO.

The rooms are identical. That is a good thing because they are suites, big and nice. 

I had two outstanding dinners (Carnevino and Cut) so that stands out.

Everyone I dealt with was nice and accomodating. I attempted to set up a spa appointment when I was working out one morning and they said they couldn't because I didn't have a credit card with me. That was confusing and somewhat of a bummer. Skipped it altogether.

The downstairs bag pick-up and taxi stand is a clusterfuck.

We also noticed that when you're in an upgraded suite versus a standard room, you get priority when you make calls to the staff- no being put on hold at all!

Check-in process was easy - you pull in off the Strip, and the Security Guard gives you a choice: Valet, or Self Park. We just drove down to the garage, and followed the signs. There was another reviewer saying the garage was very hard to navigate. NOT SO! If you've been to any other underground parking, you can figure this one out - LOL. The big painted sign for the elevators that say 'FRONT DESK' give you any clue?? LOL

As requested, we got a high room (34th floor), facing the Wynn Golf Course. What an amazing view! The room itself was a nice reprieve from the 'go go go' of Vegas. Huge 'wow factor' when you walk in. Very classy.

We stayed at the Prestige level which offers free complimentary continental breakfast & free happy hour on the concierge level. The free continental breakfast was definitely more substantial that a typical continental. They offered sausage, eggs, potatoes, fresh fruit, yogurt, mini bagels, etc. Pretty nice except that the scrambled eggs are inedible. Perhaps they are powdered eggs? Happy hour offers free cocktails and appetizers followed by dessert. Again, it is nice but desserts means cookies & brownies and the appetizers are just meh so don't go in with too high expectations. All the staff on the concierge level were fantastic! 

Hope you don't need anything from housekeeping during your stay. We called 4 times for a pillow and finally got it the next day (after the 4th call). 

The lighting in the rooms is dark. With the curtains open and all the lights on it is still kind of dark to read the free morning paper they deliver to your room. 

The remote controlled curtains didn't work. 

Just go straight to a nice bar if you want a cocktail. Either way you'll be paying about $13 for your drink. I don't mind paying $13 for a nice drink but was a little peeved at paying $13 for the crummy micro-sized bloody mary at the casino bar. 

When I called for a reservation for two rooms I was told it would be $10+ tax\/night to have connecting rooms. I thought why do they have to charge for connecting rooms and why per night versus a one time fee but ok I'm on vacation. When I checked out I discovered the fee is $10+ tax per night PER ROOM. This doesn't make a lot of sense because how can you ever connect one room?

Bigger ain't always better, however. Our three-night stay here wasn't exactly one for the books:

__________

+ If used properly, the Palazzo's ""Third Night Free"" online promo makes for a solid deal. We booked a three-night (Friday - Monday) stay in the middle of January for about $480 or so, with our total coming out to just over $600 with resort fees\/taxes included. The only catch with this promo is that your reservation must be paid in full at the time of booking - but if you're good about planning, then this shouldn't be an issue! 

__________

The hotel stays true to the quintessential Vegas themes of grandiosity and aesthetic boldness.

+ The check-in desk & lobby set the tone from the get-go; the towering walls, sky-high ceilings, and ornate fixtures demonstrate an impressive attention to detail. I was particularly wowed by the tasteful and abundant Chinese New Year decor; the various art pieces suspended from the ceiling and positioned throughout the major atrium areas provided a touch of color and class. 

__________

+ Our room was large, airy and spacious. Inevitably, I couldn't help but compare Palazzo's rooms to those at the Wynn - in part because the Wynn was our hotel of choice during our last visit to LV, and also because our room at the Wynn honestly might just be the benchmark for all my future Vegas hotel stays. 

In any case, the dual-leveled layout of our Palazzo Luxury Suite (the standard room type) was nice and inviting at a glance; the living room and bedroom sections left us with plenty of room to relax & unwind. 

- The Palazzo's rooms didn't match those of the Wynn in terms of the latter's pristine, downright immaculate cleanliness. There was a cheese stick in one of the suite's two mini-fridges (which speaks to A. how often the fridge is checked and B. how often people actually buy the stuff inside those things). Additionally, many pieces of furniture in the suite had begun to exhibit visible wear & tear; the counter tops in particular were considerably scratched and beaten up.

- Other elements of our room ended up being let-downs, as well. I would've happily traded the suite's dual undersized flat-screen TVs for one large TV; it didn't help that both TVs had a muddled, unclear picture that tended to flicker\/crackle from time to time (especially when viewing the ""hotel info"" channels!). 

- The complimentary in-room robes weren't the most comfortable. They had a crunchy, worn-in feel that was harsh on the skin. To be honest, they seemed more like extra-large gym towels than robes of a ""luxury"" resort! 

- Most disheartening of all was the condition of the L-shaped sectional, where we spent a solid portion of our stay. I inadvertently moved one of the couch's cushions to discover a full-size hand print stain on its underside. If not for the evident and recurring lack of room care\/upkeep, I'd honestly say that the Palazzo would've earned four stars. 

__________

The Palazzo's saving grace most certainly has to be its service, which came as a big surprise considering how expansive the property is. 

+ Requests were handled quickly and efficiently; we were promised a bellman in ""15-20 minutes,"" and he arrived at our room within 10 minutes at most. Similarly, our request for additional toiletries was fulfilled within 15 minutes. 

And speaking of this bellman....

+ We were assisted with our luggage by a bellman named Chris on two separate occasions; his friendliness and good cheer helped start & end our stay on a much-needed high note. Best of all, his interactions with us didn't give me the impression that he was reading off of a script (you know how that goes!).

+ The Palazzo also gets some extra points thanks to its complimentary parking (a rarity on the Strip as of late), along with the hotel's beautiful on-property Barneys New York. The store gleams overhead as your make your way up the front driveway, screaming ""please come here and blow all your savings.""

Overall, I'd still probably stay here again if the price was an undeniable bargain. However, if money's not a factor, I'm inclined to say that I'm placing my bets on Steve Wynn.",4,2,2

Later after we woke up we went to talk to the day manager Patrick, who wasn't helpful at all. All he kept telling us was ""I'm so sorry about your bad stay at the hotel there is nothing we can do."" Like really?!?!?!?!  

Totally ruined our whole vacation. We usually stay with venetian and decided to stay at Palazzo for a change. This will definitely be the first and last time we stay here. I will be telling all my family and friends about this bad experience and to take their business elsewhere!!!",4,0,0

The gaming area is so easy to navigate and has a simple rectangular layout.  You can spot the games you want to play without having to look up at signs.

This is one of my favorite hotels because the parking is so convenient when you have a bunch of luggage and you're too cheap to use the bell service.  I'm half joking but it really is a short walk from parking to the hotel elevators.  Mandalay Bay and Bally's have crappy parking locations and you have to walk a half marathon to get to your room.  

Of course the real selling point are the beautiful and spacious rooms.  3 TVs in one room is a good call.  There's a nice sofa and table to hang out and a nice desk work-space that I really like to use while on my laptop writing Yelp reviews or trading stocks.  There's even a printer\/fax which is less useful these days.  The bathroom is also spacious with separate tub and shower.  The water pressure in the shower nozzle is weak to intentionally save water but that detracts from the luxury.  I put up with it because this is a desert for goodness sake.

When entering the parking structure, I recommend coming in from Spring Mountain at the entrance facing the Wynn.  There are fewer cars than the strip side entrance and the security is a little bit quicker to get through.  Downstairs I eat at Grand Lux, CUT or Delmonico.  All good places to eat.",14,11,9

Two sinks, a large mirror and my favorite: A VANITY!!! Yessss! I love that I can apply my makeup for a fun night out sitting, and have my own space. 

Love the lowered, separate living area with couches, another tv and of course a desk and chair as well as a separate sofa chair. The couches turn into a pull out bed in case y'all didn't know!
The curtains are all controlled by a remote, talk about greatness and laziness at it's complete finest! 

The Grand Luxe cafe is open 24 hours I believe, but if it isn't I know the one at the Venetian is, which is just a 5 min walk through the casino and shops away. Eat there, it's delicious, especially late at night or should I say early morning (I'm talking 4am) lol

Run downstairs and have a coffee in the morning at illy a juice from juice farm (only if you want to pay $12 for a juice though) lol

I've stayed at just about every major hotel on the strip and have had good and bad experiences.  My husband and I actually got married at the Venetian, so I have a soft spot for it.  After a few years, the rooms started to get pretty worn down, so we started staying in the Venezia tower which is fab. I have been looking forward to staying at The Palazzo for quite some time and just stayed there last week.  WOW was I disappointed!  When we were first checking in, they were so disorganized and people were all over the lobby trying to figure out where the line was supposed to be.  A woman finally came over and divided the check in into two different lines- then proceeded to only pull people from 1 line and completely ignored the other.  My sister as well as others stayed in the line trying to get the woman's attention- in vain since she completely ignored them.  It wasn't until I came over after they hadn't moved in 20 minutes (the other line went through MANY people by this time) and forced the lady to start taking people from the ignored line that it started to move.  After we got to the room, the room was freezing cold and the heater wasn't working because nothing was warming that room down.  We called down for an extra blanket, which their response was that we were only getting one since they were fully booked (Uh...that's what we asked for).  They told us to make sure to leave the do not disturb sign off the door so that they could drop it off if we left.  We left to do some sight seeing, came back about 6 hours later...still no blanket.  When I called down to ask about it, the lady practically scolded me for leaving the sign up...uh....we didn't.  She said she would send someone up.  We waited about 45 minutes. I called back down.  Waited another 30 minutes..called back down again.  Someone FINALLY came up.  When I went to the gym the next morning, I chatted with another couple in the elevator who had the opposite problem where their room was blazing hot and their air conditioner wasn't working.  Went down to the Coffee Bean and waited about 20 minutes only to find out that the guy didn't submit my order...and had the WORST attitude about it.  The room was dirty and worn out looking.  There was visible dust and even dirty used false eyelashes on the couch..ewww. When everyone settled in for a nap, I noticed that the person that cleaned the room left an eighth of a roll of toilet paper and no kleenex. I called down and asked if someone could bring up some toilet paper and leave it outside of the room and they said they couldn't and that because of security reasons, nothing could be left outside of rooms.  I pointed out that two doors down was a food cart that was left out for room service to pick up, so yes, things WERE left outside of doors.  She then said she would send someone up.  It was just one bad experience after another... and the only ones that I can immediately recall were the ones that I mentioned...but there were many more...which is really sad!  With all of the hotels trying to one up each other, I can't BELIEVE The horrible service and attitude that I kept getting from everyone at the Palazzo.  One time- yes a fluke...but that many experiences on the same trip?  Can't be a coincidence...  I would NEVER stay there again...",0,0,0

Parking: I don't know why they can't make it clearer on where to pull in for valet (there's a confusing fork at the Las Vegas Blvd entrance), where to pick up your car from the valet (fyi, NOT where you dropped it off), and where to self-park!  Although valet is free, I recommend self-parking because it took about 40 minutes for them to get our car (after confirming that they had lost it).

Customer Service: This is mixed.. some people are wonderful and friendly (concierge, bellboy) and others just seemed confused and suspicious of us when we had questions (front desk, Club Grazie).  Check-in was slo-o-ow, even the lady behind us commented that the Golden Nugget was faster.  For your sake Palazzo, please take some notes from Bellagio, which EXCELS in customer service.

Size\/Location: The hotel is small.  I like this and at the same time I don't.  Small hotel means small gambling floor, but it also means less walking and other crap, especially when I just want to get to my room (wow I sound so lazy).  However, it is fairly conveniently placed on the strip since we had to walk to the Wynn (cross the bridge) and the Venetian (past the waterfall) a few times.

The Room: Nice and spacious, except for the closet.  Beautiful bathroom, love the little vanity table.  But it'd be nice if they checked their light bulbs.. two were out in the bathroom and one in the bedroom.  Also, I couldn't tell if they gave us new towels the next day, and where were our pillow mints?!  The bed is too soft for my taste, and I felt that the linens they used just radiated body heat.  I know, who complains about this.. but there are so many damn light switches!  One more thing - even if I had to lose the plasma in the bathroom, I'd much rather have a coffee maker, even Holiday Inn has those.

To begin, my girlfriend and I landed at 750 in the morning. Check-In time at the hotel is at 3Pm and we had noted that if it was possible, we would like an early check in.  So before leaving the airport, we called the front desk and they advised us that early check in was available.. WOWWWW!! at 8 in the morning.. I'll take it!!! That made a huge difference!!! A huge difference. Both of us are really big on customer service and not once, were we disappointed with any of the staff of the Palazzo. 

Next.... the rooms!!!!! AMAZING!!! Before stepping two feet into the room, we were already more than pleased.. Great marble floor in the doorway. The bathroom was great!!! First off, it had a double door entrance.  There was a separte shower apart from the deep tub that my girlfriend fell in love with! .. And within the bathroom there was a separate door that lead to the toilet area... In all, great design of the bathroom... Not to mention the LCD tv in the bathroom.. I could take a shower or bath and watch ESPN at the same time.. can't beat it!!!

Then off further into the room we have 2 more large LCD tvs.. one in front of the King size bed and one in the living rooom which happened to be sunken in.. Felt like royalty staying in this hotel..Let me not forget to mention that the room had a printer.. Don't know how important that is to you but it was very convenient..

The hotel is located in the heart of the strip.. When you go to Vegas, its a must that you do it RIGHT!!!! STAY HERE!!!! Though it doesnt have a buffet, you will be more than pleased with the assortment of shops and restaurants within the hotel.... Lovely design of the hotel.. lovely decorations and all!!! From the hotel room we had a perfect view of the many pools and of the strip.... The shades in the room were remote controlled. If you wanted the room completely dark at 9 am, it could be. The shades were GREAT.. 

All in all, I would recomment this place to anyone who goes to Vegas... Nice mixture of crowd.. Not full of yuppies and old people or the extremely unruly.. 

I give the Palazzo 5 stars!!!!!",1,0,1

Upon Checkin, our room was filthy, from stained headboards to furniture throughout the two suites, lamps did not turn on or off, switches were not working, curtains did not work, nor did the air conditioning - making the air completely stale and unbreathable. We had a view from all 3 windows of some sort of air vents.. and when those were on, they rattled the windows to the bedroom making it impossible to sleep. All the furniture looked thrown together.. as if it was put together last minute... 

we called to let the hotel know this room was unacceptable. They didn't help us, until we took pictures and came down to show them the next day, they then switched us to another suite. And I have to say, this suite was wonderful, clean, not stained, windows and curtains operated properly and most importantly the air conditioning worked! Making the air circulation in the room breathable. 

Upon check out with spoke with Felix and his manager Royce Phong, to find out the room we had originally was due to remodel! what?!?! The room was due to remodel? Why in the world did you guys rent it out?! This should have been disclosed to us because we would then have a choice not to reserve and stay in your hotel... Royce waived our resort fees for the inconvenience $250 for a 2 suites that was billed to us at $1600 for that night! I'm not sure what school of customer service Royce came from.. but to compensate a client 15% of something they should not have sold to begin with was unacceptable! 

I do not recommend the Palazzo hotel, it was a big disappointment, to know they chose to treat us as second rate guests by giving us a room that they would not normally give another customer!",4,1,1

The majority of the rooms are all the same and labeled as 'suites'.  You have the main entrance to your room, the bathroom and bed immediately inside and then you get this 3 step strairs to the ""social area"" or whatever you want to call it where you can gaze out over the Nevada area.  I've never had an issue with service, from checking my car in with valet to my room and leaving again.  

The upside - This casino has a lot going for it.  Location is fairly nice being central on the strip.  Its surrounded by other nice hotels too.  I'm not a smoker but this is Vegas but this hotel has managed to strike a nice balance.  In major walkway routes through the hotel and other heavy traffic areas like food areas smoking is not allowed and security or staff will ask you to move along.  Smoking IS allowed on the casino floor and in most other areas.  Overall the ambience is great and its very enjoyable.

The downside - You're going to pay a little more for your hotel room.

It is true that I am only 25 and have only been truly going to Las Vegas for about four years. However, I have been going to Las Vegas for as long as I could remember and in those four years since turning 21, I have been to Las Vegas easily 25 times, if not more.

I recently went to Las Vegas to celebrate my fathers 50th birthday with him and a couple of other friends. Ever since the Palazzo opened, I have been very impressed with it and have chosen to stay there every time it has offered a free suite, which is often or a discounted rate. However, this trip put the casino on the very top for me.

I work in entertainment, so it is difficult for me to leave work early and even though I do not live far, LA, it can still take a while to get to Vegas on a Friday night. I called the Palazzo and asked for late check-in, which of course was not an issue but have had difficulty at other places with a late check-in. For example, at the Las Vegas Hilton, I was once told that if I was not there by 2AM, my room could be given away, even though I informed them that my plane was late coming from New York, not much I could do about it. But with the Palazzo, I checked in at midnight, no issue and since I was comped a room, I got VIP check-in.

The rooms are incredible, beautifully designed, roomy and one of the best bathrooms in a hotel I have ever seen. One really cool feature is the couch is a pullout couch, so it makes the rooms even nicer if you have additional friends crashing in your room. The bathrooms have an amazing shower, with a TV, two sinks and a private toilet area.

The beds are always comfy, soft towels and wonderful climate control. One thing also important to me is the safe in the room is roomy and does not cost extra. I always gamble when in Vegas but I also like to go for nice dinners and in doing so, wear a nice watch to those dinners but not to the tables. Some safes in Vegas not only charge extra, but others are not big enough to hold your money and an iPod. The Palazzo is not one of those places.

Ironically I have always been on the same side while staying there, overlooking the Wynn pool. But from my angle, the view is great but cannot comment on other sides of the hotel.

The casino itself is wonderful. Luckily, my luck has always been good there. I even won 22 out of 25 hands playing blackjack once, a streak that even the dealer was impressed with. For the most part, the dealers are very friendly and love to carry out conversations with you, making the experience more enjoyable, even if you are losing. The cocktail waitresses are some of the hottest I have seen around and speaking of the drinks, the Palazzo is one of the few Vegas hotels that allow its guests to have their choice of drinks. It is the only hotel that gives me an Irish Car Bomb while at the table. However, you can tell that the waitress staff has gotten smaller and it can take a long time to get a drink.

I personally love the pool at the Palazzo, however, some people do not. I like how there are a lot of little pools spread out throughout the grounds. I think it allows for a more private atmosphere if you choose to visit a smaller pool. I always get a cabana when I go as well and the service there is always excellent. I even had a waiter go into the pool and tell a lovely young lady that I wanted to buy her drink, it earned him a nice tip.

However, when I went a few weeks ago, I got a cabana only to wake up to 30MPG winds and sub 60-degree temps. Not only did the hotel not charge me for the full price of the cabana, they gave my father, my friends and I a free spa pass instead. 

Now for some odd reason, I usually do not eat at the Palazzo's restaurants. So I cannot speak to those. But from other friends whose opinions I trust, they speak of them very highly.

I only have two complaints about the Palazzo. The first being the valet. It can very easily take 20-30 minutes to get your car from valet if the casino is only moderately busy and when it is really busy, you might as well walk. I have even asked to call down there 30 minutes in advance to try and arrange for my car, which they do not allow. Also, when you check-in, the bellhop can take an unusual amount of time to bring your bag to your room, sometimes 45 minutes.

My only other complaint is the Palazzo seems to have changed its point system recently to favor slot players heavily and punish table players. My comps or room deals are not nearly as good as they use to be despite going to the casino just as much and spending usually the same amount of money. I called the players club recently and was told that slot players are more valuable, which to me as a card player seems unfair. I have a friend who plays penny slots who received a free suite for an upcoming trip whereas I have not even been offered a room deal yet.",3,0,0

The products were good enough, and the TV in the bathroom was an added bonus, especially since there's also vanity seating in there.  

The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because:

1.  You can't turn off the fan, ever, so it's very dry in there.
2.  The fluorescent lighting in the water closet is too dim 
3.  The toiletries could be better.

I gamble and gamble a lot where I decided to come with friends for the New Year Celebration as well as two 30th birthday celebrations. 

As a LA native, Vegas is one of those things we decide to go on a last minute decision with our attendance ranging anywhere from 5-15 times a year. I know, it's crazy. So I've been recently staying at the MGM, Wynn and Cosmo lately because of the ease to head back to our rooms at the better clubs. Why can't the Venetian build a new, better club! Help me, help you! Anyways, so we ended up getting a room here where I use to frequent this place a lot as I got 5 star treatment as a gambler here. I come with my buddies on this trip, decide not to do any comp stuff and just enjoy our time here. 

We get a connecting Sienna Suite with a connect room for a few friends. Nothing crazy but keep in mind we were still spending $1,000+ a night. Now, I know this isn't vegas baller status but it's also a good amount of money. We decided to stay here again since my friend and I were Intercontinental Ambassador members. So we come NYE and find out our rooms are connected. What's the point of this then right? We were pretty upset where either the IHG guys or Palazoo messed up. Either way, let's get it right? We stay at these nicer places because of the service they provide. 

After some long searching and apologizing, we're told that there's no other options for the night but they can look into it tomorrow. Not the way we wanted to celebrate a 30th bday celebration as well as New Years with separated room.

I have to admit, I was pretty disappointed at this point as I always told people I loved Venetian and Palazzo. Fast forward to the next morning, we weren't able to get the room again and after some searching, they found a even better solution. A bigger, nicer way better room to make it up.

What I loved the most wasn't the fact that we got upgraded as we've been in these rooms before but how the front desk Receptionist, Jonathan took control of it. The guys is young and with the help of him and is manager, they stepped up and proved why you stay at places like the Venetian. My friends were talking A LOT of crap after the first night where this really made up for it.

Most importantly, I loved how Jonathan really understood we were there to celebrate with friends and wanted to be together. These days are numbered as we venture of to our families and careers where these moments are more and more rare. We were able to stay in this suite with all of our friends and just have a good time. 

I been a manager for several fortune 50 companies where I would love to have an employee like Jonathan. He stepped up, handled our fustration and made sure we were able to reach him throughout the moving and changes. 

I was really impressed how it turned out with Jonathan and his manager who really reinforced our faith in the Venetian. The truth is that many visitors have some many choices now where service like this is important. We know we're not the high rollers or whales but we appreciated being treated like value guests.",6,1,3

WTF is that? My food money was suddenly gone.

2) You would think free WIFI is included in those ""resort fees"" but NOPE.

3) The TV channels SUCKED. 5 tellemundo, 6 Asian sports, 10 hotel channels with a constant stream of how awesome they are because they recycle poo water to use in their gardens.  We had 3 TV's and nothing to watch unless of course you wanted to pay for a movie.

4) No matter what we did to the thermostat it stayed 70 degrees in the room. I know, I brought my own thermometer. You could turn that sucker down to 65, or up to 80 and the room stayed the same temperature.  

5) You can smell other rooms. Our neighbors would order late night room service. In wafts that enticing curry smell at 2am - GAG.

6) The water pressure in the shower - or lack there of. They said it was because they are eco-friendly and use low flow fixtures. Yea honey, I live in Seattle, home of the tree huggers. I also have a low flow fixture. Mine feels like a spa, yours feels like  Grandma spitting in my hair.

7) The toilet paper was about the same as a truck stop bathroom. My feet walked on marble and my butt wiped with sand paper.

8) The mattresses were not comfy - they had that same bounce as a motel 6, yee haw!

9) The comforter and some of the towels smelled funky.

10) The elevators - OMG people, they not only were slow - our trip to the 22nd floor would take close to 5 minutes, but they bounced and jiggled to were we all still felt like we were moving an hour after using them. We would seriously come up with way to use them as little as possible. For real, I felt like I was on a ride at the Strasosphere.

11) Overpriced, mediocre food. Any and ALL of the restaurants on site and frankly on the strip. Believe me when I say I hit most of them and while some of them were good, nothing was great - and in most cases were blah.

12) My number 1 complaint isn't any of these picky things that by themselves wouldn't have been so bad. It was the attitude. The snarky, annoyed ""I'm better than you"" tone every employee seemed to have. I know I am at an over priced hotel, but don't be a jerk-face while you are robbing my blind, at least pretend to give a sh*t before I turn my back. 

My room was pretty and it was nice - but every time I had a question beyond, ""how do I pay?"" I was met with negativity that frankly ruined my trip.

That being said here is my review. 

Room is very spacious. Got the Bella Suite because my father and brother decided to join me. 

The layout of the Hotel is very good. One main corridor down the middle. The gambling tables are not to close to each other. Tables were lucky for me made 5k. 

The food which is the most important part was incredible. 

Zine Asian Noodle - best dumpling noodles I have ever had. The noodles are made by the restaurant. 

Samba Sushi - not your typical sushi restaurant. Much like Nobu but better at 2\/3 the cost. Still will run you about $80 per person but it is well worth it. That includes sake and beer. 

Morels French Bistro - Had steak and eggs $22. Excellent. A little more pricier than the other restaurants but what do expect from the French. My brother knows food much better than I do. He loved the food at this hotel. 

The only that was wrong with the Hotel was the sports book. Even though I hit a $200 parlay that scored me $1,400 the location is bad. The ceilings are low. The layout is not very inviting.

I'm not a gambler or a big shopper, so when I go to Vegas these days it is mostly for work.  I've stayed at the Ritz Carlton, the MGM, New York, NY, and the Homewood Suites near the airport.  

The worst thing about staying in Vegas for me is how much they nickle and dime you for everything.  Want coffee in your room when you wake up and your hair is pointing in every direction it can possibly go?  Too bad, you'll have to get out of bed, make yourself presentable, get in the elevator and face the world to pay nearly 3 dollars and change for a basic cup of joe.  I'd rather have an in room coffee maker that I have to drop money in to instead.  

There is no denying the beauty and comfort of the rooms at The Palazzo and I would happily stay at this hotel again because of it.  I didn't really have much interaction with any of the employees other than when I checked in and checked out, but both experiences were pleasant.  

Situated on the far end of The Strip (near the Wynn hotel), it's about a 15 minute walk to the Bellagio if you want to eat at their buffet (hint: it is one of the best buffets in town).

Besides taking a taxi, the other way to get to the hotel is a 6.00 shuttle you can take just outside of door #8 in baggage claim at the airport.  There is a shuttle called Exec. Shuttle Service and they leave once per hour.  It will stop at The Venetian first, then stop at The Palazzo.  There are two other shuttles that can take you to the hotel (Bell Trans & Coach USA), but bear in mind those two will stop at other hotels along the way.  You can purchase a one way token (poker chip, cute) for Exec. Shuttle for 6.00 or purchase a r\/t token for 12.00.  Be aware that the shuttle back to the airport -will- be making other stops and it could take as much as 30 minutes to get back to the airport.  That surprised me given the drive to the hotel from the airport was non stop.  Oh well.",5,0,2

I'm definitely gonna stay there again; I hope I get enough comp points for free nights there.",1,1,0

I must say that things got off on a bad start, as there were pretty severe delays in checking in (~3:30 pm).  I would think that the hotel should have rooms ready by the check-in time (3 pm)?!?!  Is that really too much to expect?  Such false advertisement.

I had reserved a Bella View suite but for some reason the lady at the front desk could not locate my reserved suite!  She wasn't very friendly, nor cheerful, unlike other front desk staff I have spoken to in the past at MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay.  It sounded like the Palazzo was busy that weekend (Memorial Day) since she was asking another gentleman working next to her, who was helping another guest,  ""Did you find one yet?  I'm still looking...I need a Bella View.""  From that I realized that their reservation logistics are definitely not up to par with other luxury hotels.  Being a busy weekend is most certainly NOT a valid excuse for such delays -- it is something all hotels should plan (and hope) for.  Anyway, her searching on the computer left me waiting at the front counter for several minutes.  After turning up nothing, she informed me that she would go check with her manager, who was in the back room apparently.  Then she disappeared for a good 5 minutes or so, all the while I was left standing there waiting.  When she finally popped out from the back room, she printed out the paperwork and all, and only offered a very terse apology, which I felt sounded a bit insincere.

After having gone through that (I guess at that point I didn't mind the delay TOO much...I was in Vegas afterall!), I was finally looking forward to relax a bit in the suite before heading out to play on the Strip.  However, once we got to our floor and were approaching our room, we were a little confused since the suite that appeared to be ours had its door wide open....

and it turns out that freaking housekeeping was STILL IN THE SUITE.  ARGH.  Such delays!  They told us to wait in the hall (with luggage in our hands!) for 10-15 minutes while they finished cleaning.  WTF right?!   Pretty inconsiderate if I do say so myself.  First the delay during check-in and now this.  I was so frustrated at this point.  Once we were let in and unpacked, I went down to the lobby to report the housekeeping delays and a cracked mirror we found in the suite (as to not get charged for damages we did not cause).  I couldn't believe the response I received after informing them of our situation.  The concierge merely offered a brief apology and mentioned that it happened a few times that day already to other guests as well.  Um, does that really make it ok??  That's it?  Great.  My stay has SIGNIFICANTLY improved since your little verbal apology.

I've been to Vegas on several other big holiday weekends, so hotels being busy isn't something new to me and I've never had any problems like this in the past.  The treatment I received and the lack of service at the Palazzo really surprised and disappointed me.  I made sure to address these concerns in an online survey that they email guests after their stay.  I did receive an email reply, but again, it was just another short apology and claim that they care about their patrons, and a request to give them another chance.  Pffft....unless there is some way you can demonstrate your sincere care and concern for your patrons, I'm not sure I'll ever stay here again...

Next time...we'll Wynn!",3,1,2

Huge suites for the money- for sure.
Awesome location on the strip- absolutely.
Great amenities- sort of.
I was well on the way to a 5 star review when pulling into the valet and discovering that not only was the parking free, valet was free. HUGE wow for the Palazzo. 

Walking through the casino was actually pleasant for once... although they still allow smoking, it seems like they have a better ventilation system than most hotels, so awesome for that. They (and all the other casinos for that matter) have gotten rid of the actual money payoff machines and really reduced or gotten rid of the machines that make those slot spinning, coin dropping, all sound drowning-out, amazingly annoying casino ruckus sounds that you used to hear in your sleep for a week after departing Sin City. Way to go, Vegas!

And even though the Palazzo amazes with the extras like free wifi and relatively reasonable prices for room service, the things that don't happen, especially when comparing them to other hotels where these things are standard, make the Palazzo's short comings fairly glaring.

No coffee maker in room. Not only do they not have one in the room (most luxury hotels will bring you free coffee if you ask because it is just classier. Not so at the Palazzo), you have to pay $4 a cup at the Coffee Bean or the restaurants or some insane price for room service. 

The bathtub was disgusting with OPH. (Other People's Hair). Not cool.

You need a PhD in plumbing to make the shower work and\/or produce hot water.

Cup rings and recent disgustingness all over the place. 

There are no vending machines anywhere on the property so you have to pay their shitty prices ($5) for a 12 ounce soda.

They charged me $17 for a pina colada without telling me how much it was first. Okay, I should have asked, but I just assumed that I didn't need to buy a jar of lube before stepping up to the bar, or that the KY would at least be provided with a purchase.

The bed caved in the closer you got to the edge so you had to sleep in the center or wake up with your face in a place I wouldn't want to check with a black light. This is just not acceptable at this level of hotel.

I will say their water tasted good, room service had an awesome cheeseburger (yuck on the fries though), and they took off the ""resort fee"" (AKA, their extra bullshit charge that they don't have to show on the internet price pages). 

Overall a decent stay and I would come back, but I would expect a lot more for a hotel of this caliber next time.",5,4,0

The bathroom has double sinks, bathtub, walk in shower and a vanity for doing hair & makeup and my favorite a toilet in a separate room. The staff is sooooo nice and very helpful, getting around, in & outside the hotel. The casino is one of the nicer ones (IMHO) because the ceiling is a little higher and the smoke rises and isn't as bothersome. The Grand Canal Shoppes are just that GRAND! Very high end shops but fun to look in! The restaurants are incredible with different price points for every budget (food court in Venetian). Need a rental car? Head down to the taxi stand and book one with Avis, book directly there at the counter, it's the best price. Great convenience for getting off the strip. The pool is perfect for me. I don't need a lot of bells and whistles when it comes to pools, comfy, padded chairs with waitress\/waiter service, music, towels provided, bar & restaurant in the pool area. What more could a girl ask for? Oh yeah, a lounge chair in the pool on a hot day, yes, in the pool! Awesome!

However, the hotel comes nowhere close to the 4+ stars that internet sites claim it is. 

Here are just a few items that should NEVER be an issue in a 4-star hotel:

The comforters of each bed has ink and other stains on them. 
We had to wipe down EVERY surface in the room which revealed LAYERS of filth. This included the desk, the card table and the wall divider, the entertainment area, and the credenza. 
The sleeper sofa is sagging so badly that the bottom cushions don't meet with the back cushions.
The bathroom floor had not been swept and mopped in the toilet area.
The carpet in the room itself had not been vacuumed the day we arrived.
There is a hole in the window curtain. 
The back of the TV remote was broken.
No instructions were on or near the printer as to how to install the driver and use it. 
None of the maids who came to service our room new how to clean (save the maid who came on Thursday). 
The cigarette smoke that wafts through the upper floors of the hotel, including the elevator areas is ridiculous.
What was the last straw and perhaps my biggest beef is the fact that there was NO microwave in the room. This was appalling and disappointing, given the hotel's boasts that it is environmentally friendly and donates items such as soap to needy third-world countries. However, one of the biggest areas of waste that it has overlooked is FOOD. When I expressed a concern about there not being a microwave, both Concierge and 2 individuals at the Front Desk (one of whom claimed to be a front desk manager)  told me it was a health violation to re-heat food. Duh!!!! Everybody knows that. I had to explain to the apparently clueless individuals that it is not a health violation for the hotel to provide a microwave to guests in their rooms so that they may re-heat the expensive food they took back to their rooms in a doggie bag. Furthermore, I explained that a decent hotel will at least offer a public space where a microwave is available for use or have one that could be brought up to guests. The ""manager"" of the front desk had In-Suite Dining call our room just to say that it was health violation to re-heat our food in their restaurant. Again, another clueless person who wasn't listening to my concern -- a concern I'm sure others have expressed.
All in all, I was not impressed by the Las Vegas strip AT ALL. Everything is over-hyped and over-priced; and the hotels give the appearance of being nice. Perhaps to the people who come to drink and gamble. But not to the sober and sane tourist who favors quality over quantity.",0,0,0

I stay at Palazzo partly for its quieter spaces in comparison to its sister tower the Venetian. 

The Venetian as a whole offers the biggest rooms on the strip, with its base Luxury Suites offering 700 square feet of living space. The biggest of any in Vegas that I've stayed in. 

Always book direct or through IHG. I normally stay 2 or more nights to get the $150 food and beverage credit deal, which is well worth it! There is so many  food options in the combined resorts. The only downside side is not all the eateries do room charges to deduct from the credit - I made that mistake when I wanted something from Bouchon Bakery. 

The resort is so massive, one can easily get lost in its many corridors. 

I didn't particularly care for the shopping experience as there are so many shopping centers along the strip. 

Service is differentiated between which service agent you get. With two of my stays being at complete opposite ends.

*March 2016: no complaints and enjoyed my stay completely.
*December 2016: I was assigned a room at the end of the hallway, the room was not completely serviced, all of the telephones in the room was not working, and the window drapes would not function properly. The Front Desk manager refused to move me and was outright rude and impatient as her excuse was that the hotel was nearly sold out and that I would have to callback the next morning. Alright, the next morning I explained to a Front Desk agent and she said that unfortunately their system is down and would not be able to move me until later in the day. I waited once more and appears their system will be down until the next day. I was extremely not happy how my stay is turning out to be, not to mention that I had to call the Front Desk from my cellphone. The agent sent a person to replace the phones in my room and to fix the faulty drapes as it kept me up all night. The repair agent then did the dumbest move: he dialed to his manager to test on the speaker phone and the manager asked him why is he in this room when he can service other more important guests. That brought a boil to my blood. I called yet again to the same Front Desk agent again, which was more pleasant than the manger I spoke to the night before.

Very grande and over the top, I love it!  The Palazzo is the newest of the two and still offers the same beauty just smaller and more intimate with less Italian decor.

I know these resorts are older and slowly they are renovating the rooms.  I stayed 1 night in the Palazzo on the 31st floor and everything was brand new.  You can still smell the fresh carpet.  Our room was newly renovated with new furniture and everything was extremely clean, I cannot complain!

Service was amazing; very courteous, very quick!  I would recommend this place to families or for just people who want to avoid the heat, everything under one roof!  Visit the Grande Canal Shops, try out the restaurants (Table 10, Grimaldi's), check out the food courts (to save costs) like Chipotle or Subway.  Two large resort hotels connected to a mall with all the shopping, restaurants, casinos, and Grand amenities!  This place is huge!

We also have Prestige access ($100 extra per night).  They offer continental breakfast and hors d'oeuvres through out the day with light drinks and coffee.  I recommend to help stretch a budgeted food cost.  We also rented out a cabana by poolside which offers air conditioning, cool water spritz, small refrigerator with bottled water and we ordered appetizers!  The level of service was amazing at the Prestige lounge and poolside also. I would definitely stay here again!",7,2,5

It was so luxurious which made me feel like a celebrity.  Once we stepped into our room, there was 2 flat screen tv's; especially, a flatscreen tv in our bathroom.  While we were being situated in our suite, I checked out the view from the window.  We had the view of the swimming pool. Beautiful!!

A couple of friends of mine checked out the pool.  It was so therapeutic to hang-out in the pool with a beer and cigarette in your hand.  It just makes you forget all the bs you have in your life.

Every year my company has a huge conference hosted in the Venetian, which is connected to the Palazzo- so we take over both hotels. The Palazzo is awesome and wonderful when I stay for work. With a great selection of restaurants and multiple, beautiful pools, this hotel is a top pick for Vegas.

You can valet (free) or self park. If you chose the latter, park as close to the Front Desk elevators as possible because this will land you right next to the guest elevators leading up to the guest suites. The Casino elevators will take you closer to the front lobby and desk. 

The room I stayed in most recently was the Bella Suite (comes with two queen beds and a pull out cot built into the sectional sofa) and that room can easily fit six to seven people! Great for groups. The Siena Suite can fit four to five people, comfortably. Both the Siena and Bella Suites were well furnished and had just the right amount of opulence without going too overboard. The bathrooms were well lit and contain a vanity area for ladies, which is extremely helpful. There is definitely no shortage of flatscreen T.V.s!

The amenities were great. Wi-fi! Bathrobes! Quality shampoo, conditioner, and lotion! Oh, and a hair dryer...wheee!

The hotel staff is professional and courteous. I had no problem requesting extra key cards because they kept demagnetizing in my purse. Switching the room charge from my friend's credit card to mine was also a piece of cake! Requesting extra room amenities (shampoo\/conditioner, towels, etc.) by calling the front desk from the phone in the suite had someone knocking on my door in less than ten minutes. I also like how they address you by name when you call down to the front desk. Great service.

The Palazzo is conveniently located next to Wynn and Encore. Considering the popularity of Encore Beach Club during the day and XS at night, this is really helpful. Walking from Palazzo to Encore took less than fifteen minutes. And a cab ride to Wynn was less than ten minutes and cost $5.

Did I mention there's a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf right next to the guest elevators?",3,0,1

I loved the hotel and the rooms are just amazing. I felt like I was living in a luxury high rise condo. The furniture is very contemporary and very ""un-hotel"" like. I really enjoyed the step-down living room with the sectional couch and having my own lil office right there in the room. The in suite dining was very good and the staff are awesome. The only reason why I gave them 4 stars rather then 5 and that the customer service is SLOW. It takes sooooo long to fulfill a request. Rather it be food service, and type of room service or even getting someone on the phone. I was on hold twice for about 20 minutes. Not good. But that will not stop me from visiting again. This spot is definitely on my recommend list. But I still have to try a couple other hotels, but that's gonna be extremely hard for me to do.",2,0,3

Adelson really outdid himself this time by securing 15 acres of land next to some prime real estate, all for a mere $1.6 billion.

Reasons why this one is going to top the Venetian:

1. 50 floors of 3000+ suites.
2. NEW shops, including a 85,000 sq foot Barney's NY and a Christian Louboutin boutique amongst other luxurious and unique boutiques.
3. Fine dining GALORE: Cut by Wolfgang Puck, CarneVino by Mario Batali, Table 10 by Emeril Lagasse & Restaurant Charlie by Charlie Trotter.
4. Rooms will have oversized bath sheets, Egyptian linens, & marbelized bathrooms.
5. 1,800 seat custom built theater for the Broadway hit, Jersey Boys.
6. Jay-Z's 40\/40 Club will be housed here.  
7. A Lamborghini showroom.
8. A bigger, and better Canyon Ranch Spa.
9. Larger revenue, Palazzo boasts more Asian games, to attract the Asian market.
10. Because it's brand spankin' NEW!!!

Will update post-stay in February 2008.

Update 2\/18\/08:

The casino is really wide open and easy to maneuver with the FOUR major cavities.  

Rooms are a little smaller than the Venetian suites, but I like the decor much more, dark granite, browns, a bigger screen in the bathroom & lemon verbana scented toiletries.  

Within walking distance to shopping: Palazzo, Canal Shoppes, Wynn Espanlade & Fashion Show.  

Still waiting for some of the eateries to open up: Trotter, Sushi Samba & Cut.  

I will stay here over Venetian and the Wynn ANY day.

Update 6\/16\/08:

Still like the Wynn's pool area more, but the pool chaise chairs IN the pool is a plus.  There are also multiple pools.

Yay!!!  They finally have his\/hers terry flip flops AND cordless phones. 

Pool dining is great, I love all the fresh juices, and they are in the process of building a new Canyon Ranch Cafe!!!  So healthy!!!

The decor, the bed, the bathroom, the sunken living room. The TVS in every room. A lot of space, probably more space than a NYC apartment, lol. 

- This side of the strip is definitely THE classiest and most elegant (attached to the Venetian next to the Wynn and Encore). LOVED having a gorgeous  Walgreens attached to my building as well as an entire mall with THE best stores like Barneys New York, Christian Louboutin, Micheal Kors, Bottega Veneta, and even having a Victoria's Secret in my hotel came in handy. You can shop until 12am, yes you can go buy a pair of Jimmy Choos at 11:45pm, lol! (not to mention Fashion Show Mall is a short walk away)

- The Palazzo is with The Venetian, and in between the two is the mall, or actually it's more like a city. It's like Venice, Italy... and there's a river down the middle with people singing and giving rides on gondolas, one guy sounded so good I thought it was a recording. TAO is also in here, and it's one of the hottest\/top clubs in Vegas. So basically if you stay here you can literally just stay in your hotel the entire time... there's lots of good food (top restaurants with worldwide known chefs), shopping, gambling, clubs, everything all in one place. 


SUMMARY: This place is true luxury at it's finest. So please darling, be classy when you go. They have great deals and it's totally worth every penny. I felt like ""I made it"" staying here, lol, nah but really the grandeur of the place definitely makes you a little unintentionally snooty and boujee, especially as you walk down the strip and see how ""the other people live, you know the 99%"", hehehe, I kid I kid.  First time in Vegas and I did it right by staying here. Lost some money at the slots, but hey that's Vegas baby!


(forgot to mention the 1 main con-- our room wasn't the cleanest when we got there, I asked for it to be reclined-- they said sure. 30 minutes later the housekeeper comes in, but you could tell us being in the room totally caught her off guard, she seemed like she was on her way home when she was suddenly asked to clean our room b\/c she had her purse and personal belongings-- and just so happened to have  small water bottle and rag... she did a HORRIBLE job cleaning, didn't make any difference)",6,4,6

+1 star: Fast check-in. No hassle. Got upgraded to a room with a view. 

+1 star: Hotel is pretty clean. Lots of new slots. The hotel layout is pretty straight forward (Just follow the arrows and you won't get lost). Room was pretty spacious. We got the double queen suite (Bella Suite with a view 39th floor). Very clean room. 

+1 star: In suite dining (lunch) was surprisingly good. Ordered the Lamb shank with whipped mashed potatoes and vegetables. We also got the Reuben sandwich with onion rings (you can get fruit or fries). The clam chowder and the french onion soup for superb. Cheese pizza for the kids. And Double Chocolate cake for dessert.  

+1 star: Very friendly staff. They always greet you. 

-1 star: POOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dear Palazzo. You have 6 (I believe) beautiful pools and none of them are kid friendly. Mostly adults (I completely understand ITS LAS VEGAS) but it was so awkward to go to a pool and seeing adults drinking. At least designate one (1) pool for the kids. 

I truly loved my stay at The Palazzo. If it was me and my husband only I'm pretty sure this review will be 5 stars. But I always factor in my children feedback. They enjoyed the tub, but its not the same.

Till then Palazzo. With your lovely Grand Canal Shopping.",2,0,0

Every room in this hotel is a suite, so the amenities are nice and the room feels incredibly spacious and comfortable.  I stayed in a king suite, which had a really comfortable bed with a pillow-top mattress and feather pillows and a nice feather comforter.  

It also had a SUNKEN livingroom.  Awesome!  The living room is off of the area with the bed and it's a few steps down with a nice, velour corner lounge couch, tv, dinging table and office suite.  One part of the couch has a twin fold-out bed (request an additional blanket from housekeeping) and the other side is comfortable enough to just sleep on, anyway.  

Big bathroom, stand-up shower and jacuzzi tub.  Toilet is in a separate room so someone else can use the small vanity area or sink while you're doing your thing in the other room.  The vanity area is nice because you can sit, do your hair and makeup and watch the TV that is in the bathroom.

Did I mention there are THREE TVs in this suite?  I don't even know how many TVs could possibly be in other, larger suites but this one has a bunch that are awesome.  Satellite TV, pay-per-view movies, etc. - everything you could imagine on a TV.  There's also some cool tech updates to this room that make things comfortable: iPod dock, DVD\/Blu-Ray player and HDMI connects for the TVs so you can stream info from your devices to the TVs.

All in all, a great hotel.  My only deduction in stars comes from the pools and the casino.  Yeah, there's TONS of pools here; however, they all smell a little rank and I have NEVER been in a pool with more pieces of hair floating around than at the Palazzo.  Hair, in any quantity, grosses me out when it's no longer in your head and, instead, floating in a pool touching my finger.  It's even MORE gross when part of your weave gets caught on my wedding ring.  WHYYYYY??

Lastly, this hotel's casino SUCKS.  Table games are way too expensive ($25 minimums after noon) and I've never had WORSE luck in a casino than I have here.  Sure, it's all chance, but this place's tables are terrible and no one ever wins.  Go somewhere else to gamble, for sure.",3,2,3

If you look around the room and think to yourself, I could live here and be happy, then you know you are staying in the right place.  All the ""basic"" rooms are suites with a step down into a living room with sectional couch, desk, and table.  If you want to hang out in a nice room with friends and have a few drinks, then this is your room.  3 flat screen TVs (Living room, Bedroom, and yes in the bathroom).  The marble bathroom has a nice soaking tub and glass shower.  Private room for the toilet as well and dual sinks.  The beds are very high quality with high thread count linen.  Only the Wynn has better beds IMO.  The window drapes are nice and thick if you want to sleep in.  They are also push button automated.  It's a feeling of power to push a button only to reveal the Las Vegas Strip and it's night life below you.  It's the best basic room you will find in Vegas bar none.  5 stars.

For me the pool while nice, isn't on the right side of the hotel.  If you enjoy morning sun, you won't get it here.  Of course this depends on the time of year, but with us staying here in April, only 1\/4th of the pool had any sun by 11 am.  Most of the time when we would leave the pool around Noon or 1 for lunch, the pool area was still shaded by the hotel.  Pool side drinks were also a shadow of the quality you get at the Wynn and at the same price tag.  The frozen drinks aren't made to order.   3.5 stars for the pool.

One disadvantage to staying at a high end hotel are the black jack tables.  They aren't cheaper than $15 min.  If your gaming strategy involves putting more money on the table while you are winning, well it's not hard to often have a $45 hand and have to double down.  Now you got $90 on one hand of blackjack.  It can go south real quick if you don't show restraint.  The guy sitting next to me, was playing 3 hands at a time and must have lost about $5,000 in a matter of minutes.  So If you like stumbling downstairs from your room right into a reasonable priced casino, perhaps the Monte Carlo is more your speed than the Palazzo, Venetian, or Wynn.  That said, all the dealers were friendly.  If you are going to lose money, a nice smile and conversation from the guy pulling 6 card 21s to ruin your double down does go a long way. 4 stars for the casino

At first the parking seemed to be crazy here.  It's the only strip resort with an underground garage and not very well designed, with cars getting frustrated trying to get out, it's easy to get mowed down.  But as our stay went on, I realized if you always parked on the bottom floors, you could get a spot right next to the elevators and miss out on all the craziness, so it's one of the shortest walks you'll have from your car to the casino.  Parking 3 stars.

When reading a review about a hotel in Vegas, it's good to know the reviewer's experience with all the strip offers.  Other hotels, I've stayed at are The Wynn, Venetian, MGM Grand, New York New York, Monte Carlo, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, and Las Vegas Hilton.  You aren't going to find the perfect hotel.  Even though I gave the Palazzo 5 stars, they do have flaws.  But feeling you aren't getting luxury for what you pay for, isn't one of them. Just walking around the highly polished luxury hotel will make you feel like a million bucks.",23,17,18

REALLY pretentious prices ($15 for a tiny, not good Bloody Mary in the casino) yet one is still surrounded by the great unwashed population.  Not trendy.  Not cool.  But trying very hard to appear that way.

NO 24 HOUR PLACE TO EAT   Well, there is a bar with a greatly reduced menu overnight.

NO BUFFET which is cool if you're trying to exclude people from the Midwest for whatever reason.

BASICALLY NO INTERNET IN THE ROOM. which can almost be considered a Vegas standard, but this is supposed to be a convention hotel.

Housekeeping service is A+, quick and clean.  I guess the biggest plus was our original check-in time was at 3:00 p.m., but due to a mishap, my friends and I arrived in Vegas at 9 a.m., it's already scorching, we're all exhausted, lucky for us the room is empty, and we're in the hotel by 10 a.m., albeit we were placed on the same floor with crazy\/loud potheads and our hallway reeked.",0,0,0

Check-in was easy. We got there right around noon on a Friday and there was no line for check-in. Our room was up on the 45th floor, and I wasn't really paying attention to the conversation, but I could've sworn that my friend asked if we could have a strip-facing room and the girl at the front desk said that we could for an extra fee per night...which I'm pretty sure my friend agreed to. Anyway, we get up to the room and we had a delightful little view of the pool at the Wynn and the golf course.

The room was gorgeous...similar to the Venetian, but a little bigger. I wasn't a huge fan of the couch, but everything else was great. The bathroom was huge, the bed was comfortable, and we were close to the elevator.

The casino was nice. We got in the Friday of March Madness, so once our bags were in the room we headed down to Lagase's to place some bets. It was packed, but didn't take long to place a couple of winners.

The restaurants we ate at: completely disappointing. I was shocked to see a hotel with such high standards have such meh restaurants. We ate at 3 while we were there (SushiSAMBA, Dos Caminos, Grand Lux) as well as ordered room service and I probably liked room service the best...on the other hand, the restaurants at the Venetian are WAY better.

2) It's a smaller hotel compared to other hotels on the strip where it can get overcrowded with tourists and you feel claustrophobic.

Check in was friendly and personable, although there was a small line. It moved at a medium pace which was fine with me. During my check-in conversation I mentioned I was there for my bachelorette weekend and my bella suite became with a bella suite with strip view (thank you thank you thank you!). The room was spacious and clean. The few times we called for extra amenities they were brought up quickly. 

Tip: the day you are checking out, call to arrange a bell person early (if you will be needing one). It took a really long time for them to get to our room.

Valet moved pretty quickly for the volume of people checking out. 

The food options are okay-I feel like I could have explored more but I did take advantage of breakfast at Grand Lux a few times since it was inside the casino.

Speaking of the casino, worst cocktail service. Of any hotel I went in. Ever. 

I also was not keen of the location. I used to be a north strip person but since the opening of city center, etc I wish I was closer to center strip.


I don't know if I would have paid the prices if I hadn't gotten a great deal on the room but it really is a good option, especially if you have a few people in your group and would enjoy extra room to lounge about.",0,0,0

During my stay, i ordered room service once for breakfast. one japanese breakfast set and one american breakfast that cost $70ish. i understand that room service is suppose to be expensive, but the food gotta somewhat justify the price! my japanese breakfast was beyond yuckie, the rice was too mushy and the miso soup was crazy salty.  the american breakfast was just plain old boring eggs and sauages. i was trying to cure my hangover but the crappy breakfast made it worse. even though palazzo is the same as venetian, but i will be giving venetian a try next time.",1,1,1

The hotel is of grand scale and the rooms are clean and accomodating. The down side of our stay was with the security of our stay. This is very important considering 4 ladies were staying there at the time. At approximately 2am our room was rummaged through and robbed. We reported the incident to the front desk, who then transferred us to the security department. In waiting for someone to come and take an incident report, a strange man entered the room again. This stranger saw me and left. In a panic we watched him stroll down the hall, and take up a conversation with acquaintances. Security took over 20 minutes to come to our room, discouraged us from making a report, was rude and demeaning, and not prepared with the specifics to file a report. Management would not speak to us personally, and disregarded our claim, saying that it ""was out of their hands"" since it was passed to security. after the return of our visit, we took the following actions- 
(1) I called the Director of Security yesterday, and left a message. 7:45 am
(2) I decided to wait it out for the 1st business day of the week, and follow up today 8:00 am...
We were told to follow up with Risk management. 
(3) I was then passed me onto, Bill Parker- Director of Claims. I spoke with a woman named, Amanda 8:10 am who then told me that this was not handled in their department, and asked me to call Guest Relations. 
(4) I then spoke with the coordinator of Guest Relations, Janet 8:12 am. She is now telling me that her department usually deals with ""guest satisfaction"", but graciously agreed to be my point of contact at the current moment.

So in conclusion, I was supposed to hear back from this woman by that Thursday, to give her a chance to gather the information, in which I never did. She did inform me however, that normally her department deals with ""situation of quality of room, etc."" We did not hear back from the hotel, or ever receive copies of the reports filed. We did not receive a follow up, no comps, not even an apology! Talk about the run around!!! It may not have relevance anymore, but it affected our safety, sanity, and most of all finances!!! This was the worst hotel experience I've ever had. I will never stay here again, or any affiliated hotel of this company's again, and advise the same of my loved ones. SAFETY IS PRICELESS!!!",2,1,1

I also am a huge fan of the beds - it literally feels like you are sleeping on a cloud, and it makes the hangover a lot less painful.  I also liked our view of Venetian, which at night was beautiful.   My only problem was one of our towels had a stain on it, and although the towel was clean it was still a little icky to see.  However, it was definitely something which could easily be missed by the house cleaners, so it was no big deal.

We stayed at Venetian about a month ago as well, so it was interesting to compare the two.  Honestly, Palazzo is just a smidgen above Venetian - our room was a tad more modern and I think it is just a matter of taste in decor.  Overall, it was a wonderful stay and I am sure Palazzo (or Venetian) will be a go-to for us when we visit Vegas.",1,0,0

Came to Vegas for the weekend for my girlfriend's bachelorette, and last time we came, we stayed at the Venetian. I've heard the Palazzo better than the Venetian, so I was really excited to stay here.

We arrived at around noon, but our room wasn't ready yet so we dropped our bags off. We hung out at Fashion Show Mall, got a little something to eat and drink, and passed enough time to hopefully have them get our room ready. Wrong.

They were super late with their check ins, and didn't offer any information on when they thought our room would be ready by. We spent an hour waiting at the hotel, and they finally hooked us up with a strip view suite. Awesome, but really how much was I going to be in the room?

Finally got the keys, super excited to lay in bed for a bit, and the first thing I see are someone else's dirty flip flops on the dresser. GROSS! What is this, the travelodge??

Lastly, we didn't get our bags until almost an hour later! We didn't get to have the dinner we wanted, and ended up getting tired due to all the waiting.

Going to keep this short.

Good: The rooms are spacious, well appointed and cleaned daily before 1pm Only annoyance was the pay-for-tray of water and nuts placed and secured right in front of television.
Good: The pools are numerous, the chaise lounge chairs are numerous and picked up after by the pool attendants. Pool is open until 8pm
Fair: Casino and casino drink service. Casino is a bit small, and for the low budget slot player that i am, very limited variety of slots. Drink service seemed to be omnipresent during the morning hours but difficult to find in the evening. 
Poor: The absolutely obnoxious security theater when using the elevators to go to our room. Yelling at hotel guests because they didn't show the stupid key card was something that I finally went to management for. Of course, the young manager gal responded by just spouting out the same lines that the folks who believe 911 is valid enough for everyone to be on the lookout. Probably would never go back because of this bs.

After scouring numerous sites and calling various hotels, I came to the conclusion that getting 2 Siena Suites at the Palazzo was going to be the best deal. I have absolutely no regrets.

We arrived late at night, so the line for check-in was minimal. We had 2 connecting suites, as requested (for an additional fee of course). The rooms were clean, pretty updated (although nothing like Aria or Cosmopolitan), and sleek. Each room had 2 Queen beds, a wrap-around couch with coffee table, desk area, TV, and a huge bathroom. The couch pulled out to make a sofa...easily enough room for at least 2 people if necessary.  My only qualm about the bathroom was that, although huge, the shower stall was see-through. This is fine if you're there with a significant other, but if you're there with a group of new acquaintances, it can be awkward. Whenever one of us showered, the whole bathroom was basically closed off. So, huge bathroom-great, see-through shower-not so great.

The hotel itself is connected to the Venetian which allows for tons of shopping, restaurants, and nightlife in both hotels without ever having to step outside. The Palazzo is on the North side of the strip, but still near a lot of city's attractions.

There is a Coffee Bean near the Casino, but, like everything else in Vegas, it is overpriced. Still good to have nearby, none the less.

Many pools to choose from but if you don't get there early, you'll be searching like a hawk for a lounge chair. If you come past noon and want to sit with you friends, forget about it.

We stayed at the Palazzo for a weekend convention, which took place in the Sands Expo Center, located between the Venetian and Palazzo hotels. The hotel was decorated with the ""Carnivale"" theme, and there were lots of masked performers walking around to take pictures with. 

The suites are absolutely gorgeous and very spacious! There is a separate living room area with a desk, table, a large L shaped couch, and big TV. The view of the strip was amazing. The beds were comfortable too.  The curtains are remote controlled, so you don't even have to get out of bed to open and close them. 

The bathroom was very large with a big shower, a separate jacuzzi bathtub, and big sink and counter area. They even had a sitting area in front of a mirror. The toilet was located in a separate small room of the main bathroom, which is nice for privacy if you have friends who still need to use the bathroom to get ready. The shower is see through, and the bathroom doesn't have a lock that I saw, just a warning. 

Most of our meals were catered through the convention, so we didn't actually eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel apart from the food court in the Grand Canal Shoppes. But we passed a bunch of good looking restaurants on our way to the convention center. The catered food was very good though! 

The pool area is spectacular! They are pretty strict about checking room keys on the elevators and at the entrance, so don't forget yours! Guests have access to the pools at the Venetian as well, so there's almost like 10 to choose from. We didn't have any problem finding lounge chairs, even at peak times in the afternoon. The main Palazzo pool had a shallow area so you could lay back and lounge in the water while sipping your drink, a nice touch.

We stayed at The Palazzo for the second time this past week and the rooms were great. We took my nephews to the strip to celebrate their graduation and we got two rooms that were adjoining. The rooms were not huge like the suite we had last time but were still very nice and comfortable. 

I called to book the rooms and the gentleman I talked with was very nice. He told me he would put me down for a noon check-in. I was skeptical. We live in Las Vegas and we know that an early check-in rarely happens. Check-in is at 3 and you're lucky if they have a room at 3. I told him as much. He said it helps them out to have a few early check-ins since they get swamped at 3 and he'd put in for noon and we should get it. He did admit there was a chance we wouldn't but he sounded pretty confident we would. 

I should also point out that we paid the extra money for the ""view"" suites that give you a view of the strip. So, we show up at 1:30 to check-in and they don't have anything ready. Ugh. I'm irritated but I knew this was most likely going to happen. So, I just go with it. She said she found adjoining suites but they needed to be cleaned. I made sure to ask if they were strip view. She said they were. 

So, we leave our luggage with guest services and head out to explore the strip until we get the call that our rooms are ready. They called at 3:30. We left the nephews to explore on their own and my husband and I went back to the hotel. Our rooms are on the 6th floor. Already I'm getting a bad feeling. How much of a view can you get from the 6th floor? We get into the rooms and I'm disappointed to find that our view is of the pool and we have zero view of the strip. I was very upset as I had specifically asked, and had been assured, TWICE that we had strip view rooms. I was going to call and bitch about it even though I hate being that person. But I paid for something I didn't get. However, my nephews assured me they loved the room and they didn't mind having a view of the pool. lol   Plus, we weren't in the room long enough that it really mattered. I just wanted them to have an awesome Vegas experience and a view of the strip from the hotel room would have gone a long way toward that. 

Other than that, we enjoyed our stay. Room service is so excellent at The Palazzo. The food is delicious and service is outstanding. The staff there is so friendly.

I would say that the space, facilities, and amenities are quite good -- around four stars, if not quite the blowout extravaganza of five stars. However, the level of service I got there was fairly atrocious, and the overall feel of the place was just a faint bit shabby. 

The stay was hurt by the fact that I spent the earlier part of the week at the Bellagio for a conference, so the service there was still fresh in my head. 

Here's what I can think of as negatives off the top of my head:

- Our first night there, we paid for an upgraded sweet to get a hot tub (well, 'jetted tub' -- PS to Vegas hotels, make it easier to get a hot tub!). The first night, we got in a room where a lot of stuff weirdly wasn't working, and it was strangely undecorated. When I called down in the morning, they said, ""Oh, sorry, we put you in an *unfinished room*"". They comped us the night (good), but it was still one of the nights of our trip in a crappy room.

- Several times, the servers just seemed surly or untrained. The Palazzo has a pool that closes perversely early (like a lot of Vegas hotels, weirdly). When we showed up to use the pool at 6pm, we were sternly turned away by attendants who looked at us like we were proles. I left feeling like, ""how DARE I try to use the pool after hours?"" 

- The maid service really left something to be desired; leaving behind empty bottles on several occasions. 

- Little bits of cheapskatery. Like, we were promised $X of credit at slot machines on the casino floor. X wasn't large, but it is fun -- well, until we discovered it was only valid on certain machines, and the certain machines were all penny or nickel slots, and not very fun. I mean, hey, free slot credits is free slot credits, but it just felt sort of po', you know?

To the Palazzo's credit:

* Good rooms (well, assuming you get a finished one) for the price
* Some good restaurants there and in the Venetian (Dos Caminos is a fave of mine for lunch + drinks)
* Conveniently located near the Venetian, the Wynn, Encore, and all the stuff around those casinos
* The casino is super easy to get around -- always a big plus when your sense of direction is as bad as mine.

Conclusion:

At the end of the day, my 3 stars is relative to the cost and expectations I have for something that bills itself as a five star Vegas hotel. In some ways when a hotel tries to be more than it is, and I felt like this was definitely operative when it came to the Palazzo. Not saying you'll be disappointed to go here -- unless you've stayed at the Wynn, the Bellagio, or a real five star hotel elsewhere. 

Probably worth it if you can score a deal on a room.",1,0,0

We got 2 rooms (one was for my mother) and booked through Travelocity.  The room was what I expected (very similar to our room at the Venetian) with a king bed and sunken living room, etc.  The room was aesthetically pleasing and for the most part, very clean except that the cleaning person left a pill wrapper on the floor and forgot to give us the shower mat two days in a row which was a bit annoying.  Check-in was easy and the front-desk staff was friendly.  My only complaint is about the $32 resort fee that is charged daily.  I know this is the standard in Las Vegas now and when I checked in, the front desk staff explained that resort fee includes the wifi, spa access, a daily newspaper, phone access, etc.  When we stayed at the Venetian 3 years ago, the newspaper was at our door every morning.  My mom enjoys reading the newspaper and I was surprised that it was nowhere to be found this time.  Upon checking out, I asked about the newspaper and was told that they stopped delivering it to every room since most people don't read it and it was a waste of paper.  I completely get this and understand however it would have been nice when I checked in if the clerk had said ""if you would like the newspaper, you need to show your key card to Café Presse and you will be given the newspaper"".  In general, Vegas is very expensive now and I disagree with paying the resort fee.  It's just another way for the hotels to make more money and in the case of my husband, myself and my mother, we did not use any of the amenities that the fee supposedly covers.  We did not use the phone, the wifi, the newspaper, the spa, etc.  I personally think that the fee should be waived if one does not use any of these amenities.  I complained upon check-out about the shower mat missing and the newspaper availability and in fairness, they offered to reverse the fee for 1 night for each room.  I asked to have the fee waived for all 3 nights for 1 room and they agreed.  I still don't like paying the fee for the other room but I understand this is standard practice now.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Palazzo; it is a beautiful hotel and I would not hesitate to stay there again but the resort fee added to an already expensive get-away.",0,0,0

Only cons have to deal with the pool - lots of construction. During the week, we couldn't hear the music by the pool, just the sounds of the jack hammers. I get that the work needs to be done, but couldn't they give folks a drink voucher or just a nice offer to recognize that we are paying full price for a loud, disruptive pool experience? We even walked around the entire complex - basically construction was either extremely loud, or faintly annoying. 

 If you're going during the week for a honeymoon or another romantic or special event, might want to stay somewhere else. Also, they were out of their souvenir cups, and they still charged the same amount for drinks in big plastic cups.

We've stayed in either the Venetian or Palazzo more than five times and have never been disappointed.  If you have a big group, this is the place to stay at because they also have sofa beds and the rooms are classy, spacious, and clean.  On top of that, they have a good selection of restaurants on the property and nice pools.  

On our most recent stay, the room I had booked at Palazzo was unavailable, but they graciously upgraded us to the Penthouse suite in the Venetian instead, which was AMAZING.  I couldn't believe how lucky we were.  They me if I wanted a piano or a fireplace, which I thought was pretty funny.  Why would you need a fireplace in a hotel?  So we opted for the grand piano even though none of us could play it.  The Penthouse suite was HUGE and more than enough space for us.  There was also a sound system that was easy to use.  After a long night of clubbing, we all soaked our feet in the giant tub with the complimentary bath salts.  They also had Robert Cavalli toiletries when we stayed in the Penthouse, but they smelled very masculine.  

I hope we get the chance to stay in one of their Penthouse suites again because it really made our trip memorable!",0,1,1

over booked, didn't have a room available (already paid in full.)

gave us an 'upgrade' to an old, dark, huge room.

called us the next morning and made us move rooms.

went to the pool-- kid pooped in it, lifeguard staff asked everyone to get out. over the next 30 min, unknowing pool-goers jumped into the poop water and swam around until the lifeguards noticed (too busy chatting with one another.) happened at least 4 times.

ordered a $20 chicken caesar salad from wolfgang puck's poolside restaurant--- arrived without chicken or croutons or dressing. just plain romaine.

Also, during the day you can head over to the pool at the venetian and lounge around tao beach with all lovely beach bunnies that are dressed more appropriate for clubbing than getting in the pool for a swim :P 

Another benefit is that all the rooms are suites so they're very spacious! The extra sofa\/sofa bed is a great addition is definitely better than sleeping on the floor. The bathroom is roomy and has a lot of counter space next to the double sinks as well as a small vanity across from the shower to lay out your arsenal of make up (And that is important to us gals!) Also there's a flat screen TV in the bathroom which makes getting ready so much more entertaining! My only grip is that the bathtub isn't a equipted with jets that would really make the rooms perfect, b\/c after a long day\/night of dancing and drinking soaking your sore #11s in a hot jacuzzi tub just feels sooooo goood!

- Fully stocked bar (although a bit pricy). *NOTE* Look over your bill, we were charged 9 dollars for a bag of chips we never ate, which AR gladly refunded so no biggie.
- Bed was a bit too hard for me, my guest thought it was too soft... perhaps it was right in between so i give them a thumbs up for getting it at a level'd softness
- Must have key card to enter guest area... this keeps all the random yahoo's and prostitutes away from my sleeping area haha
- Great restaurants - seriously though, this place has some of the tastiest food... The little Mexican place by the ""venetian river"" is delicious. Worth mentioning that the sous chef came out and accomodated a guest who is allergic to garlic (thanks for the custom plate Ricardo!).

- NO COFEE MAKER?!?!?! at $350 dollars a night, i expect a cute blonde bringing me a coffee, and you're telling me I can't make it myself?

- NO FREE INTERNET?!? Seriously though, at this day and age this is like not pre-slicing a store bought loaf of bread...

This is our second time in Las Vegas this year.  The first time we stayed at the Encore and this time at the Palazzo.  Both are upscale hotels that have luxury accommodations and quality guest rooms and many professional staff members.  During non-school times of years I like to travel with our extremely well behaved 6 year old son.  

The guest suite tower is located through the Casino.  There is actually a change in the carpet pattern that separates the Casino area vs the walking corridor from the Hotel entrance to the hotel guest accommodations.  On this trip we traveled with other family friends and customarily met in the walking corridor on numerous occasions in order to meet up for meal periods. Today we were actually accosted by a member of the security force who took it upon himself to tell me that I could not have a child in the Casino.  I agreed with him and certainly knew that minors were not permitted in the casino.  He then took it upon himself to tell me that we were not permitted to be there (in the corridor) en route to the Venetian Hotel where were were going to see the National Geographic Exhibit.  

I told the security officer that we are hotel guests and that this corridor was the only way to go through the premises.  He was completely unprofessional and argumentative, treating hotel guests like riffraff. He informed me in no uncertain terms that I was to keep moving.  

The member of the security force was a middle-aged man (mid to late 50's) visually of Asian ancestry.  My thought was that he was of ancestry from the Philippines.  I say this so that hopefully Hotel Management pursues the retraining of this individual, although the way we were treated it would indicate to me that he may be a retired police officer that feels it appropriate to tell hotel guests to ""keep moving"".  

I called down to the front desk and spoke to the manager on duty about this very surprising occurrence.  He was professional and apologetic but I still have to wonder if this is a hotel that wants to have families with kids staying on the premises.  I encourage other hotel guests to report about their experiences at the Palazzo as it related to being a child friendly hotel environment for families with children.  Please use this arena to report as well as Trip Advisor.  Each hotel uses Google search words to stay in touch about what guests are saying about their property.  If they see that there are other guests that have had like or similar experiences, they will make it an action item and it will spark some positive changes.  Please share your genuine experiences in a fair and unemotional manor.",2,2,0

- Two flat screen TV's in each room, which I thought was pointless.
- Pull out sofa bed, sofa's comfortable by itself.
- Large safe.
- Housekeeping stopped by during the evening asking if we needed anything.

CONS:
- Strange smell in the casino, which gave my entire family headaches (we later concluded Palazzo did this on purpose, so you can't gamble ""properly"").
- Even stranger smell in the hotel room, which was worse than the casino smell.  Like other people have noted in earlier reviews, smelled sort of like bacon.
- Hand\/bath soap smelled like fruit loops cereal.  By this point, we concluded whomever chose the scents for the Palazzo either doesn't have the ability to smell, is super fat, or insane.
- Not enough water pressure from the shower head in the shower.
- Not enough lights in the suite, therefore too dark.
- Both concierge and housekeeping is terrible, we waited an hour and half for pillows, tissue boxes, and bath slippers.
- Sofa was comfortable, but was dirty and stained.
- Almost tripped walking into the sunken living room.

A good combination of wonderful memories, great service, roomy suites, a terrific location (and more), will keep me a continued guest.

I just think this place gives you the most bang for the buck. I've traveled a lot and stayed in many hotels in my life, and the spacious regular guest suites put the Palazzo a cut above other upscale hotels. It could just be the few steps that separate the bed from the couch space, but the suites just feel much roomier. Nothing looks outdated, and I've never had an issue with the service - a true testament to their professionalism... the first time my fiance and I stayed here together (before we were engaged), the man at the front desk checking us in asked us if I was the ""Mrs."". Simultaneously, my man said ""yes"" out of convenience, and I said ""no"" out of truth... A-W-K-W-A-R-D. I don't know if it's because it's Vegas and they get this stuff all the time, but even though the Palazzo is more upscale, that check-in man was gracious and moved on like a PRO.  Seriously, talk about making ALL of your clients feel welcome.

Additionally, the hotel's proximity to everything I love about Vegas is terrific. With a good shopping mall adjacent and the Wynn shops nearby, everything is within walking distance.

I've been to Vegas all throughout my life and have stayed at many of the big names, but this is currently my favorite. Here why:

1.) ACCOMMODATIONS --The rooms are absoutely pefect. Being an all-suite hotel, they are the largest standard rooms in Vegas at 720 sq. ft., with the Venetian coming a close second. Tastefully decorated, perfect lighting, remote controlled blinds, large bathrooms, and 3 large beds. This was probably the main reason why I wanna return here.

2.) CHARM -- CityCenter may be nice an all, but I feel like it doesn't have the Vegas charm and character that most other hotels have on the Strip. Palazzo definitely sets itself apart with its Italian design and amazing architecture

3.) POOL -- Staying here is great because you have access to all of the 7 pools or so at Palazzo *along* with Ventian's pools and TAO BEACH. Now compared to other party pools in Vegas, Tao Beach kinda sucks.. It's small, crowded, and kinda dirty. But you can easily have a great time here. So just be warned if it's not your scene.

4.) NIGHTLIFE -- TAO and LAVO are always a great time. Just make sure you arrive early (like 10) if you don't want to wait in line forever. Hotel guests usuallly get in free with an even ratio of guys to girls, but it was Labor Day weekend so ended up droppin $30 a head, not too shabby. NOTE: Drinks are $$$$ here!

5.) CLIENTELE -- Young crowd and high rollers. Good looking people everywhere

6.) RESTAURANTS -- My favorite, the Grand Lux Cafe is a more upscale Cheesecake Factory with decent prices for Vegas, large portions, and is open almost 24\/7 (well the one in the Venetian is). Also, Trattoria Reggiano is some really great to fill an Italian fix with reasonable prices. Unfortunate there's no buffet here, but if you want that go across to the Wynn for a great experience (or the Mirage's Cravings buffet for a little less dough)

7.) SHOPPING -- Well, to be honest I didn't do that much shopping here. But it's nice to walk through here and have the option to shop at nice places if I wanted to.. Grand Canal Shoppes are huge. Personally theres better things in Vegas i'd rather be doing!! But I know a lot of people are into this.

8.) LOCATION -- The North Strip has definitely become the hot spot of Vegas. And this is definitely right in the middle of all the action. Wynn, Encore, Caesars, Bellagio, Mirage are all super close.

Only complaint was they originally put us in a room that was dirty, which was annoying. The front desk staff seemed a little disorganized but it wasn't really a big deal.

Oh and WINNING at Pai Gai Poker here also made me a happy camper :D

Rooms (4): As many have said, it's just a Venetian room in brown color tones. I'm kind of jaded as I've stayed in many 4\/5 star rooms in Vegas (mandalay, venetian, caesars,etc) so I didn't find that this one was all that exciting or spectacular. It was however very nice and on par with a 5 star hotel.

Restaurants\/Shopping (5): Incredible, tons of great restaurants and lots of great shopping. Shops are open until 11! however, not any good casual options.

Pool (3): Ok so as a word of warning.. the pool at palazzo doesn't get sun until 1 PM!!! Ok so you're thinking you might be sleeping till 1 Pm anyways, but good luck getting a chair at that point without paying the pool guys a fat tip. Also, no food served pool side! You have to get up and get your food (I'm a prima donna, I know) and the food isn't that good and WAY overpriced. Also drink service was lacking.. I should have moved over to the Venetian side I guess?

Nightlife Gaming (3): High limits ($15) for craps.. no surprise there. Lavo was just ok, but I'd like to explore the jazz bar next time. 40\/40 sucks. I did however enjoy the happy hour at the cheesy ""del toro"" in the basement. $6 drinks ,  I guess that's cheap? At least it had a nice strip view. Oh the sportsbook sucks too.. it's just a window near 40\/40. boo

Ease of navigation (5): So this is important to me in Vegas.  I hate walking 30 minutes to my room, or having trouble finding craps,  restaurants, etc. This place is EASY. 1 tower of elevators, everything is well situated. Pool right off the elevators. That aspect is very nice.

Overall a great place to stay, but with so many other great places to stay in Vegas I'd save this one for when you get a great offer in the mail. I would especially recommend this place for foodies due to all the yummy restaurants and how easy it is to pass out in your room after a nice meal !",1,1,1

1.  Worst thing was the smoke smell in the room.  Our first room smelled like smoke.  I asked for a different room.  They apologized, and put me in a different room, with a strip view for the inconvenience.  They said they cannot control what people do in their nonsmoking rooms (but they can, they can charge a cleaning fee).  Our second room was even worse, but i figured that was just the way it was, and wasn't going to complain again.

2.  Our shower obviously hadn't been cleaned.  The first time we used it, we were stepping on two plastic covers from disposable razors.  That grossed me out.  I called housekeeping, asking them to clean it properly, was passed to a manager, who seemed irritated by my complaint.  (and can I just say, I'm really not a complainer, but when I spend $250-300 plus tax for a room, I expect more).

3.  Bed was incredibly hard.  Couch was very comfy, I actually thought about sleeping there. :)

Other minor things:
1.  Only got our newspaper about half the days
2.  Only two drinking glasses in the entire room.  Which we used for cocktails.  Had to drink water out of wineglasses.  
3.  Paid for the prestige level, wasn't really worth it.  Free open bar at night was nice.  Breakfast had a huge spread, but not much in the way of savory items like eggs or cheese.
4.  Despite high end finishes in the room (marble) they were poorly constructed.  Corner shelf in shower looked like it was about to fall off.  Knob holding the towel bar on the glass shower door fell off.",1,1,1

How am I clueless? Just because I had a way much more better experience than you doesn't mean I can't write and provide MY opinion about it. I am so fortunate to have had the experience and service I did for the 3 nights that I stayed here. Unfortunately, the reality is they can't make EVERYONE happy.

END EDIT. 

First off, beautiful resort! Stayed for three nights. Definitely worth the pricing. Extremely friendly staff all around and no issues with checking in. You can tell the staff actually enjoys what they do here (even the house keepers). 

We got a suite with a king bed and it was amazing! Beautiful setting and definitely felt like a real getaway. Bed was so comfortable and the shades let us sleep so damn well. And the tub, LOVED the tub.

Although thick and fluffy, it's kinda small in width. I wish they had larger pillows for that size of a bed I had. Elevators were quick for me and I was on the 44th floor.

The rooms, therefore, are especially spacious with lots of bells and whistles (3 TVs in a standard suite, for example). And right now, they are offering GREAT deals (as low as $169\/night during March Madness).

Beware, however, of the upgrade option when you check into the hotel. We were offered a $125\/night opportunity to upgrade to a much larger, even more luxurious suite upon check-in. We passed just because we didn't need it and preferred to spend that money elsewhere. The reservationist then decided to ""kindly"" offer us the upgrade for free. We just had to wait for the room.

Well, when we were called to get the keys for our room, the upgrade was revoked. Turns out, these folks do not actually have the authority to offer such perks. So we had our hopes up for nothing, and then felt kinda duped. Worse, there was no real apology or explanation - just an attempt to get us outta there as quickly as possible.

This amateur experience aside, the hotel is lovely with a lot of great restaurants and of course the shops! This is the west coast flagship Barney's, people! So get your wallets ready.",0,0,0

...except when writing a Yelp review. 

I stayed in one of The Palazzo's Bella Suites with 2 girlfriends on a mini vacay and absolutely loved it. Our room was gorgeous and luxurious, with 2 queen beds and a sunken living room that boasted an l-shaped sofa, a dining table and a large flat screen tv. We also had a fantastic view of the strip and all the excitement Vegas has to offer. But perhaps my favorite aspect of the suite was the bathroom. A telephone by the toilet? Yep. A flat screen in the main bathroom? That, too. An awesome vanity perfect for a gaggle of girls all trying to get ready at once? Uh huh. The bathroom, in my opinion, was perfection. 

It was Vegas, after all, so we didn't spend a ton of time in our (not so) humble accommodations. But since this review is purely about The Palazzo, I'll reflect on the time we actually spent at the resort. The weather was warm and sunny throughout our stay, so we posted up poolside soaking up the sun and absorbing the sights and sounds of Vegas during prime tanning time. When we weren't donning our swimwear, we enjoyed happy hour at Sushisamba, dinner at Tao (we might've sat adjacent to that dude who got lost in The Hangover), pretended like we knew what we were doing in the casino, sipped champagne, and shopped. Oh man, the shopping. I could really spend days in Vegas on shopping alone. If only I had the dough to satiate my fashion desires. The Shoppes at The Palazzo include gems like Chloe, Christian Louboutin, and DVF (and of course the designer offerings only continue down the strip). Needless to say, there was a lot of inner struggle and practicing of self-control during this Vegas visit.

Moral of the story is: The Palazzo provided the ideal home base for three girls and their Vegas adventures. I'd probably stay somewhere different next time, but only because it's fun to experience something new.

And if you thought I was going to reveal any escapades based on my review intro... so sorry, some of what happens in Vegas actually stays in Vegas.",8,4,6

Nice furniture, well appointed desk with all-in-one printer\/scanner\/fax ready to go. Three TVs, No corners cut on the bathroom. Sunken living room was nicely done, lots of comfy seating. Views were nice for our room covering the pool and spa below, Treasure Island the Northern heart of the strip.  Only about 20% view was humdrum as it encompassed the mall, off-strip Trump building and it's adult superstore. Bedding was nice, but not superior. Nice privacy with good sound control. Checkin and checkout was perfect except my son setting off the snack detector by lifting the box of gummy bears to take a look, but the front desk removed it without quarrel.  Casino was nice, A\/C worked quickly and smoothly, parking wasn't bad, amentities in the room were adequate, and free wifi was sure and steady and very much appreciated. We enjoyed our two night stay and will consider returning.

But, room for improvement. Map for Palazzo are more detailed at the Venetion. Once you approve Palazzo, they grow devoid of details, like where the theatre is. I know the idea is to drive people to the Casino, but we lost our prime seats at the show trying to find their showcase theatre. The Fridge is totally full of sensored drinks, no room to safely stick in your own half liter bottle. Kinda sad making long ice runs in the 21st century just to acheive cool water. Way too few towels for a ""luxury suite"". Double doors at the bathroom are a total hassle, they overlap the front door's arc and the noisy catches kind suck when you have to open booth to smoothly egress in the dark. Biggest letdown, housekeeping. Three drawers were full of laundry\/clothing from a previous guest. One draw was not attached to the tracks and fell out if you opened it in the chest. Small candy wrappers and misc scraps littered the floor on checkin. On our one morning, we walked out and greeted the housekeeper as we pulled the DND tag from the door. On our return, the tag was back on the door and room untouched! Wow. Was our tip and request for more towels not worthy of their service?",0,0,0

The main lobby was gorgeous and you don't have to walk around a maze just to get to your room like many of the other Vegas hotels (you might not think this makes that much of a difference, but when you're tired from a day\/night on the strip and you want to get back to your room quickly, you really don't want to take like 3 different elevators + walk through 2 different lobbies, etc... *achem* Venetian). 

The rooms large suites and are a bit newer and more modern than their sister resort next door, the Venetian, but pretty much comparable. The only difference I really noticed was that the Venetian has the sunken living-room, while in the Palazzo it is not sunken. We were given a room on the 45th floor, with a room over-looking the strip. The view wasn't that great because it was partially obstructed, and we were facing the north side with Wynn & Encore, instead of the side were you get the view of the south-side of the strip where everything is. 

I have to downgrade it to 4 stars for two reasons. First of all, the check-in took forever. We arrived at about 2:30pm on a TUESDAY and had to stand in a line for well over 30 minutes, with people in front of us who stood there forever and didn't know what they wanted... There was a young couple standing there flipping through their book trying to decide what kind of room they wanted and they were there holding up the line since before we even got in line, and they were still there after we left... C'mon people, checking-in really shouldn't take you that long... I think they should have separate lines for people that have already pre-booked everything in advance, and one for people who haven't booked the room and need to decide what they want.

Secondly, as others have said, it was impossible getting a hold of anyone at the front desk over the phone. I was on hold for over 40 minutes and I eventually gave up and just walked down to the front desk. Even when I pressed the button the phone for ""priority service"" they just transfer you to being on hold FOREVER. Apparently, it seems like a typical problem with them during peak hours as I have read on the other reviews here. Even when I went to the concierge, they just told me that they get really busy during the peak check-in hours and to call back later (this type of under-staffing or lack of service isn't what I typically expect of a 5 star). When I finally did get service though, the staff was friendly and helpful, but I just didn't like how I had to jump through circles to get a hold of them. 

All in all, it was a good experience here. Everything with the room was perfect except for those few things. However, given the ""service"" I experienced here, next time, if given the option, I might just pick the Venetian and the crazy long walk (seriously, are they trying to make it like the maze under the Paris Opera-house to match their Phantom of the Opera show or something??) over the Palazzo.",4,3,2

In-room wifi was unreliable, and seemed to blacklist some devices when using a VPN on non-standard ports.

The in-room ""fridge"" was dominated by drinks from the hotel, offering no room for any food items you might want to take back to your room, such as a dessert, cookies, or anything you might want to refrigerate.

The room had 2 beds plus a pull-out (sofa expands to bed) but this is not designed for taller people. Anyone taller than 5 foot 6 inches will probably have their feet hanging over the edge of the bed.

Case in point; on a recent visit to Vegas my wife, niece and I did some shopping at the North Las Vegas Outlet.  We made several purchases, including two identical purchases that my wife and neice made from one of the oulet stores.  Upon our return to the Palazzo, we had our car Valet parked and left all of our purchases in the back of our SUV.  We did not take the car out again until the next morning when we checked out to go home.  We stopped no where between the hotel and our home in Southern California.  When we got home, we noticed that the two purses were missing.

I immediately called the hotel and was conected with the Security Department, who initiated an investigation.  A week later when I called for an update on their investigation, the facility's Risk Management Office informed me that the investigation had been closed with no action to be taken.  I was informed that the hotel would not reimburse us for the missing purses, which did not surprise me as that was not my reason for requesting the investigation.  What did surprise me was their insistance that the hotel takes no responsibility for items left in your car even when they have charge of the vehicle.  I thought at a minimum that they would at least offer to comp us for a room on our next visit, as a good will gesture.  Nada!

If you even wiggle the fridge wrong it will get angry at you and you'll have to pay for it. One day I decided I wanted a frapachino so I poped it open only to be greeted with a year expired gross milk disgust.

This was my first time staying here and I gotta say the room was more than what I expected.  Typically, rooms in Vegas are pretty small, think 300-400 sq. ft.  When booking the room I noticed that their regular rooms were close to 800 sq. ft.  Hmm, more room's always nice.  So it was a treat having a separate sunken living room with a big sofa that could actually fit me lying down.  

3 different flat screens, living room, bedroom and bathroom areas means I can have multiple games on at once.  Muahaha.  Pretty cool vibe, throughout the casino and the hotel.  Got to check in early and reception was pretty expedient and knowledgeable.",0,0,0

Of course, bed space is limited, but it can fit everyone in terms of partying, a place to lay down, and a decent sized bathroom and mirror space in order to get all the girls ready for the night.

I'm able to get my bags safely to my room, a cab ready to take me where I need to go, and a beautiful homebase during my trips to Vegas.

Check-in(2 stars). This is really slow as it is a busy hour. I arrived 11am of busiest day and the long line was already formed.

When i came back  at 3pm she wanted me to wait until 5pm again because the room was not ready. I was really disappointed. But finally she changed our nice suite to the regular suite and i didnt need to pay resort fee($50). I didn't know whether smile or sad.

Room(5 stars). gorgeous and spacious with the view. The room is very clean, modern. It has everything: 3TVs, bar area, a nice bathroom, a spacious closet, couches, desk and dinning table. 

Pool area(4 stars). This is huge. There is many different kinds of pools with the beach chairs. I can choose loud or quiet, family friendly or vibe, deep or shallow. The staffs serve towels and sliced cucumbers to cool down the hot face. We had a great time under the shade area wading and splashing.

Amenities(5 stars). There are so many gorgeous restaurants, bar area, and also casino. i am not a casino person and enjoyed the fancy restaurant such as Morels french restaurant, Bouchon. When we checked in, the hotel gave us coupon booklet and discounted a lot.

Checked out by phone call and sent us bell boy when i needed.

Parking(5 stars). Valet parking and bell boy are for free when we stay this hotel. They are very kind and very helpful. Even though we checked out early, our belonging could stay in the hotel until we left hotel completely.",2,2,2

Every member of staff from the bellhop taking ur bags from the limo to the broken English house keeping staff are genuinely courteous and will greet you ALL the time.

If you need anything at all, they will drop whatever theyre doing to help.  The rooms are a 10\/10 by far, 3 flat screen TVs, huge sectional sofa, a shower that I wish I coulda taken home with me, you name it!

Bedroom: I'd have to say most hotel beds are incredibly comfortable and this one did not stray from that ideal. It was a little tougher(harder) and Aria's was softer. 

Bathroom: I LOVE this bathroom. When I buy a house, I want this bathroom.
-Vanity: The vanity makes it really convenient to put on makeup but the light up vanity mirror that extended out from the wall unfortunately did not light up when I pressed the button. It wasn't a big deal but the one at Aria worked so it's worth mentioning. 
-Tub and Shower: My boyfriend and I were able to fit into the tub and the shower together comfortably. The shower had great water pressure. 
-Cleanliness: A+
-Layout: Makes getting ready very easy. With a bathroom so big, my boyfriend would be able to shower or go to the bathroom while I put on makeup or blowdried my hair. No one was ever in the way. 

Suite: I love how all the Palazzo rooms are suites. They're so spacious making my stay in Aria seem like I was in a box. 

Televisions: One in literally every room. I love how you can watch on the couch, in bed or even in the tub. Or you can watch a different show if you don't want to watch what your significant other is watching. 

Layout: I found the layout to be inconvenient in the beginning. Self-Parking is in the back of the hotel, right next to the guest elevators but hotel registration is all the way, ALL THE WAY across the casino where the front door is. This walk isn't bad except when you're carrying a bunch of luggage back and forth from the back of the casino to the front and back.

Cool Little Things: 
-Ice Bucket- It had a suction type lid keeping the ice frozen for longer. Aria's was just one of those regular tin buckets you get at the Marriott. 
-Remote for the shades- That was fun to play with. 
-Robes: Very comfortable, thick and plush! If they were cheaper, I would have actually paid to have one sent to my house. Aria's robes felt paper thin and as absorbant as a piece of paper compared to these. 
-Safe: Inside one of the chests. Holds alot, I was able to put everything I needed (laptop, wallet, sunglasses, etc etc) in there.
-Mirror in the room hallway: Very convenient since it's full length and the one in the bathroom is not.

I will definitely be back here when I finish staying at the rest of the hotels I want to try out.",1,1,1

It's hard to top the Venetian and Bellagio, but at the Palazzo property, they have done just that in this latest addition to the Las Vegas strip.

The planners clearly thought of the experience from an end-to-end perspective:  transportation drop-off and pick-up options are put in precisely the right place, sparing guests awful long lines of wandering people, and facilitating fast transportation to and from this amazing property.

Upon arrival, you are greeted with a prompt, efficient, front desk.  My reservation was setup precisely as requested, and the staff guided me efficiently (i.e. not winding through the casino floor) to the guest elevators.  Bell desk service was prompt and professional, with my bags arriving at precisely the right time (a few minutes right after I reached the room.)

The splendor of the rooms is hard to describe.  The amenities and finishings are top-notch, the housekeeping services reliable, and the beverage center well-stocked.

The business center amenities in room are setup properly, as are the furnishings.  Little touches like under surface lighting near the television allow for appropriate lighting settings for viewing.  The bathrooms are elegant but not overdone, and are well kept.

The spa is top notch, and you will find the staff there equally as courteous and efficient.  Restaurants and dining options in the hotel are tastefully executed, and having sampled many of them, can speak to the same level of focus from the staff found elsewhere.

1. Palazzo parking is VERY plentiful and very convenient. The parking garage entrance is located on Sands Blvd.

2. The elevators can deliver you directly to the casino floor or to the guest check-in area or to the first set of guest elevators located near Sweet Surrender.

3. The gaming area is neat and clean, some celeb sightings have been talked about! Apparently Shaq was around when my girlfriend and I were staying.

4. The Palazzo is connected to the Venetian. The walkway is BEAUTIFUL and really reminds me of the Bellagio gardens on a much smaller scale.

5. There is a Grand Lux Cafe on this side of the property too! I'll write a future review on this Cheesecake Factory styleish place!

6. Slipping a $20 for the $20 tip trick never hurt! It worked to secure us a room facing the strip on a very high floor!

As part of our grand five star hotel binge, my girlfriend and I settled on the Palazzo as one of our many hotel destinations. Having stayed in the Venetian years ago and being very unimpressed, I had some doubts on the accommodations. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of our room and the service of the staff.

I'm going to divide this review into three sections, one talking about the hotel itself, the casino, and the amenities and service portion. First, with the hotel itself, the location is a great location but a bit farther north of the strip. Things are not really in walk in distance unless you're looking to get to the fashion outlets across the street or to visit Wynn\/Encore across the way. Otherwise, you're not really in the center of all the action.

Besides the location though, the accommodations as I've mentioned are very comfortable. My favorite part of the Palazzzo was the illusion that the room was much larger than it really was. They had a small descending staircase that led into a living room. The living room itself had an L shaped couch that was comfortable and a large plasma TV. The bed was comfortable, but a bit too soft as I recall.

As for the casino portion of the Palazzo, it's a little smaller than the action across the way in the Venetian. What it gives up in this respect is that there are far fewer players here and it's a little more intimate and smoke light in the area. The problem here is if you want to enjoy EVERY variety of table game, it might be hard to strike up a game with other people. The slot variety and machines are pretty good, but then again, there are fewer slots so that means if you do have a favorite, it will be harder for you to find one you want to play at.

Lastly on the amenities and the service, I find that the Palazzo doesn't set itself apart from many other hotels. Tipping is standard and everything that is offered is as it should be. Other places like the Aria or Bellagio or the Wynn will have service people greeting you in the halls and treating you like you're a welcome and invited guests. Anyways, the best part of the Palazzo is the connecting walk to the Venetian. There is a very beautiful Bellagio Gardensesque attraction there with fountains and other things to see that change seasonally. The problem here is that there is a foul... smell... that sometimes randomly occurs. It is so terrible that I personally believe it's a sewage issue? It's just in that connecting hall. 

Anyways, the Palazzo is a great place to stay! The rooms are still comfortable, and the action is quieter, which is a good change of pace from the quicker tables out on the strip. Have fun!",3,1,2

But tonight I really turned a corner.  I can deal with the annoying security stops in the parking lot.  But two bar incidents have me needing to downgrade this place to 3 stars.

The first happened last week.  Earlier in the summer, I went into Palazzo and was thrilled to discover they comp Duvels at one of their casino bars.  Duvels are expensive, and delicious, so I tipped generously for this ""free""drink while gambling.  So I came back last week, and not only did the bartender not comp me a Duvel, he told me ""no bartender can comp Duvel.""  Umm, yes, they can, because they did.  ""No they didn't.""  OK, I cashed out and went to another bar, and chalked it up to one dude having a bad day.

So after tonight's Yelp event, I brought some out of town friends to one of Palazzo's bars.  I explained how getting free drinks while gambling works... how you have to put $20 in and bet $1.25 each hand.  He got it.  So I was gambling and got a Macallan 12, and he got whatever he was drinking.  Bartender change, and now I can't get Macallan anymore, and my friend had to put in another $20 because ""you can't get free drinks all night on $20.""  What?  I've lived in Las Vegas 7 years, and the only time I've gotten guff was from a disgruntled bartender or from the Wynn\/Encore.

Listen, if you're worried about your boss coming down on you, that's one thing.  But you're arbitrarily making up rules just to be a dick here.  Yes, there are cameras on all gaming areas, but no boss is yelling at you tomorrow because you comped a drink with $12 balance.  I tried to explain how if I was winning money at video poker that I would last a long time on $20, but the guy just didn't get it.

Long story short, we both felt unwelcome, so we cashed out and brought our gaming and tipping elsewhere.  I'm really surprised that Palazzo is encouraging their bartenders to make their patrons feel this way, and I hope it stops IMMEDIATELY.",3,1,0

There's two queen beds, a pull out couch in the living room, along with two flat screen TV...and a TV in the bathroom too!

Seriously my FAVORITE place to stay at in Vegas...came here again at the beginning of summer! The room can seriously fit up to 15 people - as long as you don't mind getting comfortable with everyone lol. Spacious rooms and AC and the casino doesn't even really reek with cigs like most places.

The check in line was long upon arrival, but it moved in a steady pace and we were checked into our luxury suite rather quickly. All of the rooms here are suites, but we upgraded for a luxury suite to get a nice view. Our room was on the thirtieth floor overlooking the pool and the Strip. It wasn't much to look at during the day, but at night, it was breathtaking. 

The room was well appointed with a king size bed, full bathroom with quality toiletries. There were three TV's and a separate living area with sofa and loveseat. The sofa was a sleeper, we could've had two more people stay comfortably since the room was over seven hundred twenty square feet. 

The Palazzo is connected to the Venetian which was another plus. There is a Walgreens connected to the Palazzo on the bottom floor which made it extra convenient to get our bottled waters. 

We liked the fact that it's connected to the Venetian. With that in mind, the number of shops, restaurants, cafes, spas, and nightclubs are endless. I highly recommend the Palazzo if you want to take in as much as you can, on the Strip. 

Oh, and if you are environmentally conscious:
They recycle everything here!
The hotel runs on solar power, with thousands of solar powered panels on the roof tops, it's quite incredible! Everything is running off of the solar panels! 
There are employees who are in charge of separating all of the waste, from plastic, paper, and compost waste.

- you can buy a day pass to the spa for $20. Do it. The steam room and dry sauna will make it worth the money. Or if you just like ""Herbal Laconium"" humid rooms. 

- killer views if you get a west or southwest-facing room. 

Note-worthy items in the sitting area: sectional couch in this sweet gold (velvety?) fabric and a leather rolling ottoman. The room also had a TV in every room and a small fridge with all your not-complimentary extras - booze, soda etc. 

Common knowledge but: you have 30 seconds to put down an item if you pick it up from the fridge and\/or snack caddy above. After 30 seconds, it's yours so be sure you want it, because the small snacky items are $10 and up and it's not worth the money. I picked up the ""Mixed Chocolates"" box and found it contained about 10 peices of fun-size halloween-type candy. For $11. REALLY.  $8 for a 50 mL mini-bottle of Jack is a crime against humanity. Considering that's the extent of my complaints, not so bad. 

The shops around the hotel are a bit of a tourist trap and so are the slots (common knowledge again) but they're fun. I won $60 then proceeded to lose it in alarmingly quick fashion as well as... ahem... several more. Hilarious. 

Great restaurant selection around the Palazzo and Venetian and top-notch shopping if you've got a few thousand bucks to burn. Unfortunately I did not, but  window shopping is just as fun. If you're on a budget for your meals, the food court has decent (all things considered) prices and some healthier options for those of you who don't want to gain ten pounds while you're staying. 

TLDR:  Top-notch, comfy luxe rooms, great restaurant selection, awesome shopping. Don't go near the slots (free drinks if you do, though!)  or the refreshment items. DO check out Canaletto past the Gondola rides.",0,0,0

From the beautiful suite, the in room dining experience, and the STELLAR customer service.  I have stayed at the hotel 4+ times now and I am never disappointed.  Every time I check in there is a host waiting to ask if we're checking in, where we've come in from and how long we'll be staying.  He\/She directs us to the line we need to be in to check in and introduces us to the person at the Registration desk.  Just that alone makes me love coming back.  The room service food is soo good that I actually never bother to go downstairs to the restaurants.  It's in a prime location so it's easy to get to where you need to go for night life.  But, it's definitely pricey, but to me it's SOOOOO worth the money.

It's the perfect place for those who want to splurge a little bit more on something fabulous for their stay.

To start off with, the basic rooms are suites and everything is just so luxurious. We booked the standard room which came with two queen beds plus an additional sofa area with remote controlled window shade. Yeah, that was pretty awesome to wake up to. Just push a button from your bed and watch the drapes slowly part letting in the bright Vegas sun. I also loved the giant bathroom with jacuzzi tub and separate glass shower plus the flat screen in there. 

For the gamblers on here, their casino floor was also great too. I ended up winning over $300 at the craps $15 table within an hour and the dealers were so nice. Hell they were rooting for me, haha. And unlike some casinos it's not as much of a maze where you can constantly get lost... always a plus.

On our Friday evening there, plans for a catered dinner fell through so we resorted to ordering room service from Palazzo. I must say it was the best room service food I have ever had. We ordered the bruschetta, Caesar salad, two pastas plus a chicken dish. The meal was served within 45 minutes and tasted so home made. Fresh butter, basil, Marzano tomatoes, al dente pasta, pork ragu- the works!!! This has definitely forever raised my standards for room service food! I couldn't get enough of the pasta and actually ate more of it when we came back that evening at 2 something in the morning. Yes it was still good and no I'm not worried about food poisoning. I also loved the bruschetta. Ok my mouth just filled up with saliva so I'm going to stop writing about it now.

Overall a fabulous choice for my friend's bachelorette weekend. It was a real treat.

Oh and thank you to the mysterious stranger who picked up the rest of our room charge. It was VERY much appreciated by all of us! :)",7,3,6

Neither of us could get a good nights sleep all three nights and we never even got any good drinking nights in because we were either out fine dining or watching shows.  The beds were horrible and the pillows took a form that was unrecognizable. Yes we should've asked for new pillows but I didn't want to complain too much.

for the money you pay, you wont get a bigger room anywhere else.. its not even a room. its a suite! thats really the best part about this hotel.. all of the rooms are suites.. meaning you get your 2 double beds.. or 1 king bed. a sunken living room, a pullout couch, and tv's everywhere!

this is the BEST and only place i would recommend to people if you have over 5 people in your group because one suite here can really accommodate a bigger sized party..with 2 queen beds, a pullout, and a sofa.. you could comfortably fit 7-8 people no problem... and its a great location if you party at either tao, xs, or any of the clubs on far end of the strip.",3,1,2

We had reserved a Fortuna Suite in the Prestige (concierge) program at least 3 months in advance, but when we checked in (despite the great service from the concierge agent), we ended up with the handicapped accessible room.  Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but all I wanted upon getting to the suite was a nice long bath -- not an option in the shower-only room.  Unfortunately, no other rooms were available and no other options were offered (though we didn't push terribly hard, not sure if perhaps they would have come up with something).  The suite was large and pleasant, although it was a bummer not to have a fridge (the only fridge was the minibar).  

Another disappointment was room service (called In-Suite Dining).  We ordered at 9 am for an omelette, waffle, and coffee.  The meal was promised in 45 minutes, just in time for me to eat before a spa appt.  Unfortunately, the meal actually arrived an hour and 15 munutes later, and all the food was cold.  The waiter was very nice and made a lovely table for us, but the cold food and late delivery made the experience unpleasant.  

During our 4-day stay, we encountered a broken minibar fridge, non-functional TV in the bathroom, and non-functional makeup mirror.  I don't mean to sound whiney, but for the price we paid for the suite and prestige level, I was disappointed by these small negatives.  The Fortuna suite is not the lowest prestige suite, so it's not like we were trying to get a fantastic level of service for a piddling fee.  

One unexpected highlight -- one evening we came back to the room to find a complimentary bottle of champagne and fruit.  Unfortunately, neither my fiancee nor I enjoy champagne, but we were able to ""donate"" the champagne to another room.

If you, too, end up in the accessible suite, be cautious in the shower.  The curtain is not long enough, and no matter how you direct the spray you will end up with lots of water on the bathroom floor.  We ended up using lots of towels to mop up water and avoid slipping.  Also, during exceptionally windy nights we had to block the suite door with a towel to prevent an unpleasant screaming sound from the draft.

This was my first visit to a Vegas hotel, so I can't compare to other experiences, perhaps this is standard.  But still, I was saddened that our experience didn't remotely live up to our hopes.",0,0,0

We were greeted by this mousy chick & i could immediately tell she had a bad attitude.To make this short it took FOREVER to check into our Bella Suite. Not only have the other workers next to her already checked in 3-4 different customers each while we were standing there, the huge line that was behind us was already in their rooms with their feet up on the chair.The reason she was taking so long was because she was trying to find change for us from the cash we put down for the deposit. As she is walking around like a brainless zombie behind the counter my friend says ""can we just  get the change when we check out?"" to which she said ""No, i'll get it now!"" in the most rude tone! To which i replied with ""We've been here for 30 min we have somewhere to go..."" she turns to me rolls her eyes and walks away to go talk to another worker for 20 more minutes. We were trying to keep positive vibes and didn't let her get to us. My advice for you TANYA, learn how to take good care of customers! How you got this job is beyond me! McDonalds would even fire you for this kind of treatment. Put on some makeup & get your hair done maybe then you won't me such a miserable b***h & treat people better!

ROOM REVIEW

Pros:
Very Comfortable Bed
Huge suite with an awesome bathroom and a full length mirror in the hallway, which is great when getting ready for a night out.

Cons: 
A few lights were burnt out in the room
The TV in the bathroom didn't work
I totally thought house keeping would routinely check these things when cleaning the room.
All of the furnishings were chipped and the sectional did not look clean which totally made the room feel dirty and cheap
There were drink rings on the wood furniture in the room...yuck


I know what REALLY goes on in Vegas but really don't like having to be forced to think about what actually went on in the room before my stay there! Ew. I could only imagine how many 100's of people were packed in that room for bachelor parties prior to my stay! Needless to say I didn't dare to sit on the sectional not even once during my weekend stay!  Lol


Everything Palazzo (Aside from the room stay) REVIEW:

The Hotel decor and hallways are gorgeous and VERY clean.
Loved the Casino and was lucky enough to turn $80 into $2000.
Didn't have time to visit Carnevino or CUT but did visit Emeril's ""Table 10"" and had a great lunch there...they have one AMAZING lobster tail.
Being connected to the Venetian is pretty awesome and really convenient. And on top of all that, you only have to cross a bridge to get to the Wynn and Encore which triples the number of some fantastic, high end stores. No way can you get bored in this place.

Overall, if you are one of those Vegas go-ers that only use your room for a shower then are back out on the strip for non-stop gambling and clubs then youre good....I on the other hand like to mix in a lil' R & R with all of the above so a questionable room doesn't work well for me. Think i'll try the Wynn or Four Seasons next time around.

But based on everyone's reviews...I am wondering if I was just unlucky and got one of the few crappy rooms :\/",5,0,1

Tip: if you're looking for a deal,  book through hotel.com, be aware there is a $45 resort fee so make sure you take full advantage and hangout at the Cabana with a margarita, Jameson for me straight up, and use their workout facilities like there's no tomorrow. Get your money's worth!

It's pretty close to everything by Uber or Taxi and has it's own huge casino, mall and 3 Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf shops ( my fave). 

The beds are comfy and perfect for sinking into after a full day of drinking and partying. Even better when you wake up and not fully realize where you are. 

I was in love with the Cosmopolitan Hotel for a while, but I think this may be my favorite hotel...for now.

Other notes:

-Lavish mall attached with Christian Louboutian and a Venice setting with adorable Gondola's.  
- Restaurants and a nightclub.
- Perfect for sexy time, but then again everything in Vegas is perfect for a little sexy time.",9,5,7

AMAZING bathroom.. A shower with jets.. I have never seen that in a hotel before.  Super comfy bed.. And love the step down living room...with the view.

Decor is a bit over the top.. Nice but I prefer the type of decor in the Encore rooms better. 

Great gym- you can use the huge one at the Venetian.  And the Canyon Ranch Spa- for only 20 bucks you get to use the facilities (check it out - they have various relaxation and steam\/sauna type rooms) for only 20 bucks!

I came to Vegas for my 21st birthday a few months ago so of course I had to stay somewhere amazing for this experience! Palazzo did not disappoint! I was definitely impressed!  

Let's start off this review discussing [CHECK-IN] ... we were able to check in a little after noon on a Saturday, and the line was only about 10 people long. A kind attendant was monitoring the line was handing out coupons for some free drink at Restaurant Charlie and doing some small talk so it wasn't so bad. I, personally, was actually intoxicated beyond the point of being able to complete the whole checking-in transaction (aka, I had to yack into a receptacle right on the floor at the front desk), but they were very helpful at continuing along with my friends so I could clamor up to a room as quick as possible, haha!     

Our group of 5 girls fit just right in a [LUXURY SUITE] for a great price of $159! Including tax it was only about $173 total, which is pretty good for a weekend rate that's split between the 5 of us! And on top of that, we used an awesome promotion called ""Ultimate Escape"" which included:
    * Luxury Suite at The Palazzo
    * $50 in Slot Credits
    * LAVO Restaurant-Lounge-Nightclub Package:
      - $50 drink voucher
      - Complimentary admission and line pass for up to 4 guests 

http:\/\/www.palazzolasvegas.com\/pal_luxury_suite.aspx
Check out the link above for the list of features and amenities that each suite provides. It's more than any typical person would need when staying a night in Vegas! The 1-bed Luxury Suite was fine for us since the big comfy bed would fit 3, and then the L-shaped sofa fit 2. Plus... a 2-bed Bella Suite would have been $60 more at the time.  

Our room was clean, looked new and was overall veryyyy nice. 720 sq ft is plenty enough room especially since there was no lack of counters, chairs, or floor space for all of our stuff. Loved the bathroom because it was so big, bright, and had plenty of mirror space for us to share, especially with the little vanity table aaand the large full-length mirror! Woohoo! The threeeeeee TV's were also a major plus so that we could all watch different things during lag time... or watch in one part of the room while someone else was passed out on the other side, haha. We had room service get extra pillows, towels, and blankets for us, and they were very quick to bring it all without asking any questions about why we needed so much extra stuff. 

In terms of the actual hotel, we spent a good amount of time in the [CASINO] and some time in the shops but didn't have time to check out the restaurants, bars or the pool. The casino is kind of small, but we liked now it was divided by a straight walkway so that we could walk from the elevators to the front of the hotel without having to wind around endlessly and potentially get lost. There were plenty of cocktail waitresses walking around so that we were able to get more than enough of our share of yummy drinks while only gambling on the 1-cent or 5-cent machines. We also redeemed those Restaurant Charlie drink coupons for a fruit-wine concoction that was pretty strong for being free! 

[MISCELLANEOUS] Other than that... The Palazzo is beauuuutiful!!! The matching decor of the whole place was luxuriously classy from the marble floors to the statues to the chandeliers on the very high ceilings, but it was never to the point of being gaudy. Very picturesque, and I'll most likely be uploading some of my pictures from the trip when I get around to it. Loved the dimly-lit winding corridors to get from the elevators to our room. Yes, we noticed that sweet scent in the hotel as well, but we couldn't tell what it was. 

Self-parking was easy and free. Because Palazzo is on a corner, their multi-level garage has an entrance both on Las Vegas Blvd as well as from Sands Ave. The latter of which is really convenient in avoiding traffic on the strip. There was always an abundance of cabs available at the front of the hotel as always, too, at both the upper and lower level driveways. There's one main tower of elevators, and they do check for room cards in the evening before going up. The shops were nice... but not appealing for our age group, and there were so many of them it took us forever to get all the way through to the Venetian. All the help seemed very friendly. Checking out slightly late was no problem. 

Good times! I'd definitely consider coming back here again with a group, especially since they have me on the mailing list for future rate promotions!

*********************************************

By the way... I'm actually curious about if Palazzo is a 4-Diamond or a 5-Diamond hotel since it doesn't seem to be listed by AAA for 2009... anyone know?

Awesome hotel, we would come back to Palazzo and stay there from now.  Most hotels in Vegas are nice and dandy.  I'm not gonna say much about that.  The self parking was easy and getting to the check-in desk and hotel area were easy as well.  We checked in at about 2:55 pm, we knew it was a bit early.  But, no problem from the front desk.  They were professional, quick and organized.  They got the system down, they know how to run a hotel.  

From the front desk to the elevator was simple.  The elevator area was not hard to get to, not like some other hotels you need a map to navigate yourself around the hotel.  Hint:  Aria, it was confusing and hard to get around.  Once getting to the suite, the suite was nice and big, very comfortable.  The locale of the Palazzo is nice also, you have Walgreens downstair, a mall (the Fashion Show), TI, and the Wynn across the Strip.  

Palazzo has four pools for you to cool down, at least three were family friendly pools.  You also have access to the Venetian pools.  I wish they would provide umbrellas in the pool area. 

Dine-in Suite service was excellent.  Food showed up in about 15 minutes, we ordered the chicken wings, pasta with shrimps, and clam chowder were very good.  The price was OK, consider it room service in Vegas.  I would order their food in the future.  

There were no Turn Down service in the evening which we like a lot.  I don't need anyone come and knock our door if I want chocolate for the night, etc.

The bathroom was large and comfortable.  The toilet was in a separate room.  They provided plenty towels for you to use.  There were three TV's, one in the sunken living room, one in front of the bed, and one in the bathroom.

Checking out was simple.  Again, they were friendly and professional.  They made you feel comfortable, would return to Palazzo.",2,1,1

Check-in was awful!  Sure, there was no line checking in on the Prestige Suites floor but the long wait for our Siena room shouldn't have been. It was 5:30 in the afternoon so one would think the room would have been ready since check-out for customers is 11 a.m.  We had been going for 12 hrs. and were exhausted so we were less than pleased that we had to stand & wait for almost 10 minutes.  Since our check-in guy was MIA, we finally asked someone else if we could be seated inside the locked lounge area.  After another long wait, our guy finally reappeared & said that there was one of the suites now cleaned & available.  We felt relieved, which was short lived.
  
Next, since nobody takes you & your luggage to your room, we finally found our room on a different floor. Our Siena suite lacked any luster but served the purpose for our four night stay.  We sat and waited & waited for our luggage watching a small hard to see flat screen t.v.  We were tired & hungry.  Called the Prestige desk & found out that we had to call & request our luggage, which was going to be another 20 minute wait.  Don't know if that was explained to us at check-in or not as our guy talked a mile a minute (sounded like a use care salesmen), and still didn't slow-down even after we asked him to so that we could understand what he was saying.  Heaven help the foreigners.

We were frustrated with the lack of professionalism from what was suppose to be an elite experience.  One could receive much better front desk service at a Holiday Inn Express.  On the plus side, I must commend the very pleasant housekeeping gals on the impeccable job they did every day.  Too bad they can't get promoted to the front desk.  Would be a great improvement.",0,0,0

The staff at the palazzo, was great... they went above and beyond, and I was very pleased with my stay.  

After getting off the plane, my friends and I took a taxi ride (got ripped off dammit!) to  The Palazzo, and upon entering the drive way, we were stopped by the security guards...(at the time I was laughing in my head, because the taxi driving was going off on the security guard for stopping him, but the reason they did this was to maintain the flow of traffic, soo mr. taxi driver please calm down! Upon entering the Porte Cochere, doors were opened immediately, and was greeted immediately! I LIKE THAT!  Luggage was taken out of the trunk and was offered bell service immediately. Too bad i declined =(. 

The Lobby of the Palazzo was beautiful! Marble everywhere.. love the decor and designs. The rooms were nice as well. Two flat panel LCDs in each room. Two huge queen size beds and a sofa couch for one as well.  The only bad side to the room is the bathroom. They don't have locks on them! Peek a Boo! i see your dang dang..

Having grown up in LA, a 3-4 hour drive from Vegas, I've seen my share of Vegas hotels. But after staying that on 2 separate occasions at the Palazzo and Venetian, hands down, I will NEVER stay at another hotel again! This place is the bomb. It just screams elegance. The room\/suites are amazing! Sunken living rooms, 3 flat screen TVs including 1 in the bathroom. And the beds were oh so soft and cozy - defiantly calls you after a drunken night out. 

This hotel is basically the sister hotel of the Venetian, so it looks pretty much the same, with the same amenities inside, just ""looks"" a bit newer. 

My 1 and only con - the pool is between both hotels, which meant that you've got 2 fairly tall hotels blocking the sun. Other than that, it's worth the stay!",1,0,2

It has it's own separate check in area (open from 7 am - 9 pm) and a lounge where they serve breakfast, afternoon snacks, evening hors d'oeuvres and have an open bar from 5-8 pm.  The lounge has a wonderful view with huge windows that span the length of the lounge looking out towards the strip and TI and MIrage. It's decorated in a classy and comfortable manner and there's even a baby grand piano that plays itself situated in the middle of the main lounge area.  The suites you stay in are the same as the regular Palazzo suites, so that means they're still spacious (about 720 sq ft) and beautifully decorated.  You basically pay for the extra amenities and to use the lounge. So, you can pay for the Prestige suite ahead of time or if  you have a Palazzo or Venetian reservation already, you can upgrade to Prestige for an extra $100+tax per night for 2 people.

Although I'm a local, I've actually staycationed here a couple times and recommend staying here to friends coming into town who have the finances to do so.

As far as the staff, the Prestige Agents are really helpful and personable.  They really take their time checking you in and talking to you.  They are actually all concierge agents and can help you book shows, tours, dinner reservation either at the Venetian and Palazzo or somewhere else.  And because it's a private lounge, they usually remember your name and make you feel like you're not just another guest staying at another strip hotel.  If you're a tourist and don't really have your Vegas trip planned, this is a great way to find options and get personalized recommendations.

The food is pretty good too.  The breakfast presentation isn't too extraordinary, but some of the hors d'oeuvres in the evening are really good.  On the weekends, the have casino restaurants (like Valentino) cater part of the dinner presentation.  It's a great way to try some higher end restaurant food without having to pay extra!

Honestly though, what I really like is the open bar.  If you come here with a group of friends, bachelor party, bachelorette party, date, family, or whomever, the open bar serves you from 5 pm - 8 pm and it's a full bar. 

It's really a great experience with really friendly staff (the servers in the lounge are really attentive and friendly and clear your plates and grab drinks in a really timely manner).  Depending on how often you actually utilize the lounge (and I definitely do for the drinks!), the upgrade charge pays for itself.  If you're a tourist looking for a more romantic or special Vegas trip, or if you're a local looking for a romantic weekend or special staycation, I would definitely recommend looking into Prestige and consider booking it!",17,0,5

There might be some awesome suites that I don't even know about that you get hooked up with if you're big ballin'... But I'm not quite at that level yet. For my money, a double (really, a triple, with the pull-out couch in the sunken living room) at the Palazzo is the best home base for twenty-somethings trying to party.

I've stayed here twice; both have been without a hitch. The most recent was Labor Day Weekend 2011. Showed up at 10 AM on Saturday and asked for our room, fully expecting to be told to come back in five hours. A room was ready, albeit a smoking one. I was a little concerned, but I took it. Turns out I didn't have much to worry about... Yes, you could tell that people had smoked in there before, but I acclimated incredibly quickly and it never bothered me again.

Service was great: Whether it was an iPod hookup or just some fresh towels, they responded impressively quickly for a holiday weekend. I don't have too much to say about the property aside from the room... I really like that they have underground self parking... The Grand Lux makes for some solid hungover eating, and I like Lavo much more as a restaurant than a club.

All the rooms are very large and in pretty good shape as it is relatively new. We had 2 suites (they call all the rooms suites), one for us and one for the kids. For an extra $100 night we upgraded one of the suites to double the size so we had a huge master bedroom, bathroom, powder room, and combined living room\/dining room area. And there was a small exercise room with an elliptical as well. I also love the location of Palazzo: across the street from Wynn\/Encore, Fashion Show Mall, and Treasure Island. 

You have a huge number of restaurants you can choose from without ever even going outside. Many of them are on the very $$ side though. There is the Grand Luxe Cafe which is the most reasonable full service restaurant. There are also more fast food like places in the shopping areas of both Palazzo and Venetian. A big plus is the Walgreens inside of the Venetian retail area in case you need cheap water or other snacks or sundries. 

We were somewhat disappointed in the pool area and hence minus one star. It is mostly in the shade until noon or so. The ""Azure"" pool which is in the sun early was completely closed during the weekdays when we were there so that was no help to us. Good drinks service, but no food service so you'll have to get off your butt if you want something to eat. The pool restaurant is a Wolfgang Puck creation (Solare I think?). Very good pizza, but overpriced as you would expect. If you want to walk a little further you can go up to the Burger joint in the Palazzo shops that has burgers, salads, etc to go which is a lot more reasonable.

Overall - Palazzo is a place I would highly recommend.",0,0,1

It's part of a complex with the Venetian, so you have all the advantages of a huge resort at your disposal, but the Palazzo itself is a very manageable size. It's much easier to navigate than, say Caesar's Palace.

We stayed in a Prestige Bella suite. Paying up for the Prestige level is definitely worth the money. You get a great ""free"" breakfast in the Prestige-only lounge every morning, plus happy hour and snacks in the evening. The bacon was some of the best I've ever had, by the way. Prestige also offers a bunch of other services, including a very friendly concierge staff and private check in.

The suite was huge, with a separate living area. There are 3 TVs, one in the bathroom, one in the living area, and one in the bedroom area. Curiously, the bedroom area TV is the biggest. Why? (Watching porn?) We were there on a Sunday and it would have been nice to have the big TV in the living area to watch football.

The rooms were impeccably clean, as were the linens. The beds were comfortable, albeit maybe a tad firm for my taste. It was really quiet.

Our view was unimpressive, but who comes to Vegas for the views?

The casino was fun. They have a lot of $10, $15, and $25 blackjack tables for us minnows. (Don't bother with the rewards program unless you're a really high stakes player. The comps suck.) The video poker machines mostly seem to be 7-5. I couldn't find an 8-5 machine anywhere but found a lot of 6-5 machines, so be sure to check before playing. The casino seems to attract an older crowd, as there were not a lot of MTV wannabes running around.

Lots of great restaurants but no buffet. Why no buffet? I don't want every dinner or lunch at a 4 or 5 star restaurant.

Strong wifi and cellphone service throughout.

Nits: There seemed to be a power struggle between the concierge and the valet staff. We took our Jeep out every day to go off roading and every day I asked the concierge to call down to have the valet bring the car up. I stood there and watched him do it every day. And every day when I got down to the valet stand, I had to ask them to go get the car and then wait 15 minutes or more. They need a peace treaty.

No mini-fridge to keep a stash of your own drinks.

Mini-bar prices stratospheric. Ditto spa prices.

There are a lot of light sources that remain on when you turn off the main lights. Things like smoke detectors, night lights, and the like. Worst of all, there's one huge red light (about an inch in diameter) in the middle of the bedroom area ceiling that blinks all night. I need absolute dark when I sleep and ended up having to use an eye mask. Why don't hotels mask these light sources?

The first night the blinds would not close. That should have been checked and fixed before our arrival.

Despite these few nits, it was a very enjoyable stay and we will be back soon.",2,1,1

i chose to do the name your price on priceline.com and i got palazzo! parking was very convienent (front and side enterances) - although it doesnt have the hi-tech lights like cosmo- it was brightly lit and close to the elevators.

it was easy to find the front desk from the parking lot and right across the casino. the front desk was great and my bf and i recieved great customer service\/interaction. i had sara from customer service put a note on account that it would be our four yr anniversary and requested a high floor. so our front desk agent def. did her thing- we got our room on the 38th floor with a view!! free of charge! she gave us coupons and the carnival book of deals that we def took a advantage of to use at their stores and resturants. 

the room was great! the seperation of the sunken living room and the bedroom. the bed was super comfty and roomy! the vanity in the bathroom was used by yours truly and i loved the layout of it. i wished we had a fridge so we couldve store our wine and beer we brought though. 

the resort was just at a PRIME location..when i say prime its PRIME! im all about location, location, location!!! my bf and i were just amazed at how close we were to everything, the elevators were just set a great location for anyplace and everywhere. we could be at the canal shoppes in a min or casino on another floor.  anytime we were out on the strip or stopped by walgreens- our elevators to our rooms were right there. 

id def reccommend staying here for just a great vacation. btw check out all the 5\/6 pools they have to offer and use those coupons. we did eat at couple places at palazzo like i love burgers and illys by using those discounts. plus they made us feel great since it was our anniversary! i have more pics of our trip on my ig at lovexak- pls check it out! 

i wouldve to experienced the prestige floor on the 23rd floor if i had the chance i would love to see what the special selected few get to experience.",2,1,1

As the sister property of the Venetian, it shares many of the similar characteristics found at the Venetian. I have been an invited comp guest here and at the Venetian. While both properties are similar, there are some differences:

1) The Palazzo casino is WAYYYY less crowded than its counterpart. It has all the card games and slot machines that you could find anywhere else. Cocktail service is very constant here too, making 2-3 rounds an hour by my blackjack table.

2) I stayed at the Bella Suite over the 2015 Super Bowl weekend. While the suite is a little bigger and newer than the Venetian's luxury suite, I thought the Bella suite wasn't as beautiful as the one at the Venetian. That being said, it's still very very nice.

I had found a great deal through Costco travel for the hotel. When we arrived we were the only people checking in on a Wednesday night at 8pm. Lucky us, since they had miles of que line rope just waiting for the rush. 

It was a quick check in and then enough walking to make you know you were going to be really fit by the end of your stay. We were on the 25th floor. The room was beautiful with a sunken living room and a great view of the mountains and the strip. I wasn't so impressed with the strip view because this hotel sits at the end and you see Treasure Island clearly but the others are blocked out by the size of the hotel itself. No biggie, it was still gorgeous. 

They did waive the $25 a day resort fee since we weren't using internet or the gym. We moved the car so it was closer to the elevators for the rooms and this cut the walking down. 

I am going to lump out second stay here in with this review. We first stayed Wed-thurs night and came back on Sunday. Sunday I had booked a room directly through them. Despite Sunday being much more crowded than the weekday, we once again walked right up for check in and the guy asked if we wanted a strip view and higher floor, an 'upgrade'. Okay, cool. I had been happy with the 25th floor before. 

However, when we got into this new room, it was not the sunken living, nor did the shower have the extra jets in them and it was a stripped down room, and this cost $267 a night. OUCH. We were all like, WTH? It was same view we had before but now we were on the 45th floor. I had paid less for the other room, it had nothing to do with the rate calendar, believe me, that was the first thing we checked. So, if you want to make sure you have a sunken living room and more deluxe room, ask at the front desk before upgrading. 

Overall, we had a great time and I would go back and stay there again, I would not stay there if it wasn't the sunken living room suite just because then it is like most other hotels. For the cost of the room, you want to feel like it was worth it. We were going to stay at the Flamingo on the second trip Sunday for the ease of going to play Keno, but decided to go back here. 

The beds in the first room were more comfy. I though it was just me in the second room, but right away my husband and dad were saying the beds were hard in this new room. 

If you watch the rate calendar you can get rooms starting at $109 a night. If you area Costco member, you get some perks, so check that out.",5,1,1

But for some strange reason it was super busy that weekend. The Venetian wasn't able to check us in until 5 pm. Which was kinda disappointing. But they were able to offer us a suite at the palazzo. Which I couldn't resist. At that time the palazzo had just opened it's doors. I'd say it was no more than a month or two old. So why not? Bad thing was me and my buddy parked at the Venetian side. So we had to walk our asses quite aways to get to our room. Anyway the suite was really nice. Our view was facing opposite of the strip. But we were able to catch views of the pool. I love the way the curtains are opened by remote. Both the lights and ceiling fan were also operated by remote. It's very classy. Also very clean. And we were able to bypass the line at Tao the same night. although. No free entrance. Room prices were reasonable. And to be honest I don't remember the stupid resort fees being tagged on back then. The way they do now. I would stay here again. It's kinda toward the end of the strip. But at least its still on the strip.,2,0,2

I got a pretty good flight + hotel deal through Expedia, particularly because we were coming in on a Wednesday and checking out on Saturday. We're not gamblers at all so I knew we would  actually get to enjoy some time in our room. I emailed the Palazzo ahead of time to let them know that we were coming to Vegas to get married in the hope that they would grant our request for a room on a high floor with a nice view. They replied that they would do their best to accommodate my request.

We arrived on an early flight and got to the hotel at around 11am, much earlier than the usual 3pm check in time. We went to the front desk expecting to be told it was too early but to our surprise, the lovely lady at the front desk told us we could check in immediately, gave us a late 1pm checkout time without us having to ask, and proceeded to have the nicest chat with us about our plans. They did indeed give us a great room on the 19th floor with a picture-perfect view. 

We had a wonderful time in almost every respect except for when it was time to get our grab and go breakfast. At the Cafe, service was slow and quite unfriendly, and the food was not so great - a few pastries and a fruit cup - so we actually just skipped it on the last day. It came free with our package but if you have to pay extra for it, just don't. I thought the scant breakfast offerings were incongruous with the opulent Palazzo experience and that's really the only reason I scratched off a star.

HOSTELS I stayed at in college had more courteous and customer oriented staff than this mess of a disorganized zoo!

Upon arrival we decided to have the valet take our bags to our room. I let them know we would need the bags quickly as we had medications in them for my grandfather, they said no problem. After checking in at 3:35 the front desk let us know our bags would arrive in 15 minutes. At 4:42 still no bags. I called the front desk, pressed 0, and a woman let me know there had been ""a delay"" with our bags. I explained the urgency and she said they would be there shortly. Another 10 minutes passed and I redialed. I mistakenly said I had called 15 minutes earlier, to which the woman rudely snapped (verbatim) ""you actually called ten minutes ago and I told you there was a delay and they wouldn't be there for a few minutes."" Excuse me? I paid quite a bit of money for a 3 night stay, and this is no way to speak to a guest who is trying to resolve a matter of urgency regarding medication for another elderly guest! 

I asked where the bags were and if I could come get them myself. She said they would be waiting for me at guest services. 

I made the trek from the 36th floor, through the casino, to guest services. Where, get this, THEY HAD NO CLUE what I was talking about. A manager named Greg (I think) said no one had sent a request for our baggage until 4:42. By this point it's been an hour and 30 minutes and my grandfather is still waiting. Greg let me know our bags were now somewhere in the hotel on the way to our room. WHY did the Palazzo staff tell me to come here then? By this point I'm appalled and totally frustrated. Almost 2 hours later he tried to resolve the situation hopelessly. But to no avail by an awful guest services manager... As most in vegas know time is money, and the Palazzo stole the first two hours of my vacation or time I could have been working from our office in Vegas.

The guest services manager calls someone who brings our bags back down, to follow me to our room. He says he would be happy to provide a bottle of wine and chocolates and a late checkout as well as a $25 room service credit. I just wanted the bags or I would never have accepted this apology. He said he had no clue and couldn't find out who the woman on the phone was. He sent a $7.00 bottle of wine and 4 chocolates as consolation to my grandparents. ANYONE who has stayed here before knows that a $25 credit would barely cover the $5.00 delivery fee and 18% gratuity included in all room service orders, and the late checkout was provided complimentary at ALL my previous stays at the Palazzo. 

When I did try to order a bottle of wine from room service they explained the menu was filled with misprints and the bottle I wanted was $50+ more then listed. No thanks.

I like free stuff. I mean, who doesn't.

I checked in two weekends ago and without asking to be upgraded, front desk bumped me up from a standard suite to a 1,300 sq. ft. ""Siena Suite"" on the 41st floor. Just me, to my dome.

I almost felt bad seeing large groups of people heading back to their standard rooms that they probably paid a steep nightly rate for, while I sheepishly walked up to my grand double-door suite entry that the hotel comp'd me for three nights, and slid my keycard into the door key-reader.

Then I loaded myself up with some cheap Merlot I bought downstairs at the Double Helix Bar, melted in the whirlpool jet soaking tub while taking in a few episodes of Family Guy on the HDTV mounted on the bathroom wall, and I just decided I didn't give a shit. I was in the lap of luxury and SO RELAXED. It was then I realized that women have been keeping this ""tub and wine"" thing a secret from men. Or are we just too stupid and proud to hop in with some epsom salts and bath bubbles? Who knows. We're fools.

This is the second visit back to back where The Palazzo front desk has graciously upgraded me to an unnecessarily massive suite, gratis (I don't do any of that lame cash between credit cards garbage when checking in either).

Two visits ago for my birthday celebration, they put my friends and I in a 1,500 sq. ft. ""Hospitality Suite"" (a suite not even mentioned on the website, let alone reservable) that featured two separate floor-to-ceiling glass panel french doors that opened up onto a huge private OUTDOOR terrace with an incredible skyline view of Wynn and Encore...the terrace had stone-pavement, a dining table, and a large lounge area set up in front of a mosaic-tiled gas fireplace. It. was. spectacular. Totally unexpected and definitely made that trip that much more special and memorable.

Needless to say, it's hard not to bump them up from 4 Yelp stars to 5.

Summary and point of this review? Generosity flows like a river at The Palazzo. Not bad for one of the few 5-Diamond AAA hotels on the Vegas strip where it's usually the norm to get shot-down upon inquiring about any sort of upgrades. Put that $20 away. Try smiling when you approach the front desk. That's the real ticket.

Another tip, it wouldn't hurt to if you gave their casino a bit of play as well...make sure you hit up the Grazie club desk located near the heart of the casino floor. Don't give them a single cent until you've been issued a Grazie card...those points can add up quick and earn you more exclusive privileges with the resort.",17,7,6

Just a few negatives...I wish that the housekeeping staff would've given an extra roll of toilet paper.  We kept having to request more.  Lol.  I also would've liked more toiletry amenities, as there were only the usual's like Shower cap, soaps, shampoo's.  I was expecting a bit more in terms of convenience when it comes to a high end hotel like this.  Housekeeping staff also did not restock toiletries on a daily basis, and only ""when needed.""  They still should've restocked.

I do have some guilt for this but this is quite possibly the best shower I've ever had.  Incredible water pressure for a city is in a full blown water crisis as Lake Mead is at historic lows.  I was stunned but it was glorious for the purposeful short showers I took.  It was very difficult to cut it short.  The rooms are enormous. All suites and 720 square feet and up. Ours was 940 square and it was roomier than several apartments I've lived in over the course of my life.  Massive bathroom.

Huge sports bar in Lagasse Stadium.  The design and details of the shops and the mall that surrounds them are just fantastic.  You can easily get lost and I expect that is by design but it goes on and on and on and is beautiful every step of the way.  It is a special place.

The pools are just OK IMO.  Not terrible but not spectacular.  At least the free ones.  There is a separation for those like me that staying here is a privilege and the privileged where staying here becomes exclusive.  That's OK. The ""commoners"" digs and options would be exclusive for all but the very wealthy. 

Gambling isn't what I'm here for and I could not really care less but the Venetian seemed pretty decent compared to the others we walked which was all but the Bellagio on the strip hotel row.  The Palazzo was pretty weak but if you want to gamble close to your room it would suffice I suppose.  Read other reviews if that is your thing.  I'm sure gamblers have better insight than me.  I spent 20 minutes total in my 4 days at the hotel.

I don't know that I will ever stay here again as it is pricey compared to some of the other choices but it was extremely memorable if I do not.  Vegas is a wonderland.  The Venetian\/Palazzo property and Palazzo hotel is Shangri-la.",2,1,2

I've booked here two times so far. The Bella Suite is one of the most affordable suites you can book in Vegas. It has two queen sized beds and a sofa bed - great for large groups of people. Large bathroom with a huge vanity mirror. The service was great! Front desk was very friendly and welcoming. They were also understanding and extended our check-out time, thanks a bunch! You can definitely tell that they value their guests. 

Palazzo had a very great deal during our second visit, $150 restaurant credit for all bookings. We were a big group so we ended up splitting it for a meal. We used it for brunch at the Grand Lux Cafe, which is a short walk from the room elevators. Location wise, its right across Treasure Island and borders Encore and the Venetian. It's about a 10 mins walk to the LINQ and Caesars Palace area, so not bad at all!

There is complimentary valet parking but you can also park in their parking garage if you so desire. Thoroughly enjoyed my stays at the Palazzo, they will definitely be in consideration for any future Vegas bookings.",1,0,0

Yes I know they aren't allowed to but sometimes they do! They forward me over to ""risk management"" and Julie is talking about some proprietary security process they go through, well it's not working because my stuff is gone. Julie pretty much tells me that no one will ever take anything from your room, they won't steal from you or ever take anything from you accidentally. Everyone is human, shit happens! I don't appreciate being made the liar here. I'm not trying to say they took it on purpose but sometimes things are taken accidentally with a towel or the sheets.

The only shame about the Palazzo, is that you don't stay in the room enough to enjoy it! 

The location is prime (north Strip adjoined to Venetian, near TI, Mirage, Wynn & Encore), the accommodations are large and luxurious, and there's something for everyone. They have a huge casino on property with all the slots and table games you can think of, restaurants for every taste and budget, several pools with plenty of seating and cabanas for rent, a spa, shops that range from expensive taste to extremely expensive, a sports book that rivals any other I've seen on the Strip with massive screens and even a smaller sports book booth located near registration.
In the rooms, there is a long hallway as you enter that leads you into your bedroom. A divider with granite stone separates the room into a sunken living room with a wrap around velour sectional to sit and watch TV in an armoir. There's also a small table to sit at next to the window and a desk area. A $20\/day resort fee keeps your room pumped with wi-fi. There's a mini bar that isn't exorbitant (well, for Vegas standards) and a full breakfast\/lunch\/dinner option for in-room dining.

There's another flat screen LCD TV in your bedroom area and a smaller one in the bathroom where you have gorgeous tile, a makeup sitting area, separate bath and tub, and water closet.

The staff was incredibly friendly. When we checked in, I saw the line and groaned. I wanted to be at the pool drinking already! But it went fast and they were very nice and explained everything. 

Pay extra for the Strip view- it's worth it. Our view was of Vegas- and the top of the parking structure. I closed the blinds (by remote!) just to not have to look at it.

My friend booked the room for us (Bella Suite). This suite is very nice and elegant. The Bella Suite included 2 queen beds and an ""L"" shaped sofa bed with 1 bathroom. 

While staying at Palazzo, we received FREE passes to TAO & Lavo. This was very handy because we also had guys in our group. In Vegas, it's very hard for guys to get into clubs without paying horrendous prices. This is hotel also has a casino which is very convenient, but pricey. I played the blackjack table and the buy in is about $20.

The hotel is located at the end of the strip which can be an inconvenience if you want to go to the other hotels (i.e. Cosmopolitan or PH). It is close to Encore where you can go to Surrender or Encore beach.

Overall great hotel, but I don't like how it's located at the end of the strip. I prefer a hotel somewhere in the middle of the strip.

After checking in, we go up to our room and try to open the door, only to find that the lock\/handle is broken. I try to open the door one more time and the handle gives way and breaks and cuts my hand in the process. We head all the way back down to let them know of the situation and they give us the exact same room three floors up, but we don't get any upgrade for our troubles. Lame. My only other beef with this hotel was the stupid night stand light that would not turn off. It was extremely difficult to fall asleep with a light that stayed on right above your bed. Other than that, my stay was pretty pleasant.

The suites are amazing! They are huge in size and can comfortably fit seven people without a hitch. Keeping the guests in mind, the Palazzo provides a pullout bed, which is actually comfortable for the suites. The beds are very comfortable, and these kinds of suites were made for large groups. As always, the bathrooms are also large and nicely decorated. There is even a small television in the bathroom, which was new to me! I thought the remote control to operate the curtains and blinds were a nice touch. I thought those kinds of things were reserved for hotels like the Wynn, but Palazzo delivered. 

The best part of staying here? Easy and quick access to the tables downstairs - specifically craps. Thanks for the good times and paying me and my friends off on that heater table. I thin we took over a grand from that table total. I would definitely stay here next time because of the comfort, convenience, and service.

Yes I know this is a review for the Palazzo, that's why I said that.  First Check in was fast and easy and the staff is very polite.  The hotel itself was enjoyable.  I liked the fact that you could exit your hotel and go right to shops either at the mall, Venetian and was close to Caesars Palace also.  Parking and navigating through the hotel was super easy.  The smell, i should say scent, that they had in there air was not that bad.  I would say it was an attempt at a floral rose like scent, but on a few days was bordering on ""old lady, burn your nose perfume.""  

The room was nice, for the money I was expecting WOW.  The linens, as others have said are a bit rough and the bed was not that comfortable.  The bathroom and room are both  nice and spacious.  Lighting in the room was good as was the bathroom, but our dimmer for the bathroom light was broken, no big deal.  But the toilet had dim lighting which i did not like, don't act like I'm the only one who reads in there.  Cool feature was that the toilet seat did not drop but fell gently to the rim and did not make that ""thunk"" sound, yes I am easily amused. Bad part of the bathroom, there is a TV that is bigger than the Wynn's but you cant see the dang thing while in the tub, you can't even listen to a music channel because there is none; so why bother putting one in there in the first place.  Best thing about the bathroom was the mirrors did not fog up.

The room, like i said was nice and spacious but nothing made me say wow.  Again the bed sheets were a little rough, but I got used to them.  Please use some type of fabric softener or better sheets.  I've felt better sheets in a hospital bed.  The pillows sucked, I like medium to firm pillows and these are on the super soft side. Good thing there was four of them because i needed three.Nice part of the room was the HD TV's,with HD programing and nice selection of channels, two of them.  I sleep in and it was nice that my gf could watch TV without waking me up and and still keep the volume at a decent level.  View from the room was beautiful, and no i did not pay for the upgraded view.  We had the mountain view which still provided a nice view of the back side of the strip, airport and city.  We could also see UNLV. The best part of the room was the couch, that thing was firm and comfortable, more so than the bed.  Additionally,  I asked for a non-smoking room.  It's a little annoying being on a non smoking floor and smelling cigarette smoke through the hallways.  If you want to smoke in your room get a smoking allowed room, not too difficult.  And yes I am a smoker as well. 

So again I didn't use the pool, but the gf did.  She said it was OK, but there were some  stains around the rims of the pool and thought that was nasty.  

The casino had a nice layout to it although it was rather small.  There are a lot of non-smoking sections around which is nice and ventilation was very good.  As a cigar smoker no one bothered me, and there were enough games everywhere.  Poor thing about the casino was as much time i was there gambling, it took forever to get drinks.  I have to say the waitresses at the casino royale were more efficient than this place.  Yea there is something wrong with that picture comparing a 5 star hotel to something like the casino royale.

For what I paid for it, i should have stayed at the Wynn.  Was it worth trying, absolutely.  Would I stay here again probably not.  So that's my thoughts on the hotel.",0,0,0

Check in was a breeze unlike other places I've stayed in Vegas. We were in and up to our room within 5 minutes, easy! Once we walked into the room, my jaw dropped. What a gorgeous room, and killer view. We stayed on the 34th floor in room 828. Great view of the strip and the mountains. The entire layout of the room was awesome- we especially loved the sunken living room. Perfect place to chill instead of lounging in bed. But speaking of bed, that must have been one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. I slept like a queen while we stayed there for 4 nights. The remote control black out curtains also helped, but goodness that bed rocked! I also loved the layout of the bathroom. The separate soaking tub was wonderful to lay in and watch tv  while sipping some bubbly! While the casino is a little smaller, you can swing over to the sister hotel (the Venetian) for some additional slots \/ gaming options. The restaurants in both places are incredible. I honestly wouldn't even venture out elsewhere! We also used the concierge to book a show which was super easy especially when we were originally told it was sold out.

I'm so glad that I decided to be spontaneous and accept my friend's invite to stay at their suite. The suite that we stayed in had two rooms and the whole place was bigger than my house. We had three flat screen tvs in the suite, not that we watched much tv, but there were three! I have fallen in love with the showers. I would love to have 5 shower heads in my shower at home too. I think the Palazzo has truly spoiled my hotel staying experience. I love how there was a Coffee Bean right at the lobby next to the elevators and a great espresso\/cafe place toward the Venetian. Self parking and valet were both also very convenient. I'm definitely coming back to the Palazzo.

I'm definitely not a fan of the casino itself. It just lacked a certain type of atmosphere. I don't know what it is, but it just feels so boring gambling there. I do like the Venetian though. It's probably has to do with the dealers. I think the dealers at the Venetian side are a lot more friendly than the ones at the Palazzo.",1,0,0

Valet was a breeze.  Bellhop took a long time.  I called in and was told 20 minutes.  Stuff didn't come for another hour plus.

Here's my review.  Zero stars for Guest Services at Palazzo.  I ordered balloons from a third-party vendor and set up a delivery at the Palazzo.  Mind you, I contacted the Palazzo beforehand to make sure they would be able to accommodate this balloon delivery to be a surprise for my girlfriend in the room.

I was waiting at Concierge, but the kind gentleman told me to walk a few steps towards the front doors and it'll be to my left.  Perfect!

I get to Guest Services and told the lady working the desk about my delivery.  She asked for my ID.  She said she couldn't find my name.  I then told her the room itself is under my girlfriend's name, but I am also listed on the reservation when my gf called in to book.

This Guest Services lady was on a power trip and was getting really angry at me and my two friends that I asked to help me carry the balloon delivery up to the room as a surprise.  So we stood there and she ignored us.  Somehow, her phone rang and gave us more of a reason to ignore us.

This place seemed great at first, but slowly things took a turn for the worse.  I wanted to do a gondola ride, so we went to the front desk to inquire where to go.  The lady began giving us a lecture on how we should have reserved the gondola ride earlier since it is busy on Valentine's day, and we would most likely not be able to do it.  When we got outside, we found out that none of that information was true.  There were plenty of people who were in line to purchase tickets for rides and were able to get on the gondolas with no problems.  Yesterday, my fiancé left his wallet in the room.  His room key card was in his wallet.  Luckily (or so I thought) I had mine.  I attempted to get into the room, but it would not work.

Meanwhile, I plopped myself down on the floor in front of the door.  My fiancé then called me on my cell phone to tell me that they would not give him another card and would not let him come back upstairs and took away the key card.  They wanted me to come downstairs.  I asked to speak to them over the phone, but they were hesitant.  When they finally got on the phone and I explained how my feet were killing me and I could not walk all the way down there, they said they would have to send a security officer to the room.  The guy showed up and I let him have it.  How is it our fault that their key card is defective, and why are they acting like we are criminals?  We finally were let into the room, but it put me in a sour mood for the night and made us late to meet up some friends.  They didn't even offer to provide us with anything for all the trouble.  Today, they failed to show up to clean our room.  This is just unacceptable.  For an expensive hotel in Las Vegas, I expect a whole lot better customer service.

Check in went smoothly, even though the place is packed.  In fact, the amount of people here is my least favorite thing.  But, good for them, I suppose.  There are 50 floors to the hotel and, with our free rooms, they put us on the 47th.  Not too shabby!  

The rooms are huge, with a large bathroom and soaking tub (a requisite for me), a large sleeping area, and a massive sitting area in front of the floor to ceiling window.  There are three flat screen TVs throughout the suite (suite being their standard room, by the way), motorized (via remote) shades, and a cool light underneath the marble bar so that you can illuminate your preparty beverages =)

Some negatives about the room: there were some nicks here and there, which is to be expected since people aren't careful.  This in no way affected my enjoyment of the room.  The biggest thing for me was the lack of digital music on the television.  I know this seems ultra nit picky, and I'm""m sure it is, but when I take my bubble bath, I like to put on the classical music station on the flat screen and relax.  Here, we would have to pay for Music on Demand.  It's a small thing, but it is a deficiency in comparison to The Wynn.

As for the casino, there was an upgrade on the slots, for sure.  For the most part, we play the penny slots. Yes, we are High Rollers! Haha.  We like to play as part of our entertainment, and those games are entertaining.  Luckily for us, we also won some money!  Not that we necessarily brought that money home with us, but hey, winning like 1000 bucks and using that to pay for other entertainment, drinks, etc. is still a win to me!  I won like 300 bucks on a Monopoly game, about 275 on a Wizard of Oz game, another 200 on a Sopranos game, and the hubby won close to 300 on a Reel em In game!  And, he's drinking Ketel rocks and I'm drinking Chopin Cosmos the whole time.

The rooms are newer, look better, and in the suites, the divider between the couches and the beds is a flat counter\/bench area which is better and more useful than the rail divider at the Venetian.  And I think the counter lights up or something.  That's about all the differences I noticed in the suite.

However!  I don't think that's enough to make me prefer the Palazzo.  It's a beautiful hotel and casino, but I get a better vibe in the Venetian area.  Plus, the Grand Lux cafe at Palazzo closes.  Not a big fan of Grand Lux, but it just seems like we always end up there late at night when all restaurants are closed... so  no matter what, we end up at the Venetian.",1,1,1

This place is absolutely fabulous. I haven't stepped out to be a part of the teeming tourists, I haven't had to cringe at outrageous outfits and avoid fliers of the trashy kind. Infact, if I hadn't ventured out to MaCarran only to be turned back on the day the snow shut Vegas down, I would have been quite  content with seeing the outside world through the remote controlled blinds that drape the massive windows in my room!
 I've always come down here for training, so the disinclination to step out of the luxurious environs is probably somewhat motivated by the lack of time and energy. But be it trying my luck on the casino floor, or strolling down the Canale shoppes or trying the incredible dining\/lounging options at the casino, or just hanging out on the sectional in the suite - it is possible to immerse oneself entirely in all that Palazzo has to offer without ever running out of things to do or even thinking about the world outside of it.
The rooms here are palatial, and very thoughtfully furnished. From a personal printer\/fax in the room to a groove on the bathstand to hold a bar of soap - the immaculate attention to detail that is evident in the main area extends to the facilities available in each of the suites. There may be more elbow room at the blackjack tables, a sign of the times they say, but the experience of being at the Palazzo has to be timeless.

I think it's worth every penny or maybe i am just too spoiled that i cant handle anything lower than $200 per night ? I dont know.

Come on, if u cant afford it go somewhere else! IOne night i saw some security guards checked on these girls who were trying to go up to the rooms and they had no key with them - so basically they were asked to leave or something because they were staying ""illegally"" in this one small room (8 of them!!) LOL. It's kinda funny to see that one girl was trying to explain that she paid for the room and invited these others girl to join her but did not work i guess? She should have informed the hotel upfront. Unfortunately because of this incident, my bf and I got the same treatment. The guard stopped us from getting into the elevator and we were asked for the key. I was not in my best mood at that time, so I immediately took off my Prada sunglasses and said to the guard, ""do i look like someone who cant afford this place? U'd better check on the others, room to room, coz there are too many people staying in one room and its freakin annoying and this will only bring down the quality of the hotel if u guys dont take care of it"". I showed the room key to the guard including the print out of the reservation and my ID (because i was seriously furious and mad) and he said sorry. Geez!

Well seriously, everything is nice and great about this hotel, except one thing - too many people stay in one tiny room and make loud noise!! Management should really put a stop to this. (please check how Europeans\/Asians handle their 5 stars hotel business -a key scanning in order to get into the elevator and a key scanning in order to enter the floor number) . It's soooo annoying to see these stupid girls running around the place with their fake Louis Vuitton bags and Forever 21 dresses when they are clearly staying with 10 other girls in one tiny room!

I've gone here on two occasions, first was my buddy's birthday and there was about 7 of us in one room. Yeah I know we were drunk half the time anyways. Somehow even with 7 of us it was still comfortable enough for a bunch of drunks and roomy enough.  Place has a TV in the shitter...wow thats something, when its over the top and unnecessary. I would have to say the highlight is reading the titles of all the ""erotic films"" when you're shit faced and everyone in the room is cracking up. Just be careful not to actually order one.

Service, dealers are pretty cool and the service is always very friendly and attentive. Buddy of my barfed on his new suit and had the thing dry cleaned in half a day, he got it expressed which was 25 bucks, but normally its only about 10 bucks which is reasonable since they pick it up from your room. I would like to personally thank the security for not giving me trouble while I was shitfaced and trying to find my way back to the room. Seriously, and if any of them helped me along the way thank you.  

Other notes, call the concierge to get on the guest list for Tao, usually you only have to wait 10 minutes, if u got 1:1 ratio they'll let you in. If you have tons of girls and less guys, better. As far as I know they only let 5 guys with as many girls as you want in for free. The line is shorter than the regular guest line. 

One final tip, if you get shitfaced as I did, bring the ottoman in the bathroom and park it right infront of the toilet, proceed to barf without hugging the toilet.

That is all.",0,0,0

And it was just at my last stay that my husband and I had a realization. This is the best steal and the best hotel to be at. For several reasons, the first of which the rooms are amazing, they are all suites and are lavishly decorated, even the bathroom has a flat screen tv. There's a separate eating and entertaining area like if you wanna get your drink on before heading out with your peeps. Second, the location is totally central. Third, the food in the place (restaurants, coffee, shops etc) is all great. I had this amazing coffee drink from the Illy and I was depressed that I never got it after that, it has a strong coffee brew at the bottom and is topped off which cream on the top, not whipped cream but like a thick yet cold and un mousey topping, along with an amaretto (non alcoholic boooooo) flavoring. I would kill for one of those right now.

Oh yeah back to the Palazzo, it really is everything you could possibly ask for, because you get all this for like $200 something a night.

Rooms: I like that they have a separate seating area for the couch, tv and office area. The couches are so comfortable that if you stumble in late night and end up sleeping on one you won't be upset in the morning. They are large and ""L"" shaped. The bathroom is large as well, with a vanity and a separate toilet from shower, which is nice when you have a group.

Pool: We rented a cabana for the day at the Palazzo, which was amazing. It was air-conditioned, had a dvd player and also a personal server for the whole day. It is the way to go if you have a group and surprisingly not over the top expensive. 

Food: Check out Dos Caminos in the lobby area for a great meal. The decor is really cool and the food is good and not overpriced.

Check-in took forever.  When I finally got to the front of the line, they told me that the bed type I had made a reservation for is no longer available.  ""The reservation only guarantees you a room, not a particular configuration."" FINE; but then why are suites with 1 king bed called ""Palazzo Luxury"" while suites with 2 queens called ""Palazzo Bella"" on their own website and have different prices? It was 2am and I was too tired to argue with them so I took whatever room they had.

The ridiculously high resort fee (I know, most Vegas hotels charge a resort fee but it doesn't make it right) is supposed to cover internet and phone calls.  There are three phone in the suite but the only phone that worked was in the bathroom.  I had to stand by the toilet to use their phone. But that phone didn't have a front desk button so I had to press 0 and listen to all of the options.

In the afternoon, a maintenance guy knocked on the door.  I was sitting on the couch so by the time I got up and walked to the front door, he had already let himself in.  Knowing the size of these suites, they should be a tiny bit more patient. What if they walked in on people having sex?

While the bed was comfy enough, the pillows were terrible. I woke up with a sore neck. 

In the end, all I wanted was to check out a couple of hours later but NOPE, they couldn't help with that either.  The Palazzo was definitely not a 5 star experience.

This hotel is beautiful and definitely a gigantor leap from the Circus Circus hotel that my sister and I were forced to say at the night we arrived in Vegas.

The facade of the Palazzo is modest and not quite as extravagant as its mother hotel, the Venetian.  But despite this, the hotel is elegant.  My sister and I walked in excited to be in a real hotel compared to where we spent the first night. We were treated with respect and we felt so welcome by the staff that we felt so special - but I'm sure they strive to make all people feel that way.

When we got up to our room, it just took our breath away.  We were given a view of the strip which was awesome.  And the room - the ROOM--the SUITE was Beautiful and spacious.  The bathroom was ginormous! The room came with two queen sized beds and a living area.  We went to Vegas as a total of 10 girls and all of us were so spoiled that we had only two per room, though the room can comfortably fit 5-6 people. The room came equipped with three flat panel TVs - one being in the bathroom.

The hotel is so nice that we barely left the hotel grounds.  We spent most of our days in the pools which where awesome as well.  The had lounge chairs in the shallow areas of the pool so you can lay in the water to tan and stay cool under the hot sun.  But get there super early like we did and save your spots to lounge.  I'm talking even BEFORE the sun hits the pools. We were there at 10am.  

We rented a cabana by the pool and had our very own cutie patootie cabana boy who we used without restraint (wink wink)  Just kidding.  We were all good girls. I'm sure serving 10 girls was a little high maintenance for him.  The cabanas were equipped with a flat panel tv, air conditioning two chairs, a couch, a refrigerator with refreshing beverages along with 4 lounge chairs in front of the cabana.  The cabanas can be pretty private as we trapped an unsuspecting pool boy delivering oranges to us and kept him hidden from sight with the curtains drawn.   Definitely get a cabana if you go there with a bunch of people.  It's totally worth it.  The pools at the Palazzo are for the mellow relaxing crowd but if you want a party, Tao Beach at the Venetian is just a short walk away.

For the negatives - our whole party agreed that the Palazzo may have opened too early. Housekeeping wasn't up to par.  Plumbing may also have been an issue.  Some people got complimentary slippers and others didn't.  The flowers in the bathroom were wilted upon arrival.  In my cousin's room, one drawer fell on her foot as she opened it and another was missing. In another girls room, the handle to the shower fell off in her hands as she turned it. Our room was missing a hair dryer and the iron was broken. On the 2nd day my cousins were there, they ran out of water for a few minutes.  It also took a while for the water to get hot. But again, the positives far outweighed the negatives.  But because there is quite a list of negatives - I would have to deduct one star.",2,1,3

First, don't pay their rediculous $25 ""resort fee"". Tell them no and they will waive it, unless you seriously came to Vegas to work out and you feel obligated to pay (don't forget you are about to lose you a$$ at the tables.

Second, if you are the type of person who appreciates a nice, chilly, hotel room, bring it up with management. Thay have a code that will stop the goddam AC from turning off when you leave the room or FALL ASLEEP AT NIGHT.

So, I booked a room at Palazzo this time.   Great experience from check-in to check-out.  Beautiful room and great view from 49th floor.  Room has similar layout than the ones at Venetian but felt more modern and new.  Staffs I encountered, including the one who signed me up for Grazie player card, are all friendly and made me felt welcome.   I will definitely stay here again! 

While it's a great stay for me, I do have  a couple minor issues with the Palazzo.  1) confusing parking lot.  Be careful when you drive  in the parking garage.  Slow down, especially at intersections.  2) no coffee maker in the room.  Not a deal breaker but I usually like to have a cup of coffee when I wake up in the morning before I leave a  hotel room.",1,0,1

This trip was my first time in Vegas and we did it right... I got spoiled.  I will never want to stay anywhere else.

The room is simply FANTASTIC! The sunken living room is a nice bonus.  We were lucky enough to get a room on a higher floor and we had a beautiful view.

The best part about the room is the bathroom.  Oh... my... I wanted to live in the bathroom.  In fact, my husband and I liked the bathroom so much, we kept taking measurements and notes to see if we could implement similar changes to our bathroom at home.  I mean... who doesn't like having a TV in the bathroom that you can watch while you shower??  The toilet had a separate little room... just like at home!

Hotel amenities: the gym is expensive in my opinion: $20 for a day pass seems steep.  I did fork up the money for one day and took a yoga class.  The nice thing about the $20 day pass is that you can take advantage of ALL the spa and gym features, including spa tubs, rock climbing wall, fitness classes, etc.

The pool area was really nice.  I liked the blackjack tables right by the pool.  It was a very nice atmosphere.  The service at the pool is fantastic, but the drinks are pretty steep.

The casino floor: it's nicer than your average casino.  I like the tall ceilings, which makes it feel light and bright (some other casinos seem dingy in comparison).

Of course, there are plenty of stores, plenty of restaurants (I think I counted 37...??).

Of course, it's connected to the Venetian, so you have easy access to the gondolas and the Grand Canale shops, which are pretty amazing.

While I really have nothing to compare it to, it would be difficult to beat my experience here at The Palazzo!",1,1,1

The rooms are all suites so space is never an issue here.  The bathrooms are nice and big with a vanity area for the ladies, so they can get all dolled up for a Vegas night out.

My only complaint this past stay was this.  I got back to the room at 3am one night just wanting to shower and go to bed when I stepped on a tiny piece of broken glass in the bathroom.  Next thing I know I'm bleeding everywhere without a bandaid and cursing the world.  Luckily my wife woke up and found a bandaid for me.  We called housekeeping and informed them of the incident.  They were apologetic enough and made sure that they'd come to clean it all up as soon as it was convenient for us.  I was disappointed there was no follow up after this and no comps offered for my troubles.  I'm not one to demand anything so I just let it go, but I'm sure they could've easily offered a few drink coupons or something my bleeding foot.

We reserved a table at Otto Pizzeria for our party of 20 people. The price was reasonable and the food was great.

I am writing to you in regards to a recent stay at Palazzo. My girlfriends and I visit Las Vegas every 6mo for our semi-annual girl's trip. We've been doing this for 3yrs and every visit we've stayed at Palazzo. On our most recent stay this past weekend, it was by far the most frustrating. 
 
I booked two separate reservations at Palazzo. First reservation was through the Palazzo website directly for one night on 3\/1\/13 (conf #HSGD2). Second reservation was booked via American Airlines using my AAdvantage miles redemption for another night on 3\/2\/13 (conf#101702523). Both reservations were under my name and also for a Bella suite. I originally paid $278.88 for the first night and found a lower rate on your website ($234.08) . I called Palazzo and was told that there will be a credit in my account for the remainder $44.80. 
 
Upon arrival, the front desk agent who helped me seemed new to her position. I told her I had two separate reservations but would like to stay in the same room. She said my first night's stay is in a Bella suite but my second night was a King suite. I told her that was not what I had booked. She asked to see the confirmation so I was able to pull it up on my phone. I showed her the confirmation and she agreed it was wrong in the computer. She said this happens all the time and changed it to a Bella suite. I asked if our room keys would be affected and she said no. 
 
I made dinner reservations at Morel's because I confirmed on Thursday that they would serve pan seared foie gras on their menu. I'm a huge fan of foie gras and I've been craving it ever since it was banned in California. I was really looking forward to my meal. To my dismay, Morel's was sold out until Monday! I was devastated. I can't believe the restaurant did not have a sufficient supply to last the weekend?! It was definitely a huge disappointment. The restaurant should have planned their menu better in that regards. 
 
Throughout our stay, our room keys would not work all the time. We had 4 keys and only 1 was working. We had to go back and get new keys. And even after getting new keys, a couple would still not work. It was a real nuisance. On Saturday morning, we asked Housekeeping to come around 2pm since we were all getting ready in the morning for Lavo Brunch. After Brunch, we had an early dinner at Sushi Samba. When we arrived at our room around 7pm, it was not cleaned at all. We had to call for new towels, toilet paper, tissue, toiletries, etc. It was quite annoying.
 
Today I checked my American Express account and noticed there was a charge from Palazzo on 3\/1\/13 for $302.15 and a second charge on 3\/3\/13 for $43.97. I called Palazzo Accounts Receivables and was told my account hasn't been closed out so I was billed for another night's stay. She transfered me to the front desk to check out of my room. I spoke to a front desk agent and she told me I was checked out and the $302.15 and $43.97 charges were for incidentals and resort fee. I told her I declined the optional resort fee when I checked in so I shouldn't have been charged in the first place. She said she would credit me. I asked her why it was such a high amount for incidentals and resort fees, and why did i get charged twice? She advised me it's been credited and I should see a credit of $290(?) in 5-7 business days. I was confused with all these different dollar amounts and she sounded extremely annoyed and not helpful on the phone. Then she tells me the $43.97 was actually for room service. Okay, that makes more sense. But I felt like she didn't give me the correct information in the first place, so that's why I needed more explanation. I will look for the credits to appear on my credit card in the next few days. I hope it will come to the correct amount, otherwise I will be calling back.

I don't think renting rooms here are that expensive (we were here for NYE2012 so we paid up the wazoo for our room..BOOK EARLY!!!!) when you break down how much square footage you get compared to other rooms. 

The 700+ sq. ft Bella Suites sleeps ""officially"" 4, but you can fit 6 very comfortably (2 on each of the queen beds, 2 on the sofa bed). Even with 8 people (air mattress), the room is still very spacious. There is a sunken ""living room"" so plenty of communal space in the daytime. 

The only annoying thing is the 1 bathroom...with no lock. The bathroom has dual sinks with a tub, standing shower, vanity table, separate door for the toilet and a TV! 8 people sharing a bathroom can be a bit tedious, so luckily, the bathrooms in the casino level are near the hotel elevators where people can go do their business and not stink\/hog up the bathroom :) 

- YMMV but there seems to be someone checking keys when entering the hotel room elevators. Grab a bunch for the rest of the peeps in your party (super easy, just go to the front desk and tell them you want extra keys, no limit - we got 6 keys even though our occupancy states only 2 are in the room :P)
- Go to the concierge to pick up free passes to LAVO\/TAO if you don't feel like venturing outside the casino for nighttime entertainment
- Great location: close to XS (the best club there is), fashion show mall, etc...
- if you can get the upgrade to the strip view, it is amazingggg. You can see the volcano erupt from Mirage, and TI's sleazy pirate show. 
- Resort fee $20: includes WiFi in room (no password necessary)",2,1,0

However, the Palazzo is a new property and the rooms are already starting to show signs of wear and tear. At first glance, our suite was beautiful. Then I started noticing little things that bothered me. 

In my opinion, their housekeeping service was pretty sloppy. When we arrived in our room, there was still trash in the trash bins from the previous guest. OK - so I could overlook that. But when I went to the bathroom, my heart sank. I saw mildew in the shower. And not just a little. When it comes to hotels, my biggest pet peeve is a bathroom that has mildew in the shower or bathtub. Seriously, what's the deal here? Each room is supposedly cleaned every day - when you clean a bathroom every day, there really should not be any mildew problem. This is the second 5 star hotel in Las Vegas (the first one was the Bellagio) that had this problem. We've stayed at lesser starred hotels such as the Hilton, where we stayed in a timeshare double suite that did NOT have daily maid service. We did not have a mildew issue there. 

On a positive note, housekeeping was very accommodating when I asked for extra towels or extra toiletries. Unfortunately, their issue is trying to save some money on Tilex. I'm not one to complain about my room while I'm staying at a hotel. I'm scared that the person I have complained about will spit on my toothbrush or use it as a toilet brush. I'd rather yelp the hotel once I've left and then share my experience with others. 

Hubby told me I was being too critical and that the hotel is starting to get run down because they are constantly packed and have a high turn over of guests. He played the devil's advocate until he saw some nasty splatters on the wall next to the sink. Looks like someone had partied too hard and missed the sink. It even grossed him out. 

Another gripe I have was service related. Many workers seemed to be cordial and even cold - not warm and friendly. There wasn't any meaning behind their questions on how things were going or how we enjoyed our stay. There wasn't any inquiry on why I told someone that our stay at the hotel was ""just OK"". So I think they ask the questions and really could care less how we felt about our stay. Which suits me fine because there are a lot of other hotels in Vegas who would welcome us and care about our stay in their hotel. 

The rooms are equipped with a printer so that you can work and even print out your boarding tickets. Unfortunately, our printer was broken, so I had to waste a good hour of gambling time waiting for the on call IT attendant to come upstairs and fix the printer. 

When I asked the valet\/bus attendant on the phone about holding our luggage for a few minutes while we checked out and basically asking if it were the same person who would be obtaining our luggage and then bringing it out - he sounded peeved that I would even ask the question - assuming that I'd know that it would be two different people - so that I'd obviously have to tip both of them. 

I would have left less than 3 stars, but the hotel does have some strong points. The lobby and the water and floral displays are beautiful. It's location is centrally located and attached to the Venetian, it's older sister. The hotel's spa - Canyon Ranch is amazing. Also, there are excellent restaurants in the Palazzo and the Venetian. If you didn't want to leave the hotel, you'd have everything at your fingertips. There's even a Walgreens just outside the hotel. 

The casino is small, so we ended up playing at the Venetian, Bellagio or the Wynn. There is a small non-smoking section, but I didn't see anyone policing the person who was gambling and puffing away in the area. 

I'm not sure I'll ever give the Palazzo a second chance - because I really, really wanted to love it there. Unfortunately, our first date was a flop - so I'm really not sure about a second date.",0,0,0

You could, however, have similar accommodations with better customer service and coffee in the room without the views at a nearby hotel for much less. I've stayed at Palazzo three times. When you arrive, expect that there will be problems with the reservation.  The desk clerk will then offer to upgrade your room, but if they don't, you should argue for it and they will give you the upgrade.   I got to stay at a two bedroom suite for this Christmas this way.  However, if you compare the room with Encore or Wynn, I like Encore's modern and elegant style better.

The rooms are well decorated, however, there seems to be maintenance issues.  I've encountered missing light bulb, leaking toilet and broken TV in my prior visits.  The nice thing staying here is that you have the choices of the many restaurants combined at the Venetian, Venezzia and Palazzo.  Plus, you have the benefit of quality shopping at the Canal Shops.  

For a normal good meal, Grand Lux is a good choice.  For special dinners, Sushi Samba is good place for late-night drinks and snacks. Its food quality is exceptional and consistent.  The Morels French Steakhouse & Bistro is a place to stay away from.  The food was lousy, and the service was bad.  I'd rather go to the Cut for steak.  For Chinese food, I usually just go to Panda Express at the Venetian if I don't want to spend too much on a meal, however, Zine Noodles at the Palazzo is a must try.  I love their Rare Filet Mignon Noodle Soup and Abalone and Chicken Congee.  It was named a top 10 Chinese restaurant in the US by whoever they claim.  Overall, I think the Palazzo is a good or very good hotel, but not exceptional and falls short of a five stars hotel standard.",10,4,6

We are not Vegas regulars, so did a lot of research to find a hotel that we would enjoy. The Palazzo fit the bill. It has large suites, good to great restaurants, and access to a vast variety of shopping.

We got a discounted suite (33% off on their website), which allowed us access to Prestige, a private lounge. This turned out to be an awesome deal which saved us a lot of money! Not only was the suite price discounted, but with choosing a room that allowed access to Prestige, we saved even more money on food and drinks. Prestige also allows speedy check-in and concierge privileges. However, the best part of having Prestige access is you are able to enjoy continental breakfast, snacks, and a 5-8 pm happy hour which pretty much serves unlimited cocktails and appetizers! We found that between the breakfast buffet and the happy hour food, we didn't have to eat at any other places. Of course we did, but if you are looking to save money on food and drinks, then the extra fee that you pay for having access to Prestige is well worth it. The food they served in this lounge area was well above average, presented well, and the servers offered great customer service.

We loved our suite! We stayed in a Prestige Luxury Suite. It was approximately 720 sq. ft., and recently renovated. We had plenty of room to spread out since we had a separate sunken living room and dining area, a large 130 sq. ft., bathroom, and a super comfortable king-size bed. 

Another great feature of staying at The Palazzo is its location. It right on the Strip and surrounded with excellent shopping, restaurants, and other nice casinos. Since The Palazzo is owned by the Sands, which owns the Venetian too, it makes it a huge resort since they are connected.They are separated by the Grand Canal Shoppes.These Shoppes are all high end designer shops sprinkled with celebrity chef restaurants throughout. Across the street is the Fashion Show Mall which has everything you could possibly want if you didn't want to shop at the designer shops in the Grand Canal area. Fashion Show Mall has Macy's, Dillards, Nordstroms, Neiman Marcus, and Saks Fifth Avenue for anchor stores. 

A couple of side notes: Parking is free (well, sort of  -you do pay a $44 a night resort fee) in a huge parking structure which is connected to the hotel and super easy to access.There is valet parking but we chose to park ourselves. It was a straight shot to the elevators and up to the 23rd floor to check-in with Prestige. Another perk since you don't have to wait in a line on the main floor to check-in. Also, they do have 10 pools and a spa called Canyon Ranch Spa. We didn't check these areas out but the spa is highly rated on social media. Wi-Fi is also free with your room. 

Oh! I almost forgot what most people go to Vegas for -gambling! We did gamble a little in the Palazzo casino, but preferred the Venetian casino better. We walked next door to the Wynn and checked out their casino, but found it too refined and boring.",1,0,0

Having stayed here when it opened, I would have given it 5 stars, but after a couple years, this hotel has worn down quite a bit. 

The rooms are still decently clean and look luxurious at first glance, but once you get in there and start ""living"" in the room, you notice all the dingy little details...the water stains on the marble sinks, the splotchy,disgusting stains on the sofa and cushions...you really start to wonder who and what has been in the room and what they've been doing...ew...

To the hotel's credit, they were very nice and accomodating, giving me a free upgrade for being an invited guest. We got a great view of the pool on a high floor and the the linens were soft and clean. We did not have any problems with the hotel maid, considering we had random valuables and several bottles of ""beverages"" lying around...nothing went missing! :) 

They didn't hassle us having multiple people in one room, so that was nice. This is a great hotel if you're looking for suites to jam a ton of people into one room, but if you're looking for a WOW experience, I have to say the Palazzo falls short. 

I will say that they always offer me great deal through Grazie and I probably will still patronize this hotel. I'm ready to try something new though if I get a chance. :)",2,1,1

I ended up staying here after getting a pretty good deal from Hotwire.com. For Fourth of July weekend, we paid the hotwire.com price of $156 per night (+ taxes and fees). The room is nice, big, somewhat modern, and it comes with a sofa-bed. The lighting is aiite, making it a little challenging to put on makeup, but for everything else, it was good.

Here's 2 reasons why I didnt give them 4 stars:
1) Valet lost my friend's ticket and couldn't find his Audi!! My friend had his ticket, how can Valet not have theirs? They found the car (after almost 40 mins), but we ended up being late to our dinner reservations! All Valet could say was ""sorry about that"".

2)  Concierge lost my friends' luggage! We had checked out of the hotel and left our luggage with them so we could go enjoy more of the casino. When we returned to claim our bags, they couldn't find them! We had a total of 7 pieces of luggage and they lost 3 of them. Tired, hot, and ready to go home, they had us walk around with them to search two of their baggage areas for the luggage. When we found it, (after about 30 mins of searching and walking), the Manager said that the sticker with the number probably fell off our bags and thats why it wasnt with our other luggage. He says that when this happens (apparently it happens a lot. Hello! How about a better system where stickers are NOT used??), it is ""unfortunate"". Then he  wished us a safe trip. Are you f***ing serious? That's all you can say? Ugh, whatever.

Customer Service Nightmare:

Key cards did not work and it took them at least 30 mins after we contacted security to come up and open the door. No new keycards were given to us after it was promised. In fact we had to go back the next day, line-up in the ridiculous key & mail lineup just to get new keycards. 

We asked for an another set of amenities and an extra blanket,  they knew there was one more person staying with us. Called when we checked-in 1PM, 8PM, 2AM they didn't show up till 2:30AM! So my friend had to sleep without a blanket, which turned out to be a fleece throw.

For our inconvenience they gave us $50 reimbursement, which was not reflected on the final invoice or taken off my visa. When I further pursed this matter, they said ""we have no recollection and the discount was not noted in our system"" WTH?!?!

Did not honour the discount they promised:
We later got fed up and moved in the Venetian, although a sister hotel, this was  much better than the Palazzo, it was bigger and, the service was superb. 

Pools: The venetian pool was bigger but, no music. Tao Beach, this was lame. It was like 20 lawn chairs facing this dinky swimming pool with techno music in the background. They did however have their own bar. For a lounging atmosphere go to the WYNN pool, they have people coming over to mist you. Ahhh...gotta love the mist. Also it's more of a loung-ey feel with lounge house music playing in the background.

Atmosphere & Decor
We went during memorial day weekend, so it was packed with party goers. It is an older hotel, so if you want something modern go I can confidently recommend the WYNN (if you like the hot people and high rollers kind of feel) Aria is not bad but, for a 5-star hotel it lacks the standard amenities, ie slippers, news paper etc.",0,0,0

Although it's a little bit further down the strip then I'd normally like, it still gives you access to some gems- by being near the mall, some food favorites, and of course, the Wynn and Encore. 

I have never understood anyone who books a room at the Venetian when they can have identical accommodations at the Palazzo without the crowd. Do you have to walk further to the pool and shops? Sure. But at the cost of saving some dollars and saving yourself the headache of congestion, why not stay at the Palazzo? Free valet, lots of self parking, a casino with all your favorite games- it's got most of what you want. 

I will say these elevators can be a nightmare at around 10-11am on Saturday when there's a huge flux of people checking in and out. However, kudos to the Palazzo for allowing us to check in 3 hours early last time we came.

Checked in at 4:30am and they didn't have the Bella Suite I booked. And since we were checking in past 3am, we were considered a no show with deposit forfeited. Maybe there was fine print on the receipt somewhere with this tid bit, but it was a nasty surprise when we were already dead tired from our drive. 

Unbeknownst to me at the time, we were actually helped by the general manager. How he ever became the general manager really boggles the mind.  I thought it was his first day on the job. Not only was he unhelpful, but he had serious attitude problem. He's completely unfit to be in the hospitality business. I'll come back to that later. 

We decided to take a Luxury Suite until a Bella Suite is available. The manager said to call the front desk at 11am to inquire on availability. Afterwards, we accepted the manager's offer of extra towels, which he promised would be right up. We settled in and waited for 30 minutes, when we phoned the front desk about the towels only to be told it'll be right up. Again, another 40 minutes. 1 hr and 10 minutes spent waiting for towels and extra blankets when all we wanted to do was go to Earl's for some breakfast. 

At 11am we promptly phoned the front desk about the Bella Suite and was told one would be ready soon. We left our contact info and went about our day, but by 2pm we still haven't heard a peep. 2pm is reasonably early on any regular day, but we were in Vegas and wanted to maximize our day, not wait around in our hotel room for a room change. There was dinner, show, and club lined up and we were anxious to move into the new room and get ready. 

After some back and forth on the phone with the front desk, we're finally in the Bella Suite. Next come the painful towel request once more. Phoned the front desk for some extra towels and blankets and off we went to the strip. Back 5 hrs later and lo and behold, no towels to be seen. Another phone call before they arrived 40 min later. 

I admit that extra towels and blankets isn't a life and death matter, and there's no reason to be this harsh. However, if they charge a particular room rate and advertise to be a 5 star resort, there're standards to uphold and expectations to meet. We looked forward to a luxurious stay at a beautiful hotel, instead we spent a good amount of time nagging the staff for towels and room change. 

After returning home, my friend called Palazzo to complain about our stay. She spoke to the general manager who turned out to be the man helping us on the first night. Just like the first night, he continued to be rude and unhelpful. It culminated in her telling him that we won't be staying at the Palazzo again, at which point he expressed that he couldn't care less.

Seriously? Palazzo, please take heed. Here's a manager who's managing you into the ground. He has more care for his ego than his job. 

Within our party, we all agreed that Palazzo has the worst service out of any hotels we've experienced. And it's a shame that it's suppose to be one of the nicest. Despite its fancy exterior and beautiful rooms, the service was sorely lacking and really detracted from our stay. 

Luckily, my friend was able to contact the VP to air our grievances. He was completely sympathetic as well as apologetic for our poor experience. We were promised a gift card as well as his assistance to make our next visit an enjoyable one. These are all nice gestures, and that is why my 1 star experience is rated at a 2. 

For busy friends that have a difficult time to plan trips together, it's imperative that these trips be as trouble free as possible. Even though comps and freebies (for poor experiences) are nice, I'd much prefer a stress free trip. With so many other reputable resorts on the strip, there's little reason to give offenders a second chance.",10,2,0

If I didn't have this insane love for the Cosmopolitan, I would have no problem staying at the Palazzo every time I came to Vegas.

Even for the lowest-level suite at the hotel, it's pretty amazing.  The bed area has these super luxurious beds with mood lighting and drapes.  You can easily sit back because of the comfort padding and watch TV from there.  There's a sunken living room area that has a large L-shaped couch (with a pullout bed if necessary), a coffee table, a small dining table, and a fax machine\/printer (if I actually needed to use it).  The curtains are remote-controlled, so it negates figuring out how to close the blinds when you need to live like a vampire after clubbing the night before.  Plus the windows are huge, perfect for a Strip view.  The room is easily capable of fitting six people comfortably.

The bathroom is the one that you wish you had at home.. Two sinks, a small flatscreen TV, a large bathtub, a separate glass shower, and a toilet with a separate door (in case you have multiple occupants of the room that need to get ready at once).  And for the ladies, yes, there is a makeup mirror.

As for the hotel, you just know you're dealing with another level of class as soon as you walk in.  The opening corridor leads you to this massive statue (and hey, Lavo is right there too!).  Then once you walk into the casino, they kept the main walkway so wide that you could fit three elephants down it.  And it made for easy access to our rooms was very welcome...just walk straight.  It's seriously dumbproof.  Also appreciate that the ventilation was squared away, because I'm sick of going into casinos where you end up smelling like smoke if you stay there too long.

Food options are plentiful.  You have Grand Lux Cafe, you have Palazzo's line of 2nd floor shops (I really need to try to Sushi Samba), and because it's connected to Venetian you can go to the Grand Canal Shoppes' food court for cheaper options.

Best part though?  The Walgreens right next to it.  I have no idea how Walgreens got prime territory on the Strip, but I am extremely appreciate of it.  Especially when I needed some pick me up food in the morning.

The room was large and came with everything that was described PLUS MORE. By more, I mean it came with LIPSTICK MARKS ON MY WINDOW, MULTIPLE STAINS ON MY COMFORTER, AND EARRING ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR FOR ME TO STEP ON. On the evening of 04\/28\/2016 I went to the front desk and politely informed them of all the issues. They only offered to give me a late checkout, took off a SINGLE night's resort fee and tax, and they stated that they would send up a new comforter. WHY WOULD I WANT TO STAY IN  THE SAME FILTHY ROOM LONGER. I was not offered a room of equal value. I was not offered anything you would expect to be offered when you inform them you are sleeping in someone else's filth. I also spent the night of 04\/28\/2016 on the couch of my suite SINCE MY NEW COMFORTER NEVER ARRIVED. On the morning of 04\/29\/2016 during Check Out I politely informed them again that my stay was extremely disappointing, and provided pictures to the man at the front desk. Again, to no avail they halfheartedly apologized   and took off the second night's 'resort fee'. So basically, long story short, I got to sleep in an completely disgusting, over priced king suite at The Palazzo and got $60 dollar off and an apology. I hope you truly feel my frustration and disappointment with this establishment. I've worked in the hotel industry for 4 years, this was literally absurd. I never leave reviews, and I never thought I'd need to write one so negative. This is real. I wouldn't write all this crap if it wasn't, literally ruined the trip. - Sincerely Amier Poustchi",1,0,0

I expected much more from this resort but was completely let down.  The casino floor sucks, reception area sucks, and room service totally sucks.

Reception Area:
Small, and busy with long lines.

Casino Floor
The layout of the casino is quite small compared to other mega resorts on the strip.  The annoyance of having this be the only casino in Vegas that repeatedly check my ID and my friends is ridiculous. (We are way over 25).  Having the bartender check your ID when you are using ""sportsbook"" drink voucher is completely ridiculous also.

Room Service:
Worst part of all.  As part of our package, we were to receive a complimentary champagne gift basket.  Yes we received the gift basket.  Great!  Later on that night at 3am, my friend receives a knock on the door from room service.  The guy at the door was bringing in another ""gift basket"".  I'm happy they brought another one for us but at 3AM??  Are you kidding me????
On our last night there, we left our room at about 12 noon and didn't return until after dinner around 930pm.  To our surprise, the room was not made and we did not have any towels, etc!  For a 5 star hotel, this should not happen.  I call down to the operator and they state someone will come up immediately to fix the room for us.  We then leave and return back at midnight.  The room was still not touched!  I had to call back another time to make the same request.  This time, after we left the room and came back in the morning, it was finally made.

The rooms have a separate lounge area with a pretty large family style seating area. 

All five of us pretty much ended up staying in one room. We would use the second room to use the bathroom but we did most of our partying and getting ready and sleeping in the one room.

definitely my preferred hotel to stay in in my old (kinda middle) age.  basically a newer version of the venetian with less of that heinous perfume smell that permeates their casino.  the rooms\/suites are very nice and the service is impeccable.  the sunken suite and flat screen tv's are the way to go.  that and the remote control curtains\/drapes which seal the room like a vault.  all hotels must have this.  nothing worse than a rough night of partying and then finally getting in bed only to have that thin beam of light come through that crack in the curtains to hit you right in the face.  then you have to drag your self up and futilely try to fix the curtains.

The rooms are all suite, so while the rooms might be typically  more on the pricey side, it becomes worth it if you're splitting it between friends. Rooms are furnished with good quality beds and materials, but you'll see better at other newer hotels. The couch doubles as a pullout bed that is surprisingly comfortble. Some of the furniture in the rooms also look a bit weathered now, but you should come to expect that from a Vegas hotel a few years old. Staff has always been nice and courteous. My last trip was rough, we didn't check out until 2 pm, and they waived us the late fee. That was definitely appreciated.

As far as things to do and places to eat. Lavo is nice, but a little on the low key side. Since Palazzo and Venetian are connected properties, you also have Tao, which I hate. The pools at both properties are nice, Palazzo's are on the chill side, but at Venetian you have the music blaring, fist pumping, juice head infested Tao beach. There are better pool parties to be had. Grand Lux is always a winner, but only the Venetian one is only one of the two that is open 24 hours. 

Palazzo and Venetian still have a special place in my heart because of all the insane times I've had at these places. Nowadays though, you can find nicer alternatives at other newer hotels.  If you're spitting a room between 4+ people though, this might be the best alternative for you.",1,0,0

It is truly a gorgeous and ginormous hotel, impeccable at that, but their service level could definitely be improved.

We checked in on a Friday night, and that went by fairly smoothly.  Fair warning though, it is a little bit of a walk from the check-in lobby to the elevators (if you don't travel light), otherwise it's a short walk across the casino.  

As soon as we entered our room, we noticed there were no bath towels, no toothbrushes, and only two hand towels (even though we had booked the room for 4 people).  I guess they didn't have time to restock the room or our room was overlooked.  Either way, we decided to give the lobby a call and we requested extra towels, blankets, toothbrushes, and slippers, which they promised would be delivered within 30 minutes.  

40 minutes later....still waiting...

60 minutes later...still waiting...

80 minutes later...still waiting...

We finally gave up and decided to call the lobby again.  After confirming our room #, we were told that the ticket order had already been closed because all of the requested items were delivered.  Honestly, I have no idea how that happened, seeing how we were just hanging out in our room the entire time and nobody knocked on our door or came in to deliver the so called amenities.  So they promised they would reopen the order and have it delivered on a ""rush"", meaning 15-20 minutes.  For the record, our items finally came 30 minutes later, bringing it to a total waiting time just shade under 2 hours.  Ridiculous.  

But besides that whole ordeal, it's a really nice and posh hotel.  The rooms are spacious, comfy, and their curtains block out any sunlight for when you just need to crash when you get back into your room at 6 AM and sleep after a night out.

Yes, this is a pattern where the Palazzo hotel was cancelling third party booked reservations en masse. THe likelihood of both our reservations not going thru is very very low.

SO, when I checked in. My reservation was not visible. I had to call Expedia (very tough bc Expedia engineers friction into the customer service process). I had to call Expedia to have them repush the Expedia confirmed reservation thru to Palazzo's 'job duties department' (also known as trying to manage Memorial Day overbooking by being 104% overbooked)

Note: My expedia confirmation number was of no use.
Note: the hold time on Expedia was extraordinarily long

TIP: If you're booking directly on Palazzo's site, expect to pay more than double. 
TIP: If you're booking on Expedia, Priceline or Hotels, expect the hotel to disavow. Call Expedia 2-5 hours before you try to check in and say, ""Hey Palazzo's job duties department does not have me in the system. Push my reservation thru again.

TIP Ideally, you would call palazzo and venetian from the McCarran tarmack because you're gonnna be on hold forever with 877-359-8474

TIP: I would call the Venetian Palazzo the night before and have them email you a confirmation. Do not accept a verbal confirmation.

We did have a few maintenance issues: TV  remote didn't work, one of the bathroom sinks had a drain problem.  ALL were  fixed immediately!

The only ding I can give is the lousy ""shills"" or 'hawkers"" that jump at you the moment you slow down or have a minute interest in their windows.  VERY annoying and VERY much a scam.

I didn't get suckered in as we have them in local shopping centers in my California area.

But I did have some fun with them.  Let them put the $249.00 - ""best price until midnight"" miracle eye cream. They did the left eye and the bag under my left eye was gone.  Other eye was left untouched as a basis of comparison.  It had the SAME results as the stuff I buy at CVS or Walgreen's at $20.00 a bottle.

Wandered by later that night after I put the Walgreen's stuff on my other eye.  New guy that wanted to ""wipe"" off the stuff of my left eye (their stuff). Told him that was the result of his miracle product.  Walgreen's was still looking good on holding down the puffiness. 

He then changed the subject of the lines around my mouth.  Told him I really didn't care about them.  I earned those lines.....he just laughed and moved on to some other victim.

My recommendation is to not make eye contact with these shills. They are everywhere in Vegas. At the mall as well.

From Tao to 4 Chinese Restaurants to the Canal Shops, the whole joint appears to cater to Asian visitors.  So if you go, get ready for a lot of people that look like me joining you at the tables.

THE ROOM:
As a tourist:
--- REGISTRATION: Be sure to hand your driver's license to the registration desk clerk along with a $20 bill under it & ask for any upgrades available, preferably close to the elevators.  We got a fantastic view of the strip, the Las Vegas skyline, & the Sirens of TI show which includes fireworks.
--- BED:  The bed is better than Wynn's.  It doesn't move when you get into it, thus not waking up your partner if you're coming in to the room hypothetically at 4AM after hitting the tables for a long stretch.  BTW: 3 Flatscreen TV's adorn the unit.
--- FURNITURE:  The drapery\/blinds operate automatically via remote control & the attention to detail is just stunning from the carpet to the crown molding to the dark woods of the table tops.  There are detractors that call the décor ""faux"" but I don't agree, nor do I really care.  It looks good & it's comfortable so why hate?
--- ROOM SERVICE:  I love the Sands Room Service.  I've had most items on the menu.  Best Crab sandwich... ever.  Nuff said.
--- SHOWER: Water pressure is good & warms quickly!  Yay!

As a business traveler:  
--- POWER: There are ZERO power outlets near the office desk.  Call the front desk for a power strip & they'll bring you one.  
--- INTERNET:  Wired or wireless, the Internet connectivity is great.  Don't have room to explain why, but definitely more advanced than Venetian\/Wynn.
--- SAFE:  The room safe has a power outlet inside it.  Why?  Well, if you lock up your laptop, you can actually charge it in the safe.  Nice! 
--- SUITE:  The Palazzo suite doubles as a hospitality suite.  There's enough meeting space, coffee table room, & wet bar amenities to make it a great place to discuss business.  There's a DVD player there along with a 3 seat meeting table as well as a really nice sectional sofa & love seat wrapped around a coffee table.  It's a Venetian room on steroids. 
--- PRINTER:  The printer is an all-in-one inkjet w\/ both a fax line, copier\/scanner capability, & a USB cable to hook it up to your laptop to act as a personal printer for printing flight passes or show tickets.

ISSUES:  Verizon Wireless phone reception really blows from where we were at.

THE HOTEL:
First the good stuff:
--- SPA:  The Palazzo spa & facilities aren't quite built out yet, so you have to walk to the Venetian's Canyon Ranch Spa which is probably the best workout facility in Las Vegas.  They've got everything you need using top notch equipment & they have a great spa available to soak in afterwards.  The only problem is that you have to walk a few minutes just to GET there from the Palazzo, but all in all, it's worth it.
--- DEAL: There is a deal available called the ""Resort Package"" (http:\/\/www.palazzolasvegas.com\/resortpkg.aspx) which I recommend. 
ISSUES:  
--- POOL:  Something that bugged me more than I thought it would was the lack of availability of a 21 & over \/ topless pool like the Wynn had.  The reason for this is that the pool at the Venetian & the Palazzo has an inordinate number of KIDS.  & it's just downright hard to enjoy yourself once you've experienced the serenity of the Sunset pool at the Wynn. 
--- WOMEN'S BATHROOMS:  My poor wife.  There were long lines for women's bathrooms nearly everywhere we went.  Clearly, the Palazzo & the Venetian pools are 'at capacity' for women. (?)

THE RESTAURANTS:
In general, I don't care for the restaurants here.  ""Woo"" however is outstanding & makes up for a lot - see my review.  (I went to Cut, Table 10, Woo, Zine, Dos Caminos, Carnevino, Dal Toro)

THE CASINO:
The Palazzo has the SINGLE... WORST... CASINO... EVER!  The Palazzo Blackjack tables only play $25 EIGHT DECK SHOES with 70% penetration, no surrender, dealer hits on S17, DD on any two cards.  We fed $200 into the Palazzo slots at $1 machines playing max bet & got almost zero returns, zero bingos, & zero fun.  So everyday I would walk over to the Venetian & play my money there where the table rules are so much better. 

THE COMP SYSTEM:
The comp program - Club Grazie - is awful.  It's a slot club primarily. That being said, the invites from hours of table play are AWESOME.  My last invite was $200 in match play, 4 nights at the resort, $50 in dining credit, & a 2-for-1 pass for the spa.  And the best part is the invite is unlimited for this season.  I plan on calling in another trip next month. 

(I have a bigger review of Palazzo here:

No, seriously.
I only stay here when I visit Las Vegas from northern California several times a year. 
(Prior to their opening 4 years ago, I stayed at the Venetian). 

Wanna know why? 

-The suites are beautiful. 
-My views have always been incredible.  
-The staff treats me like VIP (but that could be based upon my gameplay). ;)
-Fabulous restaurants (though I'm still sad Dos Caminos closed). 
-Great Player's Club perks. 
-Private VIP rooms within the casino between both the Venetian and Palazzo. 
-Exceptional pools and cabanas. 
-Friendly housekeepers. 
-Access to multiple retail shops and other hotels.

I was so grateful that we stayed here for free. It was a nice and clean place. The comforter was a duvet with a cover! Finally a hotel understands that they should do that so they can just take the duvet off and wash it after a guest checksout! Our view was amazing and I swear I would pass out every night I went to bed and awoke so refreshed. The only drawback is the pool filled with a bunch of douchebags. And what is up with people putting chairs in the pool? It was crowded like mad and was not enjoyable....maybe i act like an old lady even though I am far from it. I also passed on the spa because it looked crowded and had a feeling it would of sucked just like the pool. So 3 stars for room and 1 star for spa\/pool area.

For the most part,  it's like the other Vegas hotels. What sets it apart though is the amount of room you get. The only place I liked better was the Wynn or was it Encore? One of those.

This hotel is huge and all the rooms are suites. This last stay we were fortunate to get a room with a strip view. I love this view especially at night when it's all lit up with lights. 

The rooms are spacious with a separate living area. The coolest thing is that the drapes open up and close by remote. The drapes block out all the light, so you can sleep in after staying up all night in the ""city that never sleeps"" :-) The living room couch also opens up to a bed if you have children or more guests. The bath room is huge with a separate shower and tub, 2 sinks, a make-up area, and private toilet area. All rooms come with a stocked refrigerator  (don't move anything unless you want to be changed ) a safe, and 2 robes for use at the pool. The room also comes with 3 flat screen TVs! 

The room is clean, the toiletries are luxurious quality,  and the beds are comfortable.  Service is excellent, and the staff will do all they can to meet your needs. 

The Lobby is beautiful at check-in and valet service is available. Be sure to take the walkway to the Venetian and see the decor and waterfalls. You may even catch a wedding taking place :-) There are many excellent restaurants to try and high end shopping available.

We did have a few problems with the casino.  We were there when the time changed from daylight savings time and all the slot machines had a problem.  We wanted to check out our money and everyone had to be hand paid. We had to wait over an hour. We also had trouble with the slot service a few other times. The drink service has also gone down hill. They are not serving the top shelf drinks like they use to and are no longer serving Fiji water. It takes forever to get a drink,  even just water and we felt some of the waitresses were not friendly. It's sad to see theses services go downhill and makes ""the player"" feel like they are no longer important.  Many of the casinos seem to be catering more to ""the club crowd"" today. We also feel the machines were not registering and keeping track of our play correctly.  The numbers they gave us did not match ours! I would give this hotel 5 stars if it wasn't for all the problems we had in the casino. 

I am disappointed that there are no coffee makers in any of the rooms.  However, they do give you a free cup of coffee at La Presse coffee located between the Palazzo and Venetian.  Depending on who is working, they may give you a refill for free. I still think it would be nice if they add the coffee makers to each room.

Our suite was spectacular, with a Strip view, and we could watch the Treasure Island show each and every night from our window.  The beds and couches were to die for, the room service impeccable, and we had free wi-fi in our room.  Bravo to whoever the interior designer was.

I mean....even our curtains had their own remote control.

Not that we needed THREE televisions, but we had them.  The bathroom was HUGE, and several people could be getting ready at the same time if you needed to.  The toilet also had it's own separate room, which we all appreciated.  Nothing ruins your vacay more than when someone blows up the bathroom.

Be forewarned, yes, this will sound nit picky. Why? Because it's supposed to be 5 stars, we have no idea why. 5 stars=allowance for picky!

Check in was great, perhaps due to no line and were routed to VIP check in. Sadly, the VIP above and beyond treatment ended at the VIP desk. Our room was spacious and clean. We enjoyed the layout but not so much the large breadcrumbs left over in the waste basket. I don't need to know the previous guest enjoyed garlic bread. 
The dining was enjoyable, however. I LOVE Illy coffee and they had it, SW is our favorite steak house and Cut was comparable other than letting in some hobo-esque diner in a hoodie and Tevas. HOODIE AND TEVAS PEOPLE!!!! As if I want to pay that much to stare at people who meandered in half drunk from not getting enough food at McDs. Luckily his granny picked up the tab for him. 
We aren't huge gamblers but enjoyed a night of blackjack, other than the pit boss who was as entertaining as a court jester. He conveniently overly chatted with hubby when he was winning and mysteriously disappeared as soon as hubby started losing until I said to quit getting distracted. We aren't there to gamble as serious people.  But come on now. Pit jester physically grabbed hubby's chips to give dealers a ""tip"" with all of his chips, after the umpteenth time that got obnoxious. We are very good tippers, by no means were we skimping on the dealer and waitress. The dealers and servers were prompt and friendly and at least didn't swipe chips. Not funny pit boss. Get your own chips. Speaking of swiping, I purposefully put all of our ones for tipping valets and such in a single bank envelope, stashing it between two maps. Apparently the maids enjoy swiping as much as the pit bosses do because our money was stolen. I 100% know this because I kept track and checked each time we returned to our room. So unless you want your chips and tips stolen, lesson learned, use the safe. My bad for trusting 5 star hotel staff. You're welcome for the $40 tip ladies. :\/
Don't stay here unless you enjoy family friendly hotels. Who totes tots to VEGAS? I almost ran down a dozen in the casino area. Please stay somewhere that has a circus parents. There is one not away. It has video games, not just video poker.

The Moroccan style street vendors peddling $400 collagen eye cream was incredibly annoying and unavoidable since they are outside of the elevators. No, I don't want your Chiclets. If my skin is so ""amazing"" why are you following me with free samples? The other stores are awesome! Christian Loubitin always satisfies. But, they aren't owned by the Palazzo. 

Even though we requested turn down on the first night to be done nightly they only remembered once. I wouldn't call a sachet of two chocolates and closing the curtains turn down when you aren't actually turning anything down. Not a huge fan of the jet engine style room fan coming on every 10 minutes. If I wanted to hear a sound resembling a jet, I'd stay at an airport HoJo. On the upside, the valets, dining, shops, and casino staff (other than the giant jester) were great. The public areas were clean aside from dropped pacifiers and stuffed animals. 
At the end of the trip after charging well over 2k to the room and gambling for hours we got ZERO comps. Zero. Nil. Niet. Nein. No can dooskey on comps so unless you spent a ridiculous amount don't bother, although if you enjoy being scoffed at, feel free to ask Theresa for comps. ""Unless you play $50 per hand for at least 4 hours per day you will not be comped anything."" Thanks Theresa. Manager of casino hosts. After 6 nights and 7 days you'd think a free 8oz of my favorite Illy wouldn't be asking for too much. Bummer. You were warned. Not having access to my VPN thanks to hotel internet blocking (I called and asked) I was forced to chew up my own personal cell hotspot data while Palazzo chewed up my daily room fee that included ""free wifi"". Why bother? Being given an extra fridge for my husband's insulin was accommodating and well appreciated. Especially since we got charged $8 for something in the mini fridge we never used. Maybe the maids also had a Fiji water.

Palazzo is like the Venetian's little fresh, innocent sister, unspoiled ... well mostly anyway, it IS Vegas. It opened in Jan 2008, so it's really quite new still, the rooms still have a good feel to them.

I love these little spinoff hotels like THE hotel for Mandalay .. and Palazzo for Venetian. It's a little quieter, less hectic, less people, less SMOKY. A little bit more personal. Three LCD TV's in the suite, I mean how can you go wrong?

Hard to pull off in Vegas, but it givess off the right vibe of sophisticated yet comfortable. Connects to the Venetian for easy access to all of their shops, restaurants, conference center. Very helpful and accommodating staff.

The hotel is so luxurious!  The rooms are so spacious!  Granite everywhere, it's so posh!  There was so much room for a family of 5.  Everything is gorgeous and every room has a t.v.!  My 4 yo son asked me, ""Mama, why is there a t.v. in the bathroom?""  I told him is was so he could watch SpongeBob while taking a shower!  His eyes lit up!

My kids loved the fact that they could watch the Pirate Show at Treasure Island just across the street every night.  And the pools at the Palazzo were awesome.  We basically would eat breakfast, head to the pool, eat lunch, head back to the pool, have dinner and we were back in the pool again!

I enjoyed the shopping mall that connected the Venetian to the Palazzo, you can just stay there and never have to endure the Las Vegas heat!  

The only reason why I'm giving the Palazzo 4 stars out of 5 is because they charged us a $50 restocking fee even though we didn't have anything from the in room fridge.  My kids were playing with the items and didn't put them back EXACTLY as how it was left.  So WARNING, don't touch the fridge!

You seriously don't need to go anywhere else!  We stayed for 3 days and it was the best and most relaxing 3 days in Vegas I've ever had!",2,1,1

Vegas is nasty too. But in situations where you have no other choice but to stay in a Vegas hotel The Palazzo is probably a better choice from the selection.

First off, the hotel is BEAUTIFUL. It is a newer hotel that has a grand lobby, impressive architecture, and nice decorations. The staff is friendly and they are attentive at the elevators to prevent random people from going up to the suite floors\/pool. It is not too crowded especially since I was there on a busy weekend. The price for this hotel is slightly expensive but if you book your suite early you can definitely find a good deal. 

The hotel is situated within walking distance of several hotels including the Venetian (they're connected), The Mirage, Treasure Island, and Caesar's Palace. Taxis are also efficient in this city.

The hotel\/casino is top-notch and very detailed in every aspect. They clean and scrub areas of the hotel regularly and it shows. I've seen staff clean and scrub the restrooms and the lobby areas late at night and early mornings. People spill drinks at the casino table (me haha) and they have tissues to clean it up immediately. Everyone is very courteous here.

The rooms are spacious; every room has a separate sitting area with its own TV and a sofa that may or may not be a pullout bed. The bathroom has a separate tub and walk-in shower, 2 sinks, and a private toilet behind a door. All of this makes it convenient, so someone can be using the toilet while others could get ready using 2 sinks. There is also a chair and table for ladies to make their face in the bathroom. If someone is using the bathroom, there is a mirror in the foyer for the ladies to make their face :)

During 2 separate visits, we encountered some problems. The first is that we gave the bellman our luggage, which were separated into multiple tickets. When we called for it, they only delivered luggage belonging to 1 ticket and marked our room as ""done"" in their system. Two hours later, after multiple inquiries and being given the run-around, we went downstairs to retrieve the luggage ourselves and had to wait in the lobby while they looked for it. About 1 hour after picking up our luggage, we received a call checking up on the issue; they resolved it by offering us a $50 dining credit.

The second time, we checked into our room to find a used cup, body print on the bed, pillows laid out, a used towel, and a dirty tub. It looked as if someone accessed the room, took a nap, and washed up before leaving. We got switched to a new room immediately. About 1 hour after the incident, we received a call about the issue and they offered us complimentary internet access to make up for it.

The customer service is amazing. They are quick and eager to resolve issues to the best of their abilities. Love love love this hotel. Definitely my #1 out of all the hotels in Vegas.

The location is towards the north end. The view is usually of the swimming pools or mountains, not the best strip view. These may be negatives for some, but the luxury details, feel, comfort, and service makes it the best place to stay! This is not one of those hit-or-miss hotels! You can't go wrong with any room. The lobby usually has decorations and there is easy access to many restaurants. It is connected to the Grand Canal Shoppes & The Venetian. Have you seen the gondolas? The crowd is a mixture of older and younger, those seeking a relaxing getaway as well as those wanting to party, since there is the best gym\/spa here as well as Tao Nightclub. Parking at Palazzo is easy, whether using valet or self parking.",6,0,3

The Palazzo (attached to The Venetian) is one of the largest casinos in Las Vegas and it features luxurious rooms.  All of the rooms are also suites, which means you get a nice big bed and a comfortable living room with large couches and tables.  The space, the plentiful seating and the luxurious touches and decor accents throughout the room make The Palazzo the perfect spot for a pre-night gathering with a big group of friends.

The room is comfortable too (both in terms of furniture and room temperature).  The bathroom is nice as well and quite spacious with both a soaking tub and a glass shower.  It was one of the nicest rooms I have stayed at though I personally prefer The Cosmopolitan due to its younger vibe and balconies in some rooms.

I did not get to check out much of the amenities like the fitness center and the pool, but there are many good dining options in the hotel with plenty of upscale breakfast and lunch spots as well as a Bouchon Bakery just downstairs.  A big chain pharmacy is also attached to the casino.

In terms of the location, The Palazzo is pretty good.  I personally prefer to be closer to Caesars, Bellagio and The Cosmopolitan, but The Palazzo is not too far north.

Service was good and pleasant.

Room rates are often high, but their room rates are typically not as expensive as Aria, The Cosmopolitan, Wynn, or Encore.  In addition, there are a few weekends during the year (if you do your research) where you can get a room at The Palazzo at a great rate.

I really enjoyed my stay at The Palazzo and it would be one of my first choices on The Strip if I was staying in Las Vegas with a big group of people.  The space coupled with the luxurious touches make this a great place for a weekend stay.  It can also make for an iconic Las Vegas stay and experience.

Layout of the hotel and casino was nice - connects easily to the Venetian.

I slept 6 dudes in one room comfortably! Two queen beds and a living room area. Just overall the value of the room was unbeatable and made the whole trip experience for me pretty amazing.

___________________________________


We were lucky to have had such an awesome person at the check-in counter when we stayed there. We had a lengthy conversation regarding all the Cirque du Soleil productions, gossiped a little about Steve Wynn and the corporate break-up that led to the birth of Le Reve, and traded tips on the fabulous celebrity chef restaurants. He assured me that dinner at Joel Robuchon would be ""the best meal of my life"" (as it was his and many others before him) and gave me a list of a few unknown casual off-Strip eateries commonly frequented by visiting celebrity chefs, sommeliers (Robert Parker), and Cirque du Soleil performers. (I assure you, losing that list was not fun.)

By the end of the conversation, he had upgraded us to the Palazzo Bella, with a view of the Strip. I realize it's not ""the best room in the resort,"" but it was beautiful just the same, and wonderful coming back to such a clean, spacious, and comfortable room every night after all that walking around the Strip followed by dinners and shows.. The bathtub was big enough for two to relax in, and the sitting area allowed us to sit and chat over bubbly whenever we wanted.. We had 2 LCDs in the actual bedroom, and another one in the bathroom. All requests were quickly addressed, and the housekeeping staff do an incredible job keeping the place virtually spotless.

The location is ideal, being next to the Wynn and across(ish) the Treasure Island and Mirage.

The property itself is, as any of us familiar with Vegas know, beautiful.

I had an incredible time.

The rooms have remote control drapery, 3 TVs, luxurious living room space, a table to dine, and a DVD player. That's just the basic room. It has great places to eat: Trattoria Reggiano, Sushisamba, Cut, Delmonico, Bouchon, Noodle Asia, and Buddy V's. The views from any room are good to phenomenal. The pool is fun and has some good looking people basking in the LV sun. Don't buy your drinks at the pool. The gym is excellent. Don't forget the Gold Room, Club Prestige, Paiza Club, and getting your points at the Grazie player's club. The beds are comfortable cloud-like cushions. The in-room business desks are great to log in to work. The basic suites can sleep 5 with 2 queens and sectional sleeper sofa. The Fusion Bar is cool with great mixologists. Just be careful of the events manager from the player's Grazie Club. 

The Grazie casino club offers great comps. Be sure to use it when charging to your room and purchasing retail merchandise in the shoppes areas. Status points will grow fast. I was invited to several comped $50,000 slot tournaments over 2 years. Then I had the disfortune to meet this woman at the 2014 Halloween slot tournament. Despite this hiccup, I really like the Palazzo.

March 2016 update
The gyms are fantastic. Patrick, the gym attendant, was very accommodating with fresh towels, equipment assistance, and cups of water. We got a room on the 44th floor with The Strip view.

Stayed at the Bellagio, Las Vegas last year with our family and loved it.  Thought we would stay at the Venetian this year as this is also a 5 star hotel.  There were no rooms available upon our early (11 AM) arrival at the Venetian, so we were offered two identical ""Venetian type rooms"" in the Palazzo Hotel, which is part of the Venetian.  The rooms were big and spacious.  We found them very comfortable.  Great view of the mountains, lots of room for 4 adults (we occupied 2 rooms with 4 occupants in each room), and we were given rooms on the same floor to make things more convenient for all of us. The view from the 39th floor was beautiful and the rooms were very quiet.  If there were people in the rooms adjacent to us, we didn't know it.  We received complimentary continental breakfast tickets at the Grand Lux Cafe.  You could upgrade to their Breakfast Buffet for an additional $8.50 per person, which we did.  It was well worth it as our family loved the breakfast buffet.  They had a great variety of food and it was all very tasty!

We paid a resort fee of $17 plus tax per room per night ($19.04); not quite sure what the fee covered, but it included internet and printer usage.  I had no problem with the fee as I was informed of it ""up front"" when we made our reservations.

What ensued caused me to downgrade their rating to a 4.  The printer in my room was out of ink and had no USB plug to connect to my laptop for printing.  I was told they would replace the ink cartridge in my room but I would have to pay $10 for the USB plug if I wanted to print anything.  I informed them that there was no USB plug when I entered the room, so why was I required to pay for something that should have been attached to the printer upon my arrival?  They informed me they were sorry, but Palazzo occupants had been taking their USB plugs and they would have to charge the next occupant for it if they wanted to use the printer.  It would cost me $10 and I could keep the USB plug when I left.  I found it incredulous that they would make me pay for something that they should be providing as a service that I already paid for. I did not buy their USB cable.  Instead, I went to our son's room, where they had a USB cable connected to their printer, and printed our boarding tickets for our flight back home from their room. 

Other than the incident with the USB cable, we had a great time at the Palazzo.  Their shops were great, the canal was beautiful, the staff was very polite and helpful, and the location of the hotel enabled us to leave our rented van in the garage so we could walk to most of our destinations on the strip.  We would stay there again.  However, next time, I will bring a USB cable with me to connect to the printer in my room in the event the same thing happens again.  

One other note:  There is a 24 hour Walgreen's located right at the corner of the Palazzo.  People packed the place buying drinks, snacks, and other ""essentials"" that would have cost many times that if you purchased it at the Palazzo.  For instance, a package of 'M&M' candy at the Palazzo would cost $9; it would cost you $6 for a small bottle of Fuji water from your room.  You could buy those items for many times less than that at Walgreens.",0,0,0

I actually added a friend to the room who got there before I did, so not sure how check in was, but adding her was simple.

In general the hotel is pretty nice, as it should be for the slightly higher price tag. My friends were convincing me to try it (I typically think that you should just go for a mediocre hotel (Mandalay, MGM, etc) because you won't be there much and the prices are great. But this place was worth the extra 25-30\/person or so that we ended up spending. They also told me - which ended up being true - that in the winter you tend to not go to the pools or anything, so chances of being in your room are more likely. We ended up lounging inside one of the days which was great.

Generally the hotel feels very clean and the air isn't very smokey. I'm pretty sensitive to that and none of my stuff came home smelling weird. Also their ""smallest"" room is a great size - it comes with the skunken living room which is perfect for 2+ people - and is very clean\/comfortable. We had 4 total and 3 could fit comfortably in the bed, while the large l-shaped couch could accommodate 2. I had requested and extra bed online, thinking I needed one, but didn't. (It never showed up anyways) so you could really fit 7ish people in here if you really wanted too. Bathroom is large but the shower is glass so unless you're that close with your friends, bathroom is one person at a time.

All other little things - parking, calling the front desk, etc - were pleasant. Bummer that our check out couldn't be extended (we had to leave at 11) but we ended up beating all the traffic back to LA so it ended up being a good thing.

When we got back to the room at 10:15 pm, the room was still a mess with the breakfast table in the middle of the room and the blood stained sheet on the floor.

Before I rave about its flawlessness, just one word of caution: the parking lot is pretty vast, and you can get lost.

Now, where to begin? The location, to start off, of the Palazzo is an ideal spot. Across, there is Treasure Island and its revered pirate show. Two minutes of walking will get you to Wynn, which has a nice buffet (see my review on it). The second floor is a long corridor of shops; most are at exorbitant prices... but definitely worth eye-shopping. You can also take a luxurious gondola ride.

The interior. Breathtaking! A lovely Italian design with impressive decor. Very fancy; apropos for its five-star rating. Although I did not personally play in the casino, it seems to be very intimate and more... classy, you know?

We checked in at 5:30PM; unfortunately, the room we reserved was all out. The registar happily upgraded us to a hospitality suite. Mind you, I was quite pissed after realizing it was on sixth floor (compared to the 50, the highest story). My grumpiness vanished when I saw the two-door entrance to my suite, compared to other one-door's. I went in with excitement; my anticipations were met! This room was at least 1 1\/2 times bigger than the ""normal rooms,"" well over the 720 square feet we were promised. Two bathrooms; one is like a hallway, with a personal TV across from the tub, and marbled shower. There was a separate living room and a master bedroom; plasma TV's on both. Amazing, amazing, amazing. And the furnitures were beautiful!
All this for $158 (with resort fee)? Hell yes!

Clean, luxurious, and ample. Love you, Palazzo! Will come back again!",0,0,0

I'm not sure what happened in the last year but the room servicing at the Palazzo has gone down considerably. I go to Vegas at least 4-5 times a year and in the last year I've stayed at the Palazzo.

From our first visit in early 2008 to our last visit last month, the rooms are never as clean as they use to be. I assumed it was the economy so they've cut down on the luxury bath soups (by Agraria) and sometimes the room is not as clean as it should be. At first I thought it was a one-time deal but my last four stays were similar in nature.

Since the rooms are comped, I shouldn't really care but I'm going to opt to stay at the Venezia Tower instead. It looks identical to the Palazzo except for the luxury soups (Agraria Bitter Orange).",1,0,0

You can't do a girls trip without a fabulous view and the Palazzo offered a great complimentary view (no upgrade charges). Every morning we woke up to the Wynn hotel, two pools, wynn golf resort, and awesome mountain views. We chose the bella suite which offered two comfortable queen beds and a plush L shaped couch in a sunken swanky living room. On day 2 we discovered the curtains were automatic as well as the shades, the child in me found this very cool by the way. 
The housekeeping service was five star all of the way! Our room was cleaned to perfection everyday with turn down service.
Be sure to check out the canal shoppes, it offers a variety of high end stores with great restaurants. I found the Palazzo offered a calm scene, a little more rowdy on the weekend, with an amazing waterfall.
The casino was very busy on the weekend, but slower during the day. The crowd is  a mix of cultures who don designer gear, no matter what age.

The steakhouse was some of the most amazing food my party had ever ate!!!!!! The customer service in this hotel was fabulous too. Everyone was extremely professional and kind. However, our experience with the hotel in general was awful. We checked in early and paid extra for an early check in along with a view of the strip. We got to our room and it was dirty. None of the tables were wiped down, it clearly wasn't vaccumed, water spots in the bathroom, but most importantly the wall next to my bed was covered in either blood, or puke, or a mix of both. I didn't even want to sleep in that bed it made me so sick. Our bags were told they'd take 15 minutes in which we waited almost 2 hours for. When we got our bags we had bought a $20 cooler before check in, that was completely broken. Our case of beer was opened and all the cans had dents, so obviously everything must have fallen over. They brought us a bucket to compensate that was actually pretty filthy. The hotel manager was very kind, and they did a few things for us which we appreciated very much. The staff was honestly great. However, last trip we took to Vegas we stayed at Excalibur for $40 a night, and it was 5 stars in my eyes. Everything was clean, and we had no issues with anything. This was a special trip for us in which we wanted to stay at a ""fancy"" and more expensive hotel. If we could do it over again, we would have chosen something else. This may not always be the case, because we've heard great things about the Palazzo, but in my opinion, save your money, it was NOT worth it. To pay that kind of money, you expect perfection. Of course everyone makes mistakes, but there is no excuse to a blood covered wall when you walk into your room. Stay at a less popular hotel! Use the extra money to enjoy the strip!!!!!!!!!",2,0,0

I asked my property be retrieved and I would pay for it to be shipped back and I was told by the front desk gal that she would send someone to retrieve my belongings, this of course never happened and now my stuff is gone bye bye.

A grandeur entranceway so mesmerizing with marble pillars, sky high ceilings and just oh so fancy details and design I had to do double takes just to take it all in. I couldn't stop saying WOW! 

I initially booked a room at the Venetian (they are joined together through the Grand Canal Shoppes) for a weekend getaway. My friends booked at the Palazzo so when I mentioned if I could transfer to the Palazzo to be closer to them with the same room rate, it was no problem, no hassle, very accommodating request. The registration personnel was professional but not snooty, really friendly & made me feel like a VIP.  The bell desk brought up my suitcase just a few minutes after check in so no waiting till forever to receive my belongings. 

My 2 queen beds with spacious loft area  was just so beautiful and the fancy marble bathroom with its double door entrance looked like you were walking in to view a masterpiece. A separate vanity mirror and chaise just for me was very pampering and added a nice touch to the powder room. The shower had 3 water massagers, 1 on top and 2 on the upper sides by the Hot & Cold knobs I felt like I was getting a Vichy shower at the spa.  Very relaxing on the back & shoulders and took off the edge from a 4 hour road trip into Nevada. The overall room was big, spacious and very pretty. 

I signed up for their Grazie card for member promo offerings and to build up points for possible comps.

I am definitely coming back here. Bookings.com provided great room rates and it is obvious their connection to the Palazzo is solid.

No, my husband and I will not stay here again, nor will we recommend it to any of our family and friends.

We checked in on Friday at around 6:00pm. We were given the room on 10th floor. The first room that we walked into had towel in the sink, towel in the bathtub, and the water tank for the toilet was open (I was toooooo furious that I forgot to take pictures). We called the front desk for another room and they gave us another room on the same floor. In the other room we had a dirty mop on the counter, trash in the shower, mirror wasn't cleaned, dripping sink, and blue tape holding the wall paper together........ We called the front desk again for a ""clean"" room preferably on the different floor, and they can only give us the handicap room and we don't want that. So the front desk tells us that they will send the housekeeping manager over to the new room to go through all the cleaning procedures with us and make sure it's all clean. After 30 mins of waiting, no one came. We called the front desk again for updates, and the response was ""due to miscommunication, the housekeeping manager thought problems were resolved."" So we waited another 10 mins for the housekeeping manager to come. She came, cleaned and pick up the things then left. 

By the time she left, it was 8:30 close to 9:00, so we decide to stay in and order room service. Guess what!? There's NO MENU!! Long story short, by the time we could eat, it was 10:30........

The sleep was not easy either....... The AC has ratting sound, u can hear people opening and closing door..... and u can hear the party that's happening at the group level.

The clientele at the Palazzo is much younger and I don't like being around loud, rowdy people.  Also, I do have to say that the Grand Lux Cafe is better at The Venetian.  So what we normally do is, stay at The Venetian but walk over to The Palazzo to gamble.

Either way, these 2 hotels are very nice.  The rooms are awesome!  The reason I give them 4 stars is because of the comps.  They make it so hard to earn comps nowadays.  Geez!  How much do I have to lose, I mean gamble.  Haha!  If you have the $$$, stay here.  You'll enjoy it.",11,7,9

For these suites being BASIC, does not COMPARE to any other hotel on the strip. You would need to upgrade your basic room at any other hotel just to achieve this.

For drunken shopping, Barney's is a one stop shop. But I'm not talking about Barney's. Cut is at the P; Cut is the BOMB. Less touristy than most, this is my second home. I am Club Grazie member, therefore many comped nights. Love the stores, because apparently they are not within a tourists' budget :)

Please, do stay here! You will love this hotel. All rooms are suites, either a one king bed or 2 queen bed, along with a large sofa that pulls out into a queen bed in the lower quarters (3 steps down). Bathrooms have tv's and obviously there is a phone in the toilet area.... just in case you are craving pizza while letting go of another pizza (lol). Marble floors in the bath and in the shower, and a tub that fits 1.5 people (grown people, hah). What I also like about the P and the V is that you need a card to enter the elevator areas, as there is a guard there who will check your room key. Yes... you will see all the non-guests waiting by this area (saaawrryyyy). A basic room at the P is a little bigger than the V, partially because there is a large area in the P that allows you to place your luggage or to even just sit down (cold marble) whereas in the V, it is replaced by a railing instead.

 Room service was ridiculously expensive! Over 100.00 for 2 entrees. No drinks or appetizers.  I am well aware it is Vegas and everything is costly but it was just like we were being charged for everything. Shouldn't something be complimentary?? I'm staying at the Palazzo!

They seriously treat you like a queen there!! Hotel lobby smells.... AMAZING!! It could be a little strong at the times but not too strong to make you feel dizzy! And it kills the smell of the smoke! 
CASINO:
We're not much of gamblers but we did play slots a little bit. To be honest, we only played at the Venetian Casino (which is on the same property) because i found the Palazzo casino a little bit too small. Servers took a while to serve at times but they're all were friendly and nice.
SUITE:
Ok, we did NOT expect our standard room to be a Luxury Suite! It was... unbelievable!!! I am pretty sure we underpaid for it! haha! I mean it was HUGE! And we got this amazing view of the Wynn Golf Course and the desert mountains. We've been to the roof top suites at the Venetian and they weren't too different from ours (except they had the view of the strip which they paid WAY more than we did and it wasn't even that appealing) 
POOL:
We checked out Azure at Palazzo which is their exclusive adult pool and it was BEAUTIFUL! But... kind of empty (we went there on Thursday maybe that's why) and boring. So we hung out there for a bit and went back to Tao Beach (at Venetian)  which is a bit more hyper for our taste. But, once again, Azure is such a work of art! It is perfect for couples and for people who just want to relax, sip on drinks and tan. 
CLUB: 
I cannot say anything about Lavo because we didn't have a chance to check it out. We were in Vegas for 4 nights so we wanted to hit the hot sports. I know that Lavo is owned by the same guys as Tao, so it should be pretty good. It looked alive every time we passed it.

Do not get me wrong, this is a BEAUTIFUL hotel.  The entry with the fountains and the super high ceilings reminded us a little of the Atlantis resort in the Bahamas.  

The service is impeccable.  The second you step out of your cab, you are greeted by a friendly bellman that whisks your bags away to have them sent up to your room.  When you reach the bank of check-in desks, there are two people there waiting to escort you to the next available attendant.  Superb service.

High speed elevators shoot you up to your floor.  We were on the 39th floor and it couldn't have taken more than 20 seconds to get to the floor from the casino level.  

We had some difficulty getting our Jersey Boys emblazoned room key to work, but after about five tries, we figured out how to get it to read the card properly.   The room layout is identical to the Venetian, but with more updated decor and LG HD flat screen televisions in the bathroom, bedroom and living area.   I LOVED the automatic shades on the windows.  Plush robes and towels, decent bath amenities, including bath salts for the tub.  

The reason for the star downgrade.  For a hotel that has been open merely a few months, I did not expect to find bolts in the wall instead of a toilet paper holder, smudges on the white cotton bathroom mat, scuffs on the walls, stains on the sofa and MULTIPLE broken drawer handles on the various pieces of furniture.... that did not scream five star hotel to me in the least.

I thought Palazzo might overtake Venetian as my favorite hotel in Vegas, but it didn't quite do that.  The two hotels are connected and it's very easy to get to and from each hotel, which is a huge plus.

The common areas of the Palazzo are extremely elegant and airy.  Even when there are a lot of people in the casino, we didn't feel overly cramped.  The shopping area was a ghost town while we were there....

The pool area feels small, but is actually segregated into about 3 or 4 different pool areas.  Each bungalow is appointed with rattan sofas and flat screen televisions.  There is a walkway that connects to the Venetian pools and Tao Beach.  In the morning, the only pool area in the Palazzo that gets sunlight is closer to the Venetian and right now, you're staring right at building construction and hearing it, too....Not very pleasant.

They're still doing quite a bit of construction, it doesn't seem like the Canyon Ranch Spa is 100% completed and not all of the stores are open yet....hopefully on a future visit, they'll be more established and I'll have an even more enjoyable experience.",1,0,1

I booked the Palazzo this weekend (6\/18-6\/20) for a bachelorette party and I was pretty excited to stay somewhere ""new"" (kinda, since Venetian and Palazzo are pretty much the same). Anyhow, I figured that since I'd never had a bad experience at Venetian, it would be the same for Palazzo. Surprise, surprise, I was wrong!

- I arrived around 12:00pm to see if we could check in early. They said they didn't have any clean suites available, and that they would call me when the room was ready. Ok, fine, no big deal-- I grabbed some lunch with my friends and we went to the mall to kill time. I called at 2:30pm to see if by chance the room was ready. They told me no, and that it would be ready at 3:00pm. 3:30 rolls around and still no call. 4:00 rolls around, STILL no call. At this point I am irritated since check-in is technically at 3:00, so I get in line to ask about what's going on. Two other people behind me are in line for the same issue. Finally, I got to the front of the line and they apologize for being so busy, blah blah. However they were friendly and upgraded our room to a suite w\/ a strip view on the 19th floor. 

- When we got the room, however, the housekeeping staff hadn't done a very good job cleaning the room. There were still stains on the counters AND they left a pair of the previous guests' dirty flip flops ON THE DRESSER! WTF?!

- Since we couldn't check in early, we left our bags with the bell hop staff. I called the concierge desk to have our bags taken up to our room--they quoted 15 minutes. Awesome, that would give us time to freshen up before dinner. NOT! It took them a good 45 minutes at the very least to get the bags to us and it ruined our timing for dinner. Ughhh, so irritated!!

I later discovered that there were some events going on (Miss USA, daytime Emmy Awards, poker tournament, yadda yadda), but still that's no excuse for the service. I was very surprised.

First of all, valet service was great. Greeted us promptly, asked us how we were doing today, and made sure that we did not take down a single suitcase from our car. 

The check-in lady was amazing and extremely nice and informative. We had not made previous reservations because we had just checked out from in a horrible, free hotel room we received from a friend. She made our check in extremely quick.

At the front of the elevators, are security guards who check to make sure we have our room keys. I love that!

When we arrived at our suite, we were in awe because we thought we would receive a small suite. It was huge for its price and gorgeous. The beautiful marble floors and the decor just made the price worthwhile. 

I am critical and extremely anal when it comes to bathrooms. This is one of the best rooms I have received when it comes to pricing. Beautiful walls, little TV in the upper corner of the mirror, nice bathtub, and beautiful shower. I love that there is a little vanity and stool to do your makeup. 

The bed was beautiful and comfy, but the sofa was even comfier. Loved that everything was spacious and there was a sunken living room.

Also, when I had checked in, I did NOT ask for a view but I received one and it was spectacular. I received a view of the city, an entire golf course, and Wynn and Encore. When I laid in my bed at night, the city was sparkling and it was just the most incredible view. I would definitely pay more than $189 for that view. It was just breathtaking and the absolute highlight of the room.

The bellhop was great and delivered our luggage and placed them in our room. Extremely nice and friendly and striked a conversation. 

I also loved that when we asked for extra blankets and towels, they contained in a plastic bag with a zipper, unlike many other hotels such as Wynn!

This is an extremely clean hotel, with AMAZING service and AMAZING rooms and AMAZING restaurants. I love this hotel and is by far on the top of my go-to hotels in Vegas.

in any case, was here for the Epicurean Event held on 5\/26 by the pools.  Second time to this event and again it did not disappoint.  I think it was one of the better organized food events that I have been to in vegas.  The layout left plenty of spacing between restaurants, and offered a nice, relaxing tour of the offerings.

Plenty of alcohol provided....well, never enough alcohol, but nice selection for a food event.  I must apologize in advance for the lack of detail on this event, but c'mon, every once in awhile it's nice to enjoy an event or restaurant without worrying about detailing the experience on Yelp right?

I can just say that this event was timed perfectly weather wise, and they had great music to accompany the event.  One of the standouts I can recall was from RM Seafood\/RX Broiler, one of our favorite dining establishments.  We got to meet Rick Moonen, very personable, friendly, great sense of humor.  Buffalo fish tacos, good, given the setting they had to prepare them in.

Another was the porcinni ravioli which I really enjoyed, and the caprese salad my dining companion raved about.  I believe these were from a Mario Batali kitchen.

There were prime rib sliders from Morels (I think), that were tasty, although a bit skimpy on the prime rib, they were good.

I was a little disappointed in some of the wines offered.  There was a good variety of stations offering wines, but none really stood out.  I cleary remember an offering from Argentina that really had a great aroma, but tasted pretty bad.  There were some nice bourbon and whiskeys offered, as well as Titos, YES!

A few misses were a pasta offered by Tao (pasta?), and pulled pork sliders from a BBQ joint that was ""soon to come"".

BOTTOM LINE IS... THE PALAZZO IS A GREAT PLACE TO STAY
Especially if you are trying to fit 6-8 in a room, the Bella suite is perfect. And if you have a party of more than 12 people, get a connecting Bella suite! The beds are comfy and there's a pullout on the couch. But that doesn't stop you from sitting on the couch. There is still space for you to sit and chill infront of the tv. There are 2 tvs in the room, as well as a printer. The bathroom is spacious with a separate shower and bath. There's even a vanity for all you ladies getting ready. The only downside to the bathroom is that there is NO LOCK. Maid service is speedy. Palazzo is a great location if you like to party at XS, Surrender, or Tryst.

Everytime I've gotten to my room at these others I'm a little let down and have buyers remorse that I should have just stayed a the Palazzo again.  I'm thinking that will be our next stay on our next visit.

The basic suites are big -- probably bigger than my first apartment! I had a great view of the strip and the remote controlled blinds and curtains are a nice touch. Big, comfy beds on the first level, and the second level was a spacious area with a sectional, desk and kitchen table. It was nice to have a gorgeous view and a spacious workspace while I worked on my laptop. Equally huge bathroom with a large glass enclosed shower stall. The TV above the sink was handy while getting ready in the morning.

The front desk was well staffed and I didn't have to wait more than a minute to check-in unlike most hotels on the strip. The staff was friendly and professional.

Some of the best restaurants in Vegas are at the Palazzo\/Venetian, but they aren't cheap. There are some cheaper options like the Grand Lux cafe, which was OK for breakfast and lunch, but nothing special. You get what you pay for. 

Speaking of what you pay, the Palazzo charges a mandatory resort fee of $15\/day that is not included in the base rate. So make sure you factor that in when booking your room.",2,1,1

My gf's and I came to Vegas to celebrate my bday.  My first impression was that the room was quite comfortable and lovely.  However, I found security to be too aggressive to women, especially women guests at this hotel.

We had an agenda to go out over the weekend and to see all the big dj's from the pool to the nightlife and we had a fabulous time.  However, this was soured when security is aggressively chasing you to the elevator asking you to flash your key again because they didn't see yours as you showed it walking by.  And it was further soured one night after going dancing at a night club when my gf sat down to a slot machine alone to gamble.  She had 6 huge security aggressively surround her, talk shit to her, demand her key, grill her like a fucking criminal and then humiliate her when she did nothing wrong.  When they realized her name was on the room and she was a guest, they backed off with no apology.  It was humiliating and rude to treat a female guest like that, one whom you should've seen around the hotel all weekend. 

All in all, the security here needs a serious lesson in customer service. As a result, I won't be spending my money here again.",14,5,2

The suites are nice: I really like the sunken living room area by the windows. it is essentially one big room, but having those few steps makes the room feel like more than it really is. Great design element.

I was overcharged for my room when I checked in. When I brought that to their attention, their recourse was to charge me even more in hopes it would cancel out. Took two days, leaving me with no credit on my credit card. Customer service lacking, but perhaps I just have high standards.

Normally we stay at the Four Seasons since we travel with little ones and it's a non-gaming smoke free hotel but we wanted to try something more central on the strip. Also, the rooms here are ALL suites so they are very spacious and included a living room with pull out bed which was comfortable to sleep on and a cute little dining table and two chairs. There was also a desk and a large bathroom with a vanity. The room itself alone gets 5 stars! Very clean and comfortable!

A few downfalls include very slow wifi, decent gym BUT no windows it felt like a dungeon. I took my workouts outside instead and speed walked the strip! I highly suggest that instead. A couple times I did call housekeeping to request turn down service and our sofa bed to made by 7pm since we have little ones who sleep early. Some nights it was done some we had to do it ourselves. Room service was great the food always came hot and when we requested pick up after we were done eating they came at a reasonable time. I would say all staff from front desk to housekeeping were all great. We did use the pool and although they said it was heated it was more lukewarm and the hot tub wasn't hot either. It was rather chilly during our visit and would have enjoyed the pool longer if it was warmer. NOTE: they do have shorter pool hours during the winter months and only a few open and no drink or food service.

All in all I would definitely stay here again for the fabulous rooms! However, it is VERY smoky in the casino and didn't think it was that big of deal walking in and out with my kids BUT after a couple days I started feeling bad they had to second hand smoke because we did walk thru the casino like 3-4x per day. Our clothes smelled too. 

You can't beat the convenience of this hotel. It's a short walk to all the big hotels...Ceasars, Bellagio, Wynn, Mirage, Treasure Island etc. Also they have a walkway bridge to a huge shopping center just adjacent to the hotel. It's also connected to the Venetian so they share the same shops and restaurants. I highly recommend Yardbird for their fried chicken! They do have some free shows in the shopping area so that was nice for the kids. I also noticed the heightened security. They now check for room keys when going to the elevators up to your room.

When we arrived and got to the room it was beautiful but there was no coffee maker, no refrigerator (only the mini fridge so you had to buy everything), no complimentary waters and if you wanted music in the living area there was a $9.99 for 2 hour charge for that!

The room is what disappointed me.  It was more like a long room than a suite.  Also, the room was less than clean.  There were crumbs left on the floor  when I checked in. These remained throughout my stay.

I stayed here apparently not too long after it took effect for Venetian\/Palazzo.   A lot of people hate it, but I think it is a pretty good deal.   Normally, these places charge you about $20\/day for Internet access (wi-fi or wired) that many people don't really need on vacation (now that we are in the smart phone era, 3G phone internet can be used to look stuff up quickly and conveniently) and $20\/day for access to a mediocre gym (hotel gyms are pretty much always weak, especially if you're a serious fitness person).   However, if given the option to pay for the not-really-need Internet and the mediocre gym all for $20 for 24 hours, yeah, I will say that yeah that's probably a fair price that I will pay.   (These resort fees are not comped if your room is comped normally, as is normally the case with any extras.)  One other nice touch is the fact that the resort fee includes a complimentary newspaper from any of the gift shops on the property -  you can choose from local newspapers (LA Times, Vegas papers  or national papers such as USA Today or Wall Street Journal -  I picked up a copy of the WSJ one day, since that is the one that is not freely available on-line)

As for the resort itself, the rooms are nice and up-to-date, since the resort is pretty new, with remote-controlled window coverings and prompt thorough housekeeping.   The overall architecture and interior style of the rooms and overall casino\/resort is very similar to the connected sister property Venetian, but with noticeable improvements such as the aforementioned remote controlled window coverings and a better casino floor layout which has more space between the games and doesn't feel as cramped and disorganized as the Venetian's casino floor.  

Another good thing about this place is the Walgreen's (24 hours of course) attached to the building at the ground level accessible from The Strip sidewalk at the south corner of the property going towards the Venetian (not accessible from the resort itself) -  a 1000X better alternative to the hotel gift shops.",2,0,1

""NO NO. CALM DOWN!""

This happened at 3 AM during my stay at Palazzo on July 7, 2012 on floor 36 and room 730. A drunken couple was fighting, death threats were flying, and what should be the most basic of functions for a hotel room -- SLEEP -- was denied for my entire family. 

Was this Palazzo's fault? No. Did their customer service fail to handle a situation that made me and my family feel unsafe in an expensive suite? Yes.

We had an AWFUL experience at the Palazzo and with their customer service. We stayed at the hotel on July 6, 2012 on the 36th floor in room 730. At 3AM, a drunken brawl essentially occurred outside our door. My mother and grandmother were afraid for their safety.

Here's where this went even more wrong:  I reported it to the front desk and they made a note about it and hung on me. Come next morning as we're checking out, I pointed this situation out to them and was promptly brushed off. How can we justify spending hundreds of dollars for a hotel room when we couldn't even get any sleep? To add insult to injury, they treated us as if were trying to extort them. Yes, a multi-billion dollar hotel and casino and they couldn't resolve the issue of one freaking scary and awful night.

I spoke to a supervisor and was informed it wasn't their problem and that they 'can't be responsible for what other guests do'. Are you freaking kidding me? There were death threats flying ... how is it not your problem? For an 'elite' hotel, the customer service at Palazzo is atrocious and I've had much better stays at the Wynn and Bellagio where they actually take care of the guests.

If I wanted to hear drunk people brawl and fear for my safety, I'd have rented a hotel room in the ghetto.

Bottom line: Save your money. The inside is nice, but most of the other Strip hotels are just as nice, WITH the impeccable customer care and service. Go elsewhere.",11,3,1

My husband and I planned a trip to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. We married at The Venetian so naturally we wanted to stay there or Palazzo. 

I usually get a pretty good hotel rate as a gold member. But because there was some big convention at the hotel during our dates, they didn't offer me any kind of discount. Ok, fine. So I emailed guest services and asked for a suite upgrade and explained our reason for our visit. I even said I don't care about the view. I have done this in the past. Usually just for small requests such as a high floor or to put a humidifier in the room. They have my history and know I don't ask for a lot. I just wanted something special for our anniversary. I was told it wasn't possible. And they didn't even offer anything else as an alternative such as a free upgrade to Prestige or hotel credit. There are tons of things they could have done if they really wanted to. 

And this is in the middle of their website hacking incident so I'm getting a little nervous about the fact that it took them a week to get only a basic shell of their website back up. And I'm getting more and more irritated by the lacking customer service.

So I'm paying full price for the basic suite and as a gold Grazie member who has been a loyal customer for 10 years and they can't be bothered to give me the time of day.

I searched around online and for the same price that I was being charged at Palazzo, I found a much bigger and nicer suite at Bellagio. I wrote their guest relations department and explained the purpose of my visit and admitted that I was a longtime Palazzo\/Venetian customer. They responded to all of my requests quickly, within hours. They put us in a beautiful suite. It was 1,000 sq feet and had 2 full baths in the bedroom plus the living room had a powder room. I couldn't believe it was the same price for what I had booked at Palazzo.

Our stay at the Bellagio was amazing. It made me see how the service has really slipped at Palazzo\/Venetian. The room service breakfast arrived when they said it would. Food was hot and really, really good (try the pancakes). The housekeepers came by twice a day yet it seemed like we never saw them and their carts in the hallways. The suite was immaculate!! You didn't see dirty plates sitting in the hallway. When we requested new pillows, they were delivered immediately. The light went out in the makeup mirror in my bathroom and it was replaced right away. These are things that are sadly missing at Palazzo\/Venetian.

I'm sad to say that I don't understand how they keep their 5 star rating. And I never thought I would consider staying anywhere else. But I seriously doubt I will be staying there again. They really need to get back to the way they used to be. Thanks to their lousy customer service and insanely high prices, I found a new place to stay in Vegas that truly is a 5 star hotel.",8,5,0

Check in was fast & a breeze front desk staff was very polite and helpful. We received a free room upgrade for our anniversary (view facing the strip on a higher floor). Our room was huge with a nice sunken living room at least 650-700 sq feet in total. 2 tv's amazing view of the strip facing Treasure Island. Clean, modern and clearly well taken care of by housekeeping. Pool was clean, and so many to choose from that run from the Palazzo to the Venetian. Lots of chairs and great places to sit, kept clean and always someone available for assistance. We didn't get a private cabana - too expensive and we enjoyed lounging by the pool.

We tried a few different restaurants:

Grand Lux Cafe - Our regular spot. Big menu with a vast variety of items with big portions and great pricing! Some stand out items were, breakfast menu, burgers, salads (asian chicken salad was my fav!),  dessert - red velvet cake - the best I have ever tried! And fresh made\/baked to order beignets!

Morels Steakhouse - we had our anniversary dinner here. We sat on the patio overlooking the Vegas strip. Service was outstanding! We ordered fondue for 2 to start & our mains were prime bone in rib eye for 2. Everything was impeccable and perfectly cooked. Probably one of the best meals i've ever had. Pricey? Yes, but worth it for our anniversary. You can't go to Vegas without splurging on at least 1 great meal. 

Poolside - Solaro by Wolfgang Puck - Great service! We ordered the Black Angus burgers - so delicious! It's so hard to find a good burger in Toronto that is made right. Solaro does it all! Juicy, fresh, not dry, seasoned well, right amount of toppings so you can still taste the meat and making you want more!

Food Court - a dozen or more places to grab a quick bite to eat with everything from Johnny Rockets to Panda Express. We tried both and had great meals.

Hotel Concierge was very helpful in searching for show tickets that we were interested in purchasing as well as providing info on where to shop (outlets etc.).",0,0,1

The suite was really nice and large. There were three different TV's as well. One that was located in front of the bed, one in the lower living room area, and one that was in the bathroom as well. The room came with one King sized bed, a couch (with a pull out bed), a desk, and a table. Overall, there was plenty of room with four people staying in the room. 

The bathroom was really nice and there is an area where you can sit and get ready, and there also twin sinks. Inside the bathroom there is also a shower and a bathtub. Inside the bathroom there is another door which leads to the toilet, so it's separated from everything. One thing about the bathroom though is that there are no locks. There are no locks on the door to toilet bathroom door, as well as the door that opens up to the bathroom. One of the bad things about the bathroom is that there is no separate from the shower\/bathtub and the sinks. So if someone is showering you can't go in and use the sinks or the toilet.
The overall ambiance of the casino and hotel was very nice though. The room and casino were clean and bright. There are beautiful butterfly and flower arrangements when you enter the hotel. The hotel also consists of very large ceilings which adds to the appeal. The hotels is also very conveniently located in the strip. There is a Walgreens right outside the Palazzo, and there is a shopping area right across the street with an ample amount of stores. Many other hotels are also within walking distance for those who watch to explore the strip.

While at our stay we stopped by the pool. The Palazzo consists of three different pools, and you also have access to the swimming pools at the Venetian. While at the pool you have a view of the hotel building, and the Wynn hotel. There is also a swimming pool that is more kid friendly, which is a little more noisy, and a adult pool which is more calm and quiet.

There were many personal aspects of the hotel that turned me off. 

The first being an incident that my friend had with the bell hop where the taxis drop passengers off. My friends and I were simply just trying to figure out how to get to the sidewalk, so we could walk on the strip. We then proceeded to ask the bell hop worker. His very first reply to my friend was asking where she was from. My friend kept responding to him. It turns out what the bell hop was really inquiring about was the ethnicity of my friend. Then comes the worst part which was both creepy and racist in my opinion. He flat out told us he was really attracted to people of my friend's ethnicity, and that he is particularly looking for someone of that ethnicity and wanted to bring someone over here so that he could marry them. While all of this is happening, I'm thinking, ""shouldn't this guy just simply do his job, and tell us how to get to the sidewalk?"" At this point my friends and I were all really uncomfortable.The bell hop then had the nerves to say, ""you all must think that I'm creepy now"". Finally he decides to tell us how to get to the sidewalk. This was a really appalling incident. This worker should have a better behavior and conduct when approaching customers of the hotel. To make matters worse when we returned to the hotel via taxi, we saw the man again. This time we weren't going to waste our time on him, so we instantly went into the hotel when we got out. However, as we were leaving the bell hop had to make a comment. He said, ""aren't you ladies the one that I saw earlier, why do you all look so sober, and where is your friend that I saw earlier"". It's one thing to make his comment the first time, but SERIOUSLY to do it TWICE! It's just completely unnecessary.

The second incident happened with a cocktail waitress while I was gambling in the casino of the Palazzo. I was playing on the slot machine with my friend when the cocktail waitress asked for our drinks. As she was walking away I told my friend that I would put a dollar in the machine that I was playing with to see how things went. At this point my friend and I have already been playing a fair amount of money of the machines. The cocktail waitress came back with a really rude attitude and and said that if I was only playing a dollar then I wouldn't be able to get my drink, because it's a 25 dollar minimum. I understand that she had to make sure because it's her job, but she could have been a little nicer about it.

The third thing is that it took about 12 hour total until we got the extra towels that we called in for. We called about 4-5 times for extra towels, but we didn't get them till about 2:30 a.m. after waiting 45 minutes for them to come. 

Overall, the Palazzo is a nice hotel in terms of the amenities, ambiance, cleanliness, and quality of their rooms. However, there are certain aspects of my stay that I didn't enjoy at all. I would come back to stay, but I am also curious to explore other hotels in Vegas.",1,3,0

The Palazzo never called to check to see how she was, refused to pay ANY of her hospital bills and their Risk management person Leigh Ann was beyond rude and curt.

The suite was great and exactly what you'd want in Vegas.  Comfortable bed, big tv, huge bathroom.  And since their rooms are all suites (I think?) there's an additional living room with sofa, table, tv, etc. 

My only complaint, which is so silly, is that I felt like things were dirty. The room itself did look clean, but I'm really easily skeeved out by hotel rooms. I don't know who decided that a black velour sectional in a Vegas hotel room was a good idea. I think from the first day they probably looked old, saggy, and dirty.

Great places to eat, but no buffet but that's ok. Awesome shopping. My wife loves the Coach purse she got from the Coach outlet store. The Valet always goes out of his way to make sure we get our luggage quickly. I love the bathrooms, the bathtub is huge, the shower could use some frosted glass though. I love the free shampoos and soaps, they smell so good. I wish I could find the same scent in a store but no luck. The casino has a great selection of games for your every desire. want to play a particular game, they have it.

The first time that I came to Vegas I stayed at Mandalay Bay when it just opened.  I believe that The Palazzo was one of the newer hotels when we visited this time as well.  

The rooms are amazing.  We stayed in a suite and it was absolutely gorgeous.  We had a great view.  The room had 2 Queen sized beds and also had a separate area with a TV and couch.  The decor was very elegant and you really felt like you were living in style.  Great bathroom area as well!  There was a small TV above the sink area and also a separate little room where the toilet was.  Amazing shower as well with bathrobes included. 

One of the other things that I liked about this hotel is that it's connected to the Venetian.  The Venetian is a stunning hotel as well and I felt that we had the best of both worlds.  You are able to go between both hotels and explore all you want.     

The Palazzo has a variety of shops and restaurants to try as well.  One in particular that stood out to me was Woo (see my earlier reviews), the upscale Chinese restaurant.  Delicious!

Caused a surge which knocked out the water for HOURS! 2. Kept their systems down for a day - which means my $150 resort credit couldn't be used.
OK, so stuff happens - I get it - but I really expected some compensation - some real compensation.

We arrived around 1ish and we were able to check in without an early check in fee. I attempted to try the ""sandwich trick"" with $40, but he was ""unable to provide a complimentary upgrade"" and so he returned my money. The front desk clerk provided us with a complimentary upgraded view of the strip (Treasure Island, Wynn\/Encore, and pools below) on a higher floor, which I definitely appreciated. He also threw in a free late (2 PM) check out. 

The room was absolutely stunning. Prior to making reservation I had been on the fence about whether to book at the Venetian or the Palazzo; what I had gathered from online was the rooms at the Palazzo where actually newer and a bit nicer and so I decided to book the Palazzo. That weekend I had a friend who was actually booked at the Venetian and so I was able to check out her hotel room as well. After seeing her hotel room at the Venetian, I was SO happy with mine..especially after hearing how loud the halls where on the weekend.

There are a couple of cons to staying at the Palazzo, the casino immediately below the Palazzo is extremely small with the casino at the Venetian being much better and livelier. If you don't mind the walk then I would book at the Palazzo, but if you want to be in the center of the action and don't want to bother with a ten minute walk then I would book at the Venetian.

One thing I noticed is that we had a room for four girls, which we paid the extra fee per person when you have more than 2 people in a hotel room when making the reservation, and they still didn't put enough towels or glasses in the room. Room service took about an hour-ish to get these items to us, which I thought was quite a bit of time since I had called in the middle of the day.

Definitely take a walk around both the Palazzo & the Venetian...both hotels are so amazing and made to look like you are in Italy. The ceilings are absolutely stunning. Also, I love the shopping area because there is an indoor area where people can ride gondolas and the people steering the gondolas sing in opera style...it's stunning.

Luckily there was a conference rate, I wouldn't have been able to squeeze the corporate-approved travel budget to fit their usual rate.  Rooms are, as noted across the board, huge.  It's a new place, so it's pretty nice.  There's a TV in the bed area, a TV in the sunken living room (10 feet to the side of the bed area), and a TV in the bathroom.  You will never lack for a TV in these rooms.  The entire hotel is ginormous, but that can have its benefits, especially being attached to the Venetian, in terms of number of shopping and dining options available -- A LOT.  Vegas, in this sense, has furthered itself in becoming the new Texas -- it's hot, sunny, dusty, everything's bigger, and for some reason crazy Uncle Larry really wanted to move there when he retired.  

The bathroom has a separate shower and tub, and the shower has those jets that squirt you in places that you don't normally get squired in.  

There's a super handy Walgreen's practically in the hotel for slightly more reasonably priced water and snacks.

Hotel + Casio = Good Times! 

Check-in is quite funny as if I were at a Sotherby's auction (You'll understand when you check-in). The rooms are spacious and luxurious. Bed linens kinda rough for a hotel of this class. Sunken living room is a nice touch to add to the already elegant suite. 

There is a great mix of people here, you never feel like you're in the middle of MTV's Spring Break (Wynn) or at the Geriatrics ward of the Bellagio (stayed there too). The service is a bit spotty. Bell hop lost my luggage for a bit, but was recovered 20 mins later. My room was never serviced although I had called 2x to have it cleaned. 

Palazzo pool is relaxing, although if you want a more sun bathing time and all the eye-candy you can soak, you walk over to the connecting Venetian pool. The Shoppes at the Palazzo\/Venetian are great with plenty of excellent restaurants to choose from. 

The Palazzo is butted up against the competing Wynn. Wynn rooms (friend was staying there) really can't compete here, they look like they were designed by a 5 year old girl. And let's not talk about the pool at the Wynn.... it was like swimming in a pool full of STDs...

Canyon Ranch Spa ( I think thats the name) Was great and relaxing. The massage could have been a little nicer but I think that was partly my fault of not speaking up.

We got the hotel this past weekend for a bachelor party.  Memorial Day being the busiest weekend of the year for Vegas, we had to pay a little bit more than we would have liked ($500 total for Friday and Saturday), but it was still cheaper than what their website was offering.  We used Priceline and saved some $.  If you want tips on how to get this hotel for cheap on Priceline, check out the Priceline bidding boards.  Or just contact me, I'll send you the link.  Anyway since we got the rooms thru Priceline, we had the basic suite.  However, we called ahead and upgraded to the Bella suites for $30\/night per room.  Free parking is a plus.

Room itself was nicely furnished.  I don't stay in 5 star hotels often, but I would have rated this closer to a 4 star.  Some of the small details were overlooked, and service from the front desk was way too slow.  At one point I was on hold for over 10 minutes so I just gave up.  C'mon no room delivery of the newspaper?  You have to go down to the Cafe Presse on the 2nd floor to get it.  Front desk told me the wrong store initially.

Front desk will give you 4 room keys with no questions asked, although only two work for the gym apparently.  All four will get you to the elevators and the pool though.  The security guards at those locations don't check very closely.

Sign up for the Grazie club online, and you will get $15 in free play.  Then refer your buddy, and you will get $50.  They also had some promotional offer where each guest also had $25 in bonus play, so we ended up getting quite a bit in free play using the Grazie signups.

Housekeeping did a good job of cleaning up after a bachelor party evening, so kudos to them.

Overall a lot of dining and entertainment options.  Tao was ridiculous on MD weekend, and the combination of an MMA fight in town made the douche bag factor sky high.  Too many yoked guys in Affliction tshirts, spray tans, True Religion jeans with aviator sunglasses and faux hawks for my liking.",3,3,1

- Stephen Covey

The Palazzo has a nice setting throughout the common areas, as well as some great food and drink options, so I decided to stay here with my love for a staycation. The rooms are spacious, mini suites and the one we booked was on a non-smoking floor. The huge problem for me was that in spite of the non-smoking floor we were on, the shared HVAC piped in dingy, smoke-laden air. This is a deal breaker for me. Even the casino floor is poorly ventilated for today's standard. I was born and raised here in Vegas and I remember back when all the casinos used standard ventilation throughout the casino floor. Thankfully the times have changed as you walk through many of the modern casinos in Vegas...alas, the Palazzo is not one of those properties. 

We still come visit the Pallazzo\/Venitian complex to eat. There really are a lot of great options, including favorites like Carnevino and Yardbird Southern Table & Bar...and the drinks at Delmonico Steakhouse are some of the best on The Strip. We really enjoyed the Lunar New Year decorations up in the atrium for the Year of the Rooster...as well as the large LOVE installation inviting you to snap pictures, but you won't find me coming back to stay here.",25,23,21

On this visit- things were going so well until I got to my room.  And it wasn't ready.  In fact- the maids had just started cleaning it when I arrived.  They asked me to go back to the lobby and wait- but I wasn't about to schlep my luggage and my travel weary body all the way back there so I decided to sit and wait.

I called the front desk and they did give me a $50 credit.  But I still sat for 40 minutes watching my room getting cleaned.

And still no coffee in my room.  That will kill a hotel for me every time.

I had never purchased travel arrangements through a travel website, but we were meeting friends, they ended up at the Palazzo so we started our hunt for the best rate on the best possible travel websites and made our deal.

We got in around 1 am from our flight, walked up to the guest check in with no wait.
We got right into our suite and WOW what a surprise!  We saw the pictures, we knew what to expect, we were still impressed.

The sunk in living room was really cool.  The view to Treasure Island allowed us to watch the show from our room.  That was fun.

We have zero complaints about the room whatsoever.
A couple comments, my husband being a smoker, we got a smoking room just so we didn't have to walk 1\/4 mile to go downstairs to the casino for a smoke.  They offered something to help diffuse the smoke in the room, they never did bring it to our room, but we really didn't need it.  The rule was smoking only in the living room.  We kept the air temp low and it was fine.
2nd item, the safe system in the rooms, in the entire hotel, one day went down.  We could not get into it.  They were quick and courteous to unlock and ensure it could be relocked and unlocked before leaving.  No other issues with that.

We spent good time in some of the restaurants in the Palazzo and between it and the Venetian.  Separate reviews on those...

The casino was very nice, never over-crowded, won some money and for the most part the dealers were friendly and pit bosses too.

Upon check out, we wanted to do the gondola ride.  Such a trap, but we just had to.  The price without any discounts or freebies was about $18.95 pp.  Pricey!
But as a guest, we had a coupon for buy 1, get 1 50% off.  But when we went to the front desk to get another copy of our room's coupons, it showed up but they could not get it to print.

As it was our last day and leaving for the airport shortly, we waited and waited....they made phone calls and tried to get it to work.  Since we already checked out, they said they would open the account back up, have them charge it to the room and come back for them to close it out and they would apply the discount then.  Fair enough.

So we go, get our 10 minute indoor gondola ride, kissed under every bridge, took pictures and videos and listened to our lovely gondola driver sing a tune or 2....enjoyed it very much!  And tipped our captain....

We went back to the front desk to apply the discount, close our account and jump into a cab to the airport.....they surprised us and removed the ENTIRE charges for the gondola ride.  Now, that was unnecessary and very customer-service oriented and it was much appreciated!

Everyone was very accommodating, we didn't need to leave the property (although as first time Vegas visitors, of course we had to leave every day and experience stuff)...we didn't need to if we didn't want to.  And maybe next time we won't!",2,0,0

I'm going to assume we were given one of the older rooms since they didn't give us a sunken living room. Looks much nicer on their site. Still.. wasn't bad.

The one big plus for Palazzo is the layout of the resort. Everything is where it should be. Want to go to the fitness center? It's underground (unlike Aria... where you walk through a common area to get to the spa) and there are two gyms - a small one at Palazzo and a bigger one at Venetian... also underground; they're connected). Valet drop-off is on the main level. Valet pick-up is downstairs. It's a short walk to Wynn, Palazzo stores like Barney's, and restaurant row\/Grand Canal at Venetian.

I am also grateful that this trip was the best Vegas trip for both of us, and I've been to Vegas at least a handful of times since turning 21. You're a sweetheart :*]
---

The No1DP was in Vegas to attend a conference in Sands Expo and the conference offered a block of rooms in the nearby Venetian and Palazzo for the same price. Knowing this I suggested to him to get a room in the Palazzo knowing that it would be the more ""contemporary"" version of the Venetian (it was built later) and had more square footage in the standard suite. 

CHECK-IN:  As No1DP would be in workshops when I arrived from SD he told front desk to allow me to check-in to his room under my name. I was able to request room keys under my name with no hassle.

ROOM: The main room is divided into two areas, the bedroom and the living area divided by a counter and two steps that lead into the living area. Room was luxurious and spacious, yet still keeping up with the Italianesque classical theme (if you want a more 'contemporary'-looking room stay at the neighboring Wynn\/Encore). This is definitely a room that you can lounge around all day.

Bed was quite comfortable, sometimes the No1DP and I found it hard to get out of bed! There's a TV across from the bed but there is no separate hookup for DVDs or a way to get signals from DVD box connected to the TV in the living room. 

Around the room there's lots of drawer, cabinet and counter space to put in your things. No1DP took this to his advantage and completely unpacked his luggage (I'm still the woman that leaves everything in the luggage so there's no looking for stuff 10 minutes prior to checkout)

Living\/work space is also ideal for lounging around. There's an L-shaped sofa with nearby counter and table space, perfect for eating meals around the couch. There's a TV with DVD player (doesn't play Blu-ray) along with a separate dining and working table. My only concern is that the stairs leading to the living space make it hard to transport room service food from the entrance to the living room area without having to pick up the individual items. 

BATHROOM\/SHOWER: Bathroom was also very spacious and luxurious. The shower can fit two average-sized people. Loved that there are shower sprays on the side and you can transfer between shower heads at will. There's a TV mounted to the wall if you want to watch while using the bath. The bathroom amenities smelled quite nice and left a little-more-than-subtle ginger scent on the skin, which smelled quite nice on the No1DP (TMI, sorry).

HOUSEKEEPING: They did a good job with the cleaning whenever we requested it (as we used the privacy cards for much of our stay). 

IN-HOUSE DINING: Japanese Breakfast ($28): Seared 7oz. Scottish salmon filet, steamed rice, miso soup, poached egg, pickled vegetables, nori, and green tea. You can replace green tea with coffee with cream\/sugar. Though slightly pricey for an equivalent dish in other restaurants, it's a small price to pay for not getting out of your room. Salmon and pickled vegetables were decent, steamed rice was a little dry (No1DP and I are used to eating stickier rice for salmon) and miso was made fresh. 

Overall the No1DP and I enjoyed our stay and this will be an option if I want a luxurious yet classical place to stay and I foresee myself being at the hotel for much of my stay.",4,1,1

I also liked how despite it being near closing time at 8pm no one tried to usher us out of the pool (we were already walking around near the entrance anyway) and didn't kick us out when we just sat on the couch in entrance lounge just a bit longer. Will definitely come back with more friends! Thank you very much Palazzo for your service! :)",3,1,3

Their hotel rooms are beautiful but their customer service is horrid.  There are way too many other options to put up with shitty customer service.  I reached out to the Palazzo before a bachelorette party I was planning.  I asked for adjoining suites and for at least ONE of the rooms to be ready early so we could decorate for the Bride.  We haD people coming in from Boston and Los Angeles at all different times on Friday.  We got to the Palazzo at 11 to check in.  We were told we were priority and that the rooms just needed to be cleaned and they would call us  We waited for an hour, no phone call.  We walked back up to the desk and they let us in one room, why no one called us still irritates me.  DO NOT COMMIT TO THINGS YOU CANNOT MAKE HAPPEN.  We went up to the one room around 12:15 and started to decorate once the bellman brought up our stuff.  Several hours passeD and no phone call about the room next door.  The do not disturb sign was on the room that was supposed to be ours.  I asked the maids and they had not been told to clean it despite our alleged priority status.  We had to keep calling down stairs.  We didn't get into the room until 4pm.  So it took 5 hours to clean rooms that were empty at 11?!!!  We had priority status?!  This put a damper on the weekend from the first moment.  If you must stay there make sure it's with a small group or that it doesn't matter what time you need to get in the room.  Forget about calling in advance and making requests because they'll lie about accommodating you.  I recommend the Elara from bachelorette parties.  DO NOT STAY AT THE PALAZZO",0,2,0

I stayed for 5 nights (4 nights were comped, one night I paid for.) It's become a tradition to come to Vegas every year for 4th of July weekend, but this year, as luck would have it, the 4th fell mid-week on Tuesday, so decided to do a Sunday thru Friday type of stay. My flight arrived in Vegas shortly after noon, and my Lyft driver had me at the hotel shortly thereafter. 

Check-in and my room assignment was the only reason this review did not get a 5-star review. I understand late check-outs on a Sunday resulting in no available room inventory come Sunday afternoon for those of us arriving at the end of the weekend. I get it. What I do not get is why check me in beforehand, tell me you're going to text me with my room # once it's ready within an hour, and no text ever came. Had it not been for me actually calling them after 2-and-half hours, I'd likely still be waiting for my room assignment. Then, to add insult to injury, they gave me a room on the end of the 700 wing of the 40th floor. The 700 wing has a view of nothing but the Trump tower. Nothing else. The desirable wing is the 800 or if you're lucky enough, the 900 wing, even number, above 40th floor, so you can look beyond the Venetian and get a great view of the central and southern strip. I called to ask for a room change, only to be told that the room I had was actually strip view. I told them it wasn't the strip view I was used to, and they tried to tell me that it was a premium room, while I kept telling them there was nothing premium about the view to me. Long story short, they ended up re assigning me to a room in the 800 wing on a higher floor the day after. I get it was a comped stay, but still, try to do right by your customers, regardless of the situation. After all, this is the hospitality industry. Empathy, folks!

This hotel is undergoing a renovation, and if memory serves me correctly, the bell hop said they started at the top of the hotel, and currently down to the 30-something floor. So both the rooms I had were updated rooms (Pictures below.) I do appreciate that they have listened to what people have been preaching for years (namely, HIDE that rack that has candy and other snacks, because kids often grab them without knowing that it costs an arm and a leg.) Now they have hidden the rack inside the nice stand in the sunken living room, under the TV. 

KODI+STREAMING!!!! If you are a techie like me, that loves having the opportunity to stream Kodi or playing videos off your device (like a laptop) and projecting it unto a TV, the new upgraded TV in the sunken living room moves around, which enables you to plug your device and watch it on the 47"" HDTV in the living room. There are 3 available HDMI ports on the back of the TV. TIP: Use HDMI Port #2! (This port already has its own dedicated channel on your TV-- Channel 67, so there's no need to change input on the TV, just the channel!) I wouldn't try streaming on the TV over by the bed, because that one is mounted against the wall, so not much room to connect peripherals. (See the Pics below.)

Gone is that long remote to control the curtains in your room. Now, there are two wall mounted controls like light switches, to do this. One over by the stairs where you walk into the sunken living room, and the other right on the side of the bed. Both super convenient locations. Also the curtains have been changed, to something more sleeker looking.

Also, I love the newer furniture in the bedroom and living room. Gone is that worn out dark golden couch, and in its place is a nice smaller L-shaped couch that doubles as a sofa-bed. In the bedroom, form over function, as one of the 2 new night stands does not have any storage, and instead just has an open space where you'd expect to store clothes or your toys\/lotions, etc. (Pics below) You still have a lot of drawer space in the armoire under the TV in the bedroom and in the 2nd night stand on the other side of the bed.

Don't quote me, but I do believe the carpeting is also new on these floors as I don't recall the design of the carpet before, until now. 

In the desk, on the side, fast charging via USB now available. Also, the alarm clock on the night stand, has fast charging capabilities!!! Check the picture attached so you can see, just plug in your fast charging USB chord, and you're set! This goes for the fast charging USB plug in play feature on the desk as well! 

The dining options here are plentiful, as always, and was happy to see Chef Lorena Garcia's ""Chica"" restaurant added to the line up here. Awesome Latin food with an added touch of Chef Garcia. Of course you can't go wrong with all the Happy Hour offerings throughout the V\/P enclave, mostly stuck to the Happy Hour at the Grand Luxe, as the offerings of the food menu are extensive and dirt cheap on that HH Menu.

It was a bit of a hassle because you must have a room key to go up to a room and to the pool.  So, we had to wait in the lobby for my friend to come down and meet us.  I felt like a criminal : ).

I came here for a bachelorette party and had to share a room with 5 other girls. Trust me, initially I balked at the idea, but in the end we were pretty comfortable. There were 2 queen beds, plus an L shaped sofa that pulls out to a twin bed, so we all had a place to sleep. Do I recommend sharing a room with 6 people? No, never again, but I survived. Other than that rooms are very large and well appointed.

Service was also really great. We asked for extra towels pretty late at night and instead of just knocking on the door, we got a call saying that housekeeping was at the door! I thought that was very thoughtful of them, although the ringing phone scared me more than a knock would have. I also like that there is security at the elevators so in theory random people should not be milling about the hotel area.

As for the gaming area, it was alright. I did decent on slots which is shocking, but lost some money playing roulette. Most tables had a $15 minimum, but not sure if it's lower on the weekdays. Palazzo has easy access to the Venetian and Wynn so it is very conveniently located to a bunch of restaurants, clubs and (high end) shopping. I didn't get the check out the pool area, but next time!

Definitely worth checking out for a great Vegas experience!",0,0,0

Well, maybe one, they've dramatically cut back on promotions for player card holders.  What can you do?  I guess the economy finally caught up with them.  Speaking of which, did you know you could have bought Sands stock below $2\/share a few years back.  Ka-ching!  They're hovering the $50\/share level now.  Shoulda, coulda, woulda right.  At least the management here is doing something right to bring forth revenue not expected before.  I always think the more profitable a casino is the higher the level of customer service is given.

The Palazzo is definitely a nice place to stay.  All the rooms are suites with tall windows that sometimes offers up a decent view.  We just got unfortunate this time with a mountain view.  The beds seem to be getting worn down, or it's just my particular room this stay, but it still has a comfy feel.  I do miss the old amenities they use to give out.  The soaps, shampoos, conditioners, etc. use to be a very good brand that came from, I think, somewhere in the UK.  Now they have something from China\/Hong Kong.  I don't really like the difference even if the new amenities are comparable to the old ones.",5,4,4

The rooms are large, have two beds, a pullout bed and a couch so there is plenty of room for everyone. It has a huge bathroom with a glass shower and bath tub, vanity mirror with seat in the corner, and large two person sink. It even has a telephone in the toilet room and a television in the corner of the bathroom so you can watch all your sports games while in the shower...it's pretty fun! The room itself has two large televisions, a lighted bar onto of a dresser, the beds are separated from the living room area by a declining stair dip down where an L-shaped couch (pullout bed) is and a coffee table. There is also a mini fridge in the corner of the room, a table and chairs for dining, a desk in the other corner which comes complete with an all-in-one fax, copy, print machine! This place is pretty loaded, looks great, comfortable, clean, and our view looked directly down over the pool from the 30th floor...yeah it was pretty sweet! 

The eateries were not that great and some of them even had signs saying ""closed, coming soon"" but the pool area was pretty nice. It came with full towel service, the people were really friendly. They had seats in the water you could sit and relax in which I loved. They had three main large pools, one small private party pool (which wasn't as popular as it should have been, sadly they were begging people to go to the parties that weekend, but we'll just give them benefit of the doubt and blame EDC) and about 10 other small pools surrounding it.

Overall this place is one of the nicest places I've stayed at in Las Vegas so far and would love to go back again.",0,0,0

While still not topping my #1 ranked place (The Wynn) the Palazzo still ranks high for being a bit more accessible pricewise, and the fact they sent me multiple comps in the past, always enough to make me a fan.

As part of the Venezia group, the Palazzo is neighbors and connected to the famous Venetian hotel and while the main structure of the resort is a near clone of the Venetian's main tower, it just makes a lot more sense to me.  While the Venetian is an enormous sprawling mess created out of a hodgepodge of mismatching buildings, making it a near Indiana Jones-like adventure to locate anything, the Palazzo sticks with a clean, orderly, symmetric floor layout that's consistent from the Lobby, upwards.  This means I don't get hopeless lost when finding a place or my room for that matter, compared to its sister resort.

Room layouts are similar to the venetian with the recessed 'living room' area floor and all rooms are suite style, complete with TWO plasma flatscreen TVs so you and your hotel mates can play dueling tv programs if you choose.  Fixtures, bedding and all aspects of the room are first class and up to date, unlike some of the more outdated accoutrements of the Venetian.

The pool area is also great, affording a view out on the strip as well as being dominated by the beautiful elegant structure of the hotel itself.  The positioning of the pool means mornings will be shaded until the sun breaks over the top of the hotel, then its blazing sun from then on until sundown, so plan accordingly.

Restaurants are highlighted by Lavo, Wolfgang Puck's Cut, the new Mario Batali restaurant amongst others and you can easily walk to the Venetian shops to check out their shopping and restaurants as well.  Walkways provide easy access to the Wynn and Encore as well as the Fashion Island shopping mall if that's your thing.  Casino floor layout is reasonable as well and very centralized, so the entire casino is in view rather than being a confusing labyrinth, like Caesar's for example.  BJ tables are plenty and reasonably priced altho minimum bets do go up as the night and weekends move in.

Get the the concierge level. (so worth it!) 
-Starts with by-passing the regular check-in and heading directly to the 23rd floor where you are met with smiles And a glass of champagne, and then checked in within moments of arriving.  If your room isn't ready yet-you are escorted into the palatial club room, where all day softdrinks, coffee & snacks are available (yes free), a FULL breakfast is served in the morning and hors d'oeuvre and drinks (yes alcoholic) still FREE. Did I say hors d'oeuvres? I meant (MEALS) because what they serve IS good (and plentiful) enough for a meal, i.e. caviar, calamari, chicken, and so much more(not just chips & dip here)
The rooms are incredibly beautiful, a bath to die for, views beyond what you would expect.  
There are many different pool area's -most of which play music and every  type of music - just choose.  (My brother and wife enjoyed the Techno music area - I on the other hand moved to the pool with some soft rock to enjoy my say of sun.  There are jacuzzi's at every turn (so no waiting, no sitting in jam packed jacuzzi's here.)

The Casino is beautiful, as most are in Las Vegas, the restaurants as well (though being there for the weekend - we actually filled up on the full breakfast and the enormous cocktail hour and with the exception of one night - we did not even Go and spend $ eating out.  We did however, grab a pizza downstairs (yummy and brought it up to the room and considering the L shaped couch AND the full table and chairs in the suite offered more room to dine than any restaurant...and did I mention the birds eye view of TI pirate show And the Mirage Volcano from our suite?  We HAD the restaurant with the best view just being in our suite!

Service, Service, Service at every turn.  

From the moment began searching reviews on this location and saw the head of Operations herself respond to most of all the comments with a ""Thank you for staying"", ""please come back"", etc....I was impressed...and so much more so once I arrived.  I left feeling as if I had a week long vacation and was pampered from the moment I arrived until the moment I checked out. This hotel is beautiful in every aspect and carries with it the amazing guest services from the Venetian - and goes Beyond...I felt relaxed, 'special', excited and enjoyed every moment.

I saw nothing but smiles from every person working there, and friendly (not the frozen smile of some hotels) the concierge level-is even more so in that they cater to your every need within moments of asking for what you need\/or want. (did I mention they sent up Birthday cakes for my Mom and Brothers Birthday?! did I mention the Chocolates on your pillow are actually displayed and given in beautiful satin bags? Wow!

We took a trip to Vegas for my Birthday and once again made reservations at the Palazzo Hotel. We reserved the Sienna View Suite so we could have a view of the strip. Upon arrival at 1:30pm we asked about the strip view and we were told that yes we will have a strip view however our room was not yet ready. We were ok with this and they said they would call us as soon as the room was ready. We went to one of the restaurants and had lunch anticipating that our room would be ready within an hour or so. After finishing lunch at 3:30 we walked around until 4:00pm at which time we decided to go to a bar and await the call for our room. At 4:20pm we decided to call the front desk and they told us they were sorry we had to wait so long but our room was still not ready and that they would find us another room. We once again reconfirmed the strip view. We then went to the room that they directed us. 
Upon arrival to the suite we found that unless you smash you face against the glass there was no strip view; only a view of the parking structures and the airport. This was upsetting as we tend to spend more time in our room than others and we like to have a view. Imagine a view room without a view. 
We then turned the TV on in the living room but it did not work. That was enough and we called the front desk to discuss the view issue and the TV. They sent a technician to our room who said the TV needed to be replaced. After discussions with the technician about the view suits he told us that for a view we should be in the 700 wing. News to us but that is not where we were. We were in the 800 wing. 
The technician was very nice and also called the frint desk to let them know we were not pleased with our room and the issues. We received a call from the front desk almost immediately and after explaining the situation they told us that there were not other rooms available until the next day but they would give us a discount on that night which we accepted with a caveat that we may want to move to the other room the next day.
The next day we called the front desk at 8:00am and requested to be relocated to a view room at which time we were told that they were booked and no rooms were available. Really, that is not what we were told the day before. When I questioned this they told me that I accepted a discount and that the other room option was not available anymore. Wow. After further discussion with the front desk we were simply stuck in the room we were given with no view. What a waste of valuable time when you work 12-14 hour days and only get a short getaway once a year.

The suits are huge!!  Its got a sunken living room area and then the bedroom area.  The bathrooms are pretty roomy and clean as well.  The housekeeping does a great job keeping the place clean and they are very good about bringing fresh towels to the rooms.  There is a fridge and a basket with food and munchies , but the prices are way too high and usually we try not to touch it.  But if we were to, its got a good selection of yummy munchies.  

We also went to the Palazzo Spa.  It was $30\/person.  They give you a locker where you could leave your stuff.  We really enjoyed the steam room, Jacuzzi, herbal room.  Didnt dare to use the Igloo shower.  It felt so cold when I opened the door to the igloo, lol. But it looked pretty nice and clean.  The spa was pretty busy but they did a great job maintaining it and keeping it clean.  Its got a quiet room with really nice comfy beds and nice relaxing spa music playing.

Most hotels will give you a credit for the amount paid that typically goes out a few months to be used when able.  The manager 'Tabatha' was rude and told me b\/c I didn't call back I lost the $$.

Nice that we get resort credit, yet there are some small cons. Love how high end the rooms are, very stylish, modern and advanced in technology with the control buttons for the curtains

Cons: 
1. From check-in you have to walk through the casino to get to the elevators to get to your room, It's a little awkward and tacky. 
2. Elevators take really long 
3. No extra fridges in the room for your drinks and food (have to pay for it, since the only ones  in there are mini bars)

This piece of crap place cause they can't hire enough people to answer their damn phones. I called there 702 number and waited 45 minutes. Nobody picked up I call from my home number to their 866 number and someone picked up right away. 

THIS PLACE DOESN'T WANT YOUR BUSINESS because I mention a room rate based off an email from that my buddy gets almost weekly and they don't believe me. She tells me oh we send out over 300 mailers. What kind of customer service is that? She just wanted to us to pay $100 dollars more. I asked about a AAA rate and or Kayak rate. She can't match or give us the rate. In order to get a AAA discount I have to go through AAA to get it. All these inconveniences isn't worth my time and their place is nice BUT, that is the word BUT I can go somewhere else since most of the time I'm at the casino gambling. 

Then that reservation chick tells me I can't pre-pay on my cc unless I fax my credit card in to authorize it so my buddy can check in without me. That's absurd!! I've never heard that BS before. I book rooms for conferences for co-workers and I don't have to be there to check in with them. 

Finally she transfer me into a black hole to supposedly the front desk to get this form faxed or emailed to me.  We wait for five minutes and then I call from my cell back to the 702 number and the front desk answers right away. She tells me why did I hang up and I explained that their phone system SUCKS! The front desk chick tells me to tell the Reservation person that I authorize my card to be pre-pay for the room and then transfers me back in the cue. Guess what we wait in that stupid cue for 20 minutes before we attempt to call back on the 866 number which didn't work the second time around. 

I'm not a high roller and maybe that's the case but I don't need this kind of BS. There is plenty of other HOTELS. This place can shove it in this economy. 

Word of advise to the owners. If you do send out mailers then add some kind of code cause I had to describe the mailer and it's content to the reservation person which really made me feel like a criminal trying to get the best rate based off of your junk email. Even yelp has a cheaper rate.",8,5,0

The couch\/living area rules, and the suites are big enough to entertain at least 10 people. Your hotel room can be pre party central.

The 1,000 point Grazie (players club)room offer was amazing... As a local it was nice not having to drive back to Henderson after a night out at  Tao and Xs. The grazie offer ended in 2010 and this review covers my first visit  as a paying guest in 08\/2012. The challenges revolved around the cleanliness of the suite, electrical noises, rattling air conditioners and people entering my suite at 1AM.

The check in was a breeze, the front desk couldn't have been nicer and went to my strip view regular 700 sq foot suite at 11AM early check in was a breeze. I went to the Palazzo pool deck which is gorgeous but was covered in a shadow until 12:30 PM  and was full of families and people over 60. We walked thru to the Venetian side and  went to Tao Beach which was bright and sunny. Showed our IDs got chairs and enjoyed the day. 

I returned to the suite and started to get situated. I looked out the window and noticed dried black phlegm on the window itself. I turned on the air conditioner and it started to rattle very loud and thought to myself...Have  had this problem in any hotel before?  I decided to call downstairs...

I re-packed   walked downstairs thru the casino back to the line and waited for new keys. Went to the new suite and it takes 1 second to open the door and hear an electrical sizzling sound. I think to myself have I ever heard a sizzling sound in any hotel  in my entire life. This time I call downstairs and ask to speak to the manager.

I was moved to a 2000 sq foot Sienna Suite which was nice. The manager took care of my challenges within 30 seconds and it was a good resolution to my 2 hours of aggravation. The suite consists of 3 rooms and a bathroom. Elliptical room, bedroom and living room. Its large and the 1000 sq foot living room is barely  decorated. The bedroom and bathroom was nice. Nothing amazing I'd brag about compared to Aria, Cosmo or Wynn. 

I was tired after caring suitcases up and down elevator shafts and medium long hallways thru casinos to front desks and was glad to get to sleep. 

Now having stayed at Aria the past few stays the door locked automatically and you  press a privacy button and didn't understand why this front door didn't have a lock. So I figured the door sensor locked because it had no chain. (later the security told me I needed to turn the door knob counterclockwise to lock) It was a shocking experience to hear the door open at 1AM in a 2000 sq foot suite and being in the bedroom which is nowhere near  the front door and was pitch black I was pretty shook up. Security came after 10 minutes and they offered to search my suite which I did already 10 minutes earlier.. ..obviously!

I was very tired...the next two days were average no issues...very good job by housekeeping ha ha ha

At 5am on the day of departure they slipped the bill under the door and was excited to see about $200 in mini bar  charges that were false. I called downstairs and spoke to a female team member at 6AM and told me she didn't want to hear my attitude so I went downstairs...at 6am to clear it up...They took it off the bill without any question.

Overall this was a 4\/10...very confusing 3 nights and was pissed I paid for this experience.

Our stay was booked for Monday-Thursday. Upon arrival, we really liked how convenient the self-parking garage was; there were 2 escalators that we saw from where we parked (one said ""front desk"" - self-explanatory...the other said ""casino"" - also self-explanatory -- however, the ""casino"" escalator takes you up to where the Sportsbook desk is, a little closer to the guest room elevators. Around 3:30pm on a Monday, the check-in line was about 4 parties long. We were helped by one of the managers, Linda, who was extremely friendly and made quite a first impression for the resort right off the bat. The only hiccup was that there wasn't a King Suite on a non-smoking floor available at the time of our check-in, but she quickly offered us a Bella Suite (2 queen beds) for no extra charge. Not a big deal, so we took it. 

The suite was one of the last rooms in the hall on the 44th floor. Surprisingly, the walk from the elevator to the end of the hall wasn't that long. The room was everything we dreamed of and more. You definitely get more for your money here compared to the Aria. Yes, Aria is a little newer, but the convenience and luxuriousness of the Palazzo trumps it in my opinion. We had nothing to complain about during our stay - the room was clean and comfortable. 

We had great experiences with room service both times we ordered breakfast with them. Eggs over easy were cooked perfectly, bacon was crispy (the way it should be!), wheat toast came with butter on the side, and house potatoes were seasoned well. Coffee and orange juice for two (each morning) was definitely appreciated even though the coupon said ""one selection per person"". The 18% service charge was already included in the price when the bill came to the room, which was perfectly fine with me. 

Like everyone else says, security at the entrance to the guest elevators was nice and definitely made me feel more comfortable and safe. Even at 3am, there was someone there making sure every party had a room key. 

Overall, I loved the convenience of the Palazzo and Venetian being connected. This past trip was one of the best we've had so far and we're already looking forward to our next trip to the Palazzo.",0,0,0

However, the others would have to be even more over the top than this one. Ignore those that say this is not five star. Five star is definitely the Palazzo. The beds, the marble everywhere, the large suken den area with a huge sectional sofa, the two HD TVs, the amenities, the auto blinds, the rediculously huge bathroom with seperate tub and shower (surrounded by marble) the double vanity, and seperate powder room are all five star quality and five star presentation. Most affluent people's homes don't have things this well laid out or of this quality. 

The color scheme and materials all reflect Vegas' attitude of young and sexy. I feel rich staying here. The clubs and restaurants are all THE places to be in Vegas for the well advertised nightlife. Their shopping areas abound with pricey but quality goods that sometimes you can only find in foreign countries. The casino is large, but very spread out so it's not crowded. However, cigarette smoke makes the casino dated and old school, not in line with the rest of the attractions.

The service of the staff, although friendly and attentive, is lacking simply because there are not enough staff to cover this three in one hotel complex and the needs of everyone there (like a morning rush to check out) or a long line and the belldesk to arrange for transportation or taxi.) In addition, the guest services areas are not put into intuitive places. However, this is my first stay in a hotel complex this large, so maybe my expections are a little skewed, but it seems like the larger the hotel, the greater the resources should be.

That being said, I'm not needy so I can pretty much get anything I need over the phone in the guest room and there is no need for me to have to journey anywhere to get something. Overall, I will be back because I cannot see how anything could be better than this experience. However, my room had a full view of the spectacular pool at the Wynn.

I don't really gamble - only when I have family or friends in town, and I only play bonus poker and a little slots. 

We had to walk around half the casino to find any video poker machines on the floor - they're apparently all clustered near Zine except for a couple random ones I found in front of carnevino.  

I could be wrong but the payouts for each type of poker are supposed to be standardized. Every bonus poker machine I've ever played has a 10 credit payout for 2 pairs w max bet 5. But all of the machines in front of carnevino only pay out 5. 

I've never seen that at any other casino and feel that its super deceptive since most people are so used to playing the same game they don't even look at the payout chart, and they shouldn't have to. 

The cocktail service also sucks - took over half an hour sitting at the same machine until I saw a waitress strut by. So no more gambling at Palazzo or Venetian for me. I'm realistic - I play to kill time, not to win. But I still don't appreciate them trying to f*ck me faster without my knowledge",4,4,1

It is a newer hotel\/casino on the strip and the rooms look that way, too.  For the price you pay, they are some of the larger rooms on the strip.  The Cosmopolitan charges even more money for a smaller room.  A $20 tip to the front desk attendant got us a great room with an amazing view of the strip and Treasure Island.  We got a suite with a large comfy bed and sunken living room.  All the materials looked to be high quality.  The televisions in the bathroom are pretty cool, too.  It was a very luxurious room and was a big step up after staying at the Sahara the night before (this was back in 2010).  The location is great being in the middle of the strip and the pools were amazing (you have access to the Venetian pool as well when you stay at The Palazzo, and vice versa). 

Even though this is a 5 star resort, I think the bad economy reflects the amenities and service you receive.  There wasn't as much extra attention as I would expect for a 5 star resort but they probably aren't charging the prices they used to in 2007, either.  The casino floor is very nicely decorated with non-smoking sections which is a relief.  I remember going to Vegas just a few years ago and I would feel sick and have a constantly runny nose from all the cigarette smoke.  They are really starting to clean things up in Vegas which is a step in the right direction.",1,0,0

I've visited the Venetian during new year's 2008, within a week of the Palazzo's opening. Sheldon's team have enhanced the Canal shops with this gem. Don't be fooled by the property being dwarfed be the Venetian's enormity. The Palazzo has earned its stripes and then some. Their location and service cannot be beat. With a robust roster of eateries, shopping and nightlife, there's no reason to not stay on this property.

 I've stayed at the Palazzo numerous times. EVERY time is better than the last. The staff takes pride in their guest's experience. Be it shows or dinning experiences. Their pools are kept at top notch as well as their day-club, TAO. I cannot wait for my next vegas vacation.",7,3,4

Our room (a Bella suite) had a pretty unique lay-out. There is a step down to a living room styled section along with the upper floor being the bedroom and bathroom. The only con to the room layout was the velvet couches and chairs that over the years have become mangy. God only knowns how many people have stayed in our room so the fragile velvet had patches missing. Another guest had ruined the large marble table completely taking the finish off, however I don't hold the hotel accountable. Room service stunk and you are expected to wait up to an hour for service?! The birthday boy however was given the presidential suite which it's fair to say that he had the very best of everything. He had the top floor with a nice view and the room had a pretty cool layout. From his room we could watch the Treasure Island pirate show and see the sunset.

Since we were with family, my sister-in-law had brought her young children (3 and 6) along. Although we rented a cabana at the secluded private pool other guests were infuriated by their presence. Keep in mind there are 3 other pools and the location and we chose the smaller pool so that the children could be away from the raunchy main pool. The four or five other adults (who mind you did not have a cabana) were furious with us. Seriously? I'll admit the two were excited to be at the pool and at times were laughing and giggling but they never jumped into the pool and never splashed. All the same, a lot but people actually got up and left scowling and complaining the whole way. But once again the hotel is not to blame. 

The lobby and casino was a little flashy, this crowd has got money. Beautiful girls are everywhere (don't get too excited, most of them are underage). By sunset, if you are not wearing the six inch heels and little dress than you are given evil glances by the younger gamblers. Since this is my style I didn't mind, but other members of my group were really uncomfortable by it. Overall I liked the feel to the Palazzo it may be flashy but what else do you want from a Las Vegas strip casino? 

Just beware of the Phantom of the Opera & Jersey Boys soundtrack that is played over and over again, I truly pity the staff.",0,0,0

Went back down amid the busyness, but the gentleman who assisted us heard our complaints, talk to his manager, and got us a non-smoking room in the Palazzo. Now, that's some awesome service!

Although we go to Vegas pretty often, we usually stay at the modest hotels, either with some promotion, non-peak rate, or free (gambling has to have some perks, right?). When my wife decided to splurge on Palazzo to celebrate our anniversary and my b-day, I did a little happy dance.

Thumbs up for the valet experience. They were always very fast and friendly. Check-in was a bit slow, but we asked for any comp upgrades (without the $20 sandwich trick) and they gave us a higher floor with a nice view of the Wynn, golf course, and mountains. You can even see their pool (but no super extra strength binoculars, lol). Sometimes, it's not always about the noisy strip view.

Regarding the room, it was spacious and luxurious. The remote to open the curtains automatically never gets old for me. It wasn't the largest room we had stayed at, but I loved the quality of the furniture. I wanted to take home that sectional in the living room. The bed was comfy, and I'm always happy when there's a flat screen in the bathroom.

We just about took advantage of every promotion they offered -- free room service breakfast, free slot play by signing up with their Grazie rewards card, and free credit to grab some beverages from their mini bar, just to name a few. I was a little giddy getting to actually drink something from a mini bar in Vegas. Nothing like drinking a mini-bottle of soda that normally costs $5 to boost your ego.

Gambling-wise, I did really well on the first night on the blackjack tables. I could've called it quits on gambling and left on top... deposit the money in my online savings account or Roth IRA. Who am I kidding... there were 2 more nights to go, and you can guess what happened after that. But we had a great time, met some good people, and that's all that matters. Grazie, Palazzo.",4,6,4

Upgraded to 5 very deserving stars as after many enjoyable stays haven't had any issues with WIFI or cellphone signal, and they have the absolute best late check out of any hotels in Vegas, 6:00pm for Platinum VIP members. 

---------

It's an all suite hotel with magnificent restaurants, beautiful pools and spa, upscale shops, Sands Expo meeting facilities, theaters, and two casinos The Palazzo (smaller of the two) and sister resort the Venetian.

I travel to Las Vegas on occasion and enjoy staying on the strip, The Palazzo is in my opinion one of the best if not the best, Vegas has to offer, opulent and exquisitely decorated, with a 5 star service to match.

The suites are lavish and generous in size, 750sf plus, very comfortable beds, rooms are exquisitely decorated, bathrooms with double sinks, Roman tub and enough Italian marble to make Michelangelo jealous, there are 3 tv's, one in the bathroom.

I have always been very pleased with their service and attention to detail, room are very well insulated, you'll notice a lack of obnoxious noise from rowdy neighbors, there is a working desk, with printer, and Ethernet connections, sunken living room with enough space for small meeting or party, and a dining table.

Can't even start describing all the wonderful amenities as there is not enough space to enumerate, however, there is one particular amenity I enjoy the best, 4PM late check out, yes, there is such thing, call it a perk if you like, but what a perk

At this point I have to burst the bubble, it is a solid 5 star hotel with one flaw, the dreaded wifi is spotty, and some rooms don't get either wifi nor wireless signal. 

I know, you are crying, not to worry, take the elevator down, get inline and try not to drool over the counter at one of two Bouchon bakeries, indulge in coffee & pastries, and you will feel better",15,10,14

The decor of the Palazzo rooms are the same as newly remodeled rooms in the Venetian, although they might be a little bigger.

This is the only place I know of (Venetian\/Palazzo) that you can guarantee yourself 3 beds (pullout sleeper couch) when you make a reservation.  I don't think even Encore has that.

Everything you could want from a hotel suite is there:  Nice TV's, Soft bedding and towels, complimentary toiletries and robes.  Nothing to complain about.  If you happen to succeed with the 20$ ""complimentary upgrade"" trick at the front desk, you can be treated to a spectacular view of the TI Pirate Show, as well as a semi-nice view of the Strip.

The casino floor itself left something to be desired.  Definitely not as busy as the Venetian, filled mostly with slots.  The walking areas were much wider, but it gave the feeling of being very empty.

-Walking distance to Walgreens right outside the entrance if you forgot to bring something or need to grab some essentials 
-Free wifi for up to 4 devices per room. I liked that I never had to reconnect over the course of the weekend. 
-Suites. This is what makes the Venetian\/Palazzo stand out a little more compared to most other hotels on the Strip. The suites are very spacious and the connecting rooms are nicer for larger parties. 

Con's: 
-We didn't have a problem with the wifi for up to 4 devices per room, but I can see it potentially being a problem since the suites can sleep more than 4. 
-I wish there was more affordable fast-food and drink options in the Palazzo. Sure, there are places in the Venetian that's connected, but it's still a bit of a trek. There is a juice bar downstairs by the elevators, but my friend said a small cold-pressed juice cost $13. The only take-out option in the Palazzo is the Grand Lux Cafe, which I wasn't super impressed with. 
-The view we had in our suite was unimpressive. All we saw from our window was the Trump Hotel and Treasure Island, and a whole lot of desert. Not the pretty Vegas night view I was expecting. 

Who I recommend go with the Palazzo: 
-Very large parties that don't mind sharing a suite or two. 
-People who are okay with the standard Vegas hotel decor, with the downstairs areas adjacent to the casino a little bit more ornate and decorated. I wouldn't consider it ""modern"" or ""sleek"" by any means if that's what you're looking for.",2,0,0

The front desk was contacted and they advised that they would send housekeeping to correct the matter and change all the bedding.  

I placed a piece of tissue between the sheets to ensure that the bedding had been changed.  When we returned the couch was vacuumed and one could still see that the bodily fluids where still sticking around on the couch.  The bedding had not been changed as the tissue paper still remained in the same location it was placed.  

After more than 48 hours of promises and lies by managers from the three managers in guest services I spoke with the fourth manager Jason had the matter partly corrected although the semen stuck around on the couch for the remainder of our stay.

The rooms were nice.... almost an exact replica of the Venetian rooms, which in my opinion, are probably the most spacious standard rooms (seeing as how they're all suites) on the Strip. If you like space, this is one thing that the Venetian and Palazzo have raised the bar over even the Wynn.

I did like the gym and spa, and the pool wasn't bad, and probably a tad more down to earth than the Wynn.

The most annoying thing, however, is that they NEVER left washcloths in our room.  I had to call to have them brought up every single day, which isn't that big of a deal but is a major annoyance to have to wait for them to take a shower.  Really?  You can't just leave a couple?  I'm pretty sure the two of us don't need SIX hand towels, but two washcloths is too much to ask for?

Restaurants and shopping are convenient but pricey.  I'd stay here again, but only because the rest of Vegas is more gross.",1,0,0

My hubby and I loved the fact that we had our own private front desk area on the 23rd floor and did not have to go down stairs and wait in line to make changes in our reservation or to check out.  It was really nice and convenient.  We also loved the fact that we got endless cocktails which we could enjoy at the Prestige Lounge on the 23rd floor or we could take them down to our suite to enjoy.  Breakfasts were pretty decent and the cocktail reception always had different items on their menu daily.  We particularly loved relaxing at the lounge and sitting in the chairs by the windows which overlooked the Vegas Strip. Bathrooms at the Prestige Lounge were very clean and offered patrons mini bottles of Scope mouth rinse, I guess so you can get rid of the alcohol on your breath.  LOL!

As for our room, we stayed in their Siena Suite (24-705).  We absolutely loved it.  It was 1200-1300 sq ft in size and had two bathrooms and a separate living room and bedroom.

Hubbie and I arrive at the Palazzo, we enter... NICE. Short line at the check in, everybody is very nice. We booked our room through priceline so we weren't sure of what it was going to happen. We enter in the room and there it was: the most beautiful room i've ever stay at. I travelled a lot, i stayed in a LOT of hotels, i've never seen anything this nice and comfy. Giant king sized bed, a living room with 2 super comfy couches (perfect for your friends to crush),plenty of room to walk around, amazing view, a bathroom where you could have a skateboard contest in.bath robes... very soft. 
3 tvs in the room (bedroom, living room ,bathroom). 
bed.. comfy... i mean i was in vegas, super hang over, my body was full of a mix of oxygen and vodka and redbull, but i slept. and i slept well. 

so, for me 5 stars for the room, i have ZERO complaint about the room, but i have to take away one star because the restaurants at the Palazzo are terrible at least the one that we tried. Some of this could be our fault: we went to Vegas as a spur of the moment kind of thing, it was Valentines week end so every nice restaurant in Vegas was booked. Still, if I'm going to pay a bill for more than $100 per person i want some edible food. Stay away from LAVO and Dos Caminos. But specially LAVO. just try to eat at the many good restaurants that they have in close by hotels, but stay away from the restaurants at the Palazzo. 

Last but not least: the Casino. I have fun when i gamble. I love black jack. I love love love black jack, but the illusion of betting as little money as i can makes me feel better, so i try to hit only the $10 or $15 table.$25 minimum bet?no thanks... well, past 11 pm at the Palazzo there are only 2 $15 tables on a Saturday night. The $25 table are sad and empty, the $15 tables are full and there is a LINE to play, but still, only 2 $15 table. We ended up going to the Venetian, that seriously, is right there, so no big deal, but i didn't like that. 

So.. would I go there again? Yes, the location is great and the rooms are amazing. You can find great food and great casinos in Vegas, just not at the Palazzo.Sleep here and walk around.",0,0,0

* Easy access in and out of their parking garage
* Easy access to their ride share drop-off and pick-up location
* Several great dining options
* Great location for shopping - all my favorite shops are in the hotel or just across the street
* Spacious guest rooms
* Views are nice even in their non Strip View rooms
* The hotel and Shoppes have a nice feel overall and seem less hectic than other hotels

However, I can't give 5 stars and it's not my very favorite hotel. (Four Seasons receives that top honor by me, followed by Mandarin Oriental.)  Reasons for that (based on my last stay):

* Room cleanliness: Crumbs were left on the stairs leading to the sunken living room by previous guests and were not cleaned up during our stay.  There was a Cheerio behind the couch that remained there as well. I spotted a reddish stain and small hairs on the bed sheet and dust and little hairs on the bathroom counter where the hand towel was hanging.  Also, there was a big, black mark on the wall separating the bedroom from the living room.

* Sheer drapes not functioning correctly when trying to raise them up

* Lack of power outlets near the bed

* Response to requests: I requested that the mini refrigerator that was left in our room before our arrival be removed, but no one ever came by to take it away.

There were some disappointing things about my last stay with Palazzo, but there are still things I find appealing, so though not at the top of my list, it's still one of my favorite hotels.",9,2,3

We came here for my 21st, which is around new years, so all the Christmas decorations were still up. It was absolutely gorgeous. When our limo arrive one of the porters immediately checked our bags. The front desk people were very nice and welcoming. The guy asked us if we were there for anything special and I mentioned it was my 21st. I asked if there were any upgrades available and he said for an additional $40 a day we could get a room with a view. Figuring we wouldn't be in the room all that much, we passed. However, when we got to the room, it seemed that he gave us a strip view anyways. The room, at 720 sq ft, was bigger than my apartment! We ended up ordering room service for dinner one night and it was restaurant quality food. Everything was still piping hot and our server made the experience all the more wonderful. He came in with his cart, and proceeded to set the table. It looked just like a restaurant setting complete with tablecloth, a basket of bread, and flowers. Definitely money well spent.   

Now, on to the negatives of why one star is subtracted. 
When we checked our luggage, we were told it would take 15 minutes to arrive. In reality, it took about 45 minutes. It was a little annoying since we had just gotten off the plane and wanted to grab something to eat. We were just laying in the room wasting time. I had to call 3 times to check on the luggage, and every time was told ""It's on it's way"" or ""It should be there any minute"". That didn't turn out to be the case. When it finally did arrive, our porter apologized and said it was because everyone had arrived at the same time and that it usually doesn't take that long. He was a nice and sincere guy so we ended up tipping him anyways.

After our luggage finally arrived, we walked down to the casino to play to play a quick round of roulette. We walked up to an empty table and put down $200. We were rudely asked for our ids and the dealer kept looking back and forth between my id and me for a good minute. He then gave it to the pit manager to look at before finally handing back our ids. Then he asked what color we'd like. My boyfriend and I couldn't decide if we wanted $25 chips or $100 chips. Before we had anytime to decide, he kept rudely insisting we pick a color. I don't know what the rush was for since we were the only people at the table. Our first gambling experience in Vegas was certainly not a good one. We ended up gambling at the Bellagio for the remainder of the trip when we could. The next morning, since I was still sleeping, my boyfriend headed down to the casino for another go. He played a good amount in the high rollers salon but it didn't affect our Grazie players club card at all. Apparently, you need to either play slots, or charge things to your room. We played about the same amount at the Bellagio and went from sapphire to gold on their Mlife players card. We also got a lot more comps and rewards. Luckily, his play did have some impacted as a couple weeks later we were sent an email promotion that gave us a complimentary three night stay and $300 casino cash. 

Overall, the hotel was exquisite, but the casino lacked. We are returning in a week, so hopefully this time they can earn the full five stars.",0,0,0

1. Spacious and beautifully designed rooms with luxurious-looking decor.  I loved the deep red velvet upholstered settees\/benches placed at the ends of the beds.

2. Location location location.  The Palazzo is connected to the Venetian and is just a stone's throw away from the Wynn, Encore, and Fashion Show mall, which gives you great access to dining, shopping, etc.  There's also a Walgreens just outside of the entrance so you can shop for basics such as water, toiletries, snacks, etc w\/o having to pay an arm and a leg for the hotel's marked up prices.

Okay, now let's talk about the VERY BAD:

My girls and I booked the Palazzo for my bachelorette party based on all the positive reviews.  There were six of us total and we booked 2 rooms.  We called one week prior to our reservation to request early check in since our flight would be arriving around 11-ish.  Usually, check in is around 3pm.  The reservationist I spoke to over the phone told me that it wouldn't be a problem.

When we arrived, however, we were told that only one room would be available and they didn't know when our second room would be ready, but would call us once it was.  We were a little annoyed, but figured we had a least one room to get settled in.  And what a room it was!  At first glance, our room was spacious and lovely.  However, once we got over the amazing decor, we noticed that there was garbage strewn around the room from the previous occupant.  Housekeeping was obviously doing a VERY half-assed job.  Then one of the girls noticed that the bathroom hadn't been cleaned properly, there was a bar of soap left on our countertop with what looked like a pubic hair stuck to it, ew!  And the toiletries (lotion, soap, shampoo, etc.) had not be restocked.  There was also a smear of what looked like pasta sauce across the bedroom wall.  Gross!  And then, one of my girls opened the nightstand drawer and found a ziplock bag full of hypodermic needles and medicine vials.  OMG!  We called the front desk right away and they told us that they would send housekeeping up ASAP.  At this point, we decided to go have lunch and do a little sight-seeing, expecting our room to be properly cleaned when we came back.

Several hours later, when we returned, our room was still filthy.  We had dinner to go to and a show to catch so we just crossed our fingers that everything would be tidied up later in the evening.  We got back a little before midnight and our room was still in the same state.  We just ended up having to clean it up ourselves.  Not the greatest way to spend the first night of your bachelorette party.  I decided I would call them in the morning.

At around 7:30am, I called the front desk and told them about what happened and how they failed to make a good first impression for me.  The front desk clerk was very apologetic and offered to waive the resort fee as well us upgrade us to higher rooms with better views.  She told us to pack up our things and at a little after noontime, someone would come up to move our luggage to our new rooms.  She said that I would receive a phone call as soon as everything was ready.  That sounded great and I totally took her up on the offer.

Unfortunately, by around 3:30pm, I had not received a single call.  We had things to do and places to be and all our stuff was still sitting in our luggage, waiting to be moved to our new rooms.  I decided to call the front desk and ask them what the holdup was.  The front desk clerk I spoke to told me that our rooms HAD been ready for quite some time and asked if I wanted our luggage to be moved up.  Well, yeah!  If the rooms had been ready, what the hell were was everyone waiting around for?  It took another 30 minutes for them to send someone up.

Once the bellboy arrived to help us move our luggage, we we took the elevator to our new rooms, which were pretty much the same, except that they were situated higher in the building.  I had expected something a little more luxurious to make up for what had happened up until this point, but oh well, at least it was clean.  While the bellboy was unloading our luggage, I told him that half of the luggage would be going to the other room so he didn't have to unload it all.  He seemed confused.  ""Other room?""  Uh oh.  Turns out we only had ONE room prepared for us.  I had to make another irate phone call to the front desk to clear up the problem.  I was civil as I could be, but had obvious grounds to be frustrated.  At one point, the front desk clerk that I was speaking with got loud and hostile with me, her attitude was pretty much: ""Well what do you want me to do about it?!""  Well, how about some better customer service?  I wasn't asking for anything except for them to do their jobs correctly.  At this point, I was transferred to her supervisor, who really didn't do any more than apologize and waive some nominal fee off our rooms, like $30 for our entire stay.

MY boss took us to Las Vegas and since he is a high roller we were living in the laps of luxury for the weekend. When we arrived at the airport there was a driver and a limo waiting for us. Upon our arrival at the hotel we were stunned at how beautiful the lobby was. There were huge fake flowers that were so pretty (not tacky) that lit up the entire space. 

The lobby was hustling with many people (bachelorette parties, couples, and groups of friends\/family.) Everyone seemed to be having a good time and it perked me up immediately.  It didn't think it could get any better until we headed to our rooms.....but it did!!

When we put the key in the door and it opened our jaws dropped to the floor. The first thing I noticed was the great view of Treasure Island from my window. It was a huge room with 2 comfortable queen beds and a sitting area that was located a couple steps down from the beds. The bathroom was INCREDIBLE! There was a glass shower and a nice big tub, on the other side of this huge bathroom was a makeup table\/vanity with a lighted mirror. Then there was a huge counter with double sinks but I was wondering where the toilet was. To my surprise, there was a water closet that was separate from the rest of the bathroom. This was great because if you are sharing space with friends and family they can get ready while you use the bathroom. Also, there was a TV in the there! The bathroom had double doors....DOUBLE DOORS!! 

The seating area had a pull out couch and a TV. The queen beds also had another TV which was awesome. 3 TV's in one room?? Not really necessary but AWESOME! There was also a lot of closet and drawer space if you need to stow your clothes and belongings. 

I would 100% stay there again...and again and again! If you want luxury, then stay at The Palazzo! It is a short walk from the busy part of the strip (Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, and Caesar's and Bally's) but, its not a far walk.",4,2,1

Things worked out in my favor since I had a business conference in town - however, I had NO desire to stay at the Flamingo where everyone else was at.  Since I had a ""happy birthday"" offer from The Venetian, I said, ""why not?"" and gave it a whirl.

Check-in was prompt - however my brother and the ""gaming"" crew quickly scooped me up and we started gambling like fiends.  The table games were fine - the felts were well maintained and chips didn't have the characteristic wear that other casinos have when they've been around for more than a couple of years.

We then went to one of the many restaurants in the shops area - not bad but service tended to be a bit slow.  Honestly, the Palazzo, in its quest to be a service oriented establishment, is having its growing pains.  Servers try too hard - some of them even end up tripping over each other and duplicating efforts when you ask for something.  But then again, better to be innundated than not at all.  The food quality was fine - nothing to complain about.

The suite was nice.  Great view (then again, I got an upgrade) when you raised the shutters and then the sunken ""lounge"" area was a nice touch.  Clean overall, the suite left me rested after many gambling and alcohol soaked nights.  Then again, this is Vegas, party up as long as you get your work done, right?

In my case booking the Palazzo guaranteed a newer room, slightly more SF, and a sleeper sofa in case you pickup a last minute friend or two wanting to crash.  One nice recent development is that the $25 resort fee (covering Wi-Fi and the gym area) is optional now versus it being a mandatory charge as it is for many other hotels on the Strip.  Pool access is included either way.  Nice touch.

My stay here wasn't perfect this past weekend.   Slightly mushy beds, a mysterio white (skeet?) stain on the sleeper couch which created a lot of laughs, and poor\/late cleanup room service.   Perhaps even the Palazzo is showing its age a bit.   But countering this is the summer room pricing, easy billing and checkout, great customer service (hello sundries!), spacious rooms, and parking situation which after a couple tries I found to be much easier to access the hotel\/casino than during my stays at the Venetian.

It's brand new, attached to the Venetian, and has the BEST shopping in the Shops at the Palazzo, not to mention the fabulous restaurants,( i.e. CUT, LAVO, Carnevino). The suites are all amazing. Brand new, great design, nice size. My favorite thing: the automatic blinds and the bathrooms. I always feel comfortable and taken care of here. I've stayed here twice and honestly it will probably take a lot to get me to stay anywhere else. 

Although, last time I was here there was a mix up at the check in desk. The guy must have been in training or something, he was extremely rude and really had no idea what he was doing. BUT besides that, I've always had a great time here and will continuously come back..

**I also have to mention, the pool is kind of weird, it's split up into at least 4 mini pools.. Not my favorite pool ever, but I'd rather go shopping instead anyways..",0,1,0

The Palazzo is stunning. Smoking. Sexy. Gorgeous. Beautiful. Amazing. Aweing. Jaw-dropping!

I think the fact that this hotel is new catches my eye a lot. We stayed here for two nights and got both nights comped. YAY for friends who gamble a LOT! It was really busy the weekend we went so there was a lot of traffic in and out of the Palazzo. I love how it's connected to the Venetian so you walk right on through, hit up Tao, get real drunk and somehow make your way back to your awesome suite here at the Palazzo.

Rooms. We got the Bella Suite View room with a view of the strip. We were on the 40 something floor so we could see the pools down below and the Treasure Island pirate show! Woot! The bathrooms to the room don't lock, so pervy friends can walk in and out of it, haha but who travels with pervy friends anyway? Let me comment about the rooms...

BATHROOM
Glass panel showers. Awesome pressure from the shower head. Regular sized bathtub. Toilet sectioned off by a door (that doesn't lock as well) and two sinks with vanity mirrors. There's also a small bench & mirror area by the door which is AWESOME for putting on make up. Yayuhhhh. Oh and did I forget to mention the flat screen TV in the bathroom? And two robes?

CLOSET 
Small, but who uses closets on vacation anyway? As long as there's enough room to hang up your party clothes then we're good to go. Ironing board and iron provided. 

SLEEPING QUARTERS
The queen sized beds were awesome! Very plush, clean, and good to jump on. Do jump on the beds when you come here. The 40 something inch TV screen that is in the bedroom is amazing. I could stare at it for days. Below the TV there's a counter top that lights up -- we made this into our mini bar. 

LIVING ROOM (sunken living room!)
Full size sleeper! I didn't discover this but the L shaped sofa could pull out into a sleeper. Even without pulling this out, you could definitely sleep 2 people on this L shaped couch. It was awesome. The coffee table is a bit big but way cushy. The TV in here is just as awesome as the TV in the bedroom section. The curtains to the big panel windows are powered electronically. We tried pulling it and it wouldn't budge, then we realized we had to control it with a remote (hahaha....)

Security is awesome. You can't take the elevators up to any of the towers unless you have their room cards or go with someone that has one. Security is pretty tight here so it's definitely not a place to mess around!

All in all, the Palazzo is awesome. Casino is decently sized and I didn't see any tables for under $15 (min hand). The shopping area in the Palazzo has some high end stores that I walked into and walked out empty handed since I don't have that disposable income to throw down 20g's on a watch, or something to that nature.

Don't forget to check out the huge waterfall in the Palazzo. Makes for an awesome picture. 

I'm coming back here in December! I think I'm going to dub this my new fav. hotel in Vegas.

I have stayed here before but haven't write a review. Palazzo suites are nice, newer, and offers more for your money. It's spacious enough to share with 1-2 girlfriends. 

Shower and bathtub are separated, 2 sinks in the bathroom and a make up area which is nice. 2 TVs in the bed area and the living area. 

The Palazzo is connected to the Venitian Hotel. They are the same group so if you are gamble, you can get points and credits on both properties.

However, the resort service is no where near MLife of the MGM group at the Bellagio. I got to earn credit in all their properties in Vegas and more in the US. My money stretches further with their program. The service for the VIP is the best.",10,3,8

This establishment was excellent. The rooms were spacious, and the service was also outstanding. 

I read many reviews about different hotels before I made my trip to vegas and what drew me to it was the television sets all over the place.

Pro:  The staff were all very polite.  
Con:  We needed the staff way more than we should have.  

For example, we're checking in and asking to have rooms near our friends' rooms, if possible.  If they had said, no, sorry, there isn't anything available, that would have been okay.  A bummer, but not their fault as they have no idea that we are part of a party,  But they said, sure, let's see what we can do.  Our check-in person was literally saying out loud, ""Oh, here's a room just down the hall, let me get that for you..."" then she had to click seventy buttons just to find out ""Oh, no, sorry, that room's gone to someone else.""  While I realize they are checking in 30 people at once, you'd think they can work into the system that another agent is working on a room and not let others book the room while it's being offered to another guest.  This happened 3 times.  We were ""upgraded"" to a ""Strip View"" room for the delay, but I'd rather have checked in within 5 minutes than 30.  Then to later find out stuff in the room was broken...

Pro:  The rooms were spacious and comfy.
Con:  Stuff was broken and wonky.

We didn't really need or use the suite aspect of the room - others in our group wanted to share rooms but we prefer to have our own.  It's too big for two people for just a weekend.  But we stayed there since the rest of our group was.  The room was really big and the bed was comfy.  We didn't really need that much space - we don't go to Vegas to hang out in the room!  But it was comfy and the tee vee had more than 20 channels which was nice.  

But weird stuff was broken and the lights were... this makes me sound stupid... confusing.  So about half of the electrical outlets didn't work, including 2 in the bathroom.  Which is difficult when you're a woman planning for a night out at Tao and need your styling aids.  And the hair dryer didn't work, which I discovered AFTER getting out of the shower - we had to wait 45 minutes for a replacement, which inconvenienced the prep for the aforementioned Tao outing.  

There is a master light switch near the door which turns on all of the lights in the room.  That's fine.  But finding the light switches for individual lights was really difficult.  I ended up just unplugging the bedstand light because I literally could not find the switch.  Then the next night it was plugged back in by the housekeeping staff apparently, and I couldn't figure out how to turn it on!  

As someone mentioned, the bathroom lights were weirdly dim, and the light in the toilet was maybe 30 watts.  

Plus the toilet had no fan... it's a hotel.  It's close quarters.  No matter how much you love your spouse, you need a damn fan in a separated toilet.  Just sayin'.

Pro:  The bars and restaurants were nice.
Con:  The clientele was... kinda dull.

The Palazzo seems to have an ""old"" clientele.  And I don't mean old in age, I mean old in attitude.  I'm a pretty mellow person and don't really consider myself a partier, but it's Vegas, godammit!  I want to stay out late, I want to drink some drinks, I want to have a good time!  The Salute Lounge is a piano bar next to the Jersey Boys theater - it's not the best dueling pianos on the strip but it was fine... the audience was fricken lame.  They just sat there without singing along or yelling or cheering or anything.  Then they closed at 1 AM.  Seriously?  Luckily the cool cocktail waitress (again, good staff) suggested we head over to the Venetian where one of the bars had a fun cover band until 3:30 AM.  But everything at The Palazzo was dead after midnight, including the casino.  

Beer:  Nothing too special on the casino floor\/casino bars, but hooray for Iburgers which offered not only craft beer on draft, but also spiked and ""very spiked"" milkshakes.  We didn't get to try FIRST Food & Bar, but they have an extensive bottled beer list, if a dull tap selection.",0,0,0

Lost our reservation.  But they could put us in the Fortuna suite, at a discounted rate.  OK.  Once in room, AC doesn't work.

1.  The rooms are spacious, luxurious and perfect for a romantic weekend or a group party.  Each room has a sunken living room with a TV and DVD player, a flat screen TV in front of the bed(s), another TV in the bathroom which has a separate shower and large bathtub (designed for tall people!). The bath amenities are those you'd expect in a high end spa, and there's even a digital scale.

2. Parking is easy.  Self parking is actually easier than valet parking and the elevator comes right to the casino floor in between the lobby and hotel elevators.

3. This casino doesn't feel like a casino.  The table games and slot machines are spread spaciously around the casino floor so it doesn't feel like they tried to pack in as many machines and people per square foot as possible.  It always feels roomy to me.

4. The attached mall has nice stores whether you are seriously shopping or just want to window shop.

5. Location!  The Fashion Show Mall is just caddy corner, the Wynn next door on one side and the Venetian on the other.  You are a short walk away from Caesar's Palace, Bellagio, Paris, etc.

6. Concierge and all other service is phenomenal.  When we were there for Thanksgiving weekend, our concierge not only recommend restaurants to us, he actually called and got copies of their special menus and made our reservations for us.  He also put us on the guest list for a few clubs as well.  The day before we left, he checked in for our flights and printed our boarding passes for us.

My expectations of a stay here were met and even exceeded in a major way. We had a comfortable, enjoyable four days in Las Vegas.

Since my family has grown, the traditional two-twin bed rooms are not cutting it.  So we need a suite - and we got an amazing deal online for a suite at the Palazzo. It was my first time getting a suite in Las Vegas and we were really impressed. 

Though the price was substantially more than an average hotel room on the strip, the value was definitely there. Everything about the room seemed elegant, luxurious, and tastefully appointed with a quasi-European style. The design of the suite is really unique as there is a ""step down"" in the middle of the room. The two queen beds plus a pull-out couch meant plenty of room for everyone.  There were two televisions, meaning that people could watch two different programs simultaneously.

The pools are also great.  There are several.  The Palazzo and the Venetian have a joint pool complex with at least six pools, including one fairly large shallow pool that is perfect for small children.  The area is quite large, meaning that there is plenty of room and it doesn't feel super crowded like some other pool complexes. Plus all of them are right next to the hotel towers and slightly raised above street level, meaning you have some pretty cool views of the Palazzo and Venetian towers, as well as some other nearby locations like the Mirage.  There are bars spread out amongst the pools, and there are also plenty of shady spots if you know where to look (major hint - ask the towel attendants, they know where all the good spots are)!  Overall this is one of the top pool complexes in Las Vegas. 

The Palazzo is also adjacent to the Grand Canal Shoppes, which is an upscale-style mall filled with unique shops and restaurants.  The architecture of the mall is the medieval-Venice style, with marble buildings and a canal where you can actually take gondola rides.  The indoor ceiling is a sky that changes color as the ""day"" passes, with about 10-to-15-minute intervals.  There is a model Fontana di Trevi in the center of the mall, with a few amazing restaurants around it.

Overall, the Palazzo is an upscale luxury hotel that is superior in many aspects to others in its price range.  Highly recommended!",33,30,31

We arrived about 8am on a Friday to the entryway bellhop telling us that check-in wouldn't be until 3, but guest services would hold our bags and we could go preregister. Lo and behold, the sweet lady at check-in granted our heart's desire for our room to be ready NOW. When we told her that our bags were stowed with guest services, she took our ticket, made a quick call and let us know that the bags would be up within 15 minutes. When we got up to the room, I figured we would be waiting at least 45... two minutes after opening the door, the front desk called to let us know a bellhop was bringing the bags at that moment. Two minutes from that moment, Carlos brought us our bags and even took our ice bucket to fill up. Yeah, he was tipped handsomely. :)
I shared my room with two other girls with PLENTY of room to spare... also, hella mirrors so no one had to wait\/fight for space when getting ready. Seriously, mirror when you walk in, three sets of mirrors in the bathroom, mirror next to the window... if you're a lady, you have options. The beds were amazingly comfy and sturdy (there's a ledge next to the beds that just invites you to use it as a launching pad... yep, I'm eight years old). The bathroom is gorgeous and I swear, I WILL have that vanity in my own home one day. Double sinks and plenty of counter space equaled all of our beauty products laid out like they for for sale... nice to not have to keep everything in bags and have to search when you're already pressed for time\/late to get somewhere.
In regards to the rest of the hotel's amenities available, the Palazzo offers plenty that we were thrilled about. Besides having its own pools (including Azure, the adult pool), restaurants, casino and shops, it is connected to its older yet still relevant sister, the Venetian... which meant we had another set of pools, more shops to spend at, more food options and another casino to lose our money at. :\/
Two of my not-so-favorite things... I understand that the bath products were complimentary and I am not a fan of complaining about free shizz, but seriously, Suave smells better than the stuff they provide. I ended up having to go to the Walgreens connected to the Venetian to get conditioner and lotion because I wasn't about to walk around smelling like potpourri from the 90's. Also, the TV's search option was on the fritz, so when it came to doing the express checkout, it took way longer than it should have (""express"" generally means quick, right?!).

The property is gorgeous and the entire hotel was very clean and the air quality inside was great with minimal smell of smoke as you walked through the casino. They really must spend a lot of money on air quality because there is a distinct difference between this hotel and the other popular hotels we walked through on the strip. There was zero smell of smoke on the room floors. We booked this trip last minute so we stayed only on floor 15 which had not been renovated yet (floors 25 and up have as they are in the process of renovating the rooms now). I was a bit disappointed at checkin but when we saw the room upstairs I was very surprised and happy that the room still was grand, large and very well kept. There was some mild wear on the bathroom granite but other than that it was a fantastic room. Thankfully the halls were quiet at night and you hardly ever heard any of your neighbors. The hotel is connected to the Venetian so you were easily able to walk along the indoor canal and shops\/restaurants that led to it's lobby casino.

I enjoyed my room there, while I don't know how much I needed it, the sunken living room was a nice touch. Service here is quite good. We had breakfast in our suite for two mornings, and they would come and set everything up. However, coming to collect the dishes afterwards was less prompt. Luckily we had a large room, so it didn't bother us so much. The room with a ""view"" has a view of the strip and the pool. However, you also see the airport, so maybe the otherwise that shows the golf courses may have been a better option. I am so glad there are non-smoking rooms, because it is difficult to breathe everywhere else in Las Vegas otherwise. Be aware that if you touch anything of the merchandise in the room, you may be charged, because there is a weight sensor (much like in Indiana Jones). The mini fridge was so hard to open, that we decided not to even use it, since everything in there has weight sensors as well!
The casino floor is like any other casino floor. I preferred the one at the Venetian, across the way, which, btw, has tutorials for craps, black jack and roulette for those who are new to these games. 
The Grand Canal shops are nice. Lots of luxury shopping choices, and tons of great eateries to choose from. It's a little easy to get lost, but luckily they have trained their security staff to be friendly and help you the instant you look lost.

i've stayed at the palazzo more often...i like the gambling better on this side and it's newer so the rooms seem a bit more modern then the venetian. however either or, whatever is comped i will stay! the rooms are all set up like the venetian. when you walk in there's a good size bathroom: a seperate shower and bath, two sinks, a bathroom, and a make up station :] WITH a tv which is great when you're getting ready or taking a bath :]

when you walk in you either get 2 queens or 1 king. there's a closet and yet again another tv. then theres a few stairs to the ""living room"" with couch (pull out bed) and 2 desks and yet another tv haha.

i would recommend everyone and anyone to stay here. it's a great place to stay and there's a bunch of things to do! you can seriously be happy staying at venetian and never stepping outside! (since it's connected to the venetian) also on the 2nd floor there's shopping and restaurants (connected to the venetian's shopping and restaurants as well). i've never been shopping there since i come to vegas to eat, party, drink, and GAMBLE!!! but the restaurants are great (well the one's i've been to) i've been to wolf gang puck's bistro, first food & bar, and sushi samba. all which are great (read my reviews!!!) also palazzo is home of LAVO night club and the venetian is home of TAO. 

another plus very close to fashion mall, mirage, bellagio, encore, wynn, and treasure island...also harrahs (carnival court FTW!) and imperial palace (ginseng 3, hash house a go go, and fat tuesdays yay!!!)

Unlike most of the hotels, you can easily grab an Uber or Lyft DRIVER on the far front right side of the drive-up entrance rather than having to try and find this particular access like most of the hotels which make you go through an entire maze; the point is this is to get a taxi because they make it entirely too difficult to get otherwise.  

The CASINO is vast in games and there are a few small bars to enjoy within.  

The MALL and FOOD COURT which connect the hotel with the Venetian are top notch (high-end) in products and service.

I'm an avid traveler and come to Vegas every 2-3 months and usually stay at the Wynn. Thought we'd give the Palazzo a try this time.

On top of all that, I have to lock my suitcase every day or whenever I am out of the room since housekeeping appears to have gone through all my belongings and rearranged all my toiletries after I specifically organized them a particular way. This is DEFINITELY not the Wynn. For the same price, I highly recommend the Wynn or Encore. Palazzo has been a major let down. No feather pillows and bed is hard as a rock. Shower has no water pressure and can't believe that staff went through my suitcase. Very disappointed.

The Good: 
*Room are spacious. There were a total of 5 girls in my group who stayed here and there was more than enough room.  The room had two queen beds and one couch that pulls into a bed. 

*There are 3 TV's in the room, so like most of the other yelpers stated, you can have 3 different parties in every ""room"".  

*We stayed on the same floor as Wayne Brady and he was such a nice guy!  He even helped one of the girls with her luggage and rode down the elevator with us. 

*Less smoky than the rest of the older Las Vegas hotels. 

The Bad: 
*Service was slooooow!  We ordered hot water - granted it was 3:30 AM but it took them 45 minutes to bring it to us.  

* Bathroom was small. When we were getting all dolled up for our night out - all 5 of us were fighting for vanity and mirror space.

*Who was the room designer?  I did not prefer the purple carpet with the funny design.

Sure, you barely spend time in the hotel room, ""but when I  do, I prefer ZZ"" (read: Dosh Zetas) because the Palazzo will treat you like you've worked hard enough not to pamper yourself. The blinds open at the push of a button on the bedside remote? check. The bathroom with separate door toilet? check, the DOWN comforter and pillows? check check. This is my third suite and compared to Cosmopolitan and The Signature at MGM, it's more for the adults 30-50's (doesn't mean though that is older looking, means it's higher class and you are the president of your own...apartment?). Cosmo for 20-35 y\/o, Signature for family or larger groups who prefer kitchenette. Choose wisely. 

The only silly thing? lifted up a pretzel box and got charged for the room for $8. Obviously it follows the fridge's law, do not move absolutely-anything-type of sensor, but come on. You put it there, all good looking candy in fancy boxes, I WILL lift and SEE...right??? you would too if you saw all those boxes all so nicely placed in front of the TV. (One of the TVs). Watching the FIFA games simultaneously in both TVs? check. The bed was exquisite and the whole room just clean, cool, comfortable. 

TAO nightclub is ok, been to LAVO before and it's ok too. Drinks at TAO club sucked (nasty) and were $15 each, i expected at least a tasty mL, no can do. 

The food at TAO was absolutely amazing. Incredible dishes, i couldn't have asked for more. The sea bass, spicy chicken and lobster\/kimchi fried rice were to die for. The filet mignon was just ok. Nice wine selection. The music was very loud for dinner time since the club was right upstairs.

1. The sheets on the bed are not soft. They feel scratchy and hard. The white comforter was not clean with spots and stains all over it. 
2. The t.v. took way too long to respond to the remote control. It was frustrating.

7. Warning- the ""refreshment center"" has an automatic electronic charging system. My boyfriend pulled something out to look at it and was charged $40. He called and they removed the charge.

Cons (few but worth mentioning): Sofa sleeper bedding wasn't supplied so had to request it. Also the mattress on it was so thin you felt every bar, very uncomfortable even for teens.

Their pool area is a great place to chill, get a couple of drinks, and soak up the sun. One little warning about the pool area: The Palazzo itself likes to block out the sun up until the late morning. Silly Palazzo, you should know better! So it's best to go to the pool area early in the afternoon when the sun comes out from hiding.

One other little warning: There's always a security guard near the guest room elevators that checks for your key card. But don't fret, my friends. If you have a big group with you (like I did), you just need to flash one or two key cards and they'll let everyone through. They're pretty cool about it.

I would love to stay here again during another Vegas trip...and I probably will!",5,4,3

They just added a whole new string of stores to the casino area.  They have a huge mall in the middle of the two casinos.  I don't know why they couldn't put those in that area and add more gambling.  The few good machines are always taken.  Not to mention, I am Gold Level player.

First of all, the casino and surrounding areas here are gorgeous. I don't gamble often but walking through the casino and lobby areas was a nice to look at every morning. The design is gorgeous and they keep everything very clean. 

As far as the hotel goes, it still keeps that luxury feel but it did fall short in a few areas.  If you are used to staying in chain hotels for business you are going to miss some of the amenities.  They do not have in the room: Coffee, Fridge, Dresser, or Microwave. These are all standard things in a cheap Marriott or Hilton and it was disappointing that they were not included with the room. Also, the closet in here is very small, expect to keep your clothes in your suitcase throughout your stay here.

The most frustrating part about the room is that the internet didn't work for 3 nights of my 5 night stay. I needed internet to work and not having it available in a $250 room is a bit ridiculous. When calling the front desk twice a day they responded by saying that the internet was out throughout the entire tower. I know several others who had internet within the Palazzo with no issue. For this reason I really couldn't give the Palazzo 4 stars.

Ultimately, the hotel is designed to get you out of the room and onto the casino floor. 

The fitness center in the Palazzo is a bit small but it was able to accommodate a quick daily workout. I was told that the fitness center in the Venetian is substantially bigger.

Although this place is gorgeous, for the price I expected a bit more from this place.",2,0,1

However, if you think they are even in the same category, you are sorely mistaken, my friend.  It's ok, I made this mistake as well.  I was tasked with planning a vacation for a group of friends, and we had a few poor people in the group, so I picked the Palazzo over the Encore because it was about $130 cheaper a night.  When I opened the door to my room, there were stains on the headboard area of the bed.  The marble separator between the bedroom and living area had stains that could not be washed out as well.  The walls were scuffed somewhat badly.  
When we arrived, we did not receive our baggage for almost an hour.  We realized that this was because they gave us a ticket and did not tell us that we had to call the front desk and tell them the number on the ticket before they'd bring it to our room.
When we asked for a humidifier, they gave us a broken one.  When we asked to get it fixed, the service man told us that they all were like that (implying that we didn't know how to use it).  We left it on overnight, and the water level did not go down at all.  The next day, they admitted it was broken and we got another one that worked.   
When we asked for champagne flutes, they did not have any.  Only wine glasses -- and again, it took almost an hour to get them.  We had to call twice to get them because we asked for 8 and they said we could only order 4 per room.  We had to call them the second time to tell them that we had 2 rooms (which should have been obvious since they were both under the same name).  
Worst of all, the showers did not always have hot water.  After a long and dirty night of nightclubbing, we came back to take cold or barely lukewarm showers.  I imagine this is what Sheldon Adelson enjoys doing.  I did this for 3 nights in a row.
One of my friends enjoyed a rib eye at the Grand Lux in the Venetian.  He had diarrhea attacks all day the next day and had chills as he was shivering on the toilet.  I was deterred from using the toilet the next day, as he had laid uneven splatters of excrement on the back of the seat.  I had to use the toilet in our other adjacent room.  
Lastly, the beds were beds for short people.  If you are anywhere near 6ft tall, your feet will hang over the edges uncomfortably.  I would recommend this hotel if you are a poor midget.  Overall, I got the impression that Mr. Adelson had let his American properties wane in order to focus on the real moneymaking Asian properties -- something that I would believe Steve Wynn (Weinberg) would never do.",1,0,0

Let me preface my review by saying hubby and I have always stayed here when we visit Las Vegas.  Our previous stays have been stellar and we thought service was always great.

Check-in went quickly and was very pleasant.  We were just glad to be there after being on the road for 5 hours. First thing we noticed, however, was the casino was noticeably smokier!  But we decided to ignore in our exuberance at being in LV finally.

The problem came when we went to pull out the bed in the pull-out and noticed the sheets were dirty and there was a MAGGOT on it.  Hubby immediately closed it back up and I called the front desk.  I described our situation very calmy and the person went ahead and comped our resort fee of $17 for our entire stay (3 days).  

About 30 minutes later, someone came by and asked if we had requested pull-out bed service.  I said SURE...and he proceeded to pull the bed back out, smooth out the sheet, brushing the maggot discreetly into the crevices beneath the couch.  I had to interrupt him and tell him we needed the sheet changed at which time he mumbled something about getting someone else to come and do that.

Long story short, it took almost 3 hours and 4-5 phone calls to get someone to change our sheet.  The maid ended up getting to our room at 2:30AM!!

Other gems:  TV remote didn't work.  Bath products were downgraded to a stinky smelling non-brand, it took some significant ranting to get a measly $100 in comps for our troubles and the pool area was dirty & smelly.  

We were laying out by the pool when we looked down and noticed a floating pool of puke-like substance at the edge of the pool, accessorized with plastic drink cups, straws and napkins.  We flagged a guy down who very snottily said he would get someone to come by and clean it up.  He didn't.  I caught someone else who actually looked at the mess and was equally grossed out by it.  That was the only way it got cleaned up!  It also took us an hour or so to finally order a drink...we got blown off by the cocktail server a couple times.

With all the other options available in Vegas now, I'm not sure if patronage will continue here at The Palazzo.",8,7,2

I checked in at 2:30am on Saturday morning of the Presidents' Day weekend, but Vegas seemed relatively slow overall since it's still the cold season.  Tried the $20 trick and got offered an upgrade a Luxury Suite with a strip view (from a Luxury Suite without one I think?).  Honestly, I'm not entirely sure we got an upgrade but the Palazzo is such a nice hotel that it really didn't matter.  We were moved to the 38th floor with a view of the strip.  The guy asked me if I wanted change for the tip and I declined.  The skeptic in me wonders if the trick actually worked as I'm not sure what the alternative would have been, but I'll just say that ignorance is bliss because I was totally satisfied with our 38th floor, strip view room.

The Room:
I don't know how much say that would help anymore than has been said already.  Check the website for the room tours.  I will say that we comfortably slept four people in our room with one king.  For non-sleeping purposes, we hosted a 15 person pre-party before the club and everyone was comfortable.  Our room did not have anywhere to hook up an iPod or mp3 player.  Apparently some have them, ours didn't and that was a minor disappointment as it seems like that's a fairly basic amenity these days, but not a big deal.

The Casino:
I honestly didn't gamble much here but early morning (4am on Saturday) three of us talked an open craps table to lower the minimum for a few new players and the staff was exceedingly nice in helping us learn how to bet in order to get the best odds.  No beginner's luck for me unfortunately but it was still very nice (and profitable) of them to lower the minimum bets and teach us how to play.

The Environmentalism:
The hotel is LEED Silver Certified which means a lot to me as a LEED AP.  Basically this means that the hotel has gone above and beyond in construction and operation in terms of material, water, and energy efficiency.  I honestly didn't notice anything groundbreaking in my room outside of the master off switch at the door, but I suppose that makes it all the more impressive that the accommodations are just as luxurious while being environmentally responsible.  

The Verdict:
I'm sold.  The basic suite seems like overkill for just one or two people unless you are planning on entertaining a group.  But if I am bringing 4-6 people or hosting a pre-party, the Palazzo is going to be my new go-to hotel in Vegas.",0,1,0

Seriously, i don't think any other hotel offers a suite as SWEET as the Bella. Fits 6 comfortably, spacious, 3 Flat screen televisions (including 1 in the restroom!). Customer Service is on point when it comes to replenishing towels, wine glasses, pillows, blankets, etc. i definitely recommend the Palazzo\/Venetian to everyone! =) This place takes you away as if you're really in Italy! (not that i've been but architect wise the buildings are amazing)  The Gondola rides located at the Grand Canal shoppes is a very romantic ride, overlooks those who are dining & or shopping & a PLUS My girlfriend was proposed to on the Gondola Ride back in 2009 :)",0,0,0

I'm sure the fact it was my birthday didn't hurt our chances either. Sweet clerk upgraded us to a high floor with a strip view directly across from Treasure Island so money well spent.. It's absolutely beautiful,. opulent in fact, each room is a ""suite"" with a sunken living room in addition to a awesome bathroom with separate shower and HUGE tub. Typical upscale Vegas accommodations really. Service on the other hand sucked for lack of better word. We arrived Sunday and didn't get our room serviced until Tuesday after I called down to the front to complain. What pissed me off though was on Monday around 4pm I saw whom I assumed was some sort of housekeeping supervisor per her uniform and ""attitude"" walking past our room after I stuck my head out of our room to ask when we'd get fresh towels, etc. I was polite and asked her if she could tell me when we'd expect to see housekeeping and Miss-Thing didn't even make eye contact with me nor slow down when she replied ""I really don't know"". The hotel seems to be short staffed by what we could see and overall seemed to be the common attitude of so many of their staff. Snooty and irritated to be asked to help. Restaurants were good but expensive (will write separate reviews on Lavo, I Love Burgers Grand Lux Cafe, Del Toro and Dos Caminos), weather was unseasonably chilly so we didn't get to use the pool much but it was beautiful. AND they charge you an extra $19 per day for some BS ""resort fee"" for their Internet and workout room access regardless of whether you'd use it or not which we didn't (sorry I don't schlep a laptop with me on vacation and the only workout I get while on vacation is my right arm lifting a martini glass!) We usually come back from LV with a little in our pockets, not at the Palazzo. Hubby swears casino's can control how tight and loose their machines are and I believe that after this last visit. Slots were TIGHT but I guess while they're called a ""one armed bandit""? Also, very smoky in the casino. We've been to most of the hotels on the strip in our visits to LV but I'm not sure that we'd stay here again due to the overall a-hole attitudes of many of the staff.

3) Platform between the bedroom and sunken living room. Good for resting your luggage on, sitting on, or dancing on ;)

I stayed here for a couple nights with a big group of friends. We had two connecting suites which made it super convenient. The rooms were huge! I loved the sunken living room with its comfy couches. And there's TVs in every room!

The bathroom was pretty spacious with a tub, glass shower, two sinks, and a little vanity area perfect for getting ready! There was even a flat screen TV in there! I also liked how the toilet was in a separate small room on its own so even if you're using it, other people can still use the rest of the bathroom to get ready. Very convenient. 

The 2nd floor has all the shopping and restaurants. It's also connected to the Venetian which is nice and convenient.

They have one of the best spas and fitness centers in Vegas with even a rock climbing gym. It's pretty expensive though and I would say it's not worth it unless you're a work-out machine who HAS to work out even on vacay. 

All in all, the Palazzo is amazing! Modern, clean, spacious, luxurious. I would definitely stay here again! It's especially perfect for groups! It's also an ideal location since it's located near the middle of the strip. :)",7,4,4

The palazzo hotel is a wondrous architectural edifice.  Inspired by ""Palazzo Vecchio"" in Florence, Italia, this contemporary palace is the modern day equivalent to Vecchio's palace during the 12th century filled with grandeur chandaliers, boutique fashionistas, cafes, and the lively connection to Venetia. The silly river attraction is supposed to be the miniature version of Venice, Italia's canals. After all venetian means venice or of venice hence the superiority of venetian operas, art, and cultures... Not to be mistaken by thr filthy, abhorrent, repulsive culture of Venice beach, CA.

Paris is supposedly lover's lane yet i argue venetia or florencia is. If vegas is the equivalent representation of such, then, palazzo y venetian is by far the choice destination where as paris paris, and new york new york lacks splendor. 

The atriums, and balconies provide an enchanting experience at night. While placed in the nucleus of the strip, the boundaries offer a unique plethora of varying magnetism. On one side is treasure island and the attractions of swashbuckling. Yet the divergence is bellagio water spectacle. The auditory senses will be enticed with opera, passionate italian prose, to lively carribean music, with club electronica tunes blasting away.

The palazzo is just a unique hybrid of classy cultures to rebellious sentiments... Upon reflection palazzo is the microcosm of Las Meadows de the Desert which in essence is microcosmic of the world.",10,10,13

I've stayed at the Venetian, TheHotel, Hard Rock, new tower at Caesars, and many others and being at a brand new hotel actually worth the money was a nice change.  While i love TheHotel, the prices are getting out of control, and i feel that the Palazzo room can compete.

There are 3 TVs in the room, a small flat screen in the bathroom, and two in the suite, the first facing the sleeping area and the second in the lower lounge area.  The sitting area is the most impressive with a large L-shaped couch with enough space to seat at least 6 and a nicely sized dining table with 4 chairs.  In the corner is a small desk and chair.

The hotel itself has great restaurants and is attached to the Venetian for even more variety.  The Palazzo shops continue to expand upon the introduction of the first and only Barney's in Las Vegas. 

The only downside to this property is that I couldn't determine if it had it's own pool.  We walked to the Venetian pool, which was quite a trek through the maze of the Canyon Ranch Spa.

Safe available in the room to put your belongings in, nice little perk I haven't seen at other casinos before.

Room service was pretty attentive, got extra towels and blankets relatively fast. Gal cleaned the room real good after someone had destroyed it the night before.

Morning of checkout, it took a good 20 minutes to get someone on the phone to help us out. They charged us $5 or so for water that we did not drink, but they gladly took those charges away. Liked the location of this hotel because we spent most of our nights over at Wynn\/Encore.",2,2,2

Yes, you get the multiple flat screen televisions, decent beds, marble bathrooms.  On the other hand, if you have stayed at the Wynn or the Bellagio, you will be disappointed.  For a Girls' Weekend Getatway, 10 of us chose the Palazzo (prestige) because it offered all suites. We, of course, wanted to have a great time, common areas where we could all commune in (drink, dance, do makeovers, whatever).  The layout of the Bella suites is odd in that you walk into and through the bedroom to get to the living room. I've never seen that before. That wasn't a big deal though.  The two things that are hilarious \/ annoying is the technology.  Evidently, when the last Holiday inn closed down, the Palazzo ran their cheap asses down to the auction to buy all of that hotel's old crap.  The telephones in the room will qualify as antiques. No exaggeration (will post pics).  There is also a huge, 1980-style fax machine for your use. No huge deal--with a shot or two of tequila, they came a huge running joke. BUT--the big deal for us was that there is no place to plug in your Ipod.  I travel a lot. Even the basic hotels, now have an alarm clock that you can set your ipod on. They have a spot for you to play a CD --really? a cd? hell, why not an 8-track? It's 2012 folks at Palazzo. 30% of people Nationwide use ipods.That statistic is even greater when you just factor in people who take at least one vacation per year.  An ipod dock is a standard amenity that travelers have come to expect--particularly travelers who are possibly coming to party with friends.  To their credit, the Palazzo was nice enough to allow us to rent a huge boombox for $35 a day. So, on top of our $469 room, we had to add $35 a day to be able to listen to a little Rhianna while we got dressed to go dancing at night.  David, the manager with whom I spoke at the Palazzo thought that this was absolutely fair.  Really, David? Penny-wise, pound-foolish, my friend: we had 4 suites, 9 women who come to Vegas twice per year--better customer service could've meant repeat business. But hell--you got your $70.00. 

Remember, your first or second apartment, where you are just trying to 'make do?""  You take your parent's old tv from the basement, your older sister's old stereo system until you can save enough money to get some new stuff. That's how the Palazzo felt. The room was decent enough, the amenities, seemed as if during a budget meeting, some bigwig told the IT department that he had to 'make do.""  So some poor middle manager was spent hours on ebay and at hotel auctions trying to 'make do.'  I, as a frequent visitor to Vegas will tell you that there are far better choices than the Palazzo.  There are many hotels that aren't trying to 'make do' and won't ask you to either.",1,1,0

We made small talk as she asked me whether I wanted a high floor or low floor, a room with a King or 2 queen beds, a smoking or non-smoking room.  I answered low floor, king near the elevator, non-smoking.  I received my keys and she showed me on a map to the elevators.

I got to the bank and I see I'm on the 42nd floor.  OK, maybe this is the lowest she could get me with a King, non-smoking near the elevator.  I took the extremely quiet and effortless elevator ride and got off on 42.  I immediately noticed I was nowhere near the elevators.  Instead I was at the end of the hall.  OK... not that far to walk.  I put my key in the room and enter and immediately notice it's 2 Queen beds, not the king I requested.  OK... not a big deal.  How much space do I really need.  And who knows... maybe I'll have a friend stay in town from LA while I'm here, and now they have a place to crash.  No big deal.

I also notice that the room is huge.  2 beds and a few steps down to a sunken living room, complete with L-shaped sofa, coffee table, a medium-sized dining table and a work desk, complete with fax and printer.

I also noticed that the credenza was moved like somebody was trying to get to the switch behind it.  I also noticed 2 moths flying around the room, bouncing into the lights and pictures in the room.  I noticed that the room doesn't have a laundry bag so I can store my dirty clothes.  And it's hot!  Nothing like entering a hotel room that is nearly as hot as it is outside.  And today, in Vegas it was about 99 degrees.  I turn on the air and decide it's time to checkout the bathroom to take a leak.  The toilet seat nearly falls off!

I plugged in and the wi-fi and internet is $9.95 per day, so I'm using my own Sprint card to post this.

For the price my company is paying for me to stay here, and for the quality of what I expected walking in the door, I'm pretty unimpressed with my first impression.  I've already put a call into maintenance, and they say they'll send somebody up quickly to address the moth, but it may not be until tomorrow morning to move the credenza or tighten the toilet.  They offered to move me, but I'm already unpacked and settled in for the night.  I'm not moving unless it's right next door, and they can't promise that.

Maybe I'll post an update.  Pretty unimpressive so far.",1,1,2

I never stayed at this place because normally it's a 5 Star, Super Expensive Hotel, like the Wynn or Caesar's. But Michael Woods was DJ-ing at the Lavo Club during my business trip (when I stayed at the Imperial) and it was just next door. So Eric and I decided to check it out. We had dinner reservations at the Lavo restaurant, started with a glass of wine which cost $15\/glass... (BTW, we decided to have dinner because it saved us $50 on cover charge to the club, so something to consider if you want to do the same) The bartender poured us a FULL glass in a nice, big wine glass, so I felt like I paid for 2 servings. BTW, Lavo means 'to cleanse' in Latin... which was interestingly true to its name, based on my dining experience which I'll explain shortly.
I was amazed at the decor... Stunning, Chic, Exotic, Upscale... Sexy... with Great sound system. Very nicely done ( And I am kind of hard to please...)  Reminded me of Tao at the Venetian but classier (is the right word?) There were a good mix of people, very well dressed (90% were) from early 30s to mid 50s. It was a Tuesday night but the place was packed! I found out later that the Palazzo had a great promotional room rate for $120 a night, when the rates are $250 +. Had I known about this sooner, I wouldn't have minded staying there on my last night... Hopefully they'll keep offering great deals in the future.
Anyway, we waited about 15 minutes before we were escorted to our table, which wasn't too bad. 
Our server was I have to say the hottest looking one there... but he wasn't the most social one I've met. Okay, now for the fun part.... the Food.
Well, I went with the margherita pizza and Eric ordered spaghetti with Kobe meat balls (highly recommended by our server) and we split a house salad. We were served garlic bread supposedly 'compliments from the chef'.... isn't bread supposed to be 'free' anywhere? 
My favorite thing to eat that night...? The Salad. 
I was disappointed at the pizza... it was thin crust but it was dry and way too much garlic on it. So was the bread.... Beware. If you are Not a Garlic Fan (BTW, i am one but except for Kimchi, I usually cook the garlic!) just try a small piece. My breath smelled garlic all night, but that's not the worst part.... about 2 hours later, I was running for the bathroom and I was in and out at least 4 times. Good thing the bathroom wasn't too crowded that night. The food just ran right through me.... It was the Raw Garlic on my bread and Salty Pizza and Meatballs that did it... the gallon of water and tea I downed all night didn't help either. I should have known better. But I ate most of my pizza because I didn't want to waste a $18 meal... and I helped Eric with one of his Kobe meatballs.... it was a $30 plate... but They were Huge! It was hard for both of us to finish the food since it was a good serving. My take on the Kobe meatballs? Disappointing. They were tender and I could tell they were made from Kobe beef... but they were way too salty. Yes, my homemade regular turkey meatballs taste way better. 
Anyway, my point is All the Food (at least that night I was there) was Way too Salty and Garlicky. And keep in mind, Garlic and Salt are natural remedy for Diarrhea.... Sorry I hope you're not eating while reading this... :-O
Back to my evening at the Lavo... Palazzo
The club opens at 11pm during the week and at 10pm on weekends... so we had an hour to spare after dinner. So we decided to walk around. Here's the best part. The entire casino was Smoke Free!! Wow, it was such a different experience to be in a casino in Vegas that didn't smell like cigarettes! (BTW, you can smoke at the Lavo Club, but the ventilation there is really great, so it wasn't too bad)
So, as we were walking around, Eric encouraged me to play a 5 cts poker machine. So we picked one and put a $20 bill in it.... Are you ready for this?
In the second hit, I got 4 Aces!!!!!!!!! I Won $130!
Okay, here's the BIG TIP. You HAVE TO BET MAXIMUM, NO MATTER WHAT YOU PLAY IN ORDER TO WIN ANYTHING, ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT TO WIN BIG. PERIOD.
So I said well, I'll just spend the rest of my $20 and we will cash out.
Guess what?! On my 5th hit, I got another 4 Aces!!!!!!!! Anyway, I walked out of the casino with $225 cash so it basically paid for our whole evening and room. Yeah!!
The Lavo Club was really nice. It was not a big place, but I prefer intimate clubs like that. Sound system and lighting were amazing! The musics loud, but it's one of the clubs that you can have a conversation with the person next to you!  
There was a good crowd of people that night and we stayed from 11pm - 2am... Michael Woods didn't start till 1am, but we enjoyed his music for about an hour and walked back to our hotel. There you have it! 
So, If it weren't for the food, I would have rated 5 stars for this place! I would definitely want to check out the casino, maybe stay there sometime, if the rates are good ... and Play my Machine again! :-)",1,0,1

Pool - we spent two days at the pool and generally had an excellent time. It would be nice if there were more offerings that didn't have club music and were also 18+.

For sure there are definite upside to staying here like the All Suite hotel and incredible size of the suites.  If you have stayed at the Venetian, this is the sister hotel that is almost identical but instead of the over the top Italian decor it is modern to modern art deco.  

The Palazzo is connected to the Venetian by a great mall and spectacular art water fall display.  The shops are upper class but lack some of the bigger names.  All in all this a definitely a top 10 hotel on Vegas but when I stayed (3 nights) it was not finished.  I had problems with the closet door not shutting and some lighting issue I'm sure they have since figured out.

The Lavo club is unique in that it is a bath house\/restaurant\/club.  The casino is nice since it is away from the hotel portion, but small.

We had a suite (forgot the name) but it was around 1300 square feet. We were located on the 37th floor. The room was very nice.

I came here for a bachelorette party.  We had two connected Bella Suites.  Initially, it started out fine.  They took our luggage and said they would bring it up.  We were upgraded to a strip view for free.  We went upstairs the rooms were big and very nice.  They have an extra vanity in the mirror and we faced Treasure Island.  

Then we waited for our luggage. And waited.  My friend asked if she could use my iPhone charger.  ""It's in my luggage. Where is our luggage?!""  I wanted to take a nap and more importantly, I needed my medicine.  It took about 45 minutes for our luggage to arrive.

Concierge was a hopeless line.  After calling twice and being put on hold for a good 5-10 minutes, I gave up.  I realized even if I reached them, I didn't trust them to change my reservation.

Oh yeah, I did try to change my dinner reservation myself but the service here was so bad.  I never could get the navigation thing to work even though it worked in other hotels.  If you have AT&T, this is not the hotel for you.

We called for hangers.  It took about an hour. Also the wallpaper was peeling in our bathroom.  Ok, it didn't ruin my trip, but I really wondered why housekeeping never did anything about it.  

When I told my boyfriend later, he responded: ""they don't care"" and I really think that was the theme.  They don't really care about their guests.

The pool was nice enough.  I've reviewed Lavo as a club before. The casino and hotel overall is small. The location is good and I like the Shops at Palazzo.  (The sales associates were all really nice except at Christian Louboutin where they wouldn't give us the time of day.) 

I liked the walkway to the Wynn because um...the Wynn\/Encore is far superior to this place. 

I stayed at Encore last year and the service is much better and I like the decor much more.  The colors in Encore are nice, they have better clubs and the Wynn buffet is nearby.  They have doorbells and put your name on your phone and card.  They have better carpet and it just feels newer and more well-maintained.

You might think I'm nitpicking here.  I still gave this place 3 stars, but look...those rooms were not cheap.  This is a 5 star hotel and there are far superior 5 star hotels less than a mile away. Unless, I needed a lot of space, why would I come back when I could be at the Wynn, Encore, THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay, The Cosmopolitan etc instead?

With the exception of the noise in the next room on a daily morning basis (roughly around 9) that sounded like a mad housekeeper (which were none on our floor at the time) very strange.
There are pros and cons to every place in Vegas, with that said when customers go to gamble which is what Vegas is well known for they would like to be waited on by the gaming casino bar staff which there weren't many we saw in any of the slot gaming areas. There seemed to be more around the poker, roulette, card gaming section and we literally not ONCE had anyone offer us a drink and this place had no issues taking my cash ($500 +).

PRO:
- The suite is big. The decor seems to reflect some decent investment
- location location location
- some folks are really nice (front desk, bell man) and aim to please

- Attention to details: i can clearly see the strek mark on the marble (someone cleaned it but not really fully). for a 5 star... that seems like a miss. 
- Cleaniness - there was hair ... HAIR in the bath tub (its very obvious.. cant miss it!) and even stickers on the wall of bathroom. (ew). The glasses in the hotel room looks yucky too.
- Furniture took some abuse. Looks like someone sneeze into the couch and it tried (ew ew)
- Service - We were waiting at LAVO to get in. The host pretty much ignore us for 5 mins despite we were right in front of her. She just kept talking to her server. Also, the manager(?) came by close to mid nite and says ""Someone opened a bottle and I need this table now, I will buy a round"". Ehhhh We can pay for my own drink.

When we tried to go to the Prestige cocktail service, they wouldn't let us in with outside food, understandably.  But they refused to hold our pizza box and were quite rude about it.  So we never went to cocktails.  
The shops were nice, but the employees were terribly rude.  The girls at Christian Louboutin were more interested in trying on the shoes themselves rather than help us.  In another clothing store, we asked the name of the designer of a dress, and the clerk said ""That dress is $4500"".  That's funny, we didn't ask the price, we asked who made it.

The elevators are really fast.

My biggest complaint is that when we ordered towels, a blanket and extra pillows, it took 1.5 hrs to receive, which was so long that even the Priority Card center called in to check on us to make sure we received. What made it worse was that when I called in after 45 minutes of waiting, the housekeeping lady that picked up claimed I only called in 20  minutes ago, but that was actually just the time she decided to put in my order. This made us miss meeting our friends at another casino, which obviously ruined our experience.

The all-suite hotel has rendered quite a reputation since then. It's managed to outshine it's sister hotel, The Venetian. Whenever I hear about large groups of friends planning a trip out to Vegas, the main place to stay at is The Palazzo. The rooms are spacious, can fit 6-8 comfortably, and is centralized by the hottest places to be on the strip. Perhaps we got the ""grand opening kinks"", but hopefully they've worked out the low-pressured shower heads. I still have to wonder why our room wasn't given a tub.

Fine dining accommodations include famous chefs such as Mario Batali, Wolfgang Puck, and Emeril Lagasse. However, if you're looking for a scrumptious meal without having to throw down a big one, a more casual venue like First Food & Bar or Grand Lux Cafe may be more suitable. 

My favorite part of this hotel has got to be the pool. Dip yourself and even dip your lounge chair.

Check in was okay, they have a separate area for Platinum members and I got to skip the VERY long line at check in.  Otherwise was pretty sure I would have been there at least a half an hour.

My front desk agent was decent, but not the best, he offered to waive the $25 resort fee which was nice and he upgraded me to a strip view suite.  Sounds nice right?  Except that I had paid for the rate that included an upgrade and I had to remind him I was entitled to one.  He was trying to charge me $40 for the upgrade...whoops...
My check in guy also forgot to give me my free breakfast vouchers which I was again entitled to because of the rate that I paid.  I had to come down the next day to get the vouchers and the front desk agent had no problem giving them to me.

The walk to the room...I am a non smoker, and I just wish that I didn't have to walk past that stanky casino room floor to get to my room.  Yuk.

The rooms, ok the rooms are awesome, you will see in the pics that I upload.  They are seriously great.  Lots of space to spread out.  The bathroom is beautiful marble covered everything.  The beds are super comfortable and you have all the channels you could want on the two lcd tvs.  

The pools are kinds meh, I didn't check out the venetian pools but the Palazzo pools aren't very special.  They are more like oversized kiddie pools.  Also the pools open early and close early.  Why would they do that?  I guess they want people gambling lol this is vegas.  

The Grand Lux cafe (the spot that I got my free breakfast vouchers for) was awesome.  Their breakfast buffet is great and they are so nice there.  They let me stuff a huge to go box with food to bring up to my room.  Who does that?

In summary, nice room, nice cafe, kiddie pools and stinky casino.  everything is about what i would expect from vegas but the rooms are really special.",4,0,0

It boasts the largest room on the strip at 750 sq ft. At a great rate of $149 for summer weeknights, you really shouldn't stay anywhere else. We arrived early at 11am and they happily allowed us to check in. It is nice and quiet, easy to navigate, great security by the 16 elevators. It connects to the Venetian and the best part is there is a Walgreens on the bottom floor! We ate at Grand Lux Cafe, I love burgers, and First Bar and Grill and Shake and Burger (for breakfast in the food court). See my reviews on each restaurant separately. If you like pastries, which I usually don't but my husband loves, there is this chocolate twist pastry in the cafe on the 2nd floor near the elevators. It is like a long rectangular shaped pastry, not sure exactly what it looked like. It's very overpiced but it was the most moist, delicious chocolate pastry I've ever had in my entire life. I ate half and the next day it was still moist and delicious (which is uncommon of any pastry!) We also went to the Canyon ranch spa and cafe.

First, the rooms are very nice, but can get dusty very quickly. I understand this given the environment and weather but there should be better filtration and circulation to alleviate this issue. Also, getting items brought up to the room can take a lifetime!! We called for towels twice and waited over an hour the first time only to be told that the towels had been ""dispatched"". The room service rates are absurd but that's par for the course in Vegas. In addition, they like to tack on miscellaneous ""extras"" to your bill so be sure to check it and finalize it BEFORE you leave. 

The positives are clearly the location and the shopping. The Palazzo is centrally located to just about everything and has a lot to do onsite. If you stay definitely get an upgraded room\/suite.

Fantastic.

In a world of poor attitudes and poor service, Palazzo is filled with can-do staff. Every contact we had was with a staffer who literally went above and beyond their job.

Yes:
Gorgeous room, upgraded to a strip view for our special occasion.
Exemplary concierge service.
Great selection of pools.
Top-notch staff at every level.

Not so Yes:
Time to allow the room printers to run on Bluetooth. It's a hassle to ask the concierge to print something from an iPad.
Someone needs to check the towels at the pool - way too many holey\/old towels.

The Palazzo is still a great place to stay, but they'll need to stay alert. There are slight signs of wear and tear. A great place today is a so-so place tomorrow.

I am a player here (not THAT kind of player....come on now) and used to get quite a few comp offers to stay at Palazzo.  According to my favorite bartender who makes me the BEST cosmos at the center bar next to the gift shop, the players club ""scaled back"" on comp offers a bit ago.  That was unfortunately because I don't ever pay for a hotel room in Vegas and had to go elsewhere where I was offered comps.  The suites are just so much nicer and larger than your ""traditional"" Vegas room.  Love the decor and everything about it.

Well, I'm happy to say that I have a comp for this 4th of July weekend at Palazzo and will be staying at Palazzo the next 3 days.  I plan on my regular ""circuit"" while there: Check in and sniff up the Palazzo aroma in the air, stop by the center bar for cosmo on way to room, immediately head back down and hit the tables, head up to floor 23 for some afternoon cocktails\/apps around 5ish and then finish up the night gamblling and having fun.

Good value for the money, all rooms are suites with either king or 2 queen beds.  If you have kids or disability, they have quite a few ADA-compliant ones where the living room isn't sunken and the shower is a bit bigger.

Upon checkin or reservation, ask for a high floor and near the elevator, this is a gigantic property and if you get a room at the end of the hall way, it's a trek.  No bad views if you can get above the 15th floor.

Great food on the property and at the adjoining Venetian, I recommend Bouchon for a moderately priced breakfast or Brunch, Otto for a nice Italian lunch, and Carnevino for a good steak.  The theme of the Palazzo is European and a little less in-your-face Italian as at the Venetian.

Great place for special events (bachelor\/ette parties, birthdays, etc) and it has a wow-factor for your friends or dates who haven't been there, they have some dramatic 2-story fountains at the check in and entrance from Venetian shops and the basic bella rooms have 2 big LCDs and a little one in the bathroom as well as the remote-controlled curtains.  The smell of the casino is really the trademark (details: http:\/\/sandsconfidential.com\/2011\/07\/20\/1538\/).

Gaming is decent:
On slow days\/nights, they have $10 craps and $25 two-deck blackjack that pays 3:2.  Sportsbook is pretty good, it's run by Cantor gaming, so they should let you make some big moves and get pretty decent lines.  Legasse's Stadium is OK, I'll let you read those reviews on that yelp page.

If you are going to do any nominal amount of gambling, sign up for Grazie, they are pretty generous in their offers to return to Vegas and feel free to ask if they'll take anything off of your bill upon check out (call casino marketing on morning of checkout).  They have a pretty easy process for opening a line of credit which starts at $2,500 if you want to avoid big cash transactions or just want to look cool, there's an online application.

Service here is outstanding and the rank and file staff make a conscious effort to impress the customer.  If you need extra towels, just grab them from the maid carts or if you see them, ask.  Having them brought up can take a little while and you're kind of obligated to tip.  They usually only have 2-4 towels in the bathroom so if you're budget a$$ is rolling 6-deep, don't make a stink about it.

Pool is on the spa floor, usually with plenty of chairs.  Cabanas range from ~$300-$500 based on the time of year.  Pool waitresses are pretty attentive and the pool-side drinks are rather reasonably priced.

Haven't done the Canyon Ranch Spa, but the GF has, she's a big fan, but mentioned the prices are a bit steep.

Resort fee is new in the past year or so (also the reason I'm deducting a star).  $20 gets you gym and internet access, some discounts, and a free paper or something, it's worthless and I wish they'd do away with this.

Checkout is 11:00am at the counter, or on the TV, super easy. Late checkout can be requested, but it seems unavailable if leaving on a weekend.",5,0,2

Pleasant, pleasant, pleasant...Everytime we walked back in from the Venetian and outside it was like a gasp of fresh peaceful air. It is very tasteful and serene. I think a bit too simple for a 5 diamond rating, but still very very nice. 

Check in on a Friday was soo fast, professional and easy. Highly impressed. 

The room was probably one of the nicest I have ever stayed in. The space and decor were stunning and understated. I felt it was lacking in bathroom amenities. 

Parking garage was soooo easy and convenient, never experienced that before in Vegas. 

Casino was small, but a very nice environment, we played and were able to make some money. The layout is nice, not claustrophobic or smokey. 

I really enjoyed the overall restaurant selection too, good variety, nothing hideous. We practically never needed to leave. We saw David Spade in their theater, which was a great theater. All in one place- made it super relaxing. 

We were actually shocked to find out what a happening place it was, I thought it would be stuffier like bellagio. For the most part there were well dressed 20's and 30's partying! Super fun, young vibe, in a tasteful way.

As you walk in, the marble floors and giant ""ice-like"" statue in the middle of the fountain in the atrium give the hotel a certain regality about it. The front desk staff was extremely friendly. They had ushers who basically talked to you as you waited to check in. They were very friendly and inquisitive about our stay there, and they even suggested things to do. From the atrium we walked through the casino and the casino was BEAUTIFUL! It was very spaced out, which can be a plus or a negative depending how you look at it. But, I enjoyed it being spaced out because I didn't feel like I was constantly sitting on top of another guest...

I got a little lost getting to my room...(don't ask...I just have no sense of direction haha). When I walked in, I was blown away. There was literally a walk way to even get into the main part of the room. You could practically live in the bathroom. There was a tub, shower, two sinks, and then a separate room for the toilet. The bedroom was connected to a walk down living room area. The bed was VERY comfortable with plush pillows and white down linens. I loved the touches of red velvet and gray suede. It gave it a very ""bachelor pad"" feel, and I loved it (even being the girlie girl that I am).

Overall, my stay here was great! I didn't get to explore the pool or spa. But, I did eat at a few of the restaurants and hung out at a few of the lounges, including the new SushiSamba SUGARCANE Boutique Nightclub. I loved the overall feel of the hotel.

This review is for the girls who want to know how much of their bathroom they need to bring with them to the Palazzo.  The rooms are pretty well stocked.  They come with the following:  2 robes, a Conair 1875 dryer, 3 bath towels (king room), 2 or 3 hand towels, 3 washcloths, shampoo, conditioner, bar soap, body wash, digital scale, shower cap, sewing kit, cotton pads, hair tie, iron, ironing board.  The lobby shop has bath bombs and other bath products if you want to soak Vegas out of your skin.  They also have basic hair products that are extremely overpriced, even by Vegas standards.  Unless you're in a bind, I'd go to Walgreens (on property) or Sephora (over at Venetian) for that.

Complimentary valet parking with awesome staff
Wifi 
Very beautiful hotel 
Yard bird restaurant 

Bad stuff: 
Asian guy at front desk put me and my husband in a ""HOSPITALITY SUITE"" knowing we were celebrating our 3 year anniversary. Also didn't appreciate how a girl named Hawraa was on board with him telling us it was a great room, we had a view of the pool, etc etc. 
ok this room had a BED THAT CAME OUT OF THE WALL! What?! What what whyyyyy?! I'm  celebrating my 3 years of marriage! Oh but the guy reassured me that's it be great no difference from that bed to the ""LUXURY SUITE""  WE ORIGINALLY booked for. It was damn well available, BUT he made this room sound like all that and then some, so we fell for it. We waked into the room, oh man, it was not for us at all. Like, what what he thinking? I can't believe he thought we'd be happy in that room, the bed was so pathetic, and then they give you just two pillows, and a very cheap looking blanket that you have to go looking for which ended up being in the closet, I was like wow really?! It was 4am at this point I believe, we were exhausted. We called spoke with someone they told us they'd try to switch us to the luxury suite like we originally had booked for. At that point my husband remembers that right after he switched us off to that joke of a hotel room, (more like a conference room"" the Asian guy went to a guest he was helping and said ""sir we just got a luxury suite become available, we upgraded you. This guys looked to be alone. It all came together..just not happy with the people at the desk, at all. Beware of the hospitality suite. Also, the water went up to my ankles while taking a short shower, gross! If you have a lot of people with you, or you have your children as well, yes this might work but not for just two people. No. After this I continued having issues with the people at the check in\/out desk, they just left me with a bad taste in my mouth. They caused me lots of stress, that's the last thing anyone wants on a getaway. Another incident happened after this, but they are in the process of correcting the issue, I will update if they do not do so.  
I hope management can really improve on the employees at the check in\/out desk. This review would be 5 stars if at the hospitality suite mess never happened.

I've read the other reviews about the old phones and fax machine, etc. but let's be honest, when you're in Vegas do you really give a shit about that stuff?! The beds are comfortable, the bathroom is huge, sunk in living room area with large, comfortable couches, the tv's are nice flatscreens with the one in the living room area having a dvd player hooked up to it. If having a in room coffee maker is a must for you though, this might not be the place for you as the rooms don't have them. If you gamble, The casino floor is great with a good variety of slots and tables, the Grazie club (the casino club card) is top notch!

The rooms are incredible.  You really feel comfy and like you are in ""vegas"" luxury.  And all you need to do is ask...normally you can't touch anything in the fridge or you bought it -- but for me (because I'm pregnant) they took everything out and let me use it for personal use.  Wow.  

I like the security checks to get up to your room.  Just that extra level of security makes you feel more safe.

Also the access to the parking is the best in Vegas.  One elevator away.

This all-suite hotel is very clean, less noisy than the Venetian, and feels more elegant.   l love the Venetian, but the Palazzo offers a more relaxed getaway.  

We booked the Palazzo Bella Suite (2 Queen Beds), and felt that it was more than adequate for our group of five gals.  I slipped the young lady at the fronk desk a $20 upon check-in and politely asked her for a complimentary upgrade.  She upgraded us to a strip-view room, along with some passes to Tao and Lavo.  

There were two to a bed and the fifth gal slept on the L-shaped couch in the sunken living room.  We could have turned the couch into a sleeper but found that it was more comfortable just sleeping on the actual couch.  

Security always made sure to ask everyone to show their room card before being allowed to enter into the elevator area...nice!  I usually spot hooker-type gals trying to enter the elevator areas on prior Vegas trips, but didn't notice this during our stay here.

The mini-bar is motion-sensor activated, so be careful about removing items from there...even for a few seconds.  

Breakdown of room service order:  
- tuna sandwich on multi-grain bread, with fries ($15)
- delivery charge ($4)
- 18% service charge ($2.70)
- tax ($1.54)
---------------------------------------------
Total = $23.24 (+ whatever tip you want to add to the bill)

If you're craving a caffeine fix, you won't have to walk far since there's a Coffee Bean situated right by the elevator area.  Of course prices are inflated...a regular iced tea cost me $5+.

There's a Walgreen's attached to the Palazzo if you need to buy much needed items for next-day hangovers...like Tylenol, bottled water, juice, etc...  Just take a left when you exit the Lobby doors and follow the walkway to Walgreen's.  

If you're staying at the Palazzo and want to get on the guestlist for Lavo or Tao Nightclub, just let the front desk know.  We were able to get on the guestlist for partying at Tao on Saturday night.  A word to the wise though...even if you're on the guestlist, you still have to wait in one of the LONG-A$$ed lines!  I normally use a promoter and skip the lines, but didn't this time.  

If you're having dinner at Tao Restaurant, then I recommend getting a reservation around 9pm or later.  This way, by the time you're done with dinner, the club is open and you can just walk on up to the second floor to party.  Unfortunately, we were only able to get on their 6:45pm slot for dinner (we booked the day prior to arrival).  Note:  make dinner reservations as far in advance as possible since 8pm and later time slots are very popular.

Cab from the airport to Palazzo (and vice versa) ran us $18 each way...plus whatever tip you want to give the driver.  One of my friends had to leave early to the airport by herself and was charged $28 for the one-way cab ride!  She was told by the driver that he had to take a shortcut via the freeway, so that's why it's $10 extra.  That's bullcrap because our driver took the freeway to the airport and we were only charged $18.",4,0,0

My experience here isn't a positive one -- the recommendations from them were just horrible.  However, their savings grace is that they DID get us in to a very exclusive and difficult place to eat -  this alone saves them from a 1 star review.

My advice is that if you don't need a place to eat a mediocre breakfast, or need wifi, and can deal without a newspaper, then don't bother upgrading.   Other than that, use Yelp --- you're in Vegas for the food, the gambling and the shows.

I have even become a gold member at the Palazzo\/ Venetian and I have stayed other places but I truly like this resort and what it has to offer EXCEPT I cannot stand that they have a total disregard for the adults who are paying good money to stay here. Why is it that every single pool except the exclusive pool with loud music catering to 20 somethings is filled with children. Children who are splashing pool water into my $14.00 drink ?????? And they are screaming and inconsiderate and they are NOT the majority....nor are they gambling, nor are they buying expensive meals or drinks and yet they are being catered to. Why can't the Palazzo and Venetian dedicate one pool to children and leave the rest for the majority...the paying people?????? Or if I have to beg...when give US one pool and give the rest to them. Just ten years ago there was a beautiful pool just outside of Riva,a restaurant at the Venetain, that is only amount a foot deep and it was for high rollers only and have wonderful lounge chairs that sat right in the water. Then they opened it up to all people and before you knew it it was bombarded by kids splashing in it, jumping from chair to chair until all the chairs were broken and they finally had to take the chairs out of the pool completely and now it's basically a Kiddy pool. Really? seriously? I am spending a tremendous amount of money for a well earned vacation and you are catering to five year olds. So for this reason, and until things change, I am giving the Palazzo a score of TWO stars. When did our country start being run by children? And when did their parents forget how to discipline their kids?????? And when did 4 and 5 stars resorts decide that a non paying guest was more important than a paying one???????

I pulled up Valet! Oh and tip for thought you can tip whatever you want like $2 or $3 so don't feel like you have to give more than that. 
I suggest to get friendly with one of the receptionist and asked for stumbling distance and they'll have a room for you next to the elevator but the best view is Strip View! As you walk into your gorgeous room everything so pure and clean to the T. Good Job to the House Keeping! They provide the best service which makes palazzo so great. 

You're Palazzo room is usually a standard suite good for couples or friends. A suite is good enough for about 7 people because they have 2 queen sized beds and a pull out sofa and another sectional of the sofa. The bathroom is very nice! It has a seperate room for the toliet. There is a flat screen tv facing the mini hot tub. For your ladies, they have a little section in the bathroom with sit down chair long mirror and vanity mirror.

The Palazzo has a gorgeous pool area but if it gets to full during the summertime you can walk towards the Venetian Beach how convienient is that! Inside the Palazzo is a gorgeous must take picture waterfall and if you go up the stairs you can go on the gandola ride. 

Palazzo is an attachment to Venetian also another good hotel to stay at but I prefer the Palazzo than Venetian any day. Palazzo is so convienient located in the heart of Las Vegas. Across from the Palazzo is the Wynn Hotel and also the Fashion Show Mall.

Not our 2.5 month reservation we had made. When we asked for a manager she proceeded to tell us and this is exactly what she said "" a request is just that, a request and only if they have them available at the time will they honor them. Also check in time is between 3 and 5 so they have until 5 to have the room available"". So heads up to anyone gets there early by a hour to make sure you get your REQUESTED room.

Very confusing easy to get turned around, which. Happened serveral times to our parents.

After several emails and calls with no response to Pallazzo managment, we have decided never to stay there again. We were treated pourly and made to feel as if we did not matter. Boy at this day and age, in such an economy you would think every customer would be treated like royalty.",0,1,0

My friend was given a comped room so I can't comment on price. However, I can comment on the room. The room had a king sized as well as a ""living room"" area. The bed was comfy and slept 4 people, while 2 slept on the pull-out  bed, 1 on the sofa, 1 on the chaise and 1 on the floor. 

The room was very beautiful with 3 flatscreen TVs (1 in the living room, 1 in the bedroom and 1 in the bathroom). The bathroom was large and well-lit.  

I wished the room stored extra pillows and blankets in the closet. By the time we realized that the room didn't have them, people were too tired to call housekeeping so some people slept without a blanket.

Later the next day, we called for extra towels and blankets. We were told that we could only be given 6 towels at a time so we had to call twice...more work for housekeeping.

Ohhh...I also don't like that master-switch!

Overall, it was a great place!",1,1,1

I had a corner suite so there were no noises at all that bothered our stay.  I had wonderful customer friendly experiences with Alberto and Tay in Housekeeping. I also have to say that the young lady at the registration desk who checked me in was kind, courteous and welcoming.  The other young lady at the registration desk who checked me out also was kind, she went the extra mile to tell me about the Fashion Show live catwalk schedule, very accommodating.

I like the fact that they let me check in early. We arrived in Vegas at like 12:30 or 1 pm, and walked right it. Check in time usually isn't until 3, but we got to check in and go up to the room to relax. I like that.

I forgot the name of the suite I got, but it seems to be the norm. It had a nice bathroom; lots of room for both my boyfriend and I to get ready at the same time. The beds were pretty comfortable, but for a ""queen"" it seemed a little small. I have a queen at home, and the two of us fit just fine, but I'm not sure why we had such a hard time fitting on their ""queen"" bed. Ohwell, it was fine. I was drunk anyways.

The view was pretty, it was overlooking the pool and part of the strip (I think?) and Treasure Island and the Mirage. But I love the shades, aha. Blackout shades for the morning after. It was the best. 

One bad thing I needed to comment about is the part of the bathroom with the toilet. It is this little confined room with a door. And no fan. SRSLY? How can you expect people to come with boys that POO and not have a fan? I'd have to wait almost an hour for the smell to pass. 

All in all, I think I'd stay here again if I had the monetary means. And I'm definitely asking to be placed in a higher room. We were on the 7th flloor. Ugh.",1,2,1

PROPERTY
+ Clean and well-maintained.

+ It doesn't reek of smoke.

+ There's a large open area that connects to The Venetian where you can find a waterfall. Nearby, there's also a large display of plants and flowers with a particular theme that changes based on events or seasons.

LUXURY ROOMS
+ Just like The Venetian, all rooms are suites with similar interior designs and feature, like multiple television sets, sunken living room, comfortable beds, and large shower and tub. 

+ It's guaranteed you won't get a view of the parking garage if you book a room here. I've stayed here a few times and have yet to receive a room with a bad view.

RESTAURANTS
+ The food at Sushi Samba is terrific. Great place for a meal if you like Asian fusion.

+\/- Zine is an upscale Chinese restaurant that serves a decent fare. If you don't feel like paying $30 for honey-glazed walnut prawns, Chinatown's a 5 minute drive away.

+\/- Grand Lux doesn't receive as much traffic as the one located in The Venetian. 
However, this one isn't open 24\/7 and closes at around 2 or 3am. The menus at both restaurants are the same, but I think service is better at the other The Venetian.

- Lagasse's Stadium is a fun place to watch and bet on sports. The stadium seating is the best part of the restaurant, but the food is mediocre.

+ Espressamente Illy is where you can get your caffeine fix. You can also order food and gelato from here. Haven't tried the gelato, but it always looks good. On the other hand, I'd skip on the food. 

SHOPPING
+ Luxury shops like Fendi, Louboutin, and Victoria's Secret -- it's a luxury to buy a $60 bra -- can be found on the upper levels. The shopping area is smaller than the Grand Canal Shops, but the selections are higher-end. In addition, it's less crowded. 

NIGHTLIFE 
- Lavo plays some great music. Unfortunately, it's one of the tiniest clubs in Vegas. 

OVERALL
The Palazzo is one of the best properties on The Strip. It may not have replicas of the Sistine Chapel, but it's still top-notch.",8,2,4
4484799,yOVSMzDL65yq_w9y9VWX5g,xJEpQXgkeeZsBFivohgJKg,uGupeWqih0yIcCg8anM1PA,4,2013-05-05,"The great:
- At check-in, we got an upgrade to a 1200 SF suite for a very reasonable extra charge.  (It's an all-suite hotel, but the standard one is more like 700 SF.)
- Check-in staff was super-friendly.
- Automatic blinds with remote were awesome.
- The birthday boy got a happy birthday letter with free drink coupons (which we forgot to use.)
- Room service breakfast beat expectations and our server was very polite and set our table well and quickly.
- Wi-fi was free with our premium suite (although I think regular suites may have to pay a daily surcharge.)  It worked well, although we didn't use it a lot.
- The decor is much more tasteful than most casinos (I prefer simple elegance to ornate.)  The Palazzo is definitely one of the most tasteful casinos.
- The vibe is quieter and more mellow than most casinos.  We never heard any of our neighbors, saw relatively few overly-intoxicated\/badly behaving people, and generally no major Vegas rowdiness.  We liked this a lot.
- I completed their online survey after our stay, and received a personal reply from management.  They offered a $75 credit for our inconvenience (being woken up by maintenance.)

The OK:
- It took a long time to check-in.  The line was not very long, but our clerk had to go to the back three times to check on something or other.  Twice was to check on the price for an upgrade.  The third..no clue.  Strange.
- I wouldn't choose our suite again.  The suite had kind of an odd layout and a lot of wasted space; the foyer was completely wasted.  The closets were fairly small and had double racks; there was nowhere for me hang my floor-length gown; I had to drape it over two hangers to keep it off the floor.  The half-bath also could have benefited from some of that wasted foyer space.  The master bathroom was lovely and spacious with its double sinks, but had an ordinary tub and shower.  I would think that they would put either a fancy, high-end tub (clawfoot, sculpted tub, etc.) or a spa\/jacuzzi tub into a 1200 SF suite?  The lights were also bizarre.  The wall lighting system controlled some lights but not others.  Some lights had to be switched off directly and were inconvenient (e.g. the bedside table lamps weren't really reachable from bed, so you had to get out of bed to turn them off.)  The over the bed light was reachable, but it was so bright as to be glaring and we didn't want to use it.  Another light had a floor switch that was hard to locate.  Another hung VERY low over the dining table, with metal bars below the shade --  so low that I hit my head (quite hard) on it when I was getting up from breakfast.
- Valet parking is pretty far from the elevator to the hotel rooms.  And they won't pull your car around until you come downstairs (we tried calling when we were leaving our hotel room.)  Valet took awhile; more than 10 minutes each time.
- The restaurants and stores in the Palazzo close down pretty early...even in relation to the neighboring Venetian (same hotel group.)  We ended having to go to the Venetian or another casino anytime we wanted late-night anything.

The bad:
On our first morning, maid service knocked and walked in even though we had the door hanger out.  We were sleeping in (we had stayed up past 6 AM.)  About 90 minutes later, we were woken my maintenance who wanted to know if we were using the tub, toilet, etc because they'd rec'd a complaint from the suite below about a loud banging noise.  I pointed out that we'd been sound asleep and not using any plumbing, and he still wanted to inspect the half-bath.  I couldn't fall back to sleep after that, and spent my entire final day in Vegas feeling tired.  Also, the previous day, we left the room around 2 PM, and apparently that was too late for housekeeping; nothing had been done with our room when we returned.  That was our fault, I suppose, but it would have made a nice impression if they'd done it (and they would have had a very nice tip that I'd left behind!)

I would stay here again; next time I'd ask to see the room before taking the (paid) upgrade.  It was probably my least favorite suite I've stayed in in Vegas.  (My favorite was at the Bellagio.)  I didn't like the design\/layout of the suite at all, but but service was excellent with minor exceptions.",6,1,3

That is why I've been here three times on January 2009 and two more on December 2008 and all the rooms were comp for a 3-4 night stay!

The Venetian hotels have three towers, the Venezia, the Venetian, and the Palazzo and I've stayed at all three and Palazzo is the best by far for their design, comfort and for family.  If you're gonna get it for FREE might as well stay at the best and when you reserve, go to the 35 floor on the 700 rooms.  It has a view of Treasure Island and you get to see the Pirate action.  I have kids and I always request that area.

The pools at the Palazzo are better too than the other towers.  They have more pools and more kiddy pools, again I usually take my wife and two boys here and they enjoy it.

If you do have kids and planning on taking them, make sure they don't lift the drink and snacks because you will get charge for it.  And, if the do just make sure you call front desk right away, they are very friendly and understanding.  Another thing if you are taking your kids, request for the two queen bed, the sofa bed comes in a queen size too.  If you request for the king bed the sofa bed comes in a twin size.

Finally the only thing I don't like about Palazzo is that the Poker room is at the Venetian and you have to make that long walk to get to the casino and Poker is the only game I play when I'm in town!",3,1,2

I stayed at the Venetian May 20th and returned to Vegas on June 6th to stay at the Palazzo.  I arrived early (7:00) and was told that I could pay an additional $100 for an early check in or I could pay $45 additional per night for a room ""upgrade"". This meant that I would now have two queen sized beds as opposed to a king.

I received what was what they promised: a modest sized suite (not sure how this was an upgrade). I was amazed, however, at the run down appearance of the furnishings; the sofa was lumpy and the cushions didn't appear to fit properly, the cushion on the seat at the desk was so worn out in the middle, that I elected to stand while working on my computer and the base of the desk, coffee table and dresser all had scuff marks. 

The room was clean, with the exception of the stains on the counter that separated the sleeping area from ""living room"" area and the bed was very comfortable.

I stayed on the 7th floor and was awakened twice during my stay: the first time by the people staying in the adjacent room who were not only loud but sounded as though they were going to come through the wall and again at 6:45 am by housekeeping.......speaking and laughing very loudly......outside my door that clearly had a sign saying I didn't want to be disturbed. When I opened the door and asked them if they could keep it down they agreed to do so.

My final night there, I called the front desk because there was a couple in the hallway having a very loud argument and slamming doors. I don't normally do this type of thing, but the male sounded really upset and you never know how much someone has had to drink. Thankfully the situation quieted down.

I had a fairly early flight, so I went to grab a bite at Grand Lux in the Venetian (it's open 24-hours as opposed to their location in the Palazzo). I had what was hands down the worst breakfast that I have had in years. First my coffee was bought in a lipstick stained cup. I pointed it out and I was bought a clean cup with luke warm,old tasting coffee. I explained that the coffee was not working for me, so the server took it to the back, nuked it in the microwave and gave me hot old tasting coffee. I told him to take it off my bill and that I would have water. When my food arrived, the ground beef was under cooked and the hash browns were uncooked on one side and burnt on the other. Not having time to send the meal back, I picked around what I could eat and left.

At the end of the day, there are a lot of options when deciding where to stay in Vegas. The Palazzo\/Venetian is not cheap and with the convenience of Uber, staying on the strip is not as essential as it used to be. The management here might want to consider doing a room refresh to stay competitive (and talk to their chatty housekeeping staff)!! In all likelihood I will book my next reservation at another resort.",0,1,0

I've stayed at many hotels on the strip over two decades and this is by far my favorite.  I booked the hotel for a discount on Priceline on their express deal and it was well worth it.  Jorge, who checked us in, was nice and helped us get a free upgrade to celebrate our anniversary with a room on the 43rd floor.  He told us how we can buy bottles of water at the Walgreen right outside the door since it was 115 degrees out.  Unlike many of the hotels on the strip, this hotel's parking lot elevator doesn't make guests walk thru the entire hotel to get to the elevators to the rooms.  Guests will need to show a room key to a security guard who sits by the guest elevators.  

The wifi for our room wasn't working at all.  Each guest has to pay a $35\/day resort fee which includes wifi.  I called someone to help us fix it and Jose came to our room.  At first it didn't seem like he was going to fix it that night for us but as soon as we left for dinner and came back, Jose had left a note telling us he'd fixed it while we were out.  Nice surprise!  

I loved having the option to walk out to the shoppes at the canal and various restaurants to eat.  Another thing I did notice from housekeeping is they forgot to empty our garbage one day.  It was filled 1\/4 of the can.  Other than a few minor hiccups I'm still very pleased.  I will be back!",0,0,0

I came with a group of 5 people, and the Bella Suite (two queen size beds and a sectional with a pull out bed) fit all of us comfortable. The sectional can actually be two beds (the pull out portion and the chaise portion), so the room is very large and versatile. The beds and blankets were very comfortable.

Note that the bathroom and toilet doors do not lock, so be aware of friends who are looking to prank you while showering.

The location on the strip is really good. It is walkable to the Venetian, Wynn, Encore, Caesars, etc.

Only negative was that they would not let us do late check out when we were leaving. Most hotels have been able to accommodate late requests, but I guess they were too book on that day.",0,1,0

We had originally booked the Luxury King Size Suite Jetsetter.com. We got a really good deal. Between 4 people, 3 days and 2 nights... we each payed about $120 so it was not bad at all. This is including resort fees. Arrived on Friday and left Sunday. When we got to check-in the line was not long at all. My cousin and I were very lucky. We got a cute young male attendant and we pretty much flirted our way to a free upgrade to a Bella Suite and a beautiful strip view. But I felt bad that we were taking advantage of him so I tipped him a $20. Justin was very very nice! 

Overall, I absolutely loved our stay at the Palazzo. Between 4 girls, we had more than enough room. 2 huge plush queen size beds, a huge bathroom with plenty of mirrors, a nice little sunken living room with a pull out sofa, which we didn't attempt to put together because we were to drunk by the time we got back from the club to figure it out lol The Venetian has the same layout but the Palazzo suites look much cleaner. I loved that it was right across the street to the hottest clubs, XS and Surrender and Encore Beach Club and Tao is downstairs pretty much. The only thing I don't like is that it's far away from the center of the strip. So it's far away from Marquee but that's pretty much it. $15 cab ride there. It's convenient if you want to walk the whole strip though... you walk one side of the strip down to Earl of Sandwich for lunch and a Fat Tuesday and then go to Marquee Day Club and walk the strip back to the hotel so it's really not that bad. Though it's not at the center, there's plenty of things on this side of the strip such as the mall and the Walgreens that's conveniently located downstairs.

We got late check out for free. But when we checked out, it looked like Jetsetter had charged us for upgrading the room and drinks we supposedly drank from the mini fridge but because we saw Justin again, We made sure we went to him so he could get it fixed for us. We weren't charged any extra fees. The customer service here is awesome! I would definitely stay here again!",1,0,0

I met up with my family in Vegas to celebrate my mom's birthday.  Since my parents are avid Vegas-vacationers, The Palazzo and NYNY gave my parents free suites.  Naturally, my parents booked reservations at BOTH hotels - The Palazzo for my brother and I; NYNY for my parents.  One thing about my family... it's not enough that we have separate rooms, but we all stay in different hotels, lol.  It was my first time at this hotel and although I like the hotel, I didn't ""love"" the hotel.

LIKES:
+ Great customer service.  My brother and I ordered room service and it arrived exactly on time.  The lady that served us was very accomodating and super nice.  Every staff that I passed by would ALWAYS smile and say hello.
+ All suite rooms.  The rooms are very spacious, quiet and wonderfully decorated.
+ Plush, soft towels.
+ Comfortable beds and pillows.
+ The casino didn't smell like a casino.
+ The shops were just next door.  

DISLIKES:
- Club Grazie.  Their membership program points expires.  If you don't stay ""active"" in a year, you'll lose all of your points.
- They don't have a ""Casino Invited Guests"" Lounge.  Their lounges are only for Platinum and Gold members, which are located in different hotels.  The Platinum Lounge is located at The Palazzo while the Gold Lounge is located at The Venetian.  So if I was a Gold member and staying at The Palazzo, I would have to walk to The Venetian in order to get to the Gold Lounge.
- Originality.  As my brother puts it, ""I'm not impressed.  It looks similar to The Venetian.""  Their rooms have the same set-up as their sister hotel.  In comparison, MGM, NYNY, TI, Mirage and Bellagio are all from the same owner yet they're all different from each other as far as decor, set-up and theme.

ALTHOUGH, I have more pros than cons, MOST of the items under the pros list, I've experienced from other hotels.  Nothing really stood out that sets them apart from other hotels and I think I have enough experience to make this claim (I've stayed in at least 10 hotels that's located on the strip).  In short, it's a really nice hotel with great customer service but it was the amenities they offered their guests that fell short of my expectation of a luxury hotel.  It was very obvious that the ""perks"" were only catered to the high end clientele.",6,5,5

I have stayed at the Palazzo before and have been generally pleased.  Upon arrival I was up to my room in under 20 minutes and at the Blackjack table within 40 minutes.  This is a large property, but it doesn't take you forever to get from point A to B.  The casino hosts a pleasant clientele (ie:  not too much riff raff).  Bouchon is always a good choice for breakfast and they also have a small take out counter if you're strolling in from a late night on the town and need a pastry or croissant to settle your stomach.
The sports book \/ lagasse restaurant is good, not great.  I have been in the summer before and enjoyed the cabanas at azure, but I do feel a bit old and out of shape for the pool party.  Whatever, order one of the giant punch bowls and you will feel fine after a few.
Finally, the rooms are A-OK.  I have been in the standard rooms and they are nothing note worthy.  This trip I was in the sienna tower which seemed a little roomier and was comfortable.

The entire hotel is stunning, from the lobby, to the fountains, the multiple pools and the suites. The suite was almost too big for just the two of us, but our friends loved hanging out in the sunken living room, so it was put to good use. If ever there was a room to split with 5+ people in Vegas, this would be it. Every detail in the room is so luxurious, from the automatic blinds, the under-lit credenza, the vanity and separated shower and tub in the huge marble bathroom, the full-length mirror, the linens, the list goes on.... I also loved that the room was super quiet, even when other guests were in the hall. 

The room service was excellent- pricier than other resorts, but the food is completely worth every penny spent. We took advantage of the excellent restaurants downstairs and next door at the Venezia & Venetian and realized that we didn't need to leave the resort for anything we wanted (except Earl of Sandwich, of course). Also, the Canyon Ranch spa on the 3rd floor is world class and worth indulging in. 

The location is great, with the shops at the Canal, Fashion Show, Wynn&Encore, and Walgreens literally just steps away, meaning we didn't have to take the car out once. Parking was a breeze and we ended up with a spot right in front of the elevator.

I don't think I ever what to stay anywhere else on the strip. The only real negative I found with the room is the location of the TV in the bathroom. The way the tub is facing you can't really relax in a bubble bath while watching your favorite show or movie which is a real bummer. The room was comfortable and cozy it felt like home. When we were at the 1st hotel we spent all of our time on the strip at other hotels but at the Palazzo I never wanted to leave. I also loved that they had a printer in the room so you could print your boarding pass without have to track down a print kiosk or going to the business office. 
The pools are multiple as you share with Venetian but there were always chairs to be found. The lobby and shopping areas are beautiful. The casino has plenty of walking space and doesn't have the funky smell that some of the older hotels on the strip have. I love that some of the machines have a Drinks 2 U button so you can order your drink as you like and it comes out quickly. So there is no wondering if you just missed the cocktail waitress. If gambling on the machines are not your idea of fun that is ok there is plenty of things to do including a trip to the spa or gym.  Don't forget to check out some of the awesome restaurants.",2,1,1

SHOPS\/RESTAURANTS - Good, it had plenty of them at all different levels. The Bourbon lounge was fun with old rock videos and the guy with the twisted sister wig was funny and kept things going. Lavo looked nice but didn't actually get there. The Grand Lux was very nice as an easy, 24\/7 place to go - breakfast, late snacks. Basically an always open cheesecake factory. 

ROOMS -  were ok, just average. This is an all suite hotel so if you're a family it's nice to have the larger living area which you could have small kids sleep in etc. But they are showing their age. The first one we got was a smoking room (they offered it as an 'upgrade' because it had a view). It was smelly and very dusty - and the view was pretty ordinary - so if offered this as an 'upgrade' just refuse.  The next room actually had a better view and was clean, but still these are not modern rooms. Not bad though.

POOLS - HORRIBLE.  on the first day at 10.30am we noticed really bad pool scum all around the main pool at the sides.  Really bad, if you have a hot tub you may have seen it after too many people have been in there. Didn't get cleaned up all day. Complained to the manager. Just got a 'its been handled' response. On check out told the girl that we couldn't use the pool and she credited the resort fee, which was good (that raised this from a 2 to a 3 star).  Also note that all the pools are for kids, there's no adults only pool.  AND most of the pools are in shade until 1pm!!  So before that you have to cram into one of the two pools that get sun if you want to go.

So, don't want to be one of these people that complain and give the hotel a one star review because someone looked at them funny, but truly this is not a 5 star hotel IMHO.  It probably used to be, but it's aging, the pool areas are badly designed, the service is meh, and for the money there are better options, or else spend maybe $50 more and go to one of the newer places and have a really nice time.

This is ok for families with kids etc, and that's what you see at the hotel, but if you are between 25 to 55 and have seen better then you may be disappointed.",4,1,0

It was crowded and noisy as all casinos are and there are even no tile floors to separate the casino with the walk way. Hey, I think you can afford some tile?!  And even there are three elevators to go to all the levels, it still gets crowded from time to time. It is a nice hotel with great facilities, but I think people will prefer more privacy. And also I would prefer a separate entrance for kids to go into hotel instead of through the casino. But on other thought, why rake kids to Las Vegas at all anyway.

All and all, on the good part, it has a restaurant row with great restaurants, the canal shops has great choices of shopping right along a canal. Maybe this part belongs to Venetian, but anyway.

The rooms are great, plenty of rooms, comfy beds and even the sofa bed are good. The bathrooms have separate shower and tub and double sink and separate door for the toilet. Sofa bed is separated with a marble bar still not a separate room like a real suite but close enough. The tables colors are very nice and the coffee table unique.

Finally for this much money, they put a scale in the bathroom so you don't have to go downstairs to the exercise room to weigh yourself. Still no slippers, but the bath robes are nice.

PRO:

- AMAZING service on the casino floor. Dealers were friendly and waitresses were fast. Table minimums were reasonable.

- Upclass, younger but mature crowd. Mostly late 20s through 30s. So not as crazy as the cheap places, but not a retirement home either.

- Gratitude got me some comps off my bill, even for mostly minimum bets at the tables.

CON:  

- For the price, a little too huckster. They're shilling the Phantom Of The Opera like no tomorrow. Everything has an upcharge from the pool to the spa to the food. Which is OK, but sometimes it feels a little much.

- Off brand slots. I'm usually an MGM group kind of guy. The slots here are more like the ones in Detroit and Louisiana. Kind of generic and none of the familiar crowd pleasers.(Except WHEEL! OF! FORTUNE! which you can't escape).

- Views are considered an upgrade, because it's mostly suites there isn't a lot of wiggle room. I know, kind of minor, but if you're used to getting a little more for how much you gamble and how much you're willing to give this is not the place for you.

Some other pro tips:

- Grand Lux Cafe is amazing for value and quality. There are a crap ton of ""upcharge"" restaurants but none of them were really worth it. 

- Holy crap the Venetian has gone downhill. Take a walk over there and it's more like Luxor or Circus Circus.",3,2,1

I'm a regular Vegas visitor and enjoy my stays at most of the hotels I've been at.  Palazzo is the first time I've stayed at any hotel chain a second time (I was at the Venetian previously).  

All in all I had fun and the hotel is beautiful, the rooms are clean and luxurious, room service is relatively prompt,  but I came across a serious Customer Service issue at checkout that I believe all need to be aware of.

-On that Saturday night, there was a fire in the parking garage and cars were not allowed into the driveway.  However, Security neglected to inform us (something we found out the next day), that pedestrians can walk up to the hotel. Instead, we were turned away in our cab at 2 a.m. to circle the streets for over an hour (a $100+ cab fare) until the hotel was reopened to cars. 

-We brought this to the attention of the Front Desk manager AL SANTOS when we were checking out. At first, he denied that the hotel was not letting cars access the hotel and that there was a fire. We were bewildered. He kept insinuating that we were inventing the story to get credits to our room. After us starting to get upset about his behavior and treatment, a front desk representative leaned over and updated him about the fire. He apologized. He proceeded to get a Security guard to watch us, while he went to get claim forms for us to document our complain. Strike 1.

-I asked to have the room credit to be put on my Grazie card and after being told at check in, during my stay and at the Grazie counter that it won't be a problem, he proceeded to tell me that it was impossible b\/c I'm a secondary on the room and not a primary. I asked him to change that - He threw a fuss, and then relented. I checked the next day and my Grazie card was never credited. Strike 2.

- Then he charged the wrong credit card for the room. After I asked him about it, he lost his temper and berated me about that being the credit card the reservations were made with. I informed him that another credit card was submitted at check in and CHARGED already. He refunded the initial card and proceeded to re-charge the second card.  I left that day with my card being charge double the room charge.  When I kept explaining that he was double charging me, he started loosing it again and informing me in the most derogatory manner that this was standard procedure. Strike 3!

-I leave the hotel finally (after over 1.5 hours at checkout). On the road I call the reservations department to reverse those double charges, which I had confirmed with my bank at that point) b\/c it was causing overdraft charges on my bank account. I came across another Manager, Michelle who offered to call the bank to verify whether any overdraft charges had occured and if we had charged more than we owed. 15 minutes after I speak with Michelle, AL SANTOS called me, yelling and insulting me for speaking to another manager about the double charges, informing me that Michelle works UNDER him and that he never double charged me. I reiterated that I checked my account online and I was double charged, but he wasn't listening, he just kept screaming at me. STRIKE 4!

Well, at this point I was angry and I asked for the next Manager up. She (Nicole)  was not available and I was told she would call me on the next business day. It's been over a week, I've called her myself again, and have STILL not heard from her.

Yeah, so a whole lot of yelling by customer service. It ruined my entire stay at the Palazzo and my entire view of the hotel. I have never heard of Customer Service reps screaming at customers and being so uninformed about the happenings at their hotel.  

If you have no complications, I guess it's ok to stay there. Otherwise, management is one unreliable rude group to interact with at the Palazzo.",11,1,1

Had dinner at the Zine restaurant.  Food was well prepared, but the portions were small and I felt were over priced.  DO NOT order wine here.  I made the mistake of doing that, it was pretty bad.  But I haven't gotten to the point of sending wine back yet.  Getting there.

Buchon was great as usual.  The wine we ordered was only $4 more but it was a 100 times better.

I like the fact that you must present your room key in order to go to the rooms! My friend presented his key and to the elevator we went. He was on the 29th or 33rd floor... I cant remember. It was a smoking floor though, he's a smoker, but he's cute! 

We get to his suite, and it is SUPER cute and nice. He had a king size suite and it was facing Wynn so it had a decent view. The room itself was clean, and large. They come equipped with 2 tvs, a large sofa, desk, chair, and a small table to have dinner or what have you. The bed was super comfy and the pillows were awesome! I love the decor, it's so modern and the colors are nice!

We ordered room service later on and the food was pretty crappy. Do not get the chicken wing substitutes, theyre over cooked and taste like popcorn chicken. The chicken Caesar was just ok, nothing special ad the OJ is fresh, sans pulp... I love pulp! The room service people were super nice and kind.

I stayed at the Palazzo for 3 nights for a conference. The conference people offered a special room price at $216 per night. Hm, that's a special deal? I wonder what the regular price for this place is.

The check-in was a breeze. Service was top notch. Everyone was polite, but I got a sense of surly but impersonal service. A bit like dealing with an automated machine, if that makes sense.

Our room at the Palazzo was one of the best rooms I have stayed in my life. The room was very spacious (about 800 sq. ft.) -- as big as our apartment, and the bathroom is bigger than our bedroom!!! All marble, beautifully appointed. 3 flat screen TVs!!!!!! Opulent.

I paid extra $65 for a view. Well, the view was ok, but I'm not sure if it's worth additional $65. I was excited to see the Treasure Island Siren\/Pirate show from our room, but the show was canceled during our stay. Boo~ 

The wireless connection was strong. The roman shade and curtain are controlled by a remote. The curtains blocked out the bright Las Vegas strip light completely.

However, the sheets were not as luxurious as everything else in the room. I felt like I was sleeping under a sheet of paper! Yes, it hurt my skin. The pillows aren't very comfortable either -- a little too soft for me.

We signed up for Club Grazie online and got a $15 gambling credit. Free money, sweet~ The slot machines paid out pretty well, although it could have been the beginner's luck. I earned $328 with the $15 credit. :D 

Everything in this hotel is expensive even for Las Vegas standard. At the same time, the casino floor felt much more calm and classier than other places, which I did like.

I splurged my winning on a $90 pedicure at the Canyon Ranch spa. Holy crap, that was an expensive pedicure. It was nice, and I got to keep the nail polish, but I felt guilty for spending $90 on a pedicure. Back in Oakland, I can get a full body massage for $90.

I would have bumped it up to 5 stars, but here are the reasons why I will not return to Palazzo:

1) Smell: If you are sensitive to smell, you will notice a very strong perfume smell permeating outside and throughout the hotel premises. Certain areas -- entry and front desk, etc. exhibit exceptionally concentrated dose of perfume. The same smell exists at the sister establishment, Venetian. I am very sensitive to smell and can't use any scented lotions or deodorants. I felt nauseated during my stay, and I  I ended up leaving the Palazzo because of it. 

2) Lay out: It's very easy to get lost in this place. The signs aren't very noticeable and it's easy to find yourself inside the Venetian and difficult to find your way back to the Palazzo. I felt involuntarily trapped in the casino and shopping area. It's bad enough that you have to walk through the casino to get to the guest rooms!!!

3) Casino waitresses never came around during the 2.5 hours I spent at the slot machines. When I was at the Mirage, I was offered drinks 3 times in 2 hours. 

4) Pool: The pool area itself is nice, but there is no wait service. 

5) Linen: As stated above, the sheets hurt my skin. They should provide higher quality linen, since they are charging a handsome amount and selling themselves as a luxury establishment.

I love the 'shoppes' shared between the Palazzo and the Venetian: so much shopping and so little time!

Do avoid the 'Café Presse' on the second floor just past the elevator exit: they give horrible service and the pastries are just not worth the lengthy wait. you are better off going to a nearby Starbucks or the Coffee Bean Co on the casino level.

When I arrived at the Palazzo on August 23 I did what any good yelper would do and checked into this world famous hotel on Yelp.  To my surprise I realized there wasn't a single review!  Could this be I would be the first to review such an amazing place??? I couldn't actually believe it so I searched a few more times to make sure I wasn't making an error.  But, I take pride in yelping so I decided to wait till I spent a few days before I made any comments.  While there I quickly realized the Palazzo lived up to its fine Italian name.  First of all, all the rooms are suites and large they are.  There is a very large sleeping area with two large queen beds, beautiful doors moldings, trim and elegant curtains that hang around the head boards.  There is also a large dresser across from the beds with a nice flat screen TV.  As you move towards the windows you enter the step down living room that has a large wrap around couch, a second TV and an office area.  What was even more spectacular was the curtains could be controlled with a remote or just a simple touch would automatically make them open or close.  Then there was the 150 sq ft bathroom with separate bath and shower, dual vanity and elegant tile work.  Overall this was a very comfortable room and a huge value for the price!  What also stood out was their elaborate pool areas.  They probably had about a dozen pool areas with some being large for the partiers, some in between and then what looked like exclusive VIP areas.  There was also Tao beach which was an exclusive day club and we took full advantage of it.  Since the pool wasn't very large in this area it seemed more like an outdoor bottle service area for people who wanted to rage during the day.  They played great dance music and it was the perfect way to start an epoch weekend!  We drank a lot so I don't remember too many other details other than I will be back.  When I got back to LA late on the 25th I figured I'd write my review on the Palazzo after I got some rest.  Today being the 27th I realized I need to finally get my Vegas reviews done.

1) I asked my room not to be cleaned but they did so anyway when I came back.  That's fine but the next morning, housekeeping knocked on my door at 9:30am and immediately try to come in before I even got a chance to say there's someone here.  they didn't provide me with one of those ""do not disturb"" sign to hang on my door but at least they should've checked if someone is in the room before busting in!

2) Wi-Fi is included with the extra $17 resort fee they stick you with but won't know about until you check in.  However, they don't tell you that you get wi-fi with your resort fee and there's no explanation anywhere telling you how to get on the internet through their wi-fi.  When you log into their wi-fi, all it states is that it cost $12.95 a day.  You have to make another call to front desk and learn how to get on their wi-fi and to confirm that it is included with the resort fee.

3) They tried to charge me $6.00 for the mini bar because their sensor in the fridge said I took something out.  All I did was put a bottle water of mine in the fridge to get it cold.  I didn't take out anything in the fridge.  Why don't they physically check the mini bar before charging someone???  That's how they do it in most hotels.

All in all, I'd consider staying here again but with so many options in Vegas, I could go somewhere else.  I never had so many hassles with any other Vegas hotels I stayed in than with this one.

The Property:

-Really an awesome homebase. There is tons of stuff to do in here and something for every person or circumstance. Great location.

-Great happy hours at Taqueria Canonita ($3 wells and $5 margaritas and long islands!), First food and bar, Zefferino ( although the food there sucks) and other places that werent as much my style.

-Excellent food. Taqueria Canonita, Otto, Canaletto, Cut, Bouchon, Delmonico etc.

-A cheap food court with awesome pretzels, hot dogs, chinese etc.

-Great bourbon list but stupid contrived atmosphere at the Bourbon room. No problem, I'll take my whiskey to go in a plastic cup! $3 for a nice pour of Evan Williams and plenty of better selections at the $5-$10 range.

-Good gaming, nice slot selection and I was able to find $10 roulette almost always. Easy to navigate casino floor.

-The atmosphere is a little hokey, especially the opera type music piped into the elevators. Give it a rest.

-The complex as a whole can be very confusing to navigate.

-Good shopping if you like fancy things.

The rooms:

-Easy check in. We arrived on a Monday but at noon we barely waited in line and got our room immediately.

-Fancy appearance. They sure do look nice but the furnishings remind me a little bit too much of somebodies rich grandmas house. They are really big though with high ceilings and big windows.

- My room really had a ""puked in"" feel to it. It was clean for the most part but a little dinged up and had a few stains. No smell or large stains but it just felt a little skeezy.

-My damn bedroom tv didnt work right, no HD channels. I didnt bother calling down, too much headache. Not going to watch much tv in Vegas anyways.

-Better toiletries at the Golden Nugget. Cmon now, this is a five diamond hotel right?

-Comfy bed, comfy pillows, slept awesome.

So basically I wasnt that impressed with the rooms. The property is kind of corny but has everything you could ever want and is in a great location. Overall I dont have too much really bad to say and really enjoyed my time here.",2,0,0

I think it's time to buy some new towels PALAZZO.  I also did not care for the mattress or pillows. Way too soft in my opnion. I like my mattress and pillow on the harder side (temperpidic!!). Other than these small complaints, the hotel was good. We had a window facing the Venetian and Treasure Island, so we we right in front of the fireworks on NYE, which was great because it was a madhouse on the Strip.",0,0,0

I absolutely loved my stay at the palazzo. After a day of walking around the strip and checking out the other hotels in the area, I the palazzo was a winner.

1-I loved how low key the place was. After the hussle and bustle of Vegas life, I really appreciated coming back to my lovely, serene, charming palazzo suite with an amazing view of the city and the mountains. the sunken living room was a nice touch, the three flat screens were a bit excessive, and the spacious bathroom was much appreciated.

The windows were humongous and I loved sitting on the sill and watching the city and sunset, although I do wish they made the sill bigger with cushions. 

Everyone was extremely friendly, and the service was excellent. Although I found out it was 45 min wait and plus additional charges to bring a water kettle to the room which was pretty ridiculous. 

Besides that, everything else was great, and you won't be disappointed at the palazzo. :)",2,1,1

  I haven't stayed at the Venetian in a long time but what I didn't like about the rooms at the Venetian besides the decor was if the lack of privacy.  If you were in bed with someone and somebody came into the room they would be able to see as soon as the door opened.  Not at the Palazzo.  The entrance hallway at the Palazzo adds to the feel of privacy and security.

up on the dining table.

Both of these hotels are fairly identical with a slight difference in design cues. The rooms are still one of my favorites after so many years of coming to Las Vegas. These large suites are always in tiptop condition and nicely decorated. I have never had a bad experience staying in one of their rooms. 

I want to talk about their beds. Their beds are hypnotic.. The moment you lay your body on to one of these queen size blocks of heaven, you will never want to get up. Their pillows, comforter, and sheets will make your dreams impossible to come true. I always want to sleep-in  when I stay here. 

The restrooms are large and lit, with double sinks and a toilet closet to keep the stinky stuff quarantined.

The casino at this hotel is for high-rollers if you want to play Double Deck Black Jack. $50 Minimum on a slow day. That's pretty tough to me, I would just find a cheap shoot game to spend time on and end up losing. 

We went to the pool during and had a nice time drinking and lounging. The Palazzo and the Venetian share a great number of pools, and there's always space. There serve alcohol at the pools but no food which I find weird.

The room was first class all the way.  The toiletry amenities were very nice, smelled like limoncello.  The only knock on the room, there was spoiled food in the minibar and it did not smell nice.  Don't buy the food from the mini bar.  There was one obscene part to the hotel nickel and diming that I have to call out.  Everyone knows that if you want to go with carry on luggage, then you have to leave the razors at home.  Knowing that I think it's absolutely SHAMEFUL to charge $14 in the hotel gift shop for 3 disposable Bic razors.  The same razors were $6 at the Walgreens on the outside of the property.

Some other positive things worth calling out... the sportsbook was awesome (see my review of Lagasse's Stadium).  A Coffee Bean shop right at the entrance to the elevators... a genius stroke!  An amazing array of restaurants on site.  And of course the Canyon Ranch Spa Club (see my review).

Palazzo, you were so good to us during our Vegas trip! Let me count the ways...

1. The large suite was SAH-WEET!! 3 LCD TVs in the room (including the bathroom), one for each one of the Three Miss Yelps. Swank and modern decor. Velvet chaise lounges and sofas in our sunken living room for us to chill and use as fun props in our impromptu photo shoots. The beds were so comfortable, and the blackout curtains could have made us sleep until 3pm if some of us didn't have such precise internal clocks.

2. The service was top notch! Our request for extra goodies for our room were accommodated quickly, and a follow up phone call from the concierge was made to make sure we received everything we needed. One of the concierge, Angie, was so sweet and helpful. If it hadn't been for her recommendations, we would have missed out on dining at Okada in Wynn and Koi in Planet Hollywood. The doormen were also all super friendly!

3. The hotel is gorgeous! The newest resort\/casino on The Strip, it offers the finest amenities, shopping and dining. Nestled between the fabulous Wynn and Venetian resorts, we were able to walk to each one easily (cabbed it to all other casinos, which is usually $10\/way). The pool area is beautiful, and if you rent a cabana, it comes complete with a flat screen TV.

4. The room rates were a steal! Our 2 queen beds suite was a mere $209\/night. Although wi-fi was not free, it was only $10\/day. 

5. On our final day in Vegas, we decided that I would try my luck at the tables. We scoped out the blackjack tables, and as we were walking by, one of the dealers, Damion, asked us how we were doing. I got a good vibe from him and the rest of the players so I joined in. $15 minimum to play, I dropped down $40. Damion and the other guys at the table were super friendly and fun to play with. They even let me stay in the game when I only had $10 left. The player to my right gave me $15 of his chips to keep me alive when I lost my last chips. I walked away from the table 15 minutes later with $90!! You can call me Lady Luck. ;)",25,16,34

after the regular four hour drive for a christmas eve (not too shabby with 2 kidlets under 4), we checked in around 3ish straight to the concierge lounge. the room is huge with the sunken living room that has a pull out bed. yes, this was where i hit the sack and to my surprise, it was comfy. even the kidlets preferred a slumber party with auntie.

the other complaint was the valet. granted there is always a wait especially for vegas hotels but as we call for ""express service,"" we still had to wait. we weren't the only ones noticing this problem. apparently, they are aware of this and hopefully are trying to work on it.

We had a large suite sized room, but I believe there are larger suite rooms.

There was no fridge or coffee in the room. Of course, there was the mini-bar. It had a crazy sized bathroom with a toilet in a separate room. Double sinks. There was a large sectional sofa which doubled as a double bed.  However, despite knowing that we were a family of four, there was no bedding provided for the sofa. And it was annoying that there are only three towels.  

I did like that there was a coffee bean and tea leaf just downstairs. And that there was security checking room keys at the elevators. Parking was easy and convenient. And it is located in a great location on the strip. It's also connected to the Venetian. I would definitely stay here again although I was annoyed at the $28 per day resort charge tacked on at the end.  Why is this not considered a scam? I know all the hotels do it. Why is it not just tacked on to the rate of the room? Seems so deceptive? Can you choose not to pay it?",0,1,0

Fast forward to check in:

We get into the room and I rush to the restroom. When you gotta go, you gotta go. I look at the toilet and there are dried up urine stains on the porcelain toilet. 

I called the front desk right away and made it clear that this was unacceptable. For an hour I got bounced around from room to room and every room had disgusting and half-done cleaning jobs. I was passed on from customer service reps to security personnel to finally a housekeeping manager who FINALLY informed me that they are looking into it.

I am not a big gambler or drinker, and I have had some bad experiences in prior visits to the city, even though I had stayed previously at the MGM and the Four Seasons Resort.

I can say that hands down, this was my best visit to Vegas.  My suite was beautifully designed and comfortable, and I liked to joke that I took several swims in the luxurious tub.  I felt very comfortable there, to the point where I forgot the strip and the masses were 30 something floors below.

The staff were fantastic as well.  In the VIP lounge, where I did not frequent despite 24 hour access, the concierges on hand called me by name, adding that personal touch.  While it was unpredictable when cleaning crews would come to clean the rooms, it was truly no bother to ask for 10 minutes to gather myself and let them do their work, which was impeccable.

Beyond the many shops and restaurants on premesis, you could also receive free classes on various games, with patient teachers who gave insiders tips on a better gaming experience (I was with an organized group, so we had our own class...craps had always been an enigma for me, and at least now I have some knowledge of the game).

Additionally, you recognize that ""Mr. A,"" the owner of various properties as well as various news outlets, truly cares about his staff, and lets that shine through.

Check in was smooth and the agent was friendly and professional.  She did try to upsell to the ""premium view"" room for $45\/night.  Wasn't super pushy, so I wasn't bothered by the offer.  (I declined, as I would have purchased that option upfront if I wanted.)

Room was clean.  We had an issue with our shower drain.  Very slow.  Bad on us, though, we didn't report it.  I would have liked a few more outlets.  I was surprised not to see any USB charging ports.  Ended up charging my device off my Chromebook.  Motorized blinds were cool.

My gf used the pools almost every day.  She enjoyed them... especially not having to pay for a chair like at another Vegas hotel we previously stayed.  Towel service added a nice touch in that they offered to make up your chair for you.  (And, while a nice offer, is it really that hard to put your own towel on the chair?)

Prices are high at the restaurants.  Not necessarily the fault of the Palazzo and more of a trend in general.  Paid $15 for a hot dog and fries at the place by the pool.  Wasn't anything special.  Our combined meal at I Love Burgers was over $50.

Perfect perfect perfect sized bathroom to share with 2 other females. 

Now for the Cons...yes there are some.

We were then invited to accept the ""opportunity"" to upgrade our stay for a low low price for a larger suite- which we declined. We were then told we could either accept a smoking floor (we had intentionally requested non smoking), pay foe the larger suite, or take a room with two queen beds. We decided to take the two queen option despite paying for a king bed. We got to the room just in time to let the frustrations die down only to have them reignited by a lovely view of the air conditioning units. It felt like we were staying in a basement dungeon. The following day we got back after dinner and decided to have room service dessert- tiramisu and crem brûlée. An hour and a half later no dessert had arrived so we made a call down. They said they had just left with the order- aka they either never placed it or forgot about it. The 37 dollar dessert was pre-made bulk tiny bowls of mediocre substance that had developed a firm outer skin due to sitting out too long. The crem brûlée did even have a hard sugar crust that the dessert is known for. The Palazo was an utter disappointment. We have been coming to Vegas for a very long time and I have even previously worked for Caesars Entertainment.

For me, it was my 60th birthday and my wife and I had made reservations at the Venetian hotel for a 3-day stay. When we arrived, we requested a room with a view and the clerk suggested upgrading to a room with a view of the Strip for an extra $45 per day. So, what the hell, we did! I'm only going to be 60 once, right? Oh, and the upgraded room happened to be in the Venetian's new boutique hotel within a hotel, called the Palazzo.

Let me start by saying that the Venetian hotel is absolutely beautiful and the Palazzo hotel was reachable by just a short walk through the Venetian hotel\/casino itself.  But, let's face it, the Palazzo is newer and it is ""special"". Everything about the Palazzo was so tastefully done! From the gorgeous rugs, to the beautiful marble floors and walls, to the lights, everywhere you looked, it was stunning!

And the suite we rented blew us away. It was huge. I think it was around 720 square feet, according to the spec sheet. A king size bed, beautiful bathroom, a separate living room, and 3 TVs (yep, there was a flat screen TV in the bathroom!). The linen (according to my wife, who knows such things), was exquisite - all I know is they felt good to the touch. 

And the view - wow! We were on the 48th floor overlooking the Strip and it looked great - and different - morning, afternoon and evening. If you wanted to get a great view of Vegas at night, our suite was the place to be. 

The Palazzo is also in a great location. Across the boulevard is Treasure Island and the Wynn is across another street. The Mirage, Harrah's, Ceasar's, all the way down to Bellagio, is not far and can be walked with no problem. Of course, when you add in all the walking you do in every casino, you could end up with blosters before you are done, which is what happened to us - but that is hard to avoid (note to self - next time bring mole skin).

I read a number of complaints about the beds being too hard at the Palazzo, and my wife and I agree that the beds were very firm, but we both slept comfortably, with no pains, other than our feet.

I should also say that we were both surprised by how quiet the hotel was. If it weren't for the rare occasion when someone slammed a door, we'd have felt we were the only people in the hotel! And for being on the 48th floor, the elevators were amazingly fast. Even on Friday night, when the hotel started really filling up, the wait for an elevator was very short.

All in all, we really had a great time at the Palazzo and definitely recommend it for a special occasion visit to Las Vegas.",2,0,1

Ok well more so for the atrium because I can't really afford anything really at the Shoppes at Palazzo, truth be told.

I honestly just love coming to view the seasonal decorations in their atrium\/waterfall area of the hotel.  Amongst the water features, fountains, and high ceilings, the centerpiece is the mammoth waterfall that cascades from the level above to the casino floor.  A showstopper in its own right, guests and tourists alike will surely find this a true Vegas photo op.  I've had the opportunity to visit the Palazzo during the 2010  holiday season, with my most recently this past spring, and I appreciate the time and effort that is put into decorating this area for the current season.  

Once more, waterfalls and decorations aren't the only attractions, as the Palazzo offers the requisite casino, bars, and restaurants, with these including Dos Caminos and CUT.

There is plenty to do on the property, which is so convenient.  My family spent mornings at the pools, as did plenty of other families.  It is the best time to be at the pool because most people are sleeping in.  Self parking is free in the attached garage.

There were a few things that cause me to dock a star.  The first one is major for me and that is the air conditioner.  It is awesome during the day but at night it can't keep up.  We all woke up hot both nights and I checked the thermostat to find the room was 5 degrees warmer that what we had it set at.  We may have been okay if the comforter on the bed wasn't 10 lbs.  It was seriously very heavy.  So odd to me that hotels always put such heavy comforters on beds when it is so hot outside.  It was 108 degrees in Vegas while we were there.  Anyway, the fitted sheet on my bed had 2 small holes on it.  That's not a huge deal, but a nice hotel like this shouldn't have holes in the sheets.  If the person laundering\/folding the sheet didn't catch it, the person putting the sheet on the bed should have.  There was a sticky spot on the bathroom floor.  Eww.  What was that?

The rooms are large and well designed. A slightly elevated bedroom section connects to a living room with its own 40-in TV, desk, and expansive couch. The bedroom section also has a flat panel TV. The king size bed I used was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've slept in. With that said, however, I hated how the night stands next to each side of the bed was basically unreachable if you were lying in bed. What is the point of having a night stand if I actually have to pull myself out of bed every single time I need to turn off the lamp, look at the clock, or put down a book?

The bathroom was expectedly grand. It included a separate shower, sauna, two sinks, and a toilet. As I alluded to earlier in my review, everything in the Palazzo that is related to the room or the facilities of the hotel are great, but it is the service that I have a serious problem with. 

Service:

First of all, our check-in process was long and delayed. At other high-end hotels on the strip, there are normally numerous front desk employees to serve you. Furthermore, even if there were large lines, there would be line ushers to guide you where to go. The Palazzo welcomed us with a very large, winding line, and it took my gf almost 25 minutes just to check in on a slow Monday (end of the memorial day weekend too!). 

Secondly, the amenities in the room are quite lacking. Besides the Motel-6 basics of a shampoo, soap, and conditioner, there were no q-tips, no shower cap, no cotton balls, no robes, and no slippers. I specifically requested for slippers and they did bring them to me, though I'd like the room to be stocked a little better so guests don't always have to ask for some of these mandatory bathroom items. 

Lastly, it was literally impossible to get a hold of a person at the front desk. I have never been on hold so long in my life at a high-end hotel. I had to call three times just to get someone to answer the phone! We requested a late-checkout but was denied with a simple ""we are currently offering 12pm checkout."" Aren't most hotel establishments 12pm checkouts? Then why do you make it sound like you are doing ME a favor by ""offering"" me a 12pm checkout? Absurd. 

Overall:

If you desire not only the look and feel of a 5-star hotel in Las Vegas, but also the service and fine amenities that are assumed to be included in such a rating, do NOT go to the Palazzo.  By far, Encore is still my personal favorite in the luxury hotel category in this city (see my review for further details).",2,0,0

The shopping at Venetian\/Palazzo is very good for high-end items.  A great place to window shop if you are not in the market for million-dollar cuff links.

The Palazzo was home to the 40\/40 club, but they ran that out pretty quickly.  Now, it is setup as a celebrity chef's location.  I cannot recall exactly what it is.  The Lamborghini dealership is fun, for a minute.  Vegas is the only place where they charge people to look at cars for sale.  If you don't want to pay, the other option is to eat at the Dal Toro cafe and see the cars for free.  Having eaten there, I can tell you that you are better off paying to see the cars if that is what you want to do.

All in all, a flop in my opinion.  If it wasn't for the fact that the Venetian is such a hit, and the Palazzo is sandwiched between Venetian and Wynn (another hit), it would have closed already.",0,0,1

Hotel staff is constantly helpful and friendly. The suites are modern, clean, and roomy - enough for 4 people to fit comfortably in a full king bed, a pull out sofa bed and the L shaped sofa. 

The reason I am giving Palazzo a 4 star review is because I booked my room through Priceline or Hotwire and I called a few weeks before arrival to request 2 beds instead of the standard 1 king. The operator on the phone told me I'll be put on a list because they are all booked up for the two beds and haven't received cancellations. She said I should ask upon check-in. Upon checking in, I asked if I could get two beds instead of 1 because we had 3 people. For some reason she just asked if we would like to upgrade for another $150 for 2 beds. That was really shady of them to upsell when I already requested 2 beds over the phone with them before my trip. Other than that, the check in experience was ok, but my request isn't unusual by any measure. Kind of lame to sell you on what you requested when there shouldn't be an extra charge.

Everything in Vegas is man made so I wasn't overly wowed by the beauty of the hotel. It's luxurious, sure, but seeing the greed just 20 steps before getting on the elevators to the room isn't very pleasing (ie casino).

Given that our online confirmation detailed our reservation for us, we expected the hotel to abide by that contract. However, our booking confirmed our room would be available at 3PM, but when we got to the front desk to check in, they said our room would not be available until 6PM, but as a ""courtesy"", they could give us a phone call if they could be ready before 6PM.

Okay, so a 3 hour delay. That's not a killer, right?

Next up, is the fact that once they did call us  that our room was available at 5PM (yay, went down to a two hour delay), we got to our room and found that our room key cards did not work. The front desk had promised that our key cards would be activated right away, and we found that was completely incorrect. 

We called the front desk and they sent up a security card to help us out. It took him over 15 minutes to come up and then blamed us for their faulty activation, saying that we had put it next to our cellphones and that's how they deactivated. Even if that were to happen, my key card was nowhere near my phone, and what are the chances that both key cards, in different locations, both deactivated? Please don't give us attitude and blame us for your negligence of not activating the card. Even if it was our fault, the attitude was completely unnecessary and unwarranted. 

The pros? Gabriela at the concierge desk was amazing. She was the most wonderful and considerate person, going the extra mile to help us when we needed to get to a show on time. Gabriela, you are the reason for the extra star. 

The suite we stayed in was clean and orderly. The beds and restroom were nothing out of the ordinary, and the walls were thick enough that we had uninterrupted sleep, besides a few instances of rowdy patrons. 

Overall, I would come back and stay at the Palazzo, but only if I did not make any reservations to get somewhere on time upon checking in or plan to receive satisfactory customer service.

The place is still not 100% complete but it's close.  They just have a few details to finish off and they'll be perfect.  The only bad thing I can think of was that there was no Tmobile repeater installed at the time of my visit.  This meant that ALL Tmobile phones did not work in the Casino area.  Very troublesome for me and my friends since most of us had tmobile.  We pretty much had to scour the whole casino floor to find one another or run up to the rooms too look.  This isn't Palazzo's fault though, it's Tmobile's for not supplying the repeater quick enough.

The rooms are just like the Venetian's, just a little bit bigger.  I was just at Venetian in December so the rooms are almost exactly the same since Venetian recently remodeled all their rooms.  The beds were comfy and we had a 38fl view of the strip and Wynn which was ok.  Not much else to say of the rooms since we spent most of our time in the Casino.

The Casino was perfect to me.  A lot of people complain about the size but it suited me fine.  I guess other people like getting herded like sheep.  That is the main reason why most casino floors are so large with everything scattered all over.  They want you to get ""lost"" so you end up playing something you weren't even looking for.  This wasn't the case at the Palazzo.  Every table game was in the center of the circular casino which made it easy to jump to whatever game I wanted.  No more walking through wall after wall of slot machines just to get to a different table game.  

The staff was excellent.  The pit bosses, cocktail waitresses and dealers were great.  I even got introduce to a host named  Earl who came in very handy.  We wanted to check out Tao Nightclub that  night and he was able to put us on the guest list last moment.  I've heard over and over that Tao will not let you in without a 1 to 1 ratio of girls but I figured since we were on the list it was ok.  Not so, when we got there they would not let us in unless we ""picked"" up some random girls.  I refuse to stoop to that level just to get into a club so I called Earl up and explained the situation.   He personally showed up at the door and got us in with no wait.  I have to give him props, no wait, no girls, no line with hundreds of people waiting in the various ""guest"" lines etc.  More on Tao in my Tao review.  The staff at the Palazzo have won me over.

The decor of the Palazzo alone is very well done. Right now, everything is fall-themed (which I love) and it's a sight in itself just to see all the details within the decorations (as it is with any other luxury Vegas resort).

Girls' Summer Trip 2008

Fabulous Six decide to head to Vegas for their annual Summer Trip.  After the initial rave reviews of Palazzo, FS decide to book a room at the relatively new hotel.

Walking into the grand, beautifully appointed lobby, FS were impressed.  Lush! they exclaimed.  Hearing beforehand that Palazzo was strict with their occupancy policy, only four of the six girls headed to the check in counter.  ES and Cathy K opted to head over to the casino to get their gambling on straightaway.

The two circled the casino... twice... in five minutes.  Surely this was a mere illusion!  Surely the casino cannot consist of so few tables!  Surely there was another pit!  Surely there was more!  Unfortunately - no. No more. What you see is what you get.

Dejected, they tried out the tables, only to walk away 10 minutes later crying, ""Palazzo casino sucky! No tables and bad luck!"" The two made their way up the lavishly mirrored elevators and stepped into their room.

Bathroom first!  Elegantly appointed decor, for sure.  Large mirrors everywhere, marble inlays everywhere, gold embellishments everywhere, big flat screen, big tub, big shower, and... oh!  Robes and slippers in the closet! Yay!

Sunken living room featured ample sitting space, what with the giant L-shaped couch, ottomans, armchairs - lots and lots of seating!

Two widescreen LCDs were tuned to various channels, and the FS tossed back many Grey Goose + Pineapples.  Soon, the FS were thoroughly trashed and ready to hit the town...

Fast forward to 6am.  The girls return from an outrageous night. Actually, they only came  back to the room because security in the teeny tiny Palazzo casino threatened to kick us out for being too rowdy.  *huff*  What to do now?  Cathy K called down to the front desk and had a nice little chat with the employee.  Pool - closed.  Most restaurants - closed.  Sucky!  Any suggestions? - Nope. Sigh.

10am the rest of the girls awake.  The FS threw on their skimpy suits and head to the pool.  WTF?!  Did all of Vegas come to visit this pool?  Claustrophobic, the FS decided to just walk over to the pool at Venetian.  Ahh, much better.

The girls dine at Delmonico's for dinner.  Fat from the ribeyes, they decided to go back to their room and take Nap #2 before another outrageous night on the town.

The FS tottered to the Palazzo elevator.  Just in time!  An open elevator door!  The girls pushed the button for their floor and.... and... and...

The elevator door stayed open.  What the...?  Cathy K impatiently jabbed the ""Door Close"" button.  At that, the elevator gave a mighty lurch.  With reflexes of cats, the FS jumped out of the lurching contraption and into another one across the hall.

Deja vu?  This elevator lurched, too!

Screaming, everyone ran out.  One by one, all the elevator doors slid open and stayed that way.  Confused and scared Palazzo guests milled about the hallway, trading information\/rumors.  A terrorist attack?  A malfunction?  An emergency evacuation?  A celebrity?  No one could know for sure.

A uniformed guard approaches the crowd. He announces that the elevators will not be operating for the next 20 minutes. Then, one by one, he points to the FS and beckons them to follow.  Oh  no!  What did they do?

The mutely followed behind the fat man, their hot pink dresses attracting unwanted attention during the unexpected Walk of Shame. People whisper. Bad girls they must be!

They walked into an employee entrance and followed the guard around the corner into... an employee elevator!  Special treatment for the HOT pink FS!  Yayers!  Unlike the other unlucky guests, the FS got a special escort to their rooms and had the time to enjoy their beauty rest!

Fast forward...  The FS ventured back down to the lobby with no plans. Clubs? Of course.  Which one?  Wherever the wind took us.  Then they are approached by a promoter and escorted into the new 50\/50 club.  Nice and plush, the interior, but TOTALLY DEVOID OF CROWDS. Wtf? They were practically the only ones there!  Afraid of hurting anyone's feelings, the FS pretend to stroll to the patio for a smoke, and climb over the gate, and out to freedom.  They hit up Tao, Pure, and other random hotspots before finally trudging back to Palazzo and straight into bed.

The next morning.  The girls pack up and wish Vegas a tired and wistful goodbye.  They call for baggage service (they had about 20 suitcases between the six of them) and wait patiently for the bellhop to arrive.  Two hours pass, and he is nowhere in sight.  SIGH.  LK decides to go downstairs to grab a coffee while they wait.  She comes back 10 minutes later sans coffee.  Turns out, every elevator was so full, she couldn't get on!

The FS didn't actually get to check out until way after 2pm.  Palazzo elevator system sucks!

Broken elevators, empty clubs, dinky casino, nothing to do - BOO!. At least the rooms and security were nice.  Gonna stick to Bellagio in the future.",6,7,5

- Lobby is nice, open. You do not feel like you are immediately in a casino. Check-in in 5 minutes at about 7pm Friday night. They had all my booking information and preferences correct. 

- Wide open, short, straight shot to the elevators. You don't have to wind your way through the casino floor to get there. 

- The suite room was nice, clean, large. You can look up the details, no point in repeating them. 21st floor. View of the strip. You can see the TI pirate boat show across the street. Beds were comfortable. 

- Staff was friendly. Guy at the Spago restaurant next to the pool went out of his way to make a blended coffee drink for my girl. 

- Main pool is shaded til about 1:00pm this time of year. I actually liked that. They check for your room key. Lounge chairs in the shallow section of the pool. Could have used a few more servers but otherwise good service. Both of us liked the views :) 

- Taxis lines were relatively short. Less than 5 minutes just about everywhere we went. 

Final note - they are serious about checking your Id's. Wanted to check out the Azure club part of the pool and we didn't have our IDs with us. It's been, ahem, a long, long, time since anyone asked for my ID. Must be a Vegas thing.",1,0,0

Stayed here on our vegas trip this past weekend and it was so relaxing. The rooms are really clean and the beds are very plush. It's very classy and the amenities they provided had everything you'd need. All the amenities are in this little box which include ear swabs, nail filer, sewing kit, shower cap, etc. They also include bath robes and slippers! The shower and bath tub are separate, I actually liked the shower more because of the back massage built in it. Such a great feature to use especially after a long day\/night of partying. I also liked the double sinks and the hair blow dryer was actually strong, not like the weak ones you'd find at cheaper hotels. The suites in here are huge, the living room has 3 tables, a pullout sofa bed, and fax\/printer. The automatic blinds were also a nice touch. I would have to say this is one of my favorite hotels, better than the room at The Wynn.

We had a great view of the pools (I believe there were 7 pools at this casino). We also paid extra for access to The Prestige room in the Palazzo. It was so awesome! Basically you can skip the buffet line and just grab food at The Prestige to bring back to your room. Breakfast had lots of items like boiled eggs, oatmeal, fruits, assorted pastries, coffee, scrambled eggs, bacon, etc etc. they also serve many different items for lunch & dinner. The Prestige is a huge room and really fancy, you're not allowed in if not properly dressed.

The casino floor isn't that great here and not as lively as other casinos, but there are plenty of shops & restaurants in the hotel. Just like the Bellagio, they have an area where they decorate with different holiday\/seasonal themes and it's really pretty.",6,4,4

When we walked into the lobby, there was a short line and someone there to greet us as we waited. She offered suggestions on where to eat and what to do for entertainment. Check in was a breeze and I was happy I wasnt spending more of my Vegas time trying to get situated. 

Our room was beautiful! Everything looked brand new. The King bed was so comfortable and the sitting\/living area really was useful for hanging out with friends for drinks before heading downstairs. 

Unfortunately, the tables and slots were stingy when we were there but I wasnt surpised. I didnt see one person hit it big the 3 days we were there. Odds are definitely better at your local indian casino or even Reno or Tahoe. 

Most of the hotels have a resort fee and the Palazzo is no different. $33 a day tacked on to your bill. Didnt use any of the amenities that supposedly came with the charge.

When we finally checked in and got to our rooms and requested our bags, they called in 15 minutes asking if we already had our stuff bc they can't find it. Then 15 minutes later they bring our stuff and they lost 4\/5 dresses on hangers AND brought up the empty box! no alcohol or snacks.

Some were still missing and all the snacks were gone. Leonard was the manager of guest services and he was diligent in trying to take care of the situation but Michael was of no help. Leonard offered us $100 food credit for the missing items but no note of it was made.

This means that you have plenty of space if you want to stay in Vegas with your friends.  You have a step down living area, along with a spacious bedroom area.

Interestingly, the Venetian hotel's suites are only 650 square feet.  So you actually get more for you money here at Palazzo instead of the connected Venetian hotel.

Another cool thing about the Palazzo is that the free self-parking is located directly under the casino floor.  This means that when you park your car and take the parking elevator up, it leads you right into the casino lobby.  How cool is that, you don't have to walk too far once you parked your car.

One bad thing about the Palazzo is its location.  It is a little too north for my taste.  I like the center strip location (i.e. Bellagio, Caesars), where it feels like the action is better and more fun.

Overall, a nice hotel, and you'll get more room and pay less here than at the Venetian.",6,3,5

I came here for prom, my friends and I rented out a room for a night. (Which was in April 2015, doing a review now because I just recently made a yelp account)
When you first walk to try to get to the elevators you are not able to pass through unless you have a key card, I personally really liked that because it made me feel a bit more safe.

The room is really big and spacious. I think we got a suite, not so sure. Our room had two beds and it's very soft and like I said a very big room.
The bathroom was very nice, I like how there is a separate room for the toilet.
I believe in totally the room had like three tv's; one in the bathroom, one in front of the beds, and one in the mini living room area.

In the mini living room there was an 'L' shaped couch, that  also pulls out for an extra bed if needed.
Then a dresser thing that held the tv and the fridge.
Everything in the fridge and on top of the dresser has a weight sensor thing so don't touch anything unless you really need it.
By the way warning when you look at that dresser thing, on the top they have stuff on it. Don't touch them especially if you find one of the items on it funny.
I got charged like $80 because my friend touched this thing they had on it called ""intimacy kit"" and they just had to touch it. ()
Luckily I was able to get the charge removed after I had to embarrassingly explain what actually happened.

The blinds in the room Is also automatic, there was a remote for it by the bed that's closer to the window and under the air vent.
Also the view from the room was pretty nice, our room was facing the back so we got a view of the airport and the swimming pools.
Talking about swimming pools, it's really nice.
I think they had like more than 5 swimming pools and it even connects to the Venetian hotel swimming pools.

For check out I was told you could check out on the TV so I did that and then you can grab the receipt at the front desk. Which I had to do because everything was under my sisters card and because I found out my sister got charged extra because of the incident with the weight sensor I mentioned earlier.

I view the sofa and holy Jesus Christ in Heaven it is utterly spackled, fully slimed and encrusted with wads of cum. Not even a stretch of embellishment here in my description. On every sitting surface in the whole room there is a dried male semen like a Japanese bukkake porn was filmed there.

A call to the front desk and the use of some appropriate keywords furnished the end result of an upgrade to the siena suite. The new room was merely satisfactory, if only because we weren't charged extra for it.

After this initially harrowing experience, the remainder of my stay was pleasant. I was happy to have dined at SushiSamba (peruvian corn oh my god), CUT ( amazing carpaccio with truffle shavings, incredible wagyu ribeye), Table 10 (this place sucked, sorry Emeril), and Bouchon (oh my lord Duck Confit!!!).

Huge rooms that truly are all suites with sunken living rooms, great views, and wonderful amenities. And the little touches, like TV's in the bathroom that face the jacuzzi tub. 

The pool is a bit quieter than the one at Venetian, but you can walk back and forth if you wish. The casino itself is elegant, but nothing truly jumps out at you. And if you want to play poker, you'll need to head across the way to the sister property. But the sports book downstairs, Lagasse Stadium, is incredible. Full of TV's and laid out like an actual sporting venue, the food is like a cross between a sports bar and high end gourmet. Emeril did a wonderful job with the menu and it makes it a great place to watch a game. Call ahead and get seating for the ""stadium"" that faces the big screen in the middle, but keep in mind there's a spending minimum if you want to sit there. They also offer the rather awesome in-game wagering via tablet computer. 

The shopping on the esplanade between the two properties is a lot of fun. The dining options like B & B and the Cantina are all excellent, but fans of Asian food rave about Woo. It's not as much my deal, but a destination for people that love it. And I say RUN, don't walk, RUN to Wolfgang Puck's Cut and have a steak dinner. Best steakhouse in Vegas hands down. This is not a debate, it's a fact.

The service and staff are accommodating and top notch. The $20 bill trick works here too, as I've ended up with a suite that had two bedrooms and a pool view for four nights using it.

Encore is probably a step above, but they don't treat poker players nearly as well. So this place gives you the best of Venetian, and a little more.",2,0,1

The suite is spacious and fancy - marble countertops and such. There was even a remote control for the curtains! Wow! Lots of pillows on the bed, so you can choose flat or fluffy. Only one minor complaint, I realize that the mini-fridge full of overpriced drinks is a standard thing, but I was bit annoyed there wasn't room to shove in my leftover half sandwich from a late night snack. Oh, and the note on the fridge says you will automatically be billed for drinks taken, so no dice on temporarily moving bottles out. 

Love the bathroom and bathroom amenities. Glass walled stand-up shower, bathrobes, a nice tub and another TV in there. There was a little box with q-tips, a shower cap and even a mini sewing repair kit. Okay, I didn't need to use it, but it was thoughtful. I was bemused by the phone right next to the toilet. 

Situated close to the Venetian, Mirage, Treasure Island, Wynn, and Fashion Show mall. Some construction was going on out but it was no bother. The hotel restaurants were good although typical Vegas pricey- I enjoyed the Canyon Ranch Cafe and Espressamente Illy. Also there's a Walgreens right out front, convenient for getting things like bottled water. 

We took a brief visit to lounge at the pool deck. They offered oranges! I don't like oranges, but it was a nice touch. In all fairness though, the pool boys should be shirtless if the pool girls have to walk around in bikinis and a skirt.",1,1,1

I've stayed all over the strip and I have to admit this was one of my best experiences in a Vegas hotel. The staff was friendly and accommodating, the rooms were beautiful and classy, the over all feel of the hotel was fantastic. 

We had a large group so we decided to book two suites. They were able to give us two adjoining suites so we could all be together. It was perfect! The suites had two beds, an el shaped couch, and one of the sides pulled out. The bathrooms had both a shower and a bathtub and lots of mirror spaces which made it that much easier to get ready among eleven other girls. 

We had brunch at Lavo on Saturday and we were impressed with the quality and taste of the food. 

The layout of the hotel were perfect, not confusing to navigate like other hotels (ahem..MGM). The casino led right to the lobby one one side and the elevator to our suite on the other. 

There was a coffee bean located right by our elevator which was PERFECT to roll out of bed in the morning (technically the afternoon..but it's Vegas who cares!).

It is where I can get away from the bright lights, incessant inhaling of second-hand cigarette smoke and the noise of drunken people blowing their life's savings at the gaming tables. I have not had any issue with the various rooms I have stayed in at the wonderful Bellagio so why oh why did I deviate from my norm and give The Palazzo a go? Silly me. Best not to mess with purr-fection, no?

The Palazoo which once, albeit not long ago, may have had its glory day but it is now a zoo of dirtiness and people with bad manners if any. 

Warning: Adult content following:
We checked into our room in the a.m., dropped off our bags and went out. When we got back to the room in the evening we were zonked and I went to sit on the sofa. When I got up I noticed a rough area on the velour. It was, um, crusted over remnants of a man's, er, ""stuff."" As another reviewer mentioned, I understand what goes on and Vegas and all but for this sofa cushion to be so obviously soiled and potentially a serious health issue is inexcusable. Even worse was the management's response which was essentially nothing. We called numerous times over the next 24 hours to get the cushion taken out of the room and replaced but it was not. It was vacuumed but that was did not clean it visually or any other way. No one seemed to care. I am more disappointed by the way the situation was handled than what caused it. Er, maybe not. But for a hotel of this ""stature"" a refresher course at a school of hotel management would be suggested and preferably one that deals with the basic rules of being a gracious host. And basic housekeeping.

In addition, there were stains everywhere, in the room, in the halls, in the public areas...Dishes and glasses left on the floor in the hallways for hours with food all over the carpets. I am looking down now and see cigarette burns in the carpet, food filth and greasy fingerprint ridden mirrors and glass surfaces.

And the internet... I cannot get access in my room but in The Prestige Room I could get free internet. I can go downstairs and sit in front of Cafe Presse and get free internet but am supposed to pay $12.95\/24 hours in my $300+ night suite complete with bodily fluid stains? It's a city not a little town somewhere. Even Best Western offers free internet.

I understand they get so many people they do not need me, but I would never stay here or at one of their other properties again. Oh I would understand one thing. If they comped me everything but yet I still would be hesitant to go as I don;t care to be exposed to hepatitis, AIDS and who knows what else.

For those who think I might be being inaccurate, look at the other yelpers who have reviewed along the same line. It's not just me but other reviewers. Pays to take the time to read them. :(((

Must take a moment to point out three employees who gave us great service: Christopher and Yayoi (hope I spelled that correctly) at check-in and Connie who works the late shift and actually got someone to go to our room and change the sheets. Thank you.

PS The person who promised us compensation for our time and aggravation NEVER followed up. I guess it is ""that kind of hotel""

Same with Gilbert at the front desk you guys made it extremely easy to check in and get settle. The reason why I'm giving this hotel a 2 star is because of them. The rooms were extremely big and came with a mini fridge. However, the fridge was small already but they had a shit ton of small bottles of alcohol in the fridge that we could not move because we would get charged. Fun fact: mostly everything in the hotel is censored so even by moving the item you will get charged. So the mini fridge was useless to us. Then if you touch the robes that are hanging you will get charge 70$. Lol ok. Like if they don't make enough money already. Then we called the front desk for bathroom supplies and we had to call three times to get extra blankets, shampoo, and toilet paper. It took 1-2 hours to get delivered. WTH IF YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO CHARGE FOR EVERYTHING WE TOUCH THEN I EXPECTED for excellent and fast service. Honestly didn't even want to touch the bed because they would probably charge extra.

Nope no one showed and the room continuous ran out of everything, our trash cans were overfilling, and never got new bedsheets. I understand that we will get charged if we use any of the bottles or robe because that's like every hotel in Vegas but if you are going to be a fancy hotel at least give some service to your customer to make their stay more bearable. Honestly I was so disappointed that I'm paying so much money for these rooms and the least they can do is empty our trash cans or tell me where I can empty them. The bell boy Andrew was extremely nice. Lastly, they charged me 380$ roughly for who knows what. Our group did not touch anything or break anything.

And the bathroom is bigger than most city studio apartments with two sinks, a separate room for the toilet, a standing shower and of course a luxurious roman tub. Let's be honest it's all about the tub! With is the perfect end to a day in Vegas regardless of if you are here for work (like I was) or play. 

But this is why I can't bring myself to give this hotel 5 stars. 1) the wine glasses in my room were dirty and my dirty I mean sticky and gross. I removed them from the stay and they were never replaced the whole week I was there. 2) That luxurious bathtub I was raving about, I actually had to clean it up a bit before I could use it as there was black stuff left in the tub. I used to supervise housekeepers and know more than anyone it's a tough job. But that's just not right. 3) The staff throughout the Palazzo didn't seem to know anything about the hotel. Nearly every time I would ask for directions they would not know where to direct me to. 

Overall it was a good experience but kinda disappointing in these other areas.The hotel facilities I'd give 4 stars, the rooms are nice (though starting to show some wear). However service here is a 2 in my book.",1,0,0

The rooms are spacious, well-designed, interesting, beautiful, and full of amenities (and the bathtub and shower were just phenomenal).  The public spaces are gorgeous.  The staff is welcoming and professional.  And the onsite options for recreation and dining are such that you could spend an entire vacation without leaving the property--heck, without even going outside--and have a perfectly fun vacation.

There were a few things, however, that struck me as weird for a hotel of this caliber.  The biggest thing to me was the air conditioning: my system was underpowered (it took me a day to realize if I wanted it at 68, I'd have to set the thermostat to around 63), and it made a TON of noise (and not even constant noise, the changing sounds and volume made it difficult to sleep sometimes).  Beyond that were some more minor annoyances.  The TVs in the rooms were weirdly small, and though they were advertised as HD, very little (if any) of the content accessible on them was high definition (including the hotel's own content, which appeared fuzzy).  The desk chair seemed extremely worn--the cushion was so gone you could see the wood frame outline through the sagging upholstery.  And my room was clearly designed for only 1 bed--the couch\/bench at the end of the bed closer to the door served as something of an obstruction to get to the closet (I believe most of the rooms are identical or almost identical--great for a King setup, but 2 Queens clearly seemed like an afterthought).

With a little more attention to maintenance and detail, this could be a phenomenal property, but even as is, I'd definitely consider returning.",1,0,0

In fact, the last time was in Vegas was about 3 years ago for about 2 days for a friend's wedding. We stayed at The Luxor (don't stay there). So on this particular occasion, my fiance, my little sister and me drove out to Las Vegas on Friday afternoon to meet up with my sister and brother-in-law who were staying there for a conference. We were only staying for one night then coming back the next day. (They treated me to a Cirque De Soleil show for a belated bday gift). So for the one night we stayed, we wanted to stay in nice comfortable place. 

Looking around at the different options in Vegas, one can get overwhelmed. We settled on The Palazzo because it offered a SPACIOUS suite with dual queen beds. The sectional couch also pulled out to a sleeper sofa so it comfortably fit all 5 of us. The suite was beautiful and the view overlooked the strip. There is a sunken living room with TV and sectional couch. The bathroom is EXTREMELY spacious with both a shower and bathtub. There is also a separate room for the toilet WITH A TV. The furniture was modern and stylish. The hotel itself is beautiful and conveniently connected to The Venetian. This allowed us to stroll for days without every leaving the hotel.

We played a little slot and that was also pretty fun. Inside the Palazzo is the Grand Lux Cafe which is DELICIOUS. I really can't be any more pleased with the beauty and convenience The Palazzo provided. The price is on the expensive side, but you really do get what you pay for.

First suite we entered was obviously trashed by the previous occupant and some items, safety hazards, had not been addressed by maid service.  When the sprinkler system is covered in soaked tissue so that occupants may smoke in a smoke-free room, you know something is off.  Had to move rooms.

I was looking for a hotel that had a jetted tub, and I saw that the Palazzo was rated very highly, so I called them up and asked if any of their rooms have jetted tubs; I was told that they all have them. Not true; only the Sienna Suite has them... but I couldn't know that until I arrived to check in, so that was very disappointing.  On top of that, the hotel couldn't honor my request to have an upper level room.  On top of that, even though I did upgrade to the Sienna Suite, which is beautiful with a lot of empty space, I was charged an extra $150 a night, even though i told them that if I had booked on Expedia I would've gotten it much cheaper and if I would've known that not all of the rooms had jetted tubs, specifically the one I got, it would've effected my decision. Nonetheless, the person at the front desk was basically calling me a liar and did not want to bring the manager over to see if they could help me.

The rooms. Unless you like a jetted tub as bad as I do, all the rooms are about the same.  The main difference is the extra space (empty space).  I was disappointed that there was no coffee machine in the room.  I spent forever finding the cafe that only gives you 1 free coffee per day, even though the front desk made it sound like it was an unlimited thing. 

That's the other thing about this place; many of their employees don't know their stuff.  I went to the information desk immediately adjacent to the entrance to the hotel to ask where I'm supposed to pick up my car from valet, and she said it's straight ahead.  It was not; I walked right back in and told her it's actually downstairs and she says, ""oh you wanted to pick up your car""... she's not the only one though.  The valet guys made me wait 5 minutes for my car even though I had called ahead and got there at the scheduled time.  They rambled about how ""I'm VIP"" as if to try and make me feel important.  It was actually insulting that they thought I was an idiot.

However, the resort itself is overwhelming.  There is soooo much to do in one day just inside the resort.  It's an enormous mall with many beautiful places to go.  I recommend Zeffrinos!

Overall, the resort is beautiful, but they are far far far away from anything near 5 star or even 4 star service.  Their attitude and lack of knowledge and care for ybeir guests is a bummer. There are more negative things I could say like how the bell hop took over an hour to come up to help with our luggage even though we called them and we were told they'd be up in 15 minutes tops, and made is wait.  I wouldn't book with them again especially for the price I paid.",3,1,0

The shower was amazing, but the bathtub (seperate from the shower) was pretty normal, didn't have jets or anything. I personally had a great view, but had to p[ay extra for that too. The hallways in the hotel were dark and shady looking (maybe that's what they were going for?). The check-in and restaurant services were great. Dos Caminos had great waiters. They DO NOT have a buffet, because the owner doesn't believe in buffets. 

The thing that ruined my trip to the Palazzo was the HORRIBLE room service. I got there and was starving but didnt want to go to the restaurant because it was 3pn, and we were going to grab something to eat at 7. So i decided to order buffalo wings (tasted amazing). They said it was going to take 20-35 minutes for the wings. 45 minutes later nothing. I called to check on it and they said that they will be there in 10 minutes. 30 minutes later, still nothing. I called to make sure they had the right room and they said that they are on their way. an hour and 40 minutes later, i got my buffalo wings. Not only that, but they charged me 18% for tip, so my buffalo wings actually cost me $24, (it was $15 on the menu + $4 delivery fee + tip). The person who brought my food wasn't very friendly either. Then the someone calls me back from room service and told me that they needed my cc information because they don't charge to the room. Why couldn;t they have told me that earlier?

Anywho, I've experienced A LOT better. Palazzo is definitely not in the same runnings as Venetian, Belagio, or Wynn. I would say that they would be in the same running as Harrah's possibly.

The gentleman who checked us in was kind and 'upgraded' us to a view of the golf course so we could be near my Dads room. I did request a quiet room and the only thing I would say is that we never got any sleep as we could here the nightclub Tao every night under our room. I know this is Vegas, but when you request a quiet room, being right over Tao is probably not the quietest of spots. The beds were comfortable and for the price, this is probably the best hotel location on the strip. Also, they were doing construction right near our room during the day and we had to call the front desk to ask them to stop. They said they were unaware of any construction but they would check into it and lo and behold the noise stopped. Yet, we heard the same banging from my Dads room the next day.

The room was clean and had a great interior with a great setup, three televisions (one in the bathroom), wireless and wired internet, as well as an in-room printer. While the lighting was not the best, the views from the room were excellent and the cleanliness was amazing as well. 

The floor of the casino was a great place to be with good service and friendly dealers. For some reason, I have had great success at the Palazzo and have enjoyed it ever since. 

It's also connected to the Venetian which provides you with a number of excellent restaurant choices from top chefs, ice skating (during the winter months), a trip down the canal, and a number of shops. 

However, what I enjoyed most about the hotel is their rewards program and it will definitely keep me coming back.

When staying at the Palazzo you'll be located near all the hot spots of Vegas.  Walking distance to the hottest clubs: TAO, XS and Surrender.  The customer base is usually much younger than the other end of the strip probably because of the club scene near by.

I'm spoiled by this hotel and it is the only place I want to stay when I go to Vegas! I have stayed at nearly every hotel on the strip, including Wynn and Encore and I think the rooms here are the best.This hotel is beautiful, upscale, and will wow you away with all the lovely Italian decor. I'm reminded of Venice when I come here... except it's much cleaner, lol. Venetian is the original building, while Palazzo is the new building. I've stayed at rooms at both. Rooms in the Palazzo are slighty larger, about 750 square feet, compared to 700 square feet for a standard room at The Venetian. Standard rooms include a living area and THREE TV's! One TV in the ""bedroom"", another in the ""living room"" and another in the bathroom. Living rooms also include a sofa that is actually a sofa bed. What I do not like, is that the cost of a 1 king bed and 2 queen beds are different prices, about $20 difference. If you are pleasant at check in, they may give you a complimentary room upgrade :)

Anyways, I think this hotel has it all... except for the Vegas buffet!! LOL. Anyways, I always LOVE the decor here. There is a beautiful shopping area upstairs, with a gondola outside and inside the hotel. The people on the gondolas will sing... it seems very romantic, and hopefully, one day a guy will take me on it. It's kind of pricey though, about $30 a person, but you can get discounts. The stores are a mix of affordable and higher end stores, so shopping here is quite reasonable. There are also a variety places to eat from casual cheaper food court type places to high end restaurants. The only eatery missing is a buffet!

The club Tao is also found here and it is also beautiful in there. It is located on the second floor of shopping and the club is 3 stories high including a rooftop pool area, which I like the best because I like to be out in the open at clubs. In the summer, it is also a dayclub called Tao Beach. You can also eat and Asian Fusion dinner at Tao and the first floor is actually a more lounge-like atmosphere. I would say that the club here ranks after XS at Encore however, which happens to be my favorite club in Vegas. But if you are staying at the Venetian, there is a separate entry line and you can get free entry passes from the conceirge desk. 

They also have a spa here, with fitness facility that includes rock climbing. using spa facilities will be $25 if you are staying at either the Venetian or Palazzo and about $40 if you are not. 

Lots of fun events ensue here. They have Carnivale in the fall and Winter in Venice in the winter. During both events, there are special performers, singers, and special decoration. I love the Winter in Venice decoration! It is just breathtaking beautiful!! During the winter, also if you gamble and earn enough points, you are invited to attend their Grazie Gifts Extravaganza. Trust me, compared to other hotels, they go all out for this. It is literally like shopping at a store. You check in and then go to another room to ""shop"". Write down what items you want, go check out and they will call you when they have your stuff pulled up and ready for you. While you are waiting, there is water, hot cider, hot cocoa, tea and coffee. It was my first time this year going and I can't wait for it next year!! Other hotels, it's just a computer that you order from...

The main difference between Palazzo and Venetian is that the Palazzo has a non-smoking gambling section and that the rooms are a bit bigger. Price of the rooms are the same at either one. I suggest getting a Grazie card and using it to earn points! That's how I get my rooms comped here!! Wi-fi here is included in the room resort fee... just connect to it! Very easy!

And this place delivers luxury at a reduced cost. Just search for some deals or ask the registration lady and I'm sure you can get a room at a reasonable cost.

The rooms are pretty big. Mine had two queen sized beds with a lower loft with an additional sleeping area for more people. It also had two tv's and a third in the bathroom. And the bathtub can fit two people. Nice bathroom tiles too.

I recommend signing up for the Grazie card; it's a player points card for The Palazzo and The Venetian. You get points for gambling and staying at the either of the hotels. And just charge your purchases at the bars or restaurants to your room so you can rack up on the points. The points get you more perks later on.

There's so much restaurants and shopping and other amenities available on the combined Palazzo\/Venetian campus that I pretty much stayed my majority of the time here. So I racked up even more points.

We wanted to be further down (or is that up) the strip than we usually stay and I wanted to be near the shops and restaurants I wanted to hit so this won the reservation lottery.

The rooms look pretty much to me like their siblings the Venetian rooms.  We asked for a strip view and while not exactly facing the strip (our view was of TI and onwards past Circus Circus) it wasn't bad - beats looking at a heating unit.  The room was well laid out with a mini office center in the room.  Desk, chair, internet access and an in room printer.

The bed was comfy although that padded headboard looked a bit dusty to me.  There was a TV for the bedroom part, the sunken living room part and one in the bathroom.  The bathroom was very room but that tub layout just tanked!  The separate shower was great but that tub?  Getting in and out required some flexibility and part of the vanity wall covered where your head would be so no watching TV while soaking in the tub.

Check-in and out was efficient and pleasant enough, housekeeping was fantastic, but room service messed up our one order.  Told them no nuts on salad bad allergy...guess what came on the salad.  They replaced the salad far quicker than it took to get the original order but I had told them several times no nuts.  Oh well....

We wanted to rent a car one day to go out to Lake Mead and tried to rent one from the rental agency in the hotel...DON'T DO IT!  What they wanted to charge for one day was double what we eventually got a car for from down the street.  

The shopping areas are very nice and opulent and if you don't want to go out into the heat or cold you can spend a great deal of time going from the Palazzo to the Venetian and back again.

Everything about The Palazzo appeals to my every sense of enjoyment ... the cleanliness, courteousness of the staff, efficiency ... you name it, they excel at it!

Checking in at The Palazzo was probably the most enjoyable, hassle-free experience of my life. We walked in at 12 PM and were able to check in immediately despite being told we couldn't before 3 PM. There's service for you. We were automatically upgraded to a suite with a view via the $20 slip trick. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it works. Drop a $20 in between your credit card and ID, spin a good story, and you're on your way up to great, complementary things.

It was a quick walk between the parking elevator, check in desk, and room elevator totally eliminating the need for valet -- for me anyway. I found that driving is completely necessary when staying at The Palazzo if you plan on hitting up anything on the strip save The Venetian or Wynn. Those two hotels are about the only two places worth visiting within walking distance so I wouldn't plan otherwise. If you're staying at The Palazzo, be prepared for cab fares or driving.

Also be prepared to head down to the elevators to let your friends in if they're staying at a different hotel and plan to pre-game or get dressed in your room. Some of the security guys are pretty lax about the room key flash, but others start getting pretty stubborn if your friends aren't slick. 

The upside (and the real reason I chose to stay at The Palazzo) is that it's sinfully close to TAO and LAVO. Close enough to stumble back to your room before you get completely trashed by the last shot you took before you left. Plus? Big plus. I'd say the same thing for Tryst and XS but my motor skills were still intact while I walked back to my room from the Wynn area. I can't say that it was an enjoyable or unpleasant walk, but a cab isn't a bad idea if you want to save your feet for the next venue.

The rooms at the Palazzo are just exceptional. It has an impressively large bathroom with his and her sinks, a full-length mirror, a separate vanity area with a make-up mirror, toilet room, television, and both a shower and bath tub. Awesome. The bed is amazingly comfortable albeit slightly short with a television mounted right in front. Automatic curtains, spacious living room area, office area, complementary wi-fi -- I really don't have a damned thing to complain about in terms of the room.

What did drive me nuts was trying to find the ice room. I walked all over the place looking for a sensibly marked ice area only to discover that you literally have to look at all the room door numbers till you find one that says ""ice"" ... petty, yet the amount of unnecessary walking I did makes me feel like its worth mentioning. ;x!

The parking structure was probably my biggest complaint. It was a constant and serious pain in my ass the entire time. We finally discovered that it was just easier to make our way down to the P4 level and park near the elevator. I, for one, am not down with treks to the elevator doors in 107 degree weather. The only problem is that getting to P4 requires you to follow the tiniest arrows on the parking columns. Some signs would have been such a great savior to all the hair I must have lost. Regardless, I never had trouble finding prime parking once I found P4 and I was there during a fight weekend!

It's nice, clean, and the people have more class.
Walk over to Venetian for the larger casino, but it's a little cramped and a mixed crowd.
Too bad they don't serve Fiji water on the casino floor anymore...I'm actually kinda sad about that.

The Palazzo and Venetian are absolutely GORGEOUS. From the check-in area to the fountains to the indoor-outdoor shopping area to the beautiful large suites, this place has it all. 

Amenities: If you booked at the Palazzo, you really get everything at the Venetian as well, which is awesome. Both hotels have a fabulous selection of restaurants, including SUSHISAMBA, Cut, DB Brasserie and Grimaldi's. Make sure to take advantage of all of the happy hours! In terms of other facilities, you get a really nice pool (and hot tubs), a great indoor rock climbing wall ($25\/person for about an hour with instructors) and the famous Canyon Ranch spa (you can buy a day pass for $30 to get access to all of the different rooms or a service which automatically gets you access to the rest). 

Decor\/Ambiance: The hotel is very elegant-it definitely has an extremely Italian flavor (as to be expected from the name) but also puts a modern spin on things with really long, wide hallways (as opposed to the skinny streets that you see in actually Italy) and open spaces throughout the entire complex. In terms of people generally the crowd is a bit older. The Palazzo side of the casino isn't as populated as the Venetian side. Rooms look very new and are always promptly cleaned. 

Location: The Palazzo\/Venetian are right next to the Wynn and the Core, so it's at the edge of the most populated part of the strip towards the downtown area. Much to my surprise the strip is actually really long, so sometimes at night after going out at another club we would opt to take a car back as opposed to walk, but during the day if you're feeling a stroll you can pretty much see everything you want to see on foot within 45 minutes or so. It's not in the heart of all the action though so if you need everything to be steps away it might be easier to stay at the Bellagio or MGM Grand. The location is still prime though-don't get me wrong! 

Next time I come back to Vegas I want to try another hotel simply because there are so many great ones on the strip, but I know I will always be able to default to the Palazzo!",2,0,2

The Palazzo Hotel is all about luxury, we stayed at the Prestige floor which was a great choice! 
The suite is huge and so beautiful and elegant but the best deal was the Prestige lounge. You can have coffee and tones of drinks all day long, snacks and in the morning you have small breakfast.
The front desk at the Prestige floor will do ANYTHING to make your stay be perfect and help you with anything you will ask; from making the bed at specific time to keep for you spots at the pool. 
Also a great thing about Palazzo is the pool, I loved that they had sallow sides so you can tan in the water or have the kids play safely.

Their comps are really good.  We have tried other casinos ( wynn\/encore).  The Palazzo will give you a good casino rate for the rooms if you open up a players card.  Log in a couple hours of BJ and you'll get something comped.  

Shopping shopping shopping!!! A up scale shopping mall is right on the second floor. :) Louboutin, Jimmy Choo, Tory Burch, DVF, did i mention LOUBOUTINS!!! haha My fav store with my fav sales manager :) Go there!

That's correct...I should have trusted some of the older reviews on here and steered clear of this shit hole...ok ok maybe that's a bit on the harsh side, but this ""luxury"" hotel definitely did not come close to meeting my standards. I booked the Bella Suite for two nights on a weekend. First thing that I noticed when walking in was the overly pungent smell of a 65 year old grandma being pumped through the air vents at seemingly toxic levels. The odor Would have been pleasant if it was about 10x more subtle...rather than hijacking your senses and making you feel a bit lightheaded. Check in was a breeze however and the guy gave us a comp ""upgrade"" to a room with a ""view"". This entitled us to a view of the TI pirate show and the Palazzo pool...which would have been decent except the fact that the view was completely obscured by quite possibly the dirtiest window I have ever seen in my life. If I actually paid the $45 upgrade charge, I would have been furious. I much rather would have taken the standard view of the Wynn instead. The next thing that I noticed was the mass amount of dust build up on the sofa and shelves above the bed..yuck and achoo. Also, there were numerous nicks and scuffs on almost every piece of furniture and wood...even an imprint of an old dirty orange left on the counter top. To top that off there was a Condom in the seat in front of the bed, it was still in the wrapper but..Really?? Did No one even wipe\/clean\/inspect this place? Next observation was the most ill-placed wet bar\/snack bar ever created. It is so inconveniently placed... you Cannot move it or touch it or even Look at it without getting charged some ridiculous fee...which I did. Right about this time is where I started to notice perhaps the worst quality about this dump, the Air. It is sooo dry and stale that it actually made me uncomfortable and unable to sleep well. If you are at All sensitive to this kind of thing, I highly recommend you do not torture yourself with this terrible air quality. I do realize that most hotels are a Bit on the dry side, but this was at another level...You couldn't even turn off the ""fan"" if you wanted to...the AC yes, but the ""fan"" no. I even had to put a towel over the vent to provide just a bit of relief. The Roman Drapes were sort of cool although they were dusty and the remote for them was very weak..this was probably due to the fact that the batteries in them were almost completely corroded with battery acid. The bathroom was pretty nice and spacious although I don't understand why they don't put a fan in the closed off room where the toilet is...the T.V. was cool in there though. I ordered two separate things from the front desk, towels and extra drinking glasses..and both times the service was incredibly slow...taking at least 45 minutes for each. And then there is the bed...the mattress was fairly comfortable but the sheets were stiff, especially the pillows. I would highly recommend bringing your own pillows as they were very stiff and uncomfortable...in fact I'm not even sure if they washed the pillow cases as there were some random eyelashes and small hairs on them. Also, the lighting system is weird with the lights and switches in odd\/annoying places. There is also a resort fee that is supposed to cover local calls (who Really uses this..) unlimited Internet (nothing like going on vacation to use the web) and a daily newspaper...that we Never got Once! The casino was OK...$15 minimum on all tables which is expected I suppose. Had decent luck there but would much rather gamble at some other place. Overall this place was just not worth it.

Very diligent about call backs as well. She managed to get a reimbursement set up, so I'm upgrading this another star. They ended up doing right by the customer, just took them awhile!**

I haven't been so disappointed in a hotel in a long time. Let me be clear, my disappointment is with staff, not with the property. I really like the property (which makes it a 2 star instead of 1), but probably won't be coming back because of the staff. 

My girlfriend left a phone charger in the room, and when I got off of work 4 hours later I went back to get it. Was told to call lost and found the next day, to which they said they didn't have it yet. We then stopped in the day after that to talk to someone in person... And we were given the run around. Bounced from security to concierge back to security, NOBODY giving any answers or taking any responsibility, and a bunch of people shrugging in a ""I don't have any idea what you should do"" kind of way. 

The security guard was older, and just seemed to not care. I told him I work at a similar hotel on the strip, I know phone chargers can go missing. He said yup, sometimes they just disappear (clearly implying employees take them). To which I asked, so because someone takes our phone charger we are SOL? He looked at us and nodded in confirmation. He also said sometimes phones themselves just develop legs and walk out never to be seen again... Really? Glad your employees didn't take a phone worth hundreds of dollars? Thank god it was just a charger? Phew!

Shocked, we asked to file a security report. This is when we were handed over to Daniel, who was far and away the best person we dealt with at the palazzo. He is what customer service should be. He was nothing short of amazing. We walked him through where we left it, he said people leave chargers in that socket CONSTANTLY (it's on the opposite side of the wall divider between living room and the beds). He sympathized, did the report with us and everything. Spent like 30-45 minutes making sure we had everything done and were comfortable. HE was 5 star quality. 

He have me a number in risk management to call to follow up in 3-4 days, and to possibly ask for reimbursement. I waited 2 weeks to call because I was really busy working, but then I left 4 voicemails for Eugene Fitch in risk management over 2 weeks. She never called back. 

I called the general line, and somebody finally called me back a few days later...  Now a month after the stay. They couldn't find my report, but called me back later having located it. The result? Uh...lost and found didn't have it, so there's nothing we can do. 

Well, thanks for nothing Palazzo. You wasted ample amounts of my time, did nothing to fix a new $30 charger being left behind, even though we spent 5-600 dollars on property. I know that isn't a lot compared to other customers, but $30 is so trivial to lose a customer over. It wouldn't have bothered me as much either if the customer service wasn't so bad. I gave them ample time to respond, and got nothing. I don't know if Eugene Fitch actually exists. I can't think of any other customer service where someone would ignore FOUR voicemails!

I find it hard to believe a 5 star establishment operates like this. I feel cheated and taken advantage of, particularly because I wasn't an a**hole to anyone. Someone who wanted to be a jerk would probably have been taken care of, I see that all the time. But because I understand what it's like in the industry, and assumed they would find a solution given enough time... I'm stuck with a ""yeah, nothing we can do.""

Arrived Saturday afternoon for a good friend's bachelor party. There is 5 of us in total staying in a Bella Suite. The room is extremely clean. Practically spotless. Very spacious as well. The bathroom was really roomy. Comes with shower and bathtub. The room cost us $400 for 1 night. $80 a person is not bad at all for a really nice suite like this one was.

I have been here a few times and I have stayed at many hotels on the strip. This is in my top 3 which says a lot. They are always so nice and the rooms are all suites so you def get what you pay for. Not all like this one. I paid extra to be upgraded. 

If you are a big gambler get a players card and play play play and you will start to get rewarded which goes for all of Vegas but this place goes far and beyond for players. I come here to gamble so if you don't this may not pertain to you but if you gamble a lot then it is for your own advantage

I arrived here today. I want to remember his name. The guy at the desk was very nice. (It was the invited guest check in) 

The rooms are very nice and comfortable as well as clean. I ordered room service and it was great too. It's pricey though but then again what do you expect when you are ordering breakfast in bed in Vegas at one of the nicest hotels\/casinos. 

They have many restaurant choices as well. I never get bored here. They have so many nice pools too. You can walk to the Venetian and you can go to pools at both locations. You can go outside and walk around to the other side. Whichever you prefer. I have pics on here showing my walk around the pools. 

I will be returning back! And got my brother a decent deal for his bachelor party in July.",6,0,2

First thing's first: the Palazzo doesn't have that annoyingly strong fragrance being pumped throughout the air like the Venetian does. It's like potpourri overload there and I can't stand it. It gives me a headache so I'm glad the Palazzo has a more subdued scent.

Second, the service here is AMAZING. We were treated with the utmost care and respect when it came to the valet, the bellmen, the check-in desk, and the dealers (some were super friendly, which is a rarity).
We also ordered room service breakfast and honestly, it was the best room service meal I've had. Just their standard eggs, potatoes and sausage breakfast with mimosas made my morning. The eggs were perfectly scrambled (and moist!) while the jam on my toast was extremely tasty. Pricey but I definitely tasted the quality of food and had it in the convenience of our own room. Highly recommend their room service breakfast.

Third, I learned how to play Craps here, which has quickly become my new favorite table game. My gambling friend and I lost a lot and won a lot at this casino.. talk about getting comped for AT LEAST the rest of the year.. ha! We also played Craps while watching the Superbowl (yes, that is double gambling going on!) so you can imagine how many HOURS we stayed at the Craps tables... haha it became our daytime gambling spot.

The rooms are laid out the same way as the Venetian's, but I prefer Palazzo's modern elegant feel. The beds were so dang comfy, it was like sleeping on a cloud every night! I would say that the Encore's beds are the comfiest I've slept on though. Our room also had 3 TV's and in the bathroom was a VANITY! You can imagine how happy that made me :P

This place turned out great for us since we didn't really go clubbing during our trip, rather, we gambled.. so it was all we could ask for! Although, their sports book is pretty small in comparison to others and especially on game day that room could get PACKED shoulder to shoulder. That's my only gripe.

Definitely would stay at the Palazzo again the next time I'm in Vegas! love this place.",8,7,8

Last time we were there someone from my group checked in before me, and they called me to ask if it was ok for them to check in, I stay at a lot of hotels, and most would make them wait for the person on the reservation to check-in, but they called me and let them check in before I even got there.  

The service at the Palazzo is always exceptional, and their sportsbook is great.  Instead of being like all the other uptight casino sportsbooks, theirs is more of a lounge and I stay in there for hours.

The other big thing about the Palazzo...it's clean.  I never feel like a million people visit the hotel every year, which is the feeling you can get with some.

Every time I stay here (at least once a year), I have to hide my towel in the closet so they don't take it.

This was my second stay at Palazzo Resort in Las Vegas.  My wife and I decided to take few days off and spend some time in Las Vegas (dinner, show, etc.).  I reserved our rooms directly via Palazzo's website using suite package simply perfect (promotion code EPAPHMX).

We arrived at the hotel around 7:30pm.  Palazzo claims to be a 5 star hotel, but surprisingly there was nobody at the front door offering to carry your luggage or even open the door for us.   Once at the registration area, you will see two waiting area:  1. Invited guests, 2. General registration.  We proceeded to the general registration with approximately 20-25 people in front of us.  After waiting for almost 45 minutes, we finally had to give up since we had a show reservation at another hotel.  There was nobody in sight to ask any questions so I tried asking the Concierge if there was any other way for us to checkin.  I was told:  ""this is a 5 star resort so there is no self checkin.""  Their recommendation was to call hotel's 800 and let them know that we were going to be late checkin and try later.  I called the hotel 800 number and spoke to front desk and then the hotel manager and explained my story.  Absolutely no regard for their guest's well being or customer satisfaction!  The explanation from the hotel manager's was that this is normal!  Business must be good because they simply don't care!

We had to drop our luggage at the downstairs garage to hold for us.  After the show, we went back to the hotel around mid-night to try to checkin again.  We had to wait 15 minutes (even at mid-night hour) to get a representative. We finally managed to checkin around 12:30am and proceeded to our room; however, it took another 30 minutes for our luggage to be delivered to our room.

Travel tips:  

Be advised, there is a resort fee of $19.04 per night.  This is not disclosed anywhere on Palazzo's website or during reservation. 

There is a Walgreens next to Palazzo.  If you need water or personal items, it takes couple of minutes to walk to Walgreens.

Taxi ride from the airport to this hotel is around $35 if you take the highway or around $20 if you take the back streets.  I would take the back street if there is no construction or traffic.

The air is so dry in this hotel.  If you have a sinus problem like me, as for a humidifier.  They will deliver it to you.",1,0,0

It may be quite a walk to the middle of the strip, but you can walk nearby to Harrahs and use the monorail! 

I don't want to repeat other fellow Yelpers positive experience (because it's all true) but you should make an effort to stay at The Palazzo when in Vegas. 

Even though I'm fond of The Palazzo, here are some negatives to watch out for:
- I was disappointed with the shower water pressure. Not strong enough. 
- There isn't a vent in the bathroom. 
- Mini fridge... Really?!, I'll get charge for taking the drinks out? So unless your going to drink the drinks in there, I wouldn't take it out. 
- Room service lags  when picking up food carts in the hallway. Having to walk pass 1 day old food in the hall is not fancy at all.  
- My friend received a  special bouquet of flowers and roses. Front desk kindly left a message regarding the special delivery.  When my friend called front desk for it, they told her she didn't have any special package waiting for her. But then when she went to front desk later that night to ask for it again, they magically found her bouquet of flowers and roses...Hmmm, shady, right?!

THE +'s: same layout as the venetian suites but more modern style decor (less with the gold scrolls and cherubs). furniture slightly worn but then that's to be expected with any popular vegas hotel. otherwise, housekeeping kept detailed tabs of preferences -- clean sheets -- comfy beds -- comfy pillows. service was always friendly. i paid extra for a strip view and actually got a glittery strip view for once. internet access is billable here which kinda sucks but at 10 bucks per 24 hours, this is actually one of the lower net access charges around the strip hotels. unexpected pluses were the amazing fruity scent that floated everywhere you went (excepting the smoking casino floor of course), and the fact that it's a wonderfully short walk from the room elevators to the valet\/taxi area.

THE -'s: concierge always took forever to answer my calls. i called on a thursday evening at about 11pm to get an extra hypoallergenic blanket. was on hold for nearly 25 minutes before my call was answered. then it took another 2 hours before the blanket was actually delivered. don't know if this was due to the fact that it was near a weekend -- but then i went during the weekend right before christmas and this is usually the slow season for vegas. eh.

SUM: slow concierge aside, i enjoyed my stay here. everything was so elegant and people were always friendly. a real classy place. well worth the price i paid (average 180 a night). if you can get a good price during the off-season, i highly recommend the palazzo.",0,0,0

But two reasons this isn't a 5 star review: the mini-bar is set up so that if you pick up an item (to read the ingredients or otherwise just check it out), you're automatically charged for consuming it. So, as the front desk and bellman will warn you: DO NOT PICK UP ANYTHING FROM THE MINIBAR UNLESS YOU PLAN TO PAY FOR IT. We're trying not to even look at the minibar, in case it gets any ideas. The other ding on this hotel is that it lacks basic amenities like a fridge where you can stash a bottle (because the one in the room is stocked with bottles and cans that we are afraid to touch, because of the whole weight-triggered-minibar-charge-thing). The concierge offered to try to track one down for us at the cost of $25\/day. No thanks. We're OK with our dessert wine warming up. The same goes for a business center (yes, I know I'm in Vegas--what are these words ""business center""? but this is also a big convention location, so bear with me): I just wanted to print out a few pages.

Take a deep breath and smell the fresh aroma that roams through the hotel - the soft scent even makes the casino portion easy to walk through rather than smelling cigarette smoke.  Valet service was attentive and promptly brought our luggage up.  Check-in was a breeze and the front desk was friendly and helpful.  We were offered a room with the strip view for an additional $45, but we declined.  The gentleman assisting in the end still gave us strip view, facing the T.I. and the pool area free of charge.  

To access your hotel room, you just flash your room card.  When walking to our hotel room, we noticed the carpets and decor which was very chic.  When we walked into our room, everyone was impressed.  The bathroom was very roomy, featuring a full tub and a shower area.  With a bunch of girls in 1 hotel room, it was also good that the toilet area had its own separate door and also nice that there were plenty of mirrors throughout the hotel.  

Our room had 2 queen beds and a living room area.  The beds were comfy and the girls who slept on the pull-out sofa said that it was comfortable as well.  There were 2 flat screen tvs in each area.  The window curtains were controlled by remote.  The layout was similar to the Venetian, but the decor was a notch above.  

Whenever we called the front desk, they always promptly answered, were very professional, and the service received was quick.  Internet costs $10.00 for 24 hours.  The internet was slow - probably slower than dial-up, but that was my only gripe of this place.

The Palazzo is in a great section of the Strip - it's close to the Mirage, T.I., Wynn, and Fashion Show Mall.  It even connects to the Venetian.  This info will serve you well if you are planning on shopping (Palazzo, Fashion Show Mall, Venetian, and Wynn), going to quality restaurants and the better clubs (Tao\/Tao Beach, Jet, Christian Audigier, and Lavo).  With Las Vegas always changing and emerging, at this point in time, this is the more trendy area.  Our whole stay, we primarily walked to all the locations with ease.  With 9 girls in heels, everyone liked the fact that we could walk to Tao and Lavo and back to our hotel room without ever stepping outdoors.

Check-out wasn't working on our tv so I called the front desk and they easily took care of it.  Out of all the hotels that I've stayed at on the Strip, this was my favorite place to stay.  2 nights cost me $818 and was worth the money.  We all loved it and would return in a heart beat!",1,0,1

Loved our suite and I have to say that this is the comfiest bed in a hotel that I have EVER stayed at in vegas. I have stayed at Wynn, Bellagio, Vdara, Cosmopolitan, MGM (I come about 8 to 10 times a year) and this bed was the best. I got the best 4 hour sleep LOL. The room was very clean and the staff is so nice. Im 26 and like to stay in hotels not full of crazy young partiers and this hotel is perfect for that. An older crowd and not as crowded as other hotels. Also we flew in and our flight leaves till 7 and they said they will hold our luggage for up to 24 hours. Thats nice! Havent even left and CANT wait to be back.",0,0,0

The front desk made numerous mistakes to our profile upon check in. When we asked to correct them, it took more than one try and more than one phone call. Because of this when my sister tried to charge something to the room, she was treated like a thief. When my sister's key card demagnitized, they gave her a new one but then canceled my key card as well without telling her. It then took over 45 minutes to get security to get me in my room which was a really problem because I was there for work at a convention. I missed part of an important meeting as a result. 

They also charged us for an upgrade they didn't give us. I had to call to get credit for the mistake and that phone call took more than 30 minutes. 

The service at the Grand Luxe in Palazzo side was terrible. It was slow and the waitress couldn't even get the drink order right. 

I completed the customer survey and received an email from Theresa Miranda in customer relations to apologize. She also offered to help with any future stay because of our experience so I thought, what the heck, we were planning to go back for my birthday that is coming up so asked for some rates. It's now been a week and she hasn't responded. 

I would think twice about calling this place a four star or five star hotel anymore.",1,0,0

I was here for my bachelorette party this weekend and I loved everything in the room from the bedding to the bathrooms!  Our suite was decked out with 3 TV's (one in the bathroom... So handy for turning on music or just staying entertained while you're getting ready for a night out, etc.) and had a cute office area for those who needed to get a little bit of work done.  

The beds are SO COMFY.  They have these awesome Sealy posturepedic beds that make you feel like you are sleeping on a cloud!  And the sheets... OH THE SHEETS! LIKE BUTTA! LOL.

Pros:
-Beautiful suites
-Amazing room layout (Totally made for partying)
-Comfy beds
-Lots of TV's!
-The Palazzo\/Venetian have the best spas around

Cons:
-A tad bit pricy
-Housekeeping is really hit or miss with requests 
-Views are kind of crappy depending on your room

Tips:
-Use the wireless without fear.... It's not REALLY $15.99; it's included in the resort fee.",1,1,0

The only reason i didn't flat-out give it a 5 was due to the horrifically long line upon arrival, even though my honey had arranged for premier check-in.  But whatever, because 20-30 minutes later we were on our way to our sweet little suite, and we LLL LOVED it.

Super clean and very well laid out, the room really was quite lovely: i think it was the whimsical elegance of the furnishings and the layout itself that did it. There was a comfy yet refined, eclectic mix that really worked -- heyday vegas elegance with a modern Jetsons twist that -- with the infusion of selected fabrics\/pieces that were so well chosen and splashed -- made me feel as if i were in my own groovy pied-a-terre in Manhattan (sunken living room and all)!!!!

YAY: there's nothing like casual elegance to make you feel relaxed and comfortable, especially if you happen to be in a zoo of sorts.  I'm not really into the whole Disneyland vibe of Vegas (the food and spas and the Barney's that stays open til midnight are juuuust fine though!).......so having such a comfy, quiet, lovely room as a base-camp made our whole stay very, VERY nice.",0,0,0
