We booked a trip through gate1travel.com and when you are booking they give you the options for hotels. The default booking is for Circus Circus, NOT Circus, Circus Manor Motor Lodge. It says three stars and even says this on gate1's travel site: ""The rooms are fitted with contemporary decor and furnishings. All rooms are equipped with amenities that will be sure to make your stay pleasant, such as internet access (surcharge), a hair dryer, and a television with cable channels.""
We looked up Circus Circus, saw it was nothing special, but alright and went for it...and found out that in fact, we were in the Manor Motor Lodge.
Now, I KNOW that this is gate1's fault and I'll be taking it up with them as well. Also, I want to point out that on my second night, I complained and they put us in a suite for the night, so this is nothing against the overall hotel, but there are still a few things people need to know staying here.
Rooms: They are DUMPS in the manor motor lodge. I asked, when we were checking in, if those rooms had been redone at all and was told that ""all the rooms have been updated in SOME way""...well I don't know what way this room had been updated. The carpets were worn and stained. The bedding was the polyester crap from the 80s. The wallpaper was stained and peeling off the walls. The bathroom floor had cracks in the tile and a permanent grunge that could never been cleaned. It looked like a motel room you see in horror movies!
The hallways were constantly loud and smelled of marijuana, with cheap, apple air freshener over top, which was interesting because of the number of small children running around with distinctly trashy families. I even made a joke with a cab driver in Las Vegas, that we were NOT ugly enough to be staying in this hotel. He agreed and said it was the butt of the joke of cabbies on the strip. Good to know.

Hotel: The hotel amenities are geared towards children, but are basically a money grab. There is a small, indoor amusement park that costs something like $8\/30 second ride. There are shops and restaurants, but non are high end. We ate at three places while there and overall they were crappy. I'll give those individual ratings though.

Service: This was very good actually. I had a very pleasant bell hop help us out and all the wait staff and cleaning staff were very nice and the woman whom I complained to was very receptive and polite, so that earns them an extra star.

The thing with the hotel is that even these rooms we were stuck in, fall under 3 stars, even though they, by themselves, would barely qualify as 1 star rooms, because the whole hotel falls under one heading.

SO, lesson to be learned, these rooms are NOT nice rooms. The hotel is considerably crappier than other hotels. It's also quite far from the main strip. BUT it is cheap. If you are (for whatever God-awful reason) bringing children to Vegas, I guess this would fit the bill. Otherwise, if you're just looking for a bed and a cheap one, this also fits the bill. The beds, I will say, had clean sheets and were comfortable. But don't be fooled into thinking you're getting this amazing deal on a three star hotel. You're not. You're getting an average deal, on 1 star accommodations.",3,1,1

Why 2 stars?
-They upgraded us to a double king, but when we got to the room it only had a single.

-We requested a non smoking room, but I think they put us in a smoking room. Our room has an ashtray. Also, I smell weed in the hall.

-For being newly renovated, the furniture is old and the tv is still a tube tv.

The general demographic seems to be people from all over the world. I got a free upgrade to a better room at the same rate.

Secondly, I found our room EXTREMELY difficult to find. The lady at the check in desk gave us a map telling us where to go but it did not really make sense.

Another very misleading thing is that there are some elevators for the first set of floors and another elevator for the higher set of floors that were not labeled. Myself and many other guests that checked in after me were constantly getting on the wrong elevator.

I have to say I didn't read up on reviews before booking the room until I was two hours away so I was really nervous. 

First I checked in and it was sort of a busy line but it was a Sunday so I understood. The clerk that I was checked into his name is Francisco, and he was truly the sweetest guy ever! My sister was with me and he gave her her own keycard and he was just so nice and considerate! 

So we were on the 35th floor of the west tower and the view was just beautiful! I inspected the room like crazy for any bugs or anything in particular and  everything was just as perfect as can be about our room! I was expecting worse of the worse but nope they actually exceeded my expectation! 

Adventuredome was pretty awesome especially for children but boy there were A LOT of kids running around. I don't know whether they were hotel guests, but I'm assuming they were Vegas residents as well. My favorite part about the whole arcade was discovering the arcade upstairs! Now that was an adventure for my sister. 

The only bad thing I would have to say is the buffet. It was awful and especially for the price we paid for the food wasn't close to being worth it. It also seems as though the food had been sitting there for a while. It was just really awful I would never eat there again or advise people to go there either. Also, stay away if you're not bringing kids with you because they are everywhere!

This was my first time at Las Vegas and as an adult who didn't get to do adult things because I was stuck with babysitting I can't wait for the next  time I go to Vegas because then I can actually get drunk and have a good time.

The accomodations (west tower) were ok nothing special but nothing to complain about. No fridge, but not a make or break item. Bath collected water so you were always ankle deep when showering.

My biggest complaint about this hotel was the lack of enforcement for smokers. There are signs saying strictly prohibited to casino areas, but people smoked everywhere and it was ignored. While most hotels have noticble smoking, the level here was so high I was gasping for air at one point, my wife, myself and one of the kids all were blowing blood out of our noses. and we do not have a medical conditions.

First impression, it's sub par in comparison to the other hotels I have stayed at. Definitely not the Wynn or Venetian. But it's my first time going to Vegas with a child. Figured this would be the best place. WRONG. When you first walk in the cigarette smell engulfs you. 

When we checked in the manager was kind enough to accommodate us for the dates we were planning to stay. Said that the prior night will be comped. We were very happy until we checked out the room. I first removed the top layer of the bedding. It's a known thing to take that off since i believe they don't wash it every time a guest checks out. Anyways, as I removed it, there were hot Cheetos crumbs on the bed. I called housekeeping to have the linens changed. She sounded annoyed since I added one of the pillows was yellow. Then I checked the other bed (we had 2 queen sized beds) there was hair in the pillow case. That's when I called Guest Service. We were immediately told to go to the front and get our new keys for our new room. 2nd room smelled better. Not smelling like a cigarette like the previous room and everything looked 10x cleaner. Oh did I forget the mention the other phone was disgusting (see photos). 

Biggest wrong was when we came back to the hotel the 1st night. Tried to self park and we were all exhausted so decided to call it a night and just pay to have the car valet. When the valet guy comes this guy tells Tim its $13 for the night. Oh and asked for him to tip him. Ok he was given $15 cash. The next morning Tim was picking up the car from the valet since we had to meet family for Thanksgiving get together  and he was told he never paid. The valet guy pocketed our money. To say we were furious was an understatement. In the end, the manager came and comped the charge. Which really was not comped since we did pay and even gave extra to the guy for tip. This experience is worse than the room being dirty. That employer should be let go. What he did was stealing. 

Like I said they right their wrongs. But come on! Get your ish together right the first time. You are leaving lasting impressions on your guests. We will never stay here again. We should've just stayed elsewhere and just came here for the games at Adventure Dome if the little one really did want to play. In the end we didn't even go to Adventure Dome at all. 

Btw, there's no room service. Also forgot razor and we called to see if they can send someone up and they don't have that service available either. Seriously just pay extra to not have to deal with this kind of BS. Last thing you want to deal with while on vacation.",8,1,2

They need to put a 12 - 20  foot wall around the whole area and make a garden area around it ,The area would be nice if they  closed a few  service roads and changed there traffic so you can relax and enjoy the pool . The buffet was a one the food tasted like they opened the cans and put it into the pans no home cooking or flavor at all . The desserts were all store pies and cakes and cookies it was really sad . They should just give you the buffet for free with the room . The best things were Krispy Kreme , Auntie Annes, McDonalds .",0,0,0

- check-in staff was very kind and helpful. 
- cheap
the cons;

where to begin?..

-this place is downright FILTHY! our room was disgusting. even in the ""remodeled"" tower ( west ) 
-too many children running around screaming. 
- Not even really close to anything noteworthy on the strip. 
- No microwave or fridge in the room. That seems like an obvious one. Had to buy a cooler..
- did i mention filthy?

booked way too many nights here.. ditching the hotel soon and staying somewhere else. Honestly a huge disappointment for our first time here in Vegas.",1,1,1

Gross: everything was just dirty, or looked dirty. The bed? the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in.  Only palatable when drunk. the sheets smelled funny, and the water was lukewarm.

Creepy: there are murals of clowns with well defined junk. Also: the criss angel official store.

Annoying: I don't care that it's circus based, there is no such thing as child friendly vegas.  take your child where they won't see ridiculous and trashy people, and so they won't wake me up.

Overwhelming: so much noise. so much smoke, and sooooo many lights.  I get it, it's Vegas, but all of the casinos down the strip are both quieter and without the seizure inducing running lights, and much more pleasant.

2 Perks: Mexitalia: whole ton of food, for not a lot of money; open 2-8pm.  Also: Krispy Kreme.  Coffee... nom nom nom.

I wouldn't mind this but I had my children with me, so I didn't like it at all in this case. 

Once we got to our first room, we stumbled upon a great view with the beds made, but trash from the previous guests were left everywhere. It was as if room service made the beds and left, but nothing else.

I remember when I was a little one my parents brought me and my younger brother here. I thought it was the greatest place I had ever seen, with the little amusement park and the carnival games and circus acts. We had our RV hooked up in the lot. It was the mid 90's. A simpler time.

I've stayed here more than once quite recently when me and my girl were ballin on a budget. Even from the outside it's like... I'm having second thoughts about this. Okay, Just... fork out the extra money and stay somewhere that say, cleans their bedspreads and curtains sometimes, or, vacuums the room occasionally. Circus Circus does not do these things ever.

Even wallking through the casino you get the most disgusting, creepy, dirty feeling. And also the feeling like you are going to be murdered. By clowns. Basically you get the dirty feeling because the place is dirty in all ways, shapes, and forms. It's really a sad place. It's like a carnival tent that someone abandoned and left to rot. And it smells that way. Like shit, mold, stale cigs and despair.

The few times (a few too many) that I've stayed here, the check in line has been long. I actually let a bride and groom at the end of the line cut in front of me when I was next up one time. Hey, Circus Circus has to do with some part of their wedding. It was the least I could do. The people that work the front desk are depressed. And I would be too if someone made me wear that stanky ass purple uniform. Bless their hearts. They also must give you a map and explain to you which way to go and which elevator you need to take to find your room. The layout of the place is horrendous. I've been lost a few times. And, you don't wanna be lost here. Like I said, it's creepy.

On your adventure to find your room, you will be forced through hallways of stands with pushy people trying to sell you a bunch of made in China crap. Like a flea market from hell. Walk quiclky, head down, through this mess. It's the only way you'll make it. 

The ventilation is SO BAD. Honestly I think if you had asthma and stayed here you would die. 

I can't even imagine that people dare to eat here. I give you props for your bravery. They do have a Krispy Kreme, which is actually one plus.

You will have to taxi or drive to get anywhere desirable. The location of this place is really terrible. Plus, you will be embarassed to tell the taxi driver to take you back here. If you wanna go see some tits, Sapphire is pretty close. Not walking distance close, but close enough.

Now on to the room...sigh...I have to admit it was terrible. We walked into the room and was almost knocked over by the stinch. I swore there was something dead or rotting in the room. We searched everywhere to try and locate the cause of the horrible smell and just couldn't find it. My daughter sprayed some perfume and we decided to buy some scented candles or rug deodorizer the next morning. By morning the smell was gone thank goodness.

The rooms were ok, faucet leaked in the tub non-stop but you couldn't hear it in the bedroom. Place was good to sleep. unfortunately I kept having to walk through the casino to get to an Uber or a Lyft which always ended up parking in a different location, and something there smells horrible.

Don't get me wrong, I've smelled smoke before, and smoke cleaners. This smell, which seems concentrated in a couple of areas, smells like burning cat and oranges mixed with bleach. It's a nasal ice pick.In my adult life I have never had to hold my nose due to smell before.

Now to be fair, other people I was with just said it smelled extremely bad where I was in pain. So maybe I'm the only one it smelled like someone driving an ice pick into my brain, but damn. All I can figure out is it's some sort of citrus-based smoke remover, perhaps it spilled. Maybe something burned. Do not know. I was there a week and would take gulps of air to avoid breathing near the spots.

Hallways on my floor had no visible signs for elevators. Not a big deal but it's walk down a bland hallway, oh, there's an ice maker, approach it and on the right you'll see another area where the elevators are. One of those things that seems to have been designed to purposefully screw with people who are drunk, stoned, or have a feat of being trapped in a never-ending hotel.

The staff that I met were friendly. We left out several hundred dollars worth of swag that remained unmolested, although I do suspect they may have wandered off with a ball of socks I left on the bed.

We wanted a hotel close to the Convention Center for two days.  All the other hotels close by were fully booked and we thought we hit a good deal when we were able to book a room for a cheaper price.  That was a missed clue.  

Circus Circus is due for an extreme make over.  I do not know how old the hotel is but it looks very old.  Parking was terrible, the garage elevators (only two) were small and very slow.  It was faster taking the stairs. Good thing we didn't have big luggage.  Feel bad for the old people. The path from the garage to the main lobby was nasty.  Garbage and puke in the path (it seems nobody cleans regularly).  The main lobby was too small and dark.  It felt like you were in a bus station.  It was very crowded with people seating in the floor with their luggage.  The carpet was worn out, not enough chairs or sofas for people waiting to check in or for a ride to the airport.  It smelled old too, like a museum,  The only plus I can think of is the staff were really friendly and welcoming.

We stayed in the West Tower and the elevators were like the ones in the garage, small and slow.  They could not handle the traffic.  In the morning it took us more than 20 minutes to get onboard one because they were always full and pitifully slow.  They made slow creaking sounds when moving.  There was also no security to verify if you are hotel guest to the elevator areas.  Anybody can get in the hotel.

The rooms were nothing special, they were old and outdated.  Rooms in Holiday Inn Express are way better.  They do not have a refrigerator (they charge $20 a night to add one) and microwave oven.  They also do not have any HD channels available.

I guess one of the main attractions is the amusement park in the dome.  You do not get perks as a hotel guest.  They will give you a 1 or 3 $ discount in the rides but you almost pay as much as anyone walking in off the street.

I am sorry but I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone.  I would rather pay extra $ for a much better accommodation.  The price you pay (even though it was cheaper than the other hotels in the strip) is not worth it.",5,1,1

This is probably my third time taking my kids here who by the way LOVE the midway here. But outside of that this place is a heart attack waiting to happen.

The last two times i was here my only complaint I'd have about this casino\/hotel is the smell they use to fume up the entire facility. The smell here is enough to break someones nose off SERIOUSLY. My nose goes into this rejection mode while i walk through the hotel and casino just to get to the midway. Surprisingly the midway doesnt smell half as bad as the main floor thank god.. otherwise the first time here would have been the last.

The reason this third time here was so bad was the smoke. Im not sure what changed or why it wasnt as filtered out as the last 2 previous times i was here.. but the moment i stepped in.. i really had a hard time breathing..like i was ready to stop breathing any moment. If I felt that way... imagine how my kids felt. I understand vegas isnt a place for kids but i only took them there specifically for the midway and other kid attractions nearby.

Fact: The hotel today is even tackier than it was in 1971.

Fact: That creepy feeling you got when you saw Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd in the film? Yeah. The hotel will give you that creepy feeling, too.


They charge a mandatory ""resort fee,"" which is a bit of a misnomer. This isn't a resort. Imagine instead that the t-shirt vendors and samurai sword dealers of your local flea market teamed up with a carnival, started a permanent location, and decided to add 3x more flashing lights than Britney sees getting out of a limo. To add to the ambiance, they found a way to make the building smell like an orange melmac ashtray that hasn't been cleaned in 30 years.

Cheap. Stinky. Dark. Slightly seedy. That's a pretty good description.

We had a recently renovated room, within the past month, and it was not as tacky as the rest of the hotel. That will not last, though. There was pizza sauce on the wall from the previous tenants that stayed put during my entire week stay. On one of the days, room service did not even check on our room or see if we needed towels.

The furniture in the room, though new, was a peculiar blend. There was a desk and a table, but the only chair was a cloth living room arm chair. I'm not sure how they anticipated someone to use the table or the desk comfortably.

For those of you who have driven up I-95 through the Carolinas, this is the South of the Border of the Vegas Strip. Don't do it. It's cheap, but it's too cheap. Find a decent place off the Strip, or wait for a special rate at a decent hotel through a travel site.

To top off the stay they shut off the water to the RV park in the morning. When we asked at the front desk about these issues they stated ""it's posted in the park, you should have known better"" about the water and when they called the now open RV park office and were told they shouldn't have placed us in the construction parking area the front desk staff turned to us and stated ""because you checked in after 8pm there is no way we could have known not to use the construction spots, we can't do anything about that.""

Even the cleaning lady is great, she speaks little English but that was not problem, very kind, we made it easy for her since we are very clean and my ocd obsession with organization kicked in. 

My only problem was that the First floor has this over powering smell, not of cigarettes but something like a strong chemical , maybe for cleaning.

I check in at about 1130 and didn't need to check in as such, just see if my room was available yet, otherwise I would just leave my bag.

When I said that I wasn't paying, I was told that they would waive the fee since I was checking out that night. 
The room itself was poorly lit and smelled bad, as did the bed covers. The only good thing was the wifi in the room, although you pay for that with the resort fee. $12 for wifi, some vouchers for the rides and some other things you will almost certainly not use.

Nationalitäten: überwiegend Deutsche, Holländer - und natürlich ein paar Amerikaner. Hauptbeschäftigungsmöglichkeit: Gaming! Wer mit Kindern unterwegs sein sollte darf sich auf den Freizeitpark ""Adventure Dome"" und halbstündliche Artistikeinlagen freuen - für Hotelgäste natürlich kostenlos.

Etwas abgelegen vom übrigen Strip und umrahmt von Bauruinen hat das Hotel aber von seinem ursprünglichen Charme nichts verloren. Unser Zimmer zählte zu den etwas neueren (Casino Tower) und war der Größe eines Zimmers im Interconti oder Hilton ebenbürtig. Gut, bei der Ausstattung hat es dann doch nur für vier Sterne gereicht, dafür stimmte das Preis-Leistungs-Verzeichnis umso mehr. 

Dies zeigte sich vor allem beim Frühstück. Für 15 Dollar gab es ein riesiges Buffet mit einer Omlettestation, einer ausgedehnten ""Beverage-Oasis"" und einer hauseigenen Patisserie mit einer üppigen Kuchenauswahl. Zahlreiche Restaurants im Hause warten mit Leckereien auf, das Highlight ist das mehrmals ausgezeichnete ""The Steak House"".

Es gibt einen hauseigenen Beautysalon, der sich vor allem auf Hochsteckfrisuren und Make-up spezialisert hat. Die Hauptattraktion des Hauses ist wahrscheinlich das Casino, zusammen mit dem benachbarten Slots-of-Fun von der Fläche locker so groß wie ""Auf Schalke"". Parken inkl. Valet-Parking ist gratis (Trinkgeld von 1-2 Dollar werden allerdings vorausgesetzt). Dafür wird das Gepäck bis aufs Zimmer geliefert. Der gutgemeinte persönliche Zimmerservice war zu der Zeit als er gebraucht wurde leider gerade nicht abkömmlich. 

Es gibt keine Minibar im Zimmer, dafür aber einen Supermarkt im Hotel. Am besten kommt man mit dem Auto in die etwas weiter südlicher gelegenen Shopping Malls des Venetian oder des Ceaasr's.

Yes, the hotel is older, it is not very fancy, I stayed in the Casino Tower. It was nice, yes the décor was older, but staying monday-thursday, I paid about $53\/ AFTER resort fee.

As we went to check out we had to leave our bags again with the bell desk.

We are moving across the country in July and had never been to Vegas so we took a spur of the moment trip to experience the bright lights and magic of the city before we leave. We booked a room at the Circus Circus online, and at $130 we thought we were getting a good deal. Upon check in we realized we were very wrong. They tacked on a $30 ""resort fee"" so after taxes it ended up being almost $180. I'm not sure what exactly that fee is for, seeing as the water slide, splash park and pool were closed. Our room was over in the Manor, which was about a quarter mile from the check in desk. We went through the building to get there, but the escalators were broken so we had to take the stairs.

The pizza place in there there was one gal that was not quite all there she was rude but I don't think she thought she was. Hmm

No customer service whatsoever, the hotel never answers their phones, whether it's for the highly limited and lacking room service, or information requests. Circus Circus advertises free in-room wifi, but it was so slow it was barely functional.  

Every public area looks and smells like a zoo constantly, and the rooms are shabby. Everything looks old and worn out and reeks of cigarette smoke. All carpeted surfaces have a good 3 decades of wear visible, and any non-carpeted surface is sticky from the goo of children. The elevators are constantly breaking down, and the casino is always happy to inconvenience its guests by closing off staircases and corridors (fire hazard?!) when the elevators go AWOL. God help you if you stay in their Skyrise tower, it will take you a minimum of 15 minutes to get from your room to the outside world every time as Circus Circus is a labyrinth.

The food is expensive and mediocre at best, and poses a serious health risk at worst. Do not eat at the buffet unless you are on a bulimia-by-botulism diet. Rock & Rita's is alright, but considers ketchup with cayenne pepper mixed in ""barbeque"" sauce.

I went to this hotel because it was the cheapest hotel close enough to the strip at a reasonable price, granted we didn't do alot of investigating before we went here, so that was pretty much our fault. So in the end it boiled down to price and enough available rooms. We checked in after having reserved our room on the drive towards Vegas, upon getting there we were automatically turned off by this hotels overall presence. The parking was confusing and there was no one to guide us through the maze in which we found ourselves driving. Finally we parked in this industrial mall style parking structure and checked in. We were forced t wait as our rooms were being cleaned and 20 mins later we were given our keys and told what elevator to take, apparently our party was split 4 of us were forced into a smoking room (more like smoking floor, it was truly horrific) that was just about soaked in smoke, it was as if the maid had forgot to use air sprays either that or the smoke was so strong the spray didn't even stand a chance. Our other party was on another floor only accessible through its own separate elevator. That alone was a huge inconvenience, we ended up going back and forth several times until we had had enough. We complained and eventually, 1 and a half days into our 3 day weekend, our both party's were placed on the same smoking floor. Apparently non smoking rooms are requested more, as it is a hotel geared more towards those with kids. As if that was not bad enough the view from the room was horrific, all you see is the sad gray roof down below of and the parking garage in the distance. The hallways had missing segments of the ceiling, which showed off the buildings rusting water pipes. Which only deterred us from drinking any of the tap water or from showering in excess. 

As for the amenities, seeing as how I was 20 when I went on this trip I was not allowed to enjoy the gambling experience while in Vegas, therefore I can not really comment on this. However my friends that did end up gambling at the hotel said it was ""whatevers"", the drinks were alittle on the light side and the games just didn't seem ""lucky"". On the opposite end of the casino level lies the ""The Buffet"", now no Vegas hotel would be complete without a Buffet and the Circus Circus is no different however don't go into ""The Buffet"" expecting a 5 star gourmet dining experience, in fact don't even expect a 2 star dining experience. Overall the food choices were varied from American cuisine to Italian to even Mexican, however the quality was about as great as any ""Home Town Buffet"" and if you've ever been to one you know what I mean. The food lacked flavor and was designed for a bland American palate, my friends had to cover their food in salsa and salt just to make it worth eating. If you do decide to eat here go during breakfast as it seems to be when they serve their better prepared options. Yet how difficult is it to scramble an egg and heat up some pre-made sausage, not very I'd assume. 

In the end the Circus Circus is a good hotel to see if your traveling with Children. Its also great if you want to see an old classic before the dynamite is called in. However do not fear when that day does come there are still plenty of great hotels I'd suggest for parents, ""Mandalay Bay"", ""Excalibur"" or ""Treasure Island"" all 3 themed hotels offer afew more options then ""Circus"" and aren't as ""aged"". As for booking plan in advance and seek out promotional offers on-line (found 3 when I got back home, which could have saved us about 112.00 [each room].....darn!) Also always request non smoking rooms close to each other or gathering your party might end up a daily rusense. The buffets okay in the morning and around brunch time but avoid the dinner menu, its your chance to sample what you missed if you would have stayed at the ""Hard Rock"" (GREAT FOOD, awesome adult atmosphere). In the end I CAN NOT recommend this decrepit old building. The whole stay felt very depressing and the staff came off unfriendly and uncaring really. Getting an extra 30 mins to leave our room was a HUGE issue, they wanted to charge for an additional day (on both rooms). If your staying here I'd recommend booking someplace else, this hotel is on its way out the door. Ow and its not even THAT close to the strip, about something like 1-2 miles away. Walking from Circus to Mandalay bay was grueling and in the end we were forced to get a taxi.",3,0,0

It took another 30 minutes after check in to get up there only to find the first  room was not cleaned. 2nd time in a week for a dirty room at check in.  Then you wait for the elevator to show up so you can go back down to check in again. 
All of the rides closed at 6pm. 
No shops were open at 8 am. 
The bed was hard.

We wanted to do something fun while my parents were gambling to be entertained however it was an experience that makes us never want to go again! I know Vegas is more for the ""mature"" folks but I mean we want to enjoy ourselves too. 

**This review is mainly for the ARCADE AREA** Everyone working in the games area are roughly 16-20 years old, I understand this may be their first job okay whatever. Anyhow, the machines in the arcade are pretty old so some of them are bound to take a quarter here and there but not every other machine. Come on! I learned after the third time it happened to my sister. The game area is just unorganized. We tried finding someone to help us maybe point out the machines that were working properly but no I did not find anyone on site. 

I saw employees more worried about their social life with their coworkers. They were chatting away on the side. One girl was wearing these glasses with a large bow on the side of them looking very unprofessional. When I asked her for help with the ticket machine she just said ""well it should've had a sign that says it didn't work"" basically saying she couldn't do anything about what happened to my ticket receipt. Couldn't she just ask how many tickets the receipt was supposed to print? My siblings didn't have a lot of tickets only 107 but my little brother was so excited that it just really pissed me off. 

The gaming area did not look clean. There were bottles and cans along the games and I was just not impressed. I used to come here a lot when I was a kid but now my family and I won't be going back anytime soon. They need a better and more strict sort of management. It's just not the same. We are taking our money elsewhere. For example, the Orleans which is off the strip, is a better casino overall BY FAR! Movie theaters, arcades, bowling, a large buffet. Yea, sorry Circus Circus the only thing I will give you credit for are your pina coladas near the main entrance.  

I forgot to mention the security guards are just rushing you when you are near the gambling area. I know they are supposed to keep clear but I was with both of my parents just waiting for my brother to get out of the bathroom. It's not like I'm going to run to the machine and start playing.",3,2,1

""RUN FORREST RUN""

After trying to get someone on the phone that actually knew around the hotel and was polite was our first challenge.   I finally got someone who raved how ALL THE ROOMS HAD BEEN UPGRADED AND REFRESHING INCLUDING CARPET......WHAT A BIG FAT STINKING (like the room smelled) LIE  !!!!    Welcome to Malborough Country !!!  Nasty

There is nothing more annoying than travelling many many hours and just wanting to check into a clean fresh room and relax for a few......not happening here.   We checked in to a room that had an extra pull out bed right in front of the door with no access to the actual room.....So I moved it and we noticed crumbs, glitter, confetti underneath it....way to go Maid Service.  No big deal but the leaking cielings with moldy water stains, dirty bathroom mirrors....Hmmmm ok I guess...... BUT THE URINE STAINS ON THE TOILET SEAT WAS DIRTY, SMELLY and  DISGUSTING.    We were moved to a new room and floor (one I was told was not available at check in about 45 minutees prior)  which now all of a sudden was available.  This room was a bit better becaue there was no pee stains and less of a smoking smell.

On a scale of 1 to 10, The rest of the trip was a   Minus  -3  in which I am not even going to write about beacuse the dont give a rats furry behind anyway.   Never Ever Again !!!  Yes its kids land because of the rides....My favorite one was while we were walking along the carnival like games....It was the asian ladies (several of them)  that were bored while working becaus there was no customers and they were sitting on the actual front of the midway games while they were texting away or working hard........which one is it?",2,3,1

1. Hotel rooms are okay 3.5 stars. The elevator system gets (1-generous heavy weighted star). We stay here every year and its the same thing every year. When 10:30 to 11 AM rolls around, everybody is trying to get out of the building, however the elevators are so slow that it takes 40-minutes to get down. By the time it gets to your floor they are already full. If you don't have luggage, take the stairs, but if you do, prepare to wait for a ride and stop on every floor.!! THE ELEVATORS SUCK.!!!!!
2. Smokey Casino is okay, nothin special, 3-stars.
3. (2-stars) The smokey mid-way is old and could use a overhaul, but my 5-year old son knows no difference and loves it. The circus acts are entertaining too, this is why we come back every year. Very crowded so get used to bumping into folks. Adventure dome is fun too, but pricy. (Not smokey) The rides seem a little old and a little young for my 5-year old, so we didn't spend much time there this year. (3-stars).
4. Overall, this place is okay (2-stars), very smokey, pricy food, dirty, old; nice upgraded rooms but getting out during checkout time is a challenge because of the  HORRIBLE ELEVATOR  system. Circus Circus gets a well deserved 2-stars mostly because of the smokey venue and horrible elevators.",0,0,0

   Eating here, good. Just arrive earlier than the rest, you know, the ""early bird..."" quote.

Rooms were okay. Nothing too special, nothing to bad.

A workout room, about 2 hotel rooms put together with walls kicked out, was nice to see. Went like super early morning, only 3 or 4 of us in there.

  The circus shows; yes. Def not Ringling brothers, as it was mostly acts without animals and air-defying feats. But, very cool! Kids liked it and us adults were impressed.

They have a dome with roller coasters and those rides, which we walked thru but we wanted to spend our $$ on other stuff, so...idk anything about those rides, sorry.

We arrived on a sat. afternoon and proceed with the check in. I honestly thought it was going to take longer than it did, the whole process took probably like 15-20 min. The gentlemen that took us in was really kind and friendly, he let us know that the package we had gotten (which I was unaware of because I had purchased it trough Groupon) was for us to stay in the hotel structure in front of the circus circus. He offered us a room in the actual casino hotel for $10 extra we agreed and he even gave us the option to be put in a lower or higher floor. When we got to our room I was really surprised the room was a decent size and it really clean so was the bathroom, we had in mind that it was going to smell like cigar but luckily we were placed in the nonsmoking part of the hotel. We had access to free WiFi, pool, discounts at some hotel stores, and parking is free. Overall we had a great experience for it being our first time staying in Las Vegas.       

The only downside I really have is that it is a little further away from the strip. Though there is a bus stop just outside of the main entrance of the casino that takes you to the strip. But I recommend driving and parking at another hotel, we did that on our last day and parking actually came out cheaper than the bus fare.",0,0,0

This was my boyfriend and I's 4th trip to vegas in the last 2 yrs and we always stay on the strip further up in nicer hotels.  We teased and said we were going to ""slum"" it this time. WOW we were teasing before we got there.  When we arrived I thought I would cry, because our joke came true and so did the Yelp reviews.

1.) The check in line and check in area looked like a refugee camp.  The line was about a 100 people long on a Tuesday night about 10pm.   People laying on the floor asleep, laying on couches and sitting every where waiting for the check in.  We checked our luggage with the bell boy and we left and came back at 1am and it was still about 60 people long.  My boyfriend say NO WAY and went to talk to someone,  next thing I know we were checked in and in a Suite.  I felt so dirty at this point even though we got very lucky and got upgraded and checked in ahead of all the other refugee's.

2.) The Suite was okay.  I was thankful because I was sure the rooms sucked if the suite was just ok. The tv was small and staticy.  The maid could not remember to leave wash rags and we were there a week!!!!

We chose the circus circus because this was the only place that was kid friendly as we were meeting a family member there that wanted to visit with the kids too. (otherwise we would not have brought our kids to Vegas period) 
  Friday night we were approached by the same black man trying to sell us weed right in front of our kids next to the elevator in the skyrise tower twice in one night. Then Saturday i had gone downstairs to smoke as I always get a non smoking room. (i know I'm a smoker but cant sleep in a smoke filled room weird I know) Anyway, I sat down at a slot machine next to the elevators and was going to play a few minutes why I smoked. Next thing I know I am being grabbed from behind, my arm was pulled out of socket by some crazy old lady that was yelling... I was sitting there thats my machine...  I get her off of me finally and she came back punching me. WTF??? I was simply minding my own business... Thank Goodness there were a few witnesses... cause that old lady told the police I hit her... and I never touched her even after she started punching me because of her age. 
 Then come to find out... the circus circus's policy is that in any incident, that they kick both parties out, regardless of who started it??? Even if your the one being attacked for no reason... even if they have it and see it all on video (which they did capture it all on video in my case) unless the Las Vegas Police sign some form stating your the victim (which luckily for me that is what happened) Still though that is craziness that someone can get attacked in their hotel and there is NO justice. You can be kicked out too??? What kinda crap is that??? That wasted about 3 hours of our carefully planned day....
 They did kick that old lady out along with her entire family. They escorted them completely off the property...  and on Sunday low and behold they had security posted in there where they should have been all along!!! Especially on a Weekend and Especially being it was the beginning of college spring break?? 
 I agree with the other reviews that the food had no flavor the blue Iguana mexican place had no flavor whatsoever....  The food looked nothing like the pictures... (we had the ultimate grande burrito) it was a dollar more for rice, for beans and for sour cream...  3 extra dollars and then it was 3 bucks for each drink as well... They only sold one size!  We didn't even bother after that to try their buffet as we had read these reviews before we left.. 
 The room in the Skyrise tower was alright but everyone was right about the outdated TV.  The beds were comfy and loved the pillow... Loved the pillow so much in fact I ordered one off amazon.  The bathroom was alright too until we realized the things in the shower were not ours (we all assumed they were each others things eww) and were left by the guest before us,,, they were still in the bathroom when we left as well.  we had 2 rooms adjoined and only one key out of 5 total keys worked... they mixed the keys up too... we were supposed to have 3 keys, my family members was supposed to have 2 keys and their key worked only on our room... (Thank Goodness we had the ajoined doors left open to each others rooms) The slot on her door was completely broken.. It did not even light up at all... Our keys all had to be re-keyed. After spending forever in a long line to get that done. Ugg (forget it we sucked it up and used the one key... until after the incident when security took me straight to the front of the line to get it done)
 We also signed up for and received players cards when we got to the circus circus and mine quit working, so I went to get a new one... everything was supposed too and should have been transferred over to the new card but... I lost all of my points... 
 The kids 14 and 8 had a blast at the Adventure Dome and at the Midway carnival games. The circus acts were much better then we expected! Those were actually spectacular and a joy to see!! The kids loved it!!! 
 The roulette table on the other hand had an admittedly strung out on crack guy at the table... He was clearly messed up and kept saying loudly how he needs to stop doing so much crack? 
 Rockin Ritas was full of hookers... They were bragging about being hookers and the bar tender seemed to know they were hookers too... 
 It is so sad that the Circus Circus is turning into a drug and prostitution hub for Las Vegas!
So all in all we had a good time and bad time all in one trip... It kinda evened itself out with the good and bad... Circus circus not great but just Okay. We also stayed  2 nights at the Flamingo and 2 nights at the Cosmopolitan... So the circus circus was defiantly a downgrade but was perfect for the kids!!!",0,0,0

For one reason mostly, the resort is marketed to familes that travel to Vegas, so what business does a twenty-three year old have at Circus Circus? Well, I needed a room for one night and I got on hotels.com and the rate was only $24 so I pulled the trigger.  Upon arriving, the interior was nicer than I expected and check-in went by fast even with a long line.

The young lady checked me in and explained how to get to my room, which looked like quite a journey. I eventually made it to my room and bypassed the kids area, restaurants, and bars. I entered my key card and was surprised at how nice a room $25 could buy. Sure, this isn't the Wynn or Bellagio, but nevertheless, I was impressed. I only stayed for the night and was unable to thorougly explore the property. My only complaint is the casino is difficult to navigate and needs more maps and signs.

We didn't care too much at that point because we just wanted to use the room to crash. 

It's very poorly laid out, you'll find yourself doing way too much walking in there, you're far away from every other casino so a cab ride is needed each time you want to leave. It took us 10-15 minutes to get from the room to get outside to the strip. Then its another 20 minute walk to Encore and Wynn. 

A dealer at a blackjack table asked us how our stay was going and we told her it was alright and that we had a cockroach in our room. She told us we should get a new room and a discount so she brought the manager over as we were playing and he set us up in the Skyline tower with 2 queen beds like we had originally reserved and 40% off.

Anyways, it seems like one of the only kid friendly hotels in Las Vegas. I don't have any, so I don't need that but it sure reminded me of the restaurant Circus Circus which I went to a few times as a kid. 
It's likely that you'll hear your neighbors at night, at least this is what I experienced when I stayed in the manor buildings. You would probably experience this in the tower buildings as well, but I only stayed there once and I didn't. I'm not sure if the walls would be less thin in those, probably not.

I remember as a kid we used to always come here Circus Circus and visit the Midway and Adventure Dome. This review is pretty much for the Midway, which was the reason to come to the hotel. For the hotel in general, I see that the buffet and some eating establishments have changed. They've added an Auntie Anne's Pretzel and Krispy Kreme, while the pizza place stays. Can't say much for the rest.

As for the Midway, it's pretty much the same since I was a kid; over 15 years ago. In my opinion, they need to change the games up. Maybe once in a decade or so often wouldn't hurt. The 'claw' in the claw machines are still loose, so it won't grab the prizes. Sad to say I spent $25 and didn't win any prizes. On the brighter side, they still had the McDonalds there which is always packed by the way. We stopped and had some refreshments before leaving. Unless they change the games up, it doesn't look like I'll be back; at least anytime in the next decade. Thanks for the couple hours to pass the time though.

It's cheap (I paid about $30 for an off-night only a week in advance). Our room was hella far from the check-in (across the street and down a bit to be exact). Not out of walking distance, but unlike other casinos, it was not connected at all to the main section. This was annoying (but I suppose it made it quieter). Check-in was also annoying--there were probably 20 people in line ahead of us and only 2 or 3 receptionists. This meant a long wait time, and throw in bratty little children running a muck... I was about ready to break out my fifth of 100 proof SoCo right there in the lobby and start taking shots. At 4pm. No joke.

There is a $5 additional hotel fee upon check-in. This includes pool access, the fitness room, etc. It also meant free wireless internet (in theory... it was painfully slow, we gave up on it after only a few minutes. Even a 3G network on your iPhone would be faster). The coupons were a joke--nothing really worthwhile (though 2 free midway games were valid on any game, so I recommend using them on the most expensive ones like throwing the dart into a star for a huge prize).

The casino itself is pretty bad and noisy--no high class establishment here. My friends and I ended up just playing midway games while completely intoxicated (which is always fun). The games are not too expensive considering how much they could jack up the price.

The location is walking distance to the main part of the strip... only if you're FUBARed (aka F-ed Up Beyond All Recognition). Seriously though, it's not too long of a walk if you're wearing good shoes.

All in all, I'll probably not stay again, but it was fun while it lasted. You get what you pay for, but I'd even prefer Hooters (see my other review) over Circus Circus.

Despite being a budget, family Las Vegas hotel (somewhat far away from the other hotels) it was better than I thought it would be. 

Ask for military or other discounts. 

As we were leaving, the line for hotel check in was insanely long. I'm not sure if that is a common occurrence on weekends, but be beware.",8,4,5

You come out smelling like a cigarette and your ears are hurting due to the huge crowds and the kids screaming and yelling.  However, it is a family casino. I never stayed here even though the prices are cheap $26 dollars a night, I am sure what you pay is what you get.  They did remodeled he place a bit especially near the adventuredome.  I ate at the buffet as well, and it was horrible.

However, I definitely love going here. I like playing their dollar games and it does not put a dent in my wallet.  I do like playing the arcade games and liked the adventuredome as well.  You can buy the unlimited pass for $25 dollars and get on most of the rides in a day or so.  I win several prizes here as well, but they are cheap looking though.",1,0,0

The room were very clean but lacked in a few items such as the room did not have a fridge to keep drinks cold or microwave to heat up anything, there was not a coffee pot or anything of the like to drink coffee in the morning.  Lastly, the TV though it was a flat screen has been rigged so that I (or anyone) could not connect anything to it in order to review family movies from my tablet.  We learned to overcome the issues in the room.  The lobby was packed with kids and adults along with the smell of cigarette smoke around the casino area, which you have to pass in order to get to a lot of the things available for kids.  The amusement park in the hotel was phenomenal.  It was a lot bigger than I had initially figured.  My wife and I got lost trying to leave the amusement area. The hotel have several restaurants but I found the cheapest one is Rock and Rita.  The meals are reasonably priced. There is also a McDonald in the hotel as well which I guess wold make it the cheapest place to eat.  If you plan on buying tickets for any shows there is a place for it in the lobby but be warned get there early because the line grows fast and the shows will sell out quickly.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Overall the place was not bad.  It was definitely designed with kids in mind.  I think what it missed in room amenities they made up for it in the rides and games they have available in the hotel.  I give it three stars because of the cigarette smoke in the lobby area and where you have to transit to take your kids to the amusement areas and the lack of amenities in the room.  If you are traveling with kids to Vegas this is a good place to be and it was very cheap to stay there.  If you are going with adults and you can spend the money go for one of the hotels that give you everything you are looking for.",0,0,0

So if you're looking for some intimate time, you might wanna look for some other place. But if you're looking for arcade full of kids who's running around or indoor theme park full of adrenaline junkie kids & their parents, then you're at the right hotel.

Arcade has mostly machines\/slots that gives you tickets. I was surprised by the number of items you can win with the tickets. They weren't priced crazily. So you can actually win something from here. AdventureDome is the indoor theme park on the 1st floor of the main hotel. It's a must go for families. Kids will love free circus show for sure.

I'm really glad I picked this hotel. I had kids with me & Vegas is like a pressure-cooker during summer. We couldn't go anywhere & had to ditch Grand canyon trip for the unbelievable heat. Circus Circus made our stay fun. We were inside the hotel most of the time & we had one of the worst but still a buffet to go. They have Krispy Kreme doughnut, pizza place, steakhouse & some other restaurants.

Just make sure you know about their resort fee, cuz sometimes it's more expensive than the hotel room rate. And their front desk service is not that great.",3,0,2

At the Midway, I was a bit sad that a lot of the games were closed down. Some of the prices also got smaller.  It is harder to get the large prizes. I feel like the crane machines are all rigged in someway because none of them grabbed anything. The crane would just fit perfectly around the prize and then just swift off without even moving it. What a rip off!

Luckily, the Adventure Dome was a lot better. Though chaos was closed everything else was like how it usually was. There was a new Lazer game which was cool. It reminds me of secret agents. 

The whole place is just starting to look old compared to all the other buildings at the strip. It still is good ol' fun but be prepared to spend a lot of money for cheap and almost unreachable prizes.

It was there the first time I ever came to Las Vegas in the summer of 1979. I paid a visit to it then and over the years I  have been back many times. I can tell you one thing the place looks different then it did the first time I came that's for sure. 

There are only three other strip casinos older than Circus Circus and when it opened in 1968 it was only a casino no hotel rooms. It's has a lot of kool history. Tony the ""Ant"" Spilotro ran the gift shop of the Circus Circus in the early 1970's. He is the Chicago mobster who's career was the basis of the hit movie casino. Joe Pesci play his character. 

I give the Circus Circus a strong three stars. There is good and not so good here. I have a little sentimental ties to this hotel and casino. There aren't many casino left from my first visits to Las Vegas. So it does bring back memories of the way Las Vegas use to be. 

Let's start with the good. Rooms are super cheap here. Probably the cheapest on the strip. It's easy to get rooms here for like $30 or $40 bucks a night.  This is nice because it give people that can't afford the Aria or Wynn a chance to stay on the strip and to have a lot of fun with the kids. How can I say this without being mean and it's not meant that way, this hotel at times had a ""different"" clientele then say the Aria or the Wynn. Hope that makes sense without being mean. 

While from its opening in 1968 and for a couple decades this hotel was constantly upgraded. From just a Casino to a hotel and casino. Constantly adding hotel towers and buildings, to the super kool Adventuredome. This is a five acre enclosed amusement park complete with roller coasters and 25 other popular carnival type rides. It had a huge carnival\/Circus midday with all the fun games. They also still do a circus shows I believe daily. 

There are some nice shops here that give you a boardwalk feel. You can really get some good buys here. There's plenty of places to eat and drink, the Steakhouse is good food, Vince Neil of Motley Crue fame has a bar here, they have a buffet and several other decent places to eat. 

The hotel is is on the far north end of the strip. It's a good location. It's a bit of a hike to places like New York New York Hotel and Casino and the MGM Grand for example but, with all the new developments going on around it should be kinda smack dab in the middle of it all. It's not a bad walk the the Wynn or Venetian for those more northern strip casinos and right across the street of the newer SLS.

The future of this place? A lot of my casino friends say it will go. But I have a little insider informant saying it won't and that it's a cash cow for MGM. I get it, the place is always crowded and I'm sure the place has paid for itself many times over and has probably helped to finance other MGM Hotels on the Strip. 

As far as gambling, the minimum table bets are some of the lowest in the strip. This last visit we met a super rude roulette table operator though. Most others working there are nice.

I'm a Blackjack guy and don't really do Slots but I believe it was one of the last strip casinos (and maybe still has a couple) to use coin in and coin out Slots. I like those older slot machines. 

My first visit to Las Vegas Circus Circus had just purchased Slots-a-Fun Casino next door. Circus Circus is and MGM hotel and Casino now. I'm my opinion, this hotel could use an upgrade. A major upgrade. Other than that it's a fun place to bring the kids while in Vegas and a nice place to gamble and eat. I hope this place sticks around.",42,18,32

We arrived to the hotel at about 2:30 pm and were not charged an early check in which was nice. They also didn't hold my card for incidentals, and the woman who helped us check in was very kind (I think her name was Grace). Being the first face we saw at the hotel, she made a very good impression on behalf of the hotel! Our room was good, clean, and we got a nice view out on the strip. I would say the buffet is quite expensive for what you really get out of it, so would avoid it. The pool is not notable really. Kinda dirty and a bit smaller, but it does the job on a hot day. Also no microwaves and fridges are only available for an extra $22 a night (instead we went to the nearby Walgreens and bought a cheap cooler and filled with free hotel ice). My other comment would be housekeeping is not the best. We had a Do Not Disturb up while we left for the day, and when we came back they had come in and put the sign back inside and cleaned and moved things around. Also instead of replacing towels we had put on the ground, they just picked them up and hung them back up (gross!); and they didn't change our sheets for the week we were there. It is located on the very middle of the whole strip, so you do have to take a bus or walk to go to most popular places on the south end of the strip. Overall, a pretty good hotel and worth it for the price we paid and no big complaints.",2,0,0

There is definitely an odor inside the hotel and hotel room floors. Our room wasn't that bad, the toilet didn't flush right and some other minor things. I was optimistic. 
My husband and I had immediately woken up after midnight due to a REALLY strong odor coming into our room, because someone was smoking marijuana! It was awful and I was livid! We had two young children in this room and here my husband and I thought we upgraded to keep away from this exact situation..
I had a terrible headache from it and sat on hold with guest services for 20 minutes at 12:30 in the morning to answer the call!

Pros
-front desk staff seem to be cool and professional 
-Very big as far as hotel itself it has about 3-4 buildings. 
-Has a lot of things to do for the family.
- Gives you a coupon book to use at the hotel for food, beverage, casino, and fun activities. 


Walk with me as I explain what I saw 


Cons:
The front desk agent kept hinting several times about paying for an upgrade in hotel ...which I should have taken her advice on if it looks better than what the hell I stayed at. The price to  upgrade was $25 more. (Next time I will trust my instincts) 
-We stayed at The Manor (aka rat trap, aka the place the prostitutes bring their John's, aka roach motel, aka Bates Hotel, aka Original hotel from the Rat Pack days. The manor is located behind the high rise hotels. 

-it had graffiti on the buttons in the elevator..smh 

- We walked into the room and it looked so dated like from the 60's. The wallpaper is dated and there were stains on it. There was  this one spot in particular that had this brown-ish- red spot which is either blood or water stain. The shower curtain was dirty. The wallpaper near the entry way to the bathroom was stained. The curtains in the room has slashes in it as if some either did it on purpose or someone was trying to stab someone. 
-The tables in the room was old and there was water stains on it. The lounge couch was dated and I didn't want to sit in it.  I immediately thought this place had to have bed bugs. I checked and surprisingly it didn't. The bed was comfy despite how old it looks.
-TV was definitely old and it was a box tv (who the hell still have these kind of TV's in a motel) the channels were blurry and the TV kept shutting off and on. For all the high traffic of people I saw checking in the hotel they could afford to buy some flat screen TV's at a wholesale rate at Wal-Mart. 

-the shower head needed to be replaced and you had to play around to get the shower to turn off completely.

I tried to maintain the motto ""what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas"" but this was too much. 
I normally give places the benefit of the doubt and rate no less than a 4 out of 5 but this place needs to do some real remodeling. 






If I come back it would be in the high rises.

Bottom line avoid saying at the Manor",1,2,1

Waiting in that line and in a crowded elevator full of people that have been in the desert heat does not smell nice...27 smelly floors. :(

While we were there, we went to the pool and rented one of the family umbrellas. Throughout the day we had to fend off people trying to come in our rented space (our kids chairs while they played). It would have been nice if they occasionally checked in to monitor that. Also, I waited for a cocktail waitress to show up until after 1pm.

Now, if you compare Circus Circus to another kid friendly spot on the strip, you will be pleasantly surprised! There is so much to do here for kids AND for the kid in you!

Without a doubt, needs a facelift!!! It is very old, and has a grimy feel to it. We stayed in the ""newer"" West Tower and even this felt old. I don't think I will ever stay here again. The place seems clean and the room service was attentive, but it's true what they say, you can't polish a turd. It did the job though, we slept and showered and it work fine. 

The Pool: 3 Stars
Decent size(2 of them), but also very old. There is a bar and snack bar for convenience, I ordered a bloody Mary for $10 (Includes the cup). It was great! I suggest getting there when it opens up before the crowd arrives. When it was crowded, it was too much. 

The Casino: 3 Stars
There was a good variety of slots and tables. It's not too big and yet not too small. 

The Food: 3 Stars
Here's a quick rundown of the spots we hit. All of these spots are a mix between a sit down restaurant and a fast food. You order and pay, then seat yourself and pick up your food. 

***The Pizzeria was very good! Recommend this spot!

*The Garden Grill was OK. The burger was just OK, the Caesar Salad dressing sucks, stay away. The wings are decent. The portions are pretty big!

*The Blue Iguana was again, just OK. It was NOT authentic Mexican food and needed some seasoning but it was edible. 

***Barista Bagels was good! Breakfast special was good and you can't really go wrong with a bagel and coffee. 
*** McDonalds was actually ""fresh"" and tasty. I don't eat at any McD's and was happy with what I did eat here. Yes, I just said that I liked McDonalds...here. 

The Fun: 5 stars!
Lots to do in the Midway and also in Adventuredome. Carnival games that only cost a buck or two and are easy enough to win a prize. Video arcades galore. Rides, rides, rides! Fun for all ages, literally. There are plenty of rides for the little ones to get on and some exciting rides for the big ones! 

So, in case you missed it...LOTS of fun if you have kids with you in Vegas!!!",7,1,0

I stayed in the Manor Motor Lodge during my recent stay. Here are just a few of the things that sucked about it: there is no fridge, no microwave, and no coffeemaker; the outlets are loose and won't hold your plugs; I found several bugs. The wifi was pretty decent, but then again it should be for $10 bucks a day (aka the resort fee). 

The Midway, at least, has been updated. One of the last times I made my way there, everything was broken down, so it was nice to see they had fixed some of it up. However, so many of the games are like 2 bucks a pop, and all you win is this crappy little stuffed animal.  The circus acts are pretty cool, though. Oh, and they took away the Carousel Bar. Why?!

There are so many other options on and off the Strip that you really don't have to settle for Circus Circus if you're looking for a cheap option. I really wish they would step up their game just a bit.",0,0,0

Fast forward to 2017. This hotel has sure changed. Sure with the time that's passed, things will be different. But oh they did not change for the best. 

The cheapest rooms are in the ""old"" tower. If you book those, after check in you will have to walk quite a ways to get there. We upgraded for an extra $10 a night so we could be in the West tower. Avoid going back out in 100+ degree temps, and not have to lug our bags a half a mile away.

The elevators are ridiculous. There are 4 that go to the first 10 floors, and then another 4 that go to the rest. They are so slow. Crowded. Rickety. Borderline scary. Definitely not enough for the amount of people in that hotel. Several times we spent at least 15-20 minutes to even get an elevator, and most times it was so packed we couldn't even get in it. They had trash in them most times. Someone barfed in one. Super.

The room was clean. Newer furniture. The king bed had 3 pillows for 2 people. No comforter on the bed. Just a thin blanket between two white sheets. Fridges and coffee pots are no longer in the rooms. The flat screen TV looked like the 1st model ever made. The bed was hard and not very comfortable. I think the sewer system was overloaded because there were times it smelled like a porta potty in our room that was used by 100 people and left to sit in the sun for a couple days. It was pretty disgusting.

The gambling area was okay. The machines hit pretty decently. The Pizzaria and Deli were delicious. But the buffet was wayyyyy overpriced. Almost $50 for two people to eat dinner with a mediocre selection of food.

Being there felt like Grand Central Station. You couldn't walk anywhere without running into a kid or a stroller. Buy waters, sodas, beverages at Walgreens or somewhere else. The lobby store was selling Aquafina 1L bottles for $4. The vending machines on each floor sells 20oz bottles of soda for $4. 

I'll never stay there again. It's just too run down and too busy and the food is way too expensive. Cheaper is definitely not better.",7,0,0

(Not rude or moody) I go there 2 or 3 times per year and I love to gamble and expend money. I never expect to win, only to have fun, meet friends and gamble in a hassle free atmosphere. But, this is the third time I visit Circus Circus and  I've been forced to switch tables every time a couple of Mexican rude dealers are in my table.( I am Mexican by the way ) they are always mad, slap people hands, and give a very killer looks, when some body complains about their attitude. Also there is a Black fat lady she is the same as those two. OMG! are they working for free?? I was giving $5 to $10 dollars to this dealer on every wining hand, and he not even pick up his tip until I tell him to. I am not Shure if he considered the tip as an offense or very small. I stop doing it so after the third time.

You guys need to improve dealer customer service or people won't want to gamble there any more! the Asian dealers are all great! I have never had a single problem in 29 years visiting your casino.

Maybe this review will go to trash but, at least I had expressed my opinion to you. It is in your hands to do something or nothing in regards.

Have a great day.

I stayed in the Manor once because all the rest were so expensive (it was a weekend with a huge event somewhere in vegas). It is a looooong walk to and from the casino since they are located outside. However, when i went they had a mini fridge which no other room has had (i think this was in 2012). It was awful but it wasn't the best. I wouldn't stay in the manor again unless i absolutely had to.  

Now the skyrise, it is located inside the main building (no need to walk outside) and it was really nice, nothing special but nice. It was clean not far from adventuredome. Not much to say. Definitely would stay there again.

Now West Tower my favorite! This is where my family and i usually stay! It is near the adventure dome for my brother and i. The rooms are nice, the gym is really close by! Its the perfect place! Out of all 4 rooms i'd say this one is the best!

Casino tower... the most expensive. My family and i booked the hotel room online and we were super excited. We booked it because the rooms were cheaper than usual and we decided to stay in the best room we could. Upon walking in the room seemed small and cramped. Maybe we just got a bad spot but i didnt lkke how the west tower rooms were cheaper and more spacious! There was nothing special to room which was really disappointing because it is the best one. It had beds toilet and a shower but i thought it was missing a little umph. Definitely not staying there again!

All in all i love Circus Circus. All of my stays there have been wonderful and i hope they continue to be great. This is a family friendly hotel and i dont understand why people leave such nasty reviews. Circus circus is one of the cheapest on the strip i dont know why people complain if you want a good hotel go to Cesars Palace or Bellagio. The Adventure Dome is great, Midway is great (free shows)!

We booked a room for Saturday night. Arrived a couple of hours before Frightdome was set to open, dropped our bags off in the room and actually rested a bit.

The hotel\/casino itself like I stated before is rundown and just not a pleasant experience. But on the upside it was a 10 minute walk from our room to Frightdome. Check in was a nightmare.

They also have a few circus acts throughout the day that the kids really enjoyed.

Adventure dome was as we expected-but it was dirty, and again the staff had the look of death in their eyes. They did not give a crap about anyone; in fact they looked annoyed when my husband stated he wanted to purchase a rock climb and bungee jump for my kids. The food was not worth the price at all!

Some backstory:  I came to Vegas for only one reason - my daughter was undergoing radiation treatment for cancer and needed to be isolated in her home.  When I found that out, I began searching for affordable hotel rooms so I could come to town and take my 3 grandkids out of the home during this time.  I did a lot of research finding a room I could afford, knowing I would have to buy meals for myself and 3 kids for 5 days as well. I finally settled on this hotel because I thought at least the rooms are reasonable and the kids would have something to do in the evenings (two are in school). I booked my room online, but needed to add an extra night a few days before travel. That is when I had my first negative experience with Circus Circus, when I spoke with their reservations person, I asked her, due to my situation, if they could waive all or at least part of the 23.00 ""resort fee"". She cut me off before I could finish my sentence with a loud and rude, ""no"" and went on to explain all the ""benefits"" I get for that fee, including a coupon book with ""all kinds of free stuff"".  I asked her if I was getting one of those books for each night of my stay, and was again told, ""no"". One coupon book per reservation.  I wasn't sure I really understood correctly or understood the reasoning of it, and I asked her to explain. Her answer was, ""well, its pretty simple. You get one. Do I need to get a supervisor to explain that to you?"" To which, I said ""yes"". So on the phone came a supervisor, and she explained one per room, but as a special ""favor"" offered to upgrade me to the west tower, which would put me closer to the casino. Apparently, she missed the whole part of my story that I was coming with 3 kids.  I never visited the casino.  So here are the reasons for such a low rating:

1. They told me all about the free stuff in the coupon book, such as rides and games, things for the kids to do.  There are no free rides. There are discounts on a ridiculous 37.00 ride bracelet and 2 for 1 roller coaster coupons. Same for games. Basically, all their coupons are buy something get something, or discount on something. NOTHING is FREE without spending MONEY on something else.
2. The rides and games close at 6. My grandson doesn't get out of school until 3:20. By the time we get back to the hotel, its after 4.  That gave him less than 2 hours to do anything
3. ""High Speed"" Internet. Another ""perk"" of the resort fee. The wifi they had has an upload\/download speed of 5 mbps. Useless. I couldn't do any work during the day
5. Restaurants. Blue Iguana. One step below taco bell. The food was tasteless. They charged me 3.99 for a little plastic tub, about 3 tablespoons, of guacamole. My granddaugher doesn't eat Mexican, so she had McDonalds. Lucky her. The rest of us did - and got sick. I've been changing some rank diapers for 24 hours now.  Our last night here, we at at Vince Neil's to take advantage of the coupon in the book - two 8 oz new york strips and a bottle of wine for $29.  We ordered cheese sticks as an appetizer, which was supposed to come with marinara and ranch dipping sauces. Instead, it came with 5 cheese sticks (for $10) laying in a bed of marina sauce. No ranch. My steak was over-cooked, so I sent it back. They never brought me out another one. When my granddaughter was done eating, the waiter appeared to see how everything was. I pointed to the empty spot in front of me and told him that I had sent it back with the server (guy brings your food out is not the waiter).  He went into the back and reaappeared with my steak. I told him it was a little late, we were ready to leave. Did he offer to discount my check? No. He offered to box it up to go.
6. The room itself.  These rooms are old, they stock cheap soap and a small off-brand combination shampoo\/conditioner. Motel 6 level. The ""free in-room"" coffee was cheap packs with powdered cream. The beds come with 3 sheets and a thin blanket - no coverlet or bedspread. The whole first day, I kept thinking, ""well, anything can be forgiven with a nice, hot shower."" Until I took one. The shower heads are your basic, cheapest shower head - reminiscent of my first low-rent apartment years ago. No water pressure at all, and no way to adjust anything. Bathtubs are standard with the curved shower curtain bar that's supposed to fool you into thinking its better.  In a nutshell, the room was below what you'd expect from a Motel 6.
7. Service. The first night here I called down to order a crib. They told me it was 22.40\/night to rent one! After complaining, they agreed to waive the fee, but then never brought the crib. I had to call again the 2nd night.

There were 2 nice things about this place, the maintenance man who came and opened our safe. Very nice guy. The housekeeper the first morning. Very friendly.

The rooms are terrible.   Paint peeling and faded.  Bad smells.   Awnings tearing and damaged from the sun. Trash everywhere.  Weeds growing everywhere. The room we stayed in was 2nd floor with no ventilation in the bathroom (unless you call an old dirty unballanced fan that pulls air through a small filter and immediatly spits it back into the bathroom).  The air conditioner would blow the curtains across the room like a flag in the wind. We either had to put a shoe on the curtain or open them.  And the SMELL!  You can't open a window because there are no screens on window.  An old cathode ray tube telivision with faded and off colors! Because thier RV parking lot was full, they let us park in their RV park for $20 a night.  Our door opened to a full and overflowing dumpster.  At 1 am the people accross the hall kept slamming thier door because thier door was malfunctioning.   Those poor souls eventually got moved to another room.   As I decended the stairs the next morning I nearly slipped and fell on a corndog. The adventure dome so under staffed a good portion of the attractions and games are not even available for use.

Anyway, the only experience I have ever got of Vegas was Circus Circus. It's like carnival games but indoors. But with a lot more people. And way more expensive. And without the cotton candy? Actually don't quote me on that. I don't know if they have cotton candy. I grew up with a mother that told me cotton candy was made of old women's hair. But that's a whole 'nother story.

So back to carnival games. I suck at anything involving coordination which apparantly is the root of carnival games.

This is quite obviously one of the older places on the strip and it seems that Circus Circus knows it and doesn't really care or try to keep up or compete with the rest of the strip. We stayed in the Circus Manor across the street from the big hotel. There is NOTHING luxurious or fancy about this place. You get a shower and a bed. The only high tech thing in their rooms are their Keurig coffee makers which are located IN THE BATHROOM. Totally didn't use that thing. GROSS. You do get a lot of space in your room so if you have kids this would be a good thing. The bed was surprisingly comfortable. I was able to get full nights sleep with out tossing and turning.

You pay a $15 resort fee per day with your stay, as if you would really use their facilities besides the casino unless you are traveling with children. Everything just seems cheesy and run down. Old video games, carnival games, rides and ""circus"" performers. They do offer free parking which is great! The pool area is decent. 

If you are wanting a luxurious Las Vegas experience don't stay here. If you want to stretch your dollar this is a ok place. We were only in the room to shower and sleep so it turned out to be a great value. Check in was easy, check out was easier. You are able to do express check out via text message. With the amount of volume that Circus Circus gets I really feel like they could put in a tad bit more effort in keeping this place modern. Even just a few new coats of paint and some small details like faucet fixtures in the bathrooms and carpets. 

I wouldn't say avoid the Circus, just know you are getting what you pay for.",1,0,1

Going in: First, grab the door handle and pull it towards you.  While you are pulling, insert key card and pull it out.  The left light should turn green.  While you are still pulling the door handle towards you, turn the door handle and unlock the door.  Hold still.  Take a breath.  Now slowly push the door open with your free hand.  Viola!  You're in.  When you close the door from the inside, turn the door handle down and make sure you close the door tight until you let go of the handle.  If you forget this or do it incorrectly, you're gonna wake everyone up.

Going out:  Open the door quietly.  The door will creak a bit, hopefully your roommates are passed out cold...  Grab onto the outside door handle.  Insert key card and pull it out.  When the lights turn green, crank the door handle down and hold it down.  As you're leaving, pull the door as tightly closed as possible before slowly letting the door handle return to its position.  If you forget this or do it incorrectly, you're gonna wake everyone up.

About my stay:  $50 a night (for 2 beds) in the Manor Motor Lodge for 3 nights.  Registration is separated from the motel room, so drive your car to Manor Motor Lodge and then walk over to registration.

The room seemed clean, but the halls have a musty old smell.  You get a small safe next to the TV.  USE IT.  The bed was comfortable.

Bring your own soap and shampoo, the stuff they have sucks.  Bathroom was clean and the water pressure was good, but I wished the shower head would spray water down instead of at an angle.

There are 2 pools outside, but you can't go inside at night, which was the only free time I had.  Casino was meh... easy to get lost in, so beware.  Didn't get a chance to do arcade and rides, nor see any Circus-y stuff.

They have this old motel next to the main hotel that is not even attached, she explained this was the location of our room and offered me an upgrade to a deluxe room in the main hotel for $20. I took it because there was no way I was staying in that other place. If the room we upgraded to was a deluxe room then I don't even would want to know what the motel rooms looked like. This hotel is VERY dirty, the carpets in the hallways are all stained and there is trash laying everywhere.

Rooms on the weekend- yes WEEKEND- are sometimes priced below $20- and that isn't for the Manor rooms, that's for a tower room.  Three weeks ago, I booked a flight from San Francisco to Vegas, PLUS four nights at Circus Circus for $170.  Compared to other strip hotels, Circus Circus is filthy.  Once the largest casino and hotel in Vegas, it's now ready to be torn down.  It makes sense to stay at Circus Circus- I mean, who really stays in their hotel room in Vegas.  If you have a ""west Tower"" room, the rooms are as nice as Bally's or Harrah's- almost as nice as MGM.  It's always my recommendation to get a cheap room here, and then spend your time on the South Strip.  Take all that money you saved and play some blackjack on Fremont Street (better odds and selection).  I think it's silly how people spend over $200\/night for a room, when they're hardly there.  If you have children, go to Excalibur, not Circus Circus.  If you want to stay in you're room, and watch TV, and have no idea how to vacation, then spend $400\/night at bellagio or the Venitian, not Circus Circus.

I was more scared of the fact that my room was the scene of an obvious Crack party prior to my check in.  Upon entry none of the lamps would turn on,  so I reached for the lightbulbs.  Simply put, they were greasy with fingerprints.  The remote control was sticky.  The TV and wireless modem had been unplugged behind the TV cabinet and brownish toilet paper had been stuffed in the peephole.  No doubt some very important crackhead was trying to keep ""the man"" from surveilling their going's on in the room while they binged.

On to the exercise room.  After signing out a key for the workout area I had to be escorted there by security as it is impossible to find in that aging labyrinth.  Neither my key card nor the security guards worked so I had to knock to be let in.  I wish that I hadn't.  The smell of old, penetrating and sour sweat hit me like a sledge hammer.  Like if I kept my heavily used workout shorts moist and warm in a plastic bag for several years.  Not good.  It took more work to find an operational machine than anything I did in that terrible room.

Second night in the hotel I returned at 11pm, tired and ready to sleep in my crack sheets, when alas, my card key didn't open the door to my room.  I called the front desk and they sent security up.  The first security person's card didn't work so they had to call up another guard.  I told the first that, ""this is Vegas, and if I were a betting person I would wager that the fact that my card worked earlier but doesn't now, and that your master card doesn't work, the door lock is broken.""  My logic was apparently not sound enough because they called up another, whose card didn't work either.  They had to call up maintenance with some secret room opening device that I couldn't see.  I then had to relocate to a new room at 1am.  They were gracious enough to offer me late check-out for the inconvenience.

Finally, the food at the buffet.  I was really hungry.  However, my hunger was clearly not powerful enough to make a single item on the nasty buffet palatable.  I even tried simple things like the chicken strips just trying to get some sustenance, but even they were inedible.

I always go to Circus Circus for the Midway area. It's a great place to take your kids, friends, or even your date. They have free shows going on like every 30-40 minutes and have lots of arcades and games to play. How much you spend in this area is up to you. Even if you don't spend a dime, you can still enjoy the free shows (acrobats, jugglers, trapeze, can't beat that!). Then of course, there is the Adventuredome. You are never too old to enjoy an indoor theme park. Most of those rides aren't extreme, so its a safe bet for most people. My friends came to Vegas for a few nights and they spent most of their time inside the Adventuredome and Midway area.

The furniture had patches on it, with a fridge that  the door wasn't even attached, the bathroom toilet was leaking.  But the biggest problem, was the fact that they were trying to put 4 of us into a suite with a queen bed and they were bringing up a roll away.  had we not already paid for it I would have taken my business elsewhere from then on.  We were moved into another romm more suited for us and stayed in that room, but even this NON smoking room had burns on the bed, the carpet, and the bedding had multipul burns.

I spent 1\/3 of the money they did and actually had a very pleasant stay in a nice room.  I didn't stay in the main hotel but in the little apartment complex rooms that are detached.  My room was very quiet and very cold for it being over 100 degrees outside.  My friends however were very jealous of my room because it was quite big and everything worked.  As where there room was a bit run down and requiring maintenance.  

The only real drawback here is that you'll have to walk quite a ways to get to the really good casinos and attractions further along the strip.  Also there are indeed a lot of children here but I could care less because I rarely spent time at the casino here or my room.  I come to Vegas to explore, not camp out at my hotel.  They have great food here too and the best hotel rates for the quality of the rooms in all of Vegas in my opinion.  

Not for nothing, they do have loose slots in the Casino, and they would be a good start or end to an evening of gambling further along the strip.  But I cannot stress enough how cheap the rates are here, I was usually half lit and fell straight to sleep in my ice cold room when I returned from a night of debauchery anyways.

I have never in my life felt so nasty. This hotel is disgusting. I wish we would have read more of the reviews and did research before staying here. We checked in at 2 in the morning. Between the time we checked in until 3:45 am, we moved rooms 3 times. The sheets where nasty and had old blood stains. The beds had hair from previous guests as well, the bathroom and there was a bug in one of the beds. They upgraded us to a suite and comp'd is 2 breakfast Buffett. Idk what or why the new room was considered an upgrade because it was still nasty. Which in all honesty, if the rooms are this nasty, I have no desire to eat anything prepared, stored or brought into this hotel. I have to say that the manager on duty whose name is Carrie, was more than helpful and apologetic for everything that we had issues with. To be honest, the staff was nice, but the entire housekeeping staff needs to be fired. This makes no sense that we had 3 rooms in a row that where that nasty. Even the upgraded suite was dirty and smelled like cigarettes, but after driving 12 hours to get here and having to change rooms so many times, we just slept with our clothes on. I've never stayed anywhere that makes me feel as dirty as I felt while in this place. I can honestly say that I WILL NEVER STAY AT CIRCUS CIRCUS EVER AGAIN. No matter how much they want to give us free, they can keep it because there is no reason that any place in the service industry should be that nasty.

Today, it is not as nice. It is worn, smell Christmas in the corridors of a non-nice way. When we checked in we had to wait in line for almost 30 minutes, which is crazy. We paid for a continental breakfast. Breakfast?! What you may choose to include milk, coffee, juice or a bottle of water. Then a croissant, muffin or danish. Finally, an apple or a banana. The bananas are almost always the end, one is allergic to apples, there is no one to do. If you want a cup of tea instead of coffee will cost you $ 4. The queues for breakfast is miles long.
Not even the staff is especially nice. They stand behind the counter and just looks bored. You get no information about the hotel, about where the breakfast is, where the pool is located, or you can pay $ 9.95 to receive a coupon booklet with a lot of discounts.

Location is not a very good one. This Hotel caters to a lot of families and there should be more security out in the premises. There are a lot of homeless people outside the building.

My friends and I booked to stay in the ""Manor Rooms."" Little did we know that these rooms were actually across from the main building\/tower (as if we weren't far enough away from the center of the strip). 

Positives:
-Spacious! Lots of room for luggage and moving around
-Fridge! So rare in Vegas rooms, unless you're splurging on a suite or whatever. This kept all our booze nice and cold.
-Self-parking
Negative:
-Broken hairdryer, iron, and light. We called the hotel about these issues and the person  they sent over to fix it never came.

The place is outdated, musty and in need of a facelift. The hotel has two towers and has full casinos downstairs, restaurants, mini marts, bars and the midway where you can watch free circus acts and play games.

The room we got had two queen beds with a bathroom. It was small, smelled musty and the walls were so thin. You could hear the family in the next room. They didn't have a fridge and the given toiletries were minimal. The only good thing about the room was probably the beds and the thick curtains to keep the sun out. During the night\/mornings there would be weird noises, every time someone would flush their toilet or shower you could hear the pipes making loud noises in the wall. I didn't get much sleep because of the darn room!

I enjoyed the mini bar downstairs in the lobby where you can buy yard drinks, definitely get a strong Strawberry Daiquiri! Keep the cup to refill, saves you about ten bucks. The Westside Deli and the Pizzeria is pretty good to fill up your tummy as well. Hit up the Blackjack tables, my friends got pretty hot tables here.

The lack of mini bar, fact there is no menu for room service or television channels was also a negative. 

The hotel: This is an older hotel so between the old and worn carpets alongside the serious spend required to update the whole building, this is not a place for lovers or high-rollers. This is a hotel for families.

I've never stayed at the hotel or ate from the buffets here but gambling in this place is A LOT better then any other casino because when we come here, we always win something.

When you come here, (and any other casino) make sure to get the Player's Card.  They have a deal right now that if you spend $10 they give you $5 for free or spend $20 and $10 are free.  Make sure to get this as they give them to you as chips and you have to go play at the tables.  You CANNOT cash them in but if you win at the tables, you get your money plus extra back.

I came up about $40 on tables and $20 on slots.  My boyfriend came up about $50 on tables and $20 on slots.  

This place doesn't look all that run down, maybe the outside does a little bit but the inside looks decent.  Playing tables at this place has been the easiest compared to all the other casinos i've gambled in.  I came up money, so that's all that matters.  A lot of other casinos take your money in a blink of an eye but this casino, is for me, much more lenient then the other ones.

I finished my two weeks trip in Utah and was heading back to Los Angeles. My plan was staying at Las Vegas for One night and then continued my trip back home. Because it was Friday, every hotel in Las Vegas was expensive. I picked Circus Circus since it had a decent rate. Still, it cost me 134 dollars for one night. When I I booked the hotel, I didn't pay attention to the fact that the room was in the Manor Motor Lodge. Now I regretted my carelessness. The Manor Motor lodge is nothing but a motel.
The motor lodge is separated with the casino and the West Tower. After check-in, you will have to walk a long way to your room, which is not a pleasant experience considering the hot Summer of Las Vegas. The worst part is that the room is outdated. Furniture in the room is exactly what you will expect in a Motel 6 or Super 8. In addition, one desk lamp in my room was not functioning. If you stay during weekdays for 30 dollars per day+ the 14 dollars resort fee, it is somehow acceptable. However, if I spend 134 dollars for one night in this room, I really expect more than motel 6 experience.
If you spend your vacation in Las Vegas, I will suggest you spending a little bit more picking one of the room in the West Tower or going somewhere else.",1,0,0

We got a room so we could take our 5 year old to the Adventure Dome. We played all day and our feet were killing us so we decided to go up to our room and figure out dinner. We ordered from the pizza place that is in the casino. They deliver and the little one was pooped and grumpy so that was perfect. No need to lug her around any longer. We ordered a large pizza and wings and it cost $40ish. Totally regretted not trekking it back across the casino to go to mcdonalds to save money, but it was nice to  have a little pizza party in our room. Also, if you think you will be thirsty, bring your own drinks to your room. Sodas cost $4 from vending machine

The room was standard. It was nice and clean and we were actually shocked how nice it turned out being. Will stay again when we decide to go to Adventure Dome again.

And when it happened, you felt very regretful because you knew you should have gone with your first instinct? Thats exactly how my experience went at this hotel. 

The price was decent(you get what you pay for, and that has been proven). The rooms were okay, however the service was abysmal unfortunately. The moment i walked in the lobby(while carrying luggage), I was aggressively harassed by a so called greeter employee trying to get me to book for the following year. I wasn't even greeted before they started trying to get more money out of me. Can I just enjoy the night first and see how I feel after my stay? I politely declined the offer and was still harassed by the employee. I waved them off with a no. They still wouldn't leave me alone, and tried following me. So I had to be rude to them just for them to leave me alone. Now I feel bad because I'm sure everyone treats them like that and that puts me in a poor mood. 


Lets fast forward this till check out.  I Had a great night, had fun, etc... I go back to my car and noticed the rear passenger window has been punched in and someone broke into my car. This happened on hotel property in the parking garage. Things that were stolen weren't even f##king worth breaking into a car for. Seriously, to whoever stole from the car, I hope you step on a dirty lego. 

So I called security and tried to utilize their expertise in handling this problem. I felt like I could have gotten a lot more accomplished during an aftermath at a cheap all you can eat buffet in a porta-potty in the middle of the desert. Basically the one of many security guards I saw at the hotel was less hopeful than Colin Kaepernick getting a starting QB position on the NFL. The term ""security"" means the state of being free from danger or threat. I believe that is being disregarded at the management level. The parking garage I was parked at did not have surveillance cameras. This is the 21st century, we have cameras on our phones which can also be used to control a television, to navigate us back home, to find out whats a good place to eat, and to make a phone call. What a time to be alive! And this hotel doesn't have SECURITY cameras in their parking garage. What kind of security is that? I'm sure this has been an ongoing issue in the past and will continue to be an issue in the future. 

I filled this report out that was provided to me by security which looked like it was developed by an individual learning how to use microsoft excel 1997. I filled out all the information with details. I was promised to get a call back from a manager, or corporate to get to the bottom of this and talk it out because that's all i ever wanted was to just simply speak to management. Well, the results came back and the lie detector determined that was a lie. Nothing happened. Filling out this piece of paper gives customers\/victims a false sense of SECURITY.

Due to a last minute change in our vacation plans we decided to go to Vegas for a few days. Because we had no reservations for accommodations we sat in the baggage claim at the airport searching for places to stay. We called a few places prior to picking Circus Circus, but because of a large convention in town they were all booked for the night. We decided to ""roll the dice"" and let Price Line pick the cheapest deal (which wasn't very much of a savings!) and Circus Circus was the accommodations picked. Just walking into the lobby I could see that it was run down, but the staff was very friendly and helpful. The check-in went smooth and we were given directions to our NON-SMOKING room in an adjacent building. The minute we walked into the hallway we smelled marijuana smoke and the stale musty smell of a tired motel. As soon as we unlocked the door to our room the smell of cigarette smoke was overwhelming. The walls were paper thin and we heard everything our neighbors said, albeit we don't understand Spanish. Everything about this stay at Circus Circus was unpleasant! We will not ever be staying here nor will we ever recommend it to anybody.

It is VERY dumpy and ""all used up"".

It could have easily passed as an extension of the dumpy TraveLodge next door.

Here are some of the things that we didn't enjoy:
The half-mile trek from the hotel desk to our room.
The rude service at the hotel desk.
The beds were very uncomfortable (The floor was more comfortable!)
The TV got channels 2-13, of which 3 were static, 2 were ""in house"" channels, 2 were news .. 
The TV checkout system didn't work (hotel-wide).
The bathroom floor of our hotel room was dirty when we arrived
The table-lamps in the room were falling apart
The parking lot lights seem to be pointed directly at the room window and shine around the blackout curtain
The ""security guard"" at the entrance to the parking area checked for a room key the first time. There was nobody there the second time, and they waved us through the third time.
We asked housekeeping for more pillows and waited about an hour before giving up and buying some at Wal Mart
The arcade game areas were full of broken games
Ugliest Carpet Ever!
Our non-smoking room smelled like stale smoke, worse than the hallways.
The card-lock entrance to our  building didn't have anything to lock onto
No vending machines in the remote hotel room buildings
Clowns. Lots of them. Thankfully none in the hotel room.
Our hotel door didn't close\/lock all the way on its own, even though it slammed every time.
The a\/c system in the room wouldn't allow you to have the fan running all the time.  It would shut off the fan after an hour or two (making it hard to drown out the outside noise)
The walls were thin .. We apologize if you had the room next to us, but you started it.

Good (which can be found at other places too):
In-room mini-fridge
Water pressure in the shower
An impossible-to-clog toilet
On the strip
Cheap (Although, we're going to pay more next time for a better place so we can enjoy our trip more, instead of bitching about how ghetto Circus Circus is)

We'd agree with other users that this is a good place to take kids.  They don't seem to care that you leave them unattended to run amok, and there are lots of things for kids to climb on.",4,1,1

But there's literally 500,000 kids everywhere at all times! I mean, it probably didn't help that we were visiting during the Junior NBA's and I think they were hosting it. So I mean, make a wrong turn and feel like a sardine in a can. 

So the pros about CC: my kids liked it here. 

The cons about CC: my kids liked it here. 

The games are like fair games...you keep playing trying to get the bigger prize. The employees look unamused to be working there. They look like they wish they could be anywhere else, other than there. I'm not sure if I blame them. NOTE: if you have multiple kids, make sure to bring the bank roll. Or deal with some seriously disappointed kids with their flower prizes. 

They have shows that happen maybe every hour and a half. We got seats for the scarf arial dancer. My kids liked watching the girl do that. An employee walks around selling popcorn and cotton candy. Kinda gives you that circus without the animal smell feeling. 

We didn't go o adventure dome...but I'm not too sure my kids would be into that. I believe it's $30 for an all day pass. They have a McDonalds in the game area...of course they do.

***Thin walls.   I could hear the words of an argument on both sides of our room (we were in between two rooms that seemed like they were all from the same, arguing family).  This was in Manor C.
By the way, the Manors suck.  I would never let them put me here again.  It is far away from all the shops and coffee places.  So in the morning, you gotta trek out of the building, into the sunlight, walk to another building, take the escalator up, walk a long pathway to finally reach the nearest place that sells coffee and pastries.  Yes, there is coffee in the room but it sucks and it isn't enough for a real coffee drinker.  The rooms show a lot of wear and tear and grime.  It really makes me want to spend MORE money at a better hotel next time to have nice, clean surroundings.
***The fire alarm went off at 4am our first night.  Everyone went outside in PJs, wondering what happened.  There wasn't a fire.  The security guards rode over on their bikes and nonchalantly informed a few guests the alarm must have been engaged by someone on purpose.  They didn't make an official announcement that is was OK to return to our rooms, you just had to guess by noticing everyone going back into the building.  Very unprofessional.  It was obvious they don't have a real disaster plan.
***The pool was closed at 2pm on our 2nd day, the one day we had planned to take the kids swimming.  Not sure what happened.  There wasn't a cleaning crew or any activity.  It was 106 degrees outside.
***The Midway games are still fun!  The people running them are all cheerful and good at making the games fun and exciting.  I liked that.

On the main floor you have all of your table games,  slots and bars. These are all old and you can even find a few slot machines that take and pay out tokens. Like most of the casinos in the area,  they also have a frozen drink bar. 

Step upstairs and you'll be able to answer the question that's been bugging you since you set foot in this place. Why are there so many damn children?!  The upstairs is full of arcade games and the kind of skill games you'd find at a cheap carnival. 

But the real gem of circus circus is located in the middle of the second floor. A small area where gymnasts perform a set every half an hour. This free show is unexpected and sure to please all ages.

I'll start with what just happened. House keeping has a storage room right behind the headboard of the bed I'm sleeping in. It's 2:30am on a Thursday morning. The brilliant class of person who works for this sort of run down dump decides NOW is the perfect time to slam fully loaded carts around with all his might. The headboard on my roommates bed hit him in the head. We're both wide awake thinking that there's a huge fight going on. The employee continues to slam the shit out these crates for the next few minutes. I get dressed and go over to whoop some butt, this little house keeping idiot looks at me like nothing's going on. I tell the idiot off and luckily he heeds my warning. 2:30am... In a hotel. What makes you think this is an appropriate time to be slamming things against the walls? 

Every hallway in the hotel smells of smoke. It's nonsmoking, but everything including the carpets are from before it became nonsmoking, so it all still stinks. Why bother replacing carpets?

The room I'm in smells, but not terribly. The bedding has changed but not the drapes or carpet. The A\/C dehumidifies the room so bad that you wake up a few times a night needing a drink of water. This isn't a joke, seriously it's bad. Most A\/C units have at the very least some form of returning humidity, in small spaces like a hotel room you need that. 

Ice machine on my floor doesn't work. But you can buy a bottle of water for $3, or go to the store in the lobby and save $1... How that makes any damned sense is beyond me.

Every working auto sliding door in the place has metal to metal wear marks. They aren't even bothering to maintain the facade here, let alone keep things working. 

A few of the buttons on the elevators don't work. Not one or two on one elevator, multiple. Luckily every elevator has two button panels. So if you can't get to your level, just use the other side. (Makes me feel super safe in the event there is a malfunction)

They have a roller coaster park here, takes up a fair portion of the overall size of the place. It's closed for repairs... Not one ride, the whole place. 

Monorail runs through the side of the building. But they stopped bringing it up here. Not sure who they pissed off but the rail to Circus is defunct. So you'll either need to walk, or pay to get away from this tragedy of a hotel\/casino.

Let's talk about the casino. Low ceilings, you can touch them in most of the lower level if you're 6ft tall. Feels like a dank dungeon compared to most the other places. Dated inside and out. And not that hip trendy dated look. More of a sad dilapidated feel. All the cool shops are here, like the wall boutique that sells bad knock off Japanese-ish style kimono and other super trendy fake silk fashion. Not to mention the ""crystal"" store that sells no crystal anything, just plexiglass chunks with laser etching. Top of the line throughout.

The view from most of the rooms is the ghetto motel next door, a few chain link wrapped half torn down buildings, the parking structure, the flat expanse of roof over the low casino, or if you're lucky you get a high enough room to see the empty half built hotel\/casino that's abandoned across the street.

Save your sanity, save your money, stay at a Best Western, or even the Startosphere is a huge upgrade. Circus Circus is a sad joke. I feel half bad for the people who work here, but there is a big McDonalds next store so they might be able to move up in status if they apply there.",10,9,0

Very kid friendly...but i went with some friends for a drinking weekend. Didn't see many kids after about 9pm so that's nice not to see them when stumbling in drunk from the strip club at 5am.

Growing up as a Southern California Asian, family trips during the summer meant trips to Las Vegas and now after turning 21 I still take trips to Vegas, now with only certain members of my family.

So now that I have established the basis of my credentials for writing this review, please read on!

If you are reading this because you are trying to decide whether or not you would like to stay here on your Vegas trip.  I have a short and simple answer for you: NO!!!!

If you have any sort of decency or standards or if you care about your family at all, DO NOT stay in this hotel.   

This hotel is old, in desperate need of a remodel, has the permanent lingering smell of cigarette and it is in the older part of Vegas.  You cannot just walk out of the hotel and expect to be on the strip.  It is a good few blocks away from the center of the strip.  Not the greatest place to be staying with a family, oh and if you are over 21 and thinking of staying here, same answer applies.  No!  You will hate it.  It is far from the strip where all the clubs are.  Yes, it is cheap but it is not worth it.  The hotel is ghetto, sorry, no other word to describe it.  

Every time I step foot in this hotel I forget how old I am.  Let me explain, the hotel to this day looks exactly the same as when I came here back in 1998.  It feels like a never ending time warp, nothing has changed.  Still smells the same, still the same shops, layout, everything is pretty much the same.

The only redeeming factor and the reason why I still come here to this day, is the carnival games and arcade upstairs.  I loved Circus Circus as a kid because of the carnival games.  My dad would take us to Circus Circus and win us all teddy bears that my mom would later complain about because they would just end up in a plastic bag stuffed in the garage somewhere or donated to goodwill.  

Circus Circus is an awesome place to take your children, just don't spend the night there.  The carnival games are super cheap, with the majority of them being only $1 and they have pretty legit prizes, comparable to the la or oc fair.  

The arcade is pretty fun and it's big.  My grandma used to spend hours here dumping tokens into that one game that has a bunch of tokens that are pushed down by the little bar that moves.

Despite it being stuck in a time warp, ghetto, far from the strip, old and smelly, chances are next time I'm in Vegas I will come back, just for the carnival games.

Oh they have beer pong at the hotel next door, but I really would not recommend it.  The ball is rolling around on the ground and who even knows what years and years of build up is on that carpet.  I am not a germaphobe or anything but even that makes my skin crawl.",2,5,4

Pros: The booking price was reasonable, around $75 & this was for a one-night stay. We then decided to stay an additional night for the price of $40-$45 (this includes any taxes) . Our building\/neighboring rooms was\/were quiet . The room was clean upon arrival. The slot machines are pretty ""cheap"" (Penny & $1 machines) . 

Cons: We stayed at one of the Circus Circus Manor buildings (Section E, which is the last one all the way at the end ! :\/  ) I personally didn't like that the Circus Circus Manor reminded me of a cheap motel. They're across the street from the actual casino\/hotel, towards the back. They're too secluded. The rooms could use some remodeling . Nothing in our room was dirty or broken, necessarily, but the building\/rooms could use some new carpet, furniture, etc. It has this 70s vibe to it . Circus Circus is a little further away from The Strip . In order to get to all the main casinos, you definitely need to drive or take a cab. When we returned to the front desk to extend our stay, there was only 4 people working (2 helping guests check in, & 2 helping guests check out) & unfortunately , it took a while to be helped . 

Maybe we were lucky, but OVERALL, Circus Circus wasn't a disaster . If they could move those Manors closer to the main hotel\/casino  and give the place a face lift, it would look a lot better !",1,0,1

Five days in Vegas and everyday I brought up going to see the infamous Circus Circus. I wanted to see old Vegas. On our last day in Vegas our group indulged me and we took a trip to Circus Circus.

I remember as a child my friends talking about this cool casino in where the kids had a wonderland of arcade games and where circus acts are performing overhead while there parents play black jack. 

We rolled up to Circus Circus and I see all these cheesy old school Vegas lights. I was pumped up!  As I walked in I couldnt believe my eyes. Circus Circus looked like a  toxic waste dump. Sadly Circus Circus looked like an old prostitute who had her best days twenty years ago. The casino is completely outdated, dirty, and just looked like something sad. I caught the circus act which featured a decent performance but the presentation, stage, and lighting looked like it was from 1927. Walking upstairs I was afraid for all the children. I could never imagine letting my kids touch anything in this space.

If you have never been you should at least pass by the casino. This place is historical in its own way so it deserves a visit. This is old Vegas but I would never eat, gamble, or stay in its hotel.

I do want to point out that the man at the front desk was very helpful and courteous when I checked in and that he did offer to upgrade my room for more money if I didn't like ""the manor"". 

I needed a hotel room at the last minute and got it for a total of only $50 a night, including the annoying resort fee. For $50 it was fine for 1 night, but it was depressing. They wanted $112 for Tuesday and Wednesday, I guess because of the conventions in town. At that point j decided to just pay more and go to the Stratosphere. 

Unless you have kids, or can get a room for only $50 total my suggestion is to consider paying more money if you will be staying long. The entire hotel is just old looking and depressing in my opinion.",0,0,0

cut to a week later when i am pulling up to the strip, goodbye big casinos, hello grimy end of the strip where circus circus is located. oops! so i guess it wasnt that close to where we wanted to be afterall. thats okay, right?

enter the hotel, wait in a long line to check in, get handed a map of the hotel and we are told we have to walk across the street, yes ACROSS THE STREET to our room in the ""manor"". what in the hell?

we arrive at the manor and panic sets in. this place is filthy, smells bad, looks bad. i definitely do not want to be sleeping in this place for 3 days. 

i immediately call the front desk to let them know ill pay for at most one night but im switching hotels.  the woman i spoke to was very kind and told me that since i booked through hotels.com they couldnt refund me but she would upgrade us to a tower room.

and god bless her.

our new room was on the 21st floor, in the MAIN hotel. it had a fabulous view, it was newly remodeled, clean, the most comfortable bed ever. we were happy campers and didnt at all mind taking a cab everynight. 

so i strongly suggest booking a room at circus circus if youre on a budget, just make sure you arent in the manor!!!",0,0,0

Wall paper was peeling, shower curtains were beat up, bathroom was not thoroughly cleaned (a lot of dust around), tile was stained and damaged, furniture was old and damaged, and bedding looked like motel bedding. The atmosphere ambiance is ghetto. It feels like a motel. Ridiculous but you have to request a do not disturb sign when checking in. Fridge or microwave is $20 a night. It's like the amenities are disappearing in Vegas. Remember you pay for parking at most casinos now. Oh and the resort fee regardless if you use it or not so use the pools and get your money worth. 

Needs bigger pools or more pools and better restaurant options. The pizza place and the buffet are not worth your money.

Not only was the staff inconsiderate as well as excruciatingly judgmental, but the entire building smells like stale cigarettes and urine. I booked my room at Circus Circus using booking.com, which is a great website, and super easy to use. However, no where on booking.com did it specify that I had to be 21 to check in to the hotel. Apparently, Circus Circus has took it upon themselves to decide that because I'm 19, I am instantly up to no good and I may try to illegally gamble while I stay here. I came to Vegas for my college orientation. I needed a room for one night. The woman at the front desk was kind, and one of her managers upgraded me to a nicer room at first. I was happy to be out of the car and ready to sleep. Of course, my luck had to kick in, and some irritated looking man came up and looked my boyfriend and I up and down like we were on cocaine, and checked my I.D. Then proceeded to tell me I can't check in because I'm not 21. Well, I wasn't aware of that. His gaze then resembled that of a startled sloth, and shook his head at me whilst mumbling unintelligibly. After a moment, he said ""you have to find someone who is 21."" Okay, I'll go do that. I'll go find some random ass person to check in for me. Then after another five minutes of looking at me the same way someone would look upon satan's incarnate, he decided to downgrade me to ""the manor"" which is basically where they put the people they don't want anyone to see. I paid $88 for a room and I got put into one that goes for $26 ON THEIR WEBSITE! Then I had to pay the $22 resort fee. I'm not even in the resort. I got put across the street in a room where almost everything is broken, there are holes in the bed sheets, and They gave me a room with 2 queen beds when I asked for one bed about five times. I also find it quite amusing that the lock on the door hardly works and there are people shouting and banging around in the hallway outside at 11:30 at night. I've stayed at the Tropicana, the Super 8, and New York New York. All of which I checked into when I was 18 with no problems. The Super 8 had better service, nothing was broken, and everything was clean. At New York New York I was upgraded into the second nicest room available. I will never be caught at Circus Circus again. I'd rather sleep in my car in the middle of Alaska with no blankets than stay another night at Circus Circus. Worst hotel ever.",0,0,0

Why do people think that repeating something automatically makes it better?  ""New York New York,"" ""Girls, girls, girls,"" ""ylang ylang,"" ""Circus Circus????""  I think it's all a big ploy by the Department of Redundancy Department, and it's kind of like dessert that repeats.

You can repeat the word ""circus"" a hundred times, but it's not going to make this hotel any better.  The North end of the strip has already seen Stardust and Frontier implosions, and it's only a matter of time until Circus Circus is reduced to a pile of rubble.  Don't worry, though, a few years later a big $3 billion dollar monstrosity with a helicopter pad, 36 12,000-square-foot suites and a revolving Japanese tea garden will be erected in its place.  Circus Circus will go the way of The Sands and disappear into the night.

The only reason I gave Circus Circus 2 stars (or ""star star,"" if you prefer) is because of the great deals to be had there.  I stayed there Wednesday through Saturday of last week, and I only paid $83 per room FOR ALL THREE NIGHTS.  Yep, $25\/night plus tax.  Even Motel 6 would probably charge you more.  Of course, $15 cab rides to the Bellagio cut into my profit margin, but if you don't mind a 45-minute walk or a short bus ride, you can really save some money.

Do yourself a favor and stay in the main tower.  The lowest rate published on most sites refers to the ""manor"" rooms.  The ""Manor"" is a series of connected buildings located on the territory of the hotel.  They look really sketchy.  In fact, it evoked memories of the motel from ""My Name Is Earl"" and the motel from ""No Country For Old Men.""  Ummm, yeah.

We stayed in one of the main towers, where they seemed to have run out of non-smoking rooms.  I was relegated to a smoking room, which, the front desk clerk assured me, ""housekeeping can spray to get rid of the smell.""  When I walked in, my room reeked of cigarette smoke.  A nice gentleman of Vietnamese descent showed up a few minutes later with a bottle of commercial strength Febreze.  After a mere 10 seconds, my room smelled like potpourri of Febreze and cigarette smoke.  Ummm, thanks?

Circus Circus is also home to one of the very few buffets in Vegas where the customer has to get his\/her own drinks.  They don't even serve you coffee in the morning.  Are you serious?

I guess Circus Circus is a great place for kids, because what eight-year-old kid doesn't like clowns, plush toys and anything circus?  Also, what eight-year-old kid doesn't need to know about the dangers of splitting tens or taking a 6-team parlay with 6 road favorites?  Public schools sure as hell won't teach them that, so, once again, it's parents to the rescue.

I also love the adults who line up to win tokens at the Circus Circus arcade.  Congratulations, dumba$$e$.  You've done it!  You've found the only slot machines in Vegas that NEVER pay.  Go crazy!

Even at $25\/night, I am still not convinced Circus Circus is a great deal.  Although, compared to Hooters Hotel and Casino (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/hooters-casino-hotel-las-vegas#hrid:5rFXtgeUzRhIdR68wB-_JQ) . . .",2,6,2

The Stardust, as painstakingly crappy as that dungeon was before being torn down, is probably a step above this.

Upon arrival, we were handed a bunch of vouchers for free rides and games in the fun fair, discounts in the bars, ect. Sadly, some of them were not honoured, so I had to spend 20 minutes queuing for the not very fresh breakfast in the inner Starbucks.

Apart from Starbucks, there are many shops, McDonald's, obviously a casino and lots of fun attractions that you could spends 3 days without leaving the place.

The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, The Hilton Grand, The Mirage- all have had my company at some point in time. With that being said, for the price, Circus Circus knows what they're doing. With a Groupon deal I got a room here with 1 queen bed for $25 a night. Yes- a hotel room, on the Vegas strip, for $25 a night. That is ridiculously cheap. Was the room fantastic? No. It's a little worn down, but the sheets were clean, the staff was friendly, and all of the basic amenities (a television, complimentary toiletries, and clean towels) were a part of the package. They're comparable to a well-kept Holiday Inn or Best Western in their room accommodations. For the price, it's absolutely worth it- and a great option for large families and groups on a budget. 

The Circus Circus is by far one of the most family friendly hotels on the strip. They have something for everyone. From 6-year-olds to 60-year-olds and everyone in between- they attempt to meet your needs. The hotel has a casino, circus shows, an arcade \/ fair games for kids (and kids by heart!), bars, restaurants, a pool, and an amusement park. 

If you have children, I honestly believe Circus Circus is the best place to stay. If your kids and responsible and independent (and old enough to handle being on their own) you can easily let them roam the 'circus' area while you are downstairs in the casino. The 'Circus' area features arcade games, fair games (with live people running the games), and live circus acts. Kids can earn prizes at the games or they can earn tickets that they can cash out for prizes at counters around the area. The casino is right downstairs and easily accessible- so you can check up on your kiddos, or they can find you with ease if they need to.

The casino is average; nothing special, but it will keep you busy for a while. We're not into gambling so we didn't spend a lot of time at the casino and unfortunately I can't give you a good idea of what it's like. Back to the kiddos though- there is a pool here! It can be a bit of a pain to find and isn't really conveniently located within the hotel. But, once found the pool is decent. It's comparable to other Vegas pools and is clean and well-kept. Because this is a kid-targeted hotel, the pool does tend to get really busy. Get there early to get enough lounge-seating if you have a group over 4 people. 

Eating options here, again, are very kid friendly. Most famously is the Circus Buffet which offers up almost anything your heart could desire (and even the pickiest of kids will be able to find something to fit their fancy). There is also a deli, Mexican restaurant, pizzareria, burger joint, ice cream shop, McDonalds, and a few other quick eats. For adults there is a Starbucks and a steakhouse. 

The hotel is located on the side of the strip, but it's walking distance from every other major hotel and attraction in downtown Vegas. You could easily walk to the Mirage volcano, Bellagio fountains, shopping centers, resorts, and entertainment and eating options. Cab fairs get a bit expensive around the strip- but if you opt for Uber it's often under $6 to go from one side of the strip to the other. 

Overall, I only stayed here a couple nights. It's not a place to go if you want to treat yourself- but if you're on a budget, have a big family, or want to delight your kids, Circus Circus is one of the best options out there in Vegas. A solid 4 star rating, I believe, is well-earned from me.",8,3,1

Speaking of seedy, the entire place (inside and out) has a dirty\/seedy vibe and every time I left the hotel room (which was often because of the horrible stench in the room), I felt vaguely unsafe, like I was walking through a rough inner city neighborhood.

The staff were pretty helpful, however most of them seemed really unhappy to be there (I don't blame them at all).

My advice is to pay a little more to stay at a nicer place up the strip (and I strongly advise against bringing your kids here!).",1,0,0

The carpets seem old and dirty.
The players club for gambling is nice. You earn comp dollars and players club points.   The problem is spending the comp dollars.  Most stores in the casino do not accept the players club comp dollars in exchange for goods.  Want a energy drink for when you leave in the morning?  Sorry, hand over cash.

The above is mainly things that have gotten on my nerves.  But here are the real issues:

The hotel and casino is run down.  Look around, and you can see signs of age and disrepair.  The most obvious example of this is the elevators.  EVERY SINGLE ELEVATOR I've ridden on in this hotel has major problems.   For floors 10-15 or the casino tower, there are three elevators.  1 is out of order, although they don't have signs up.  It's just permanently stuck on a floor and never moves.  The other two have a voice telling you to enter when the doors are closing.  To exit while the elevator is moving...etc.   the electronic announcer is out of sync with reality.

The elevators in the parking garage are scary.  Most lights don't work.  You hit a call button for an elevator, but it won't light.  You can't tell if it's working.   The doors seem to have safety features that don't work, as I've seen several people almost get caught in the doors.",2,2,1

As this was for a business trip, I had to find a cheap place to stay. It was either this place or Luxor. Really disappointed I didn't choose the Luxor. 

The restaurants here all sucked. They closed early and were overpriced. Didn't try their in house buffet but I heard quite a few grunts and belly aching from those who did. 

The layout of the place also thoroughly sucks. From the check in desk to my room, it took two escalators and two elevators rides. That and I had to walk from one end of the lobby to the other just to get to my room. If ever a hotel was to be demolished, this one should be it.

The rooms are what you'd expect from a Motel 6 or other seedy looking roadside motel. What I particularly enjoyed about the staff was that they never gave me shampoo. They kept giving me more bars of soap (don't ever use thier soap) and bottles of conditioner. By the end of the week, I had about 10 bars of soap and about 6 bottles of conditioner. Keep in mind this was after I asked them to give me shampoo after the first night. I ultimately had to go to the convenience store in the lobby to buy my own bar soap and shampoo. Price? $12 for stuff that was supposed to be included. That $12 was their ""tip"".

The only upsides to this place are that it's close to the convention center, it's dirt cheap to stay here and the gambling here is also cheap. Other than that, this place sucked.",0,2,0

My fiance and I only stayed here one night because I extended our trip to LV by one day.  We had stayed at the Flamingo and after checking out there made our way to Circus Circus.  The parking lot was a bit crazy, the craziest part being how to get to it from the strip.  We finally parked and made our way to check in, the line wasn't too bad but when we talked to the clerk she told us we'd be staying in the manor motor lodge which is a lot away, (its basically a series of smaller motel buildings).  I wasn't really in the mood to trek all the way over there and have to do that at night too, so she told us it would be 20$ extra to get the Skyrise tower (16th floor) which was actually in the main resort complex.  I agreed to that and we made our way to the room.  The room was clean and adequate, it was a little older but I didn't mind at all.  We had a nice view of the Stratosphere and Downtown, the beds and pillows were VERY comfortable.  After we got settled we headed to the Adventuredome which is nice because you don't have to pay a general admission price you just pay per ride.  They gave us a coupon at checking for BYGOF one ride so my fiance and I went on the Canyon Blaster roller coaster which was really fun and there was no line.  We played some of the chance games as well which were only 2$ a play (very reasonable, coming from someone who lives at the Jersey Shore, and we also got coupons for those games as well).  We then made our way to the buffet which I was very impressed with but will leave a separate review for that.  We played at the main casino with the circus tent above it.  I thought that was very cool and the free trapeze performance they put on was amazing and totally made my night.  That room they have is so cool you have slots, arcade games, mcdonalds, and a show all under one roof.

Perfect for $24 a night.   The hotel actually gets 3 stars there.   NOTE:  They only give you conditioning shampoo - No lotion - I never pack lotion for fear it will end up all over my stuff.  This is VEGAS - ZERO percent humidity so your skin will be a prune in a matter of hours.  They also gave us only 2 towels for a 2-queen beds.  The housekeeping staff was funny and actually caught us in the lobby as they were cleaning and handed us more towels, probably knowing we were going to call them in a few.  

Where it loses stars - the lobby, the restaurants, the Adventure Dome.   The lay out is weird too.   It's hard to get anywhere easily in this hotel.   We did have my 4 year old step-daughter with us as we were driving to Utah for a family trip and this was the half way point.  She did have fun in the Adventuredome - but it's really like going to a bad country fair.  Each ride for her size is $4.00 - and if she needed an adult to ride with her (bumper cars & merry-go-round) then we had to spent another $4.00 for one of us go go with her.   You can buy a wrist band for the day - we only had a few hours.  They are $24 for adults and $17 for kids.   The hallways leading from the lobby to the rooms to the casino is filled with little stores that are full of junk.

The positive part about Circus Circus is that the promenade up stairs has a huge arcade, several carnival games and FREE circus acts!! There is a small seating area offered to view the acts. This property is also home to the Adventure Dome, a smaller theme park with rides and more FREE shows.

Again with little upkeep or renovation. The carpets on property are wet, sticky and discolored. The walls have streaks of liquid (probably soda spills from children).

Unlike the Plaza, I could feel comfortable in the shower at Circus Circus, but that was about all that I liked.

The mattress just about ruined everything for me.  Imagine sleeping on a mattress where the warehouse forgot to put padding over the coils and you felt every coil when you moved in the bed.

Sure, the parking lot and garage aren't that clean, but our room (west tower btw) was certainly clean and better than what you'd get at that price at some crappy motel. Oh, and no lingering smell of smoke as people report in other hotels. Having said that, I did have some issues.

First, we had confusion over which elevators to take because the lady at the front desk didn't write the exact info for us, and the numbering system sucks because you can't determine which tower you need to go to just by looking at the map.

Second, the TV menu was damn hard to figure out because they use their own remote control and TV system instead of the actual TV remote. We had to watch our shows in non-HD, which means that they became stretched on the widescreen TV until we figured out how to access the aspect ratio setting.

Third, the wireless internet is pretty underwhelming for the price, which was $11.99 for a 24-hour period (""resort fee"" takes effect in March). It felt like it wouldn't connect at times even though the signal was strong. In addition, I was checking out other wi-fi options, and they had discounts for paying for 3 days or 1 week or whatnot. Circus Circus didn't. Bleh.

Finally, the cheap stores and kiosks on the second floor don't have opening\/closing hours posted where we could easily view them, so we couldn't tell when they would close on our normal walk out to the parking garage. Annoying when we wanted to hit up places for souvenirs but also wanted to stay out late or watch our beloved 24.

Anyway, decent price and closer to the main area of the Strip than something like the Stratosphere. I'd hope for a different place to stay next time, but looking at reviews of other cheap Vegas hotels, this one isn't half bad.",0,0,0

But to get to the rooms you have to get passed the casino which smells like cigars and at times can be suffocating.. And there is almost no way to bypass it without having to walk all the way around the building (loong walk). So if you're ok with smoking then go for it. If not, there are other (nicer) hotels that are smoke free with access to your rooms (that don't require walking through a casino).

 If you want a nice view you will have to get a West side facing room that is on level 25ish or above (overlooks the ""strip""). 

The swimming pool and hot tub are saltwater for those wondering. Easy to access and very spacious! (Two pools and two huge hot tubs). I guess for an average american this hotel will do if you got the money. But for me, next time ill just find something better.",1,0,0

So many problems with this place, where to start. The rooms are run down, the hotel is run down, it is a good long walk away from most of the strip, the type of people that stay there are obnoxious and so many other issues. Most of the problems I could live with because of the price. The problem I had was the type of people that low price attracts. I was told that it is a nice environment to stay in and it was a fun hotel, which may be true. I was shocked by how many people try to turn a trip to Vegas into a family vacation by staying here. I was appalled by the parents that walked around playing slots while smoking and holding an infant. Parents let their little children just run around the hotel unsupervised while they got plastered at the bar.

We call our travel agent to ask her what kind of place did you book us into and we demand an upgrade. We were told to contact Circus Circus and they tell us that weren't able to get our money cause it counted as one day. Not even an upgraded room was given to us. The Casino was shitty and so expensive not even a Cocktail waitress walks around in this joint. The whole night we had to sleep with a door in front of our room. Cause yes, there was a child with us.

The advertised flat screen was on old television, the hot water was down the first night, no fridge or coffee makers and water cost $3-5. Just go outside the hotel get your water for way cheaper. 
Everything reeks of smoke; the hallways, the elevators, every corner of the casino! I got aa free and unwanted audio session of the couple next to me have a morning quicky at 8:45 a.m. (moans , groans, skin slapping, etc) and had to crank up ESPN loud in order to get rid of the noise. No shuttles, so if you aren't driving , prepare to spend or bring your running shoes.

I will give you our experience is short then explain everything in full. Within the first 10 hours we were switched to 3 different rooms, treated like crap by all the employees and rooms smell either like cat piss or dirty trash!!! Okay here it goes:
So this is everything off the top of my head... mix in extreme attitude from the staff as if they hate their jobs and are being forced to work there
1. We had to walk through the whole casino floor with 9 bags to the check in at 9:45pm
2. Check in line was 45 minutes which we understand is not their fault they were busy but at least be nice and smile 
3. We go to the far tower with 9 bags to our room and our key doesnt work
4. We wait 25 minutes in a hot hallway for security to open our door you then acts like it isnt our room as if we are stupid and went to the wrong door and knocks over and over on the door
5. We have to add our other night online because they couldn't do it at the front desk check in, you can only book a room for that day at the front desks
6. call guest services to see where we go for a new key, she talks to us like we are a stupid child 
7. We walk back down to the main lobby to  get new keys and to have them mark that we are staying in the same room, they said thats fine 
8. We go over to talk to someone about all the problems and she tells us we cant stay in the same room because someone booked it for tomorrow, so she gives us a new room
9. We go get our bags and take them to the next room, same tower but up stairs... room smells funny and looks nothing like the pictures and has an old school tv in it
10. The light in our new bathroom is broken, we say f##k it we havent ate all day so lets go eat first
11. Its after midnight so everything is closed except a un appealing Deli, Krispy Cream and Vince Neils restaurant so we eat there 
12. Back at the room we call to have the light fixed 2 hours later they still haven't come to fix it  so we cancel so we can go to bed
13. We wake up and call to have the light fixed. She hangs up on me after I tell her what's going on
14. We call to speak to a manager, they hang up on us 
15. We call back and demand to speak to a manager, he finally gets on the phone we explain everything he says he is moving our room and dropping the charge for the night
16. I call bell service while my friend goes down and talks to the manager and get new keys, they tell me to call back because they arent going to come up get the bags and bring them down and then go back up (well what the heck  that's what we have been doing since we get there!!!) 
17. Maid service just walks in no knock nothing and then is bitchy because we are still in the room and she is going to have to come back
18. We get the new room number, bell man comes up gets  The bags and takes us in a service elevator to our new room which is better then the last but smells like a dirty trash in a woman's restroom (if you know what I mean... dirty sanitary stuff) and again looks nothing like the pictures online
19. We have to go down stairs because it looks like he charged the upgrade card. He says it is a refund but its in the wrong column of the receipt, they're charge column is actually credits and the credits is actually charges... if this is true why don't they just fix that in the system?
20. We left a item in our room and called to tell them, they said it hadn't been turned in and to try back. In the next 24 hours before we left we called 3 times and each time they said no it hasn't been turned in or reported. So basically we know it was left on the bed and now our childs doll that we know was left in the bed magically got up and walked away within 2 hours from the first time we called!!! 

The employees are so rude and just when you think something has been fixed for you something else goes wrong and they give you an attitude about it and talk down to you as if some how you being in the hotel is a bother. CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING IS NEEDED BY ALL STAFF!!! 

Mind you my husband (who was not with us) works at a casino in San Diego and he was appalled by everything we were telling him, he said their hotel would be ashamed and be doing everything they could to fix everything and everything would have been comp'd (food everything) not just one night. I wasnt asking for all that I would have been happy with an apology, fixing the issue right away, no rudeness or something. I mean they treat you like they could careless if you come back and like you are bothering them by being there. Mind you we were very passive and not angry or rude at all like we should have been, and like the other people who were down at the front desks complaining!!! I don't like leaving bad reviews but this one is much needed!!!",4,0,0

I had used Expedia and upon checking in and already being charged for the room they sprung on yet another charge, there resort fees. Funny how that wasnt mentioned from Expedia. We were told that we would be staying in the Manor Lodge. Not in the actual casino but across the street!? Talk about invonvience. Upon entering this building it was so old, run down and outdated along with a ""musky"" smell. Being up for over 24 hours prior all I wanted to do was take a hot shower as soon as I arrived. Bad idea. The bathroom had a layer of dust all over the place, the shower handle actually had mold growing inside and to top it all off the hot water pipes inside the wall were hitting against the wall and making a very loud rattiling. Exiting the bathroom and calling the front desk to complain I actually even noticed the lamp shade on the table was tilted off and hanging. 
We were moved to the West Tower room with the help of a bellboy which was alot better and what I was used to from my prior visit but my god the smell of smoke is soooo bad! 
The casino is very old and needs a huge make over. Enough with the small shops selling fake jewlert and colognes. The breakfast buffet is not bad but for $16 thats a big breakfast. Eat as much as you can to last till dinner time. 
And be prepared for kid kids and more kids not paying any attention and running everywhere. One kid even runs into me and spills his soad on the floor and says nothing. 
Next time will pay a bit more and stay at a better place than this. Last time for Circus Circus.",3,3,1

I booked a room online about two weeks in advance and placed a request in the comment section that I would like a West Tower room overlooking the former Riviera construction site. When I arrived at 11:00 the lady at the check in desk was SUPER helpful. She offered me the choice of two rooms both with a view of the site. She was able to check us in quickly and was extra polite. 
Our stay was only supposed to be for two nights but we were unexpectedly held over due to the 15 freeway being closed back into Los Angeles due to the Blue Cut fire. I went downstairs the morning we were set to check out and was greeted by another extremely helpful check in clerk. She was able to get us a discounted rate on the same room for one more night in hopes the fire would be more contained the next day and the roads reopened. 
The housekeeping staff was also great. We ran into the young lady responsible for our room in the hall on day one and requested a single extra pillow for between my knees. She noticed that we were a family of four and made sure to bring in enough towels and toiletries for everyone in addition to the extra pillow and two extra blankets ""just in case"". 
Everyone we came across from check in to check out and  everyone in between was amazing. 
The room was worth the money we spent, and maybe a bit more. I was please how clean everything appeared. The sheets smelled lightly of bleach, which to my brain says clean. The carpets were vacuumed every day and I even left a blanket out with a small grease stain my son caused with his French fries and when we came back a new blanket was on his bed.

Although customer service is amazing, it is not worth the headache you will get from the constant smoke smell. My husband & I walked through 15 other casino\/hotels & this was the only one that smelled like deep saturated smoke plus overly used cheap carpet powder mixed in. Upon returning home we had to wash everything because it had that smoke smell. Even the gifts we purchased for friends came back smelling like smoke & we were so embarrassed. 
Ice machine broken. No vent in bathroom. Window was only allowed to be open by an inch. Some weird screw was put on top. 
Outside doors were left open to outsiders by people putting the rugs in between them. We'd remove them & shut the door but we'd come back & it would be done again. 
Did not want to eat at buffet b\/c it looked disgusting & everything was just so musty.

This is really just a pro's v. cons and it depends what you are looking for when coming to Vegas.

Pro's - Affordable.  Rooms (especially newer west tower) were clean and pretty nice, I was impressed.  Discount tickets place in the lobby.  Nice dealers and casino floor had a nice variety of slots.

Con's - Not the best customer service at the front desk, pretty sure the guy that checked us in was on coke.
-No free internet (yes the coupon says so but it's not - $9 a day, this is a ""service fee"" which is obviously bull$hit)
-Not the cleanest place in the world outside of the rooms, one of the restrooms must have had a problem because it smelled like sewage in one part of the casino for a good part of the day....really bad, very overwhelming smell.
-Pretty far from rest of hotels, it's about a 20-25 minute walk to Treasure Island.
-Their Adventurdome was closed with no notice, this really should have been stated in advance since it is their main attraction.

The layout and design of this hotel closely resembles a labyrinth of disaster and confusion. The architect responsible for this needs to be tarred and feathered for his atrocious design. The hotel rooms are divided into three wings, all of which, apparently, have the same room numbers. It's impossible to know where you are going unless you are specifically told which wing you are in. This makes visiting a problem since the workers don't even know where the hell everything is. 

Upon my arrival, I spent over an hour being directed and redirected to every nook and crevice at Circus Circus before finally reaching my destination. I spoke with four different attendants and two security guards, all of whom led me around the hotel with bad directions and no semblance of a clue of their own location. One of the hotel wings also had FOUR out of six malfunctioning elevators, which turned the little lobby area into a makeshift russian roulette of terror straight out of a low budget horror film. One poor sap waiting almost thirty minutes to get on because the remaining two elevators only went down instead of up, and the elevator occupants were particularly asshole-ish that day. 

Hilariously, there was one guy riding around in a mechanized wheelchair with a very drunk and sloppy girl wrapped around him ricocheting between elevator doors. I very much wanted to put my fist into his face. Very much.

I usually take LOTS of things into consideration, but there was absolutely NOTHING good about this place. Such a a disappointment. 

 To their manager CHAD - either he needs more intense training on management, or he needs to find another career he is good at. Having other reps telling me what he said is NOT professional. ANSWER customers calls, don't hide from speaking with them.

Southwest didn't tell us, when we signed up with their vacation package, that our room was in another building from the main hotel and casino.

The elevators are a little confusing at first.  They should have more restaurant options.  They should also bring back the great carousel bar that revolved, and the circus acts.

We reserved a space 2 weeks in advance and paid extra for it to reserve it.
The day before we called to confirm our reservation. A lady named Karen told us that even though we made a reaervation it is FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE. Confused but desperate to ""fight for a spot"" , we left our homes one day early to make sure we we were able to keep our spot.

 When we get there we see that someone beat us to our spot. And since karen  told us it was first come first serve we realized that reservations and deposits dont matter so we found an empty spot to take for the night.
 The next morning we went to the office. They said no-one would say it was first come first serve as that reservations DO matter. After we gave them the name of the person who told that to us they changed their tune but said unfortunately they gave our reservation to someone else. And That it was not possible to override.
We told them to then move the people who took our original spot to move out of oir spot since reservations and down payments  do matter. They said they werent able to.
We spent 4 hours argueing with them, including someone named Sophia and the manager who refused to come down to talk to us and said we should go to the managers office to complain, they wouldn't come down to us.

 After being moved for the third time we decided to leave. They sais that ""for our convenience"" they won't charge us the higher rate, as if they did us a favor.
Very disappointed. Because there aren't meant RV parks on the strip, i will be sure to video record or conversations and ask for names and a confirmation code before hanging up. People in the park told us we should sue.",1,0,2

Old, not updated hotel with kids running around everywhere... check.  Honestly, there weren't as many kids as I'd thought there would be, but I guess compared to the other hotels we visited there were quite a few.

We stayed there because it was the cheapest option ""on"" the strip, and we'd rather use our money for other things... like booze.  I made the reservation through some website, not the hotels directly, for tower rooms.  I was told I'd most likely be able to upgrade to the West Tower (newly renovated) when I checked in; but they were sold out.  We were stuck in the Skyrise Tower.  Aside from the fact that our room smelled like a Playschool dollhouse, it was fine.  No fridge or microwave though - luckily we knew this and brought a cooler to keep the drinks cold (priorities).  But like I said, I knew not to expect much.

The buffet was disgusting, like worse than my college cafeteria.  However, for breakfast, it was awesome because as far as I'm concerned you can't go wrong with a plate full of greasy bacon and tater tots after a night of drinking.

The staff is retarded.  I think they all are retired carnies, who know nothing.

Since we weren't leaving til 11pm on a red-eye, we tried for late check out\/another night... again, sold out.  All rooms were sold out, except for 2 rooms they had in the back manor ""motel.""

Luckily we didn't sleep there - just needed a place to store our luggage for the day and shower before the flight.

This is so far the ONLY hotel on the strip that caters to families.  Circus Circus is also the few remaining hotels from the 1969 era still operating today.  This hotel has many rooms scattered around in different buildings.  Getting around can be quite confusing but should be ok once you get used to it.  Check-In lines are extremely long.  Most of the shops here are low-end.  There are shops here with Asian vendors.  Except for Krispy Kreme the eateries here are low-end as well.  If these aren't for you, there are other hotels with better food ad better stores.  There is always a Subway and a McDonald's nearby that are open 24 hours to cure your hunger blues.  The Adventuredome indoor amusement park sets this hotel apart from the others.  Keep in mind that New York New York has a roller coaster and The Linq is a ferris wheel that gives you breathtaking views of the Strip.  Circus Circus also has an old school photo shop where you can dress up and take personal photos.  The best thing about this hotel is the free Wi-Fi for those staying here as well as free access to fitness rooms and discounts on certain items (the resort fee covers all that).  Selection of TV channels are subpar and need immediate improvement.  As for my stay here it was decent.  It can be a bit loud in the lobby at times.  After all, you're on the Strip.  If you are looking for something good to eat I would eat somewhere else.  The food quality is extremely low budget and not worth the time.  There are other hotels (Downtown or Off Strip) that offer a better experience.  However if you are looking to save some money this is the place for you.",2,1,1

I just moved to LA and Vegas has been on my to-do list so me and my lady were going to be spontaneous and head out this weekend. I figured it's an old hotel, okay I can deal with that so I booked the room through Hotels.com. After reading reviews I noticed I didn't get a  room in the main tower I was booking for some sort of Motel property near the actual Casino called Manor Motor Lodge... I noticed the rooms looked a bit outdated so I called to see if I can change reservation to an actual Tower in the main building. I called and was talked to soooo rudely by this lady that after I got off the  phone I had to just sit and think  for a  second... I was pissed. So I called Hotels.com and cancelled and began to realize that saving 100 dollars is not work having a  1star experience for my first time in Vegas. So I booked at Bally's who has updated rooms and is located in the heart of the strip for just 75 dollars more for the weekend. I saw the reviews and was still willing to give them a try until I called and realized the reviews are very legit... and I was about to find out the hard way.

The room is okay, it seems clean enough, though it's painfully tacky with decorations, like an Italian woman from the 80s styled it from Walmart.

Heard reports that the beds were infested with bed bugs, so we looked on the sheets and under the mattresses. It looked safe for now, but I guess we'll find out in the morning!

Luckily we did not find a dead roach in our room, but there was a little bug in the bath tub when we checked in. As well as left overs from the previous tenants: a shampoo bottle and a hand written note of random stuff. 

The room has ac, safes, a small TV and two closets, but does not have WiFi, a fridge, or microwave. I guess they really want you to eat at their restaurants (we tried, food was greasy and upset my stomach, scene was kind of sparse and sad). Sink and bath clogged instantly upon first use... saw horror stories below of huge hair wads in the drains, was too scared to check, but not surprised. 

Bell desk broke my husband's luggage, and all the bellman said was ""It wasn't me"" and left. We called the front desk, and they said to call security (what??). Whatever. They just broke my husband's birthday present from a friend. No big deal! Not. 

I could go on, but long story short, there's way better places to stay for the same amount of money... not to mention this place just has a seedy, musty feel to it... I can hardly wait to move to another hotel... it was not as horrific as I was fearing, but it's still pretty bad.",8,2,0

Well let's just say it was perfect timing (again with the sarcasm), we were only able to find time to stay over on a Saturday night. What's wrong with that you ask? That's when the prices for each and every single hotel skyrockets. I was in desperate need of a cheap and family friendly hotel and that's when vegas.com and fellow yelpers led me to to Circus Circus.

(Disclaimer: Other hotels might have the same or similar offers, but please note I would not know any better since this was my first time....in Las Vegas that is).   

I got the standard tower queen room and it was quite roomy. The room was clean. Okay I think I want to rant about the cons right now. The hotel is quite confusing and I felt it was like a maze. You have to be careful when it comes to elevators because they to certain floors. Like one set goes to the 20th floor and above (something like that). Check out is the worse thing that can happen. I ended up waiting 30min for an elevator. There were 4 elevators but even living on the 12th floor it was always packed and up to a certain point none of the elevators stopped at our floor. I found another set of elevators but once again the hotel is a maze and it took me a while to get to the front desk. I mean I found no problem with the rooms, but it was just the hotel can get confusing. The staff were great though. There was an information booth by the elevator on the second floor so that really helped with everything. 

As for location wise, Circus Circus is said to be located on the strip, but near the end, so getting around still required a car. There was pretty much nothing to do or any sight seeing to do outside the hotel. Oh and Downtown is pretty close to Circus Circus so that might give you a better idea about location wise. 

One thing to be careful for is the rooms: Tower and Manor. Towers are obviously located in those tall buildings with the extremely complicated elevators. Manors are cheaper for a reason: they are three-story buildings located near the parking. In other words they are not connected to the casinos. Since I didn't stay there I can't really say it's a bad idea to book a room there. 

I would have given this hotel a 2 star but because of my 5 year old brother it deserves at least a 3 stars. Adventuredome! As a part staying at the hotel you get a coupon book with offers ranging from specials in their casinos, dining and let me say it again Adventuredome! We got two free tickets for the premium rides and a coupon good for two games (carnival style games). That kept my brother entertained, so on behalf of my brother I add a star to my review. Adventuredome is not the only place kids can play games. In fact right above one of the casino is another area kids can play. That way parents can dump their kids there and go down one floor to gamble.

Oh something I did to make sure I earned a prize with the coupon for two free game play. I picked one of those games that ensured a winner every round, made sure there weren't people interested in playing the game, sat down with my brother and played the game. That way it doesn't matter who wins. Cheap Asians for the win.   

Another point I wanted to make is the ""Free World Class Circus Acts"" Circus Circus loves to promote and exaggerate over the top is not as great as you think it is. I saw only one show, but let me explain to you what happens. It's a small stage so you can already guess how limited the performers have in terms of props and what they can actually do. I was expecting lions, and tigers and bears, oh my! but instead I got a 5min show that starts every hour with different performers every hour. Well nothing in life is free and I guess if I want to see such performances (performances I would actually consider World class then I'm going to have to empty my wallet a bit). But now think about it this way, if you really want to see every performer and since it's free would you really leave the hotel for a quick 30min to do something else and return again? Of course not, and this is where Circus Circus gets smart. They dump the stage right in the middle of  the carnival games. What does that mean? Even though that 5min performance is free, the 50min til the next show is not. Family friendly  = little kids. Pure genius to attract parents and their kids to a free show and then surround the children with flashing lights, silly sounds and tempting prizes. But despite that I still give props to the performers even for that short 5min for doing things that I can never learn to do.

Bottom line: Good for families with little kids and on a budget, bad for sight seeing.",1,1,0

The midway is great and the free circus acts are fab.  What I really like about this place is they are truly kid friendly.  They actually have a toy store!  Their gift shops are fairly decent and they still have the penny slots and 2 cent slots as well.  Overall it's fun...,1,0,0

I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed...

Review #8:
well, the super-creepy leering clown neon sign out front sets the stage for this joint; I suppose my advice to you before you come here is to gain 40 or so pounds, go clothes shopping at WalMart, and have 2 to 4 rugrats to drag along; if not, Circus Circus has plenty of low-end eateries to pack on the pounds, low-end touristy shops for the wardrobe, and I believe they even rent out loud & hyperactive children if you don't have any of your own; OK, I'll quit being mean now...; the place is surprisingly large; there's a strange separated annex building with more slot machines; a 2nd floor of low-end shops & eateries surrounds a humongous amusement area that I am sure most 4 to 10 year olds would love; best craft brew bet = shockingly, the Circus Spirits store has some decent craft 22 oz. bombers, including Tenaya Creek, at very reasonable prices",2,10,2

If anyone remembers, Treasure Island used to have this AMAZING arcade with midway games next to the Cirque Soleil theater. We used to play the Treasure Island midway games but because they closed, we had to go to Circus Circus. It's so rundown and some of the people that go there are kind of shady. 

I'm hoping they will get a renovation soon since this is probably one of the only big arcades that kids can go to now. 

OH! They also have a good circus show that plays every 20 minutes or so. Clowns, acrobats, almost anything you find at a real circus :)
One good thing about Circus Circus is that they have this indoor amusement park, dunno what it's called but it's pretty cool! You should definitely check that out if you are ever in Vegas with kids.",0,0,0

- trop kitsch

A detailed review about our many stays....

Check in: is usually quite quick but make sure you're checking in at check in time especially on a holiday or a weekend as rooms may not be ready. Staff is usually friendly but I've had a few times where they weren't. Hey, everyone's allowed a bad day right? 

Kids: yes, there are lots of unsupervised children running around acting like children. This is a hotel geared towards families so if running, screaming, playing children bother you then it might be best to consider another place to stay. The adventure dome is a lot of fun for both adults and children. The games and attractions are pretty cheap and your normal run of the mill circus games. 

Rooms: we've stayed in many different types of rooms and you are best off to avoid the manor rooms as they are a walk from the casino and main entrance. There used to be a mono rail type thing that crossed the casino but I don't think it's in operation anymore. We mostly stay in suites now since my players club card either comps the room or makes it very cheap. I do love the suites! They're large, clean, have a wonderful whirlpool tub and are a little more updated then other rooms. 

Food: there are dining options for every taste and price point. The steakhouse is the best by far I've eaten at on the strip. The portions are huge, the food is excellent and the decor is nice. I've used points towards meals here and paid $7.00 for 2 prime rib dinners within appetizer,dessert and cocktails. The Mexican\/Italian resturant is unique in selections and is pretty good for American Mexican\/Italian food. I haven't had anything that I was disappointed in eating and I'm a foodie. 

Casino\/comps\/games: one of the most annoying things I ever experienced here was being carded to the point I felt almost harassed. I was carded twice before I even made it to the bar and then a bartender called security on my very valid California ID acting like it was fake. They asked if I had any other forms of ID which I had to go to my room to get and then acted suspicious of my civilian ID from a military base. Two valid government issued IDs and they still acted if I was under age and trying to pull something on them....I was 25 at the time. Another bartender asked me my year of birth, when I graduated high school and other questions that I felt kind of harassed by also to verify my age. this only happened at one stay and they may have been on a strict ID policy or had an age issue recently happen. Still very annoying to the point I began playing across the street which hurt my points and comp ability. 

It's a regular run of the mill casino, typical games. I do like playing slots on the carasouel and I'm not a big slot player. 

This hotel comps very very well. I play table games 90% of the time, roulette, craps and a little blackjack. I was very pleased with after just 2 days of playing I had enough points to pay for a $95 dinner at the steakhouse. 

Yes, this hotel needs a pick me up and make over but as those of us with kids know....you don't get kids really nice things because they tear them up. I understand the hotel not spending millions of dollars to have children tear up everything. 

I've never had issues with my car but I always vallet, it's worth it to me. I've never had any issues with vallet or the bell hops. The staff is usually very helpful and polite. 

The hotel is located at the end of the strip and is closer to Freemont street then the strip in my opinion. It's a fun place to stay for a decent price. 

It's worth the extra bucks to upgrade to a suite and to vallet\/bell your bags. If the children bother you then avoid the adventure dome and kids eateries. Also, try and avoid the first few weeks and last few weeks of summer as that's when it's most over run by kids. If you're expecting a fancy hotel\/casino like other places on the strip then you will be disappointed. Don't be afraid to let the front desk know if you're not happy with the room as they have always been helpful in correcting or relocating in my experience. Even if you don't stay or play here the steakhouse is must when in Vegas, it's seriously some of the best food and service I've ever had.",2,1,0

First things first, navigating the parking structure was a real pain in the butt...no actually a real pain in the butt.  There must be a road bump every 50 dang feet.  It was insane how many there were.  But the car was a rental so I didn't care much beyond my own rear end.  We then get into the casino and locate what we thought was the upper end sit down restaurant ...we were told that it was changed to a burger bar.  This info was not on their website.  So we decided to go to the Blue Iguana Mexican Grill.  Sounds good right?

This reminded me of Taco John or Taco Bell...if (taco bell and johns they were shittier, more dirty, inefficient and full of loud obnoxious people (which the hotel really can't do much about)  After we ordered our food we went to a few tables trying to find one that was actually clean
  Whelan I found one, the table wobbled.

The food comes out and I know before my first bite either my wife or I will be leaving a shit stain in our underwear.  Time did tell.  She had the mystery burribto and I had the Nacho supreme.  we each ate about half our meal and left.

A few hours later my wife began to throw up and was down for the night (not alcohol related as she was not drink)  I ended up burping all evening and having good a sour stomach and heart burn.

I only called because their app charged my card twice in which he promptly refunded but not without some harassment.  The details are too long to write concerning RON so make your reservations online or go elsewhere.  SO, I was here in Vegas for a wrestling tournament, held across the street at The Riviera, with my 2 sons.  Nothing more. I was tired from working all week and my husband couldn't get Friday off so all I wanted to do was record my sons matches and sleep.  After the crowd became too much, I decided on FRIDAY that I was leaving on SUNDAY at checkout instead of MONDAY at checkout so I called reservations to cancel for Sunday night. Reservation Specialist RHONDA said I would need to contact the Accounting department Mon through Fri 8-5 for a refund.  WHY?  I should have just walked my tired behind to the front desk in the first place but NO, I had to call these bitter, angry folks with hopes that they would help.  So I say to Rhonda  ""I'm giving a 48 hours notice to cancel my last day here and I'm already checked in.  A refund can't be issued to my card for 1 day?"". I saw that the balance hadn't cleared but it was still pending on my bank statement.  So as nice as I was to this lady, she says, ""Ok I see you just don't get it""  CLICK and transfers me to some music (LOL). So a recording answers and transfers me back to her at which point she hangs up in my face after I say, ""Hi Rhonda, ""it"" transferred me back to you I guess"".   (CLICK!)  LOL!!  What in the world?   I'm assuming Rhonda gets irate calls from dissatisfied customers often or she has poor customer service skills.  Either way is unacceptable for Circus Circus Casino Resort who charges NV residents outrageous resort fees.  I walked to the front desk and was immediately issued the refund I requested.  Apparently, it was Rhonda who didn't get it because her job is to listen to customers and she failed.  All she had to do was send me to the front desk.  PERIOD.  I live near Reno and I bust my butt  and do my part to ensure Clark Co is one piece.

We booked CC for a 4 night, 5 day trip having never been to  Las Vegas before. A lot of things confused us about this trip, but some do seem standard across the board so maybe Vegas just isn't for me. These include; no coffee pot in the room so you have to spend OVER 10 dollars at Starbucks EVERY DAY, because they want to rip you off and nickel-and-dime you, as well as not putting a fridge in the room so that when you go out to dinner and get these giant portioned meals, you have to throw it away. Not only is that wasting food which makes me feel terrible, but it makes you spend more money (shocker!). Not to mention the ""resort fee"", but I'll expand on that. I should mention we ""upgraded"" our rooms so we could avoid staying in the manor, which looks like the scene of a serial murderer documentary. 

The resort fee is apparently PER room, not reservation. Had we been notified of this, we would not have stayed. 25 bucks a night is supposed to include the extras like the swimming pool etc but half of the amenities are terrible or don't exist such a coffee pot\/fridge. What are you really paying for? NOTHING. There is a pool but it closes at 6 when the children go to sleep I guess.  What about the adults? This ""resort fee"" may include the walking sidewalks to the pool (broken) and the escalators (also broken) but after getting a recent food injury I can tell you, these small inconveniences add up pretty quickly.  Also the wifi is unsecured, which means anyone can use it even though it's supposed to be just for guests. I assume that's part of this ""resort fee"". The least you can do is put a password on it, and half of the time it doesn't work. 

Furthermore, I am glad I don't have kids because you have to walk them through a GIANT hotel full of smoke. If it's catered to families, how does this add up? Second hand smoke at a young age? I'm just glad I don't have kids and can manage. 

The room itself was mostly clean, but I can definitely see where people have smoked in the room despite it being ""non smoking"". The last night we stayed, I found a lid to a salsa or something under the nightstand. I didn't bring that into the room so it had been there for quite a while. Gross.  They also failed to mention that we had adjoining rooms (my friend and I had separate rooms across the hall from each other instead of next to each other which makes NO sense), and nobody warned us that we would be next to strangers. This doesn't exactly make me feel safe with all of my belongings in there and of course, there's no safe or anywhere to lock things up.

On the second to last day, we went out and came back to hit the pool since we paid so much money for it, and my makeup was missing. I couldn't find my 50 dollar foundation which I had just bought so of course I went into a panic and called down to the desk. They said the housekeeping staff accidentally broke it, which is fine, because accidents happen. However, they didn't leave a note or anything in the room which could have avoided this panic. The woman stated she tried calling the room and I didn't answer. Well, I'm on vacation, not hanging out in this hotel room. So they tell me there will be a note on my account so they can reimburse me, cool. I get down to the desk to check out and nobody has any idea what I'm talking about. So clearly, the management of housekeeping is useless here and didn't do her job. Fortunately, the manager at check out (Cheryl) was extremely helpful at handling the manner. Furthermore, she was interested in hearing what we had to say which definitely made the experience better. 

With that said, I won't be returning here. This place is not worth that kind of money and I honestly feel jipped having spent that much for a ""resort fee"" which does nothing for me at all. I honestly considered demanding money back at check out especially considering my foot injury which made this experience horrible. So if management is reading this, I want my 180 back. Also, I will be emailing this information to corporate to hopefully have these issues addressed before others suffer.",0,0,0

Purpose: In town for a wedding 
Status: Vegas Virgin 

I was sucked in by the price for a room ""on the strip"". I found a deal on a room and could have spent another $20 for a room in a NICE hotel that was ACTUALLY on the strip, so once I knew this, I kicked myself. Hard. 

The decor and condition of the room is on par with tired, dingy $25 rooms on the side of Route 66 in the middle of nowhere, I just WAAY overpaid. The bathtub spout wouldn't stop dripping loudly. The alarm clock was broken - didn't just not work, but some prior guest had smashed it to smitherines. There was actually a list of 6 things wrong with the room, which I called downstairs to tell them about. They just said ok, that they wrote it down, and suggested I order a wake-up call. SMH 

I also didn't appreciate them saying they're on the strip without a disclaimer, ""TECHNICALLY we are on the strip, but you will be so far away from everything else on the strip that you will have to pay through the nose to get back and forth from your destinations and your room throughout your stay"". 

Meanwhile, my friends on the trip were staying at nice hotels on the strip at or near The Venetian, where the wedding was held. They were sending pics of their rooms to FaceBook - gorgeous rooms, drapes with remote controls, etc. Then after I visited my friend in her Venetian room, my Circus Circus room looked like a total &*$# hole. I asked why nobody told me, they said nobody told them, either, that it seems to be the way of Vegas, Vegas Virgins stay in Circus Circus their first trip, hate it, and go to the nice spots every trip after.",1,4,0

If you're coming to Vegas with kids, read on... this should prove useful for you.

I have a kid too, so this place should be a slam dunk considering the rest of Vegas is targeting the scantily clad 20-something-way-over-the-top parties (hey no complaints).  It's not. The place is littered with trash both outside and inside. The lobby toilets were quite the adventure;  and did I detect a faint scent of barnyard in there? The pool area is loaded with seedy, overly tattooed, douche baggy, wannabe gangster types. Not a good kiddie scene. To boot, they didn't seem to have a separate kiddie pool from the main pool, so you know what's going on in that water. 

That was enough for me. 

I didn't even bother to check into a room - just immediately told the management I'd like to cancel and instead booked a room over at NYNY.  It's a shame really. This place has the potential to be ""the"" place to go for families in Vegas. 

If you are brave enough to check in, I strongly suggest you skip the Manor and Skyrise towers in favor of the West Tower, which I'm told is remodelled and much nicer.  And may the force be with you.

For those of you complaining that this place is packed with kids - take hand, smack face.  The name of the place is Circus Circus, for crying out loud!  There is a circus and an amusement park inside of the place, and you're surprised that it's wall-to-wall kids?  While I fully agree than The Strip is no place to bring your children, it's pretty obvious that everyone who's oblivious to that fact is most definitely going to bring their little screaming banshees to the giant indoor amusement park\/circus.  I mean, c'mon people!

That being said, the hotel is, in fact, terrible.  It most definitely needs to be downgraded to a 2 star rating, because I have stayed in nicer motels than this supposed 3 star hotel.  We chose it knowing that it wasn't the nicest hotel on The Strip, and because they were offering a promotion of 2 free Cirque Du Soleil tickets with a 3 night stay, but the experience was certainly not one that I would expect from a 3 star (above average) hotel.

After dealing with airports, flights, luggage, rental cars, and traffic for the past 10 hours, we wearily entered the Circus Circus hotel lobby, wanting nothing more than sleep.  What I saw made me want to cry: a line of at least 100 other people waiting to be checked in stretched across the entire length of the dark and dingy lobby.  Rather than having someone at every desk position, there were only 5 or 6 check-in clerks on duty.  We waited over an hour to be checked into our room.  Once we were finally in our room, we immediately noticed that we had been given 2 double beds rather than the one king bed we had requested when we booked our trip several weeks prior.  We didn't feel like dealing with the hassle of having it changed, nor did we expect that they would even be able to, so we decided to just deal with it and went to bed.

We weren't particularly close to the elevators, but somehow the mechanical whirring and banging of the elevator machinery traveled quite nicely through the walls to our room.  Being a light sleeper, I knew that this would most certainly keep me from sleeping.  Fortunately, using a combination of ear plugs and a white noise maker, I was able to drown the sound out well enough to sleep.  The check-in process and front desk employees discouraged us so much right off the bat that we just didn't feel like bothering with trying to get our room changed.  None of the employees we came across in any of the shops or the Adventuredome were particularly pleasant either.

The one good thing I can say about this hotel is that our room was clean.  After reading some of the other negative reviews on here, I was pretty terrified of what the room would look like (smoke stained walls and sheets, funky odors, etc.), but the room we ended up in was perfectly acceptable in that regard.  The sheets and blankets were clean (although I never ever use hotel comforters just as a general rule, since they don't get washed regularly), the bathroom was spotless, and the walls and carpet were perfectly acceptable.  I think that may have been another reason we decided to stick with the room we got, after seeing some of the horror stories on here.

Overall, I am giving Circus Circus the same rating I believe they deserve on the universal hotel rating scale:  2 sad little stars.  If I ever return to Vegas, I will certainly not be staying here!",4,1,1

After seeing the sad looking Dungeon of Fun at Excalibur, we brought the girls here to have some. 

There were a lot of game choices the girls played on their own as well as ones we played as a family. A lot of the same\/similar games we have seen over time but still as fun and not bad for $1 or $2. Luckily the day we went I also scored six 2-for-1 Midway games coupons through another source. That was a maximum $12 savings for us. 

The employees working the games were friendly and nice so it made approaching them and playing the games even more fun. I think this is a different shift than the weekend employees who have to deal with the mass numbers of people and craziness on the weekends. LOL! Maybe that's why they're nicer and happier?

My husband paid for the stay online and upon checking in we were told the $37 a night plus tax rate was a ""glitch in the system"" and actually owed $453 in addition to the $137 we'd already paid. Because I am OCD and printed the actual receipt from the internet that showed the nightly rate, they dropped it down to $223. Still a huge cost and, in my opinion, not worth it, and just a huge disappointment. The entire place smells of smoke but that's Vegas. However, other hotels\/casinos must filter their air differently because we did not notice it as much when we got to the Luxor (also 100 percent kid friendly and a better value for higher quality). Anyway, our room was fine. It had two queen beds and a television. It was missing a chair and table (it was obvious because there was discoloration where those things used to be), but we just wanted to get the stay over with. The kid areas (Midway and Adventure Dome) happened to be closed the first two days we were there, even after we called to verify their hours before choosing this place, so we ended up not being able to visit them until our third day BUT they were a huge hit for the boys once they were open. The games were things they enjoyed and not too much of a waste of money. Vince Neil's was surprisingly good for breakfast (there's someone that passes out coupons for it, get one!). Starbucks was SO EXPENSIVE compared to anywhere else on the strip. I've been a partner for 9 years and I was surprised how much it cost. They said it was ""resort fees"" (Luxor Starbucks did not cost as much). I love my 'bucks but not for $4 more than the $5 I already pay. In closing, if you use Uber, you have to walk literally a mile through the Casino where they are allowed to pick you up. Really difficult with kids but once you're in the Uber you can escape to other wonders of the Strip that aren't so smoke stinky and meh.

10 years later when I have a different apetite for entertainment, this place just doesn't cut it anymore.

I do feel however that this place is for traveling families that have young ones with them. Leave your kids at the theme park while you go gamble. Ok, not a bad idea. The problem with that is that they made this place more geared to attract young people and not convince their parents (and grand parents, for that matter) to stay here and gamble while leaving their kids (with supervision, of course) to all the fun areas. 

The casino floor is in the SAME EXACT CONDITION that I remember from 10 years ago when I was not of legal age. It's the same red\/orange\/weird carpet they've had since the beginning of time and they've not done much to change it.

The poker room is also at one extreme corner of the casino, and is very small. Not much action going on there. Last I remember there were 3 tables of 3-6 going on and nothing else. The tables weren't even full.

The hotel rooms are very similar to motel 6 (not that it's a bad thing), but for a hotel\/casino in Las Vegas, they are below standard.

I ended up booking my room last minute for a friends Birthday. We stayed in the West Tower, which has access to the Adventure Dome. Our room was basic. Very small T.V. that was about 20 something inches in size, with blurry channels. The carpet in our room was wet for some reason. I called the operator for extra towels. When the towels were brought, I noticed that all 3 towels were stained and dirty. I called again and had them replaced. There was no reception at all through the casino floor which made it hard for me to contact my friends through phone calls or text messages. Overall experience was good, but not at it's finest. For it being a last minute trip, it went smooth.I had fun and so did my guests. I like how they have circus acts towards the middle of the casino on the upper floor. I was only able to catch one clown, who happened to be walking the opposite direction I was walking to. Would I come back? Sure. I'm just not a fan of where it's located. For one, it's somewhat off the strip and two, it reminded me of Down Town Los Angeles - Skid Row. I would encourage anyone to stay or visit this place, but at your own risk!

Oh yea, before I forget. The dealer at the Black Jack table was somewhat giving me a hard time, due to the fact that I had trouble reading and adding the ""Ace"" card to the rest of my hand. I'm used to playing with the Virtual dealer Blackjack tables, which obviously adds and display your total. The guy next to me, who was there before me, was getting annoyed with the fact that the the dealer would delay the game and put me on the spot. The dealers intentions were good but the whole thing with him putting me on the spot in front of others and delaying the game was not necessary. Either way, I tipped the dealer out because he was doing his job and brought me some luck. I'm not going to sit here and cry about this but it was somewhat embarrassing.

I haven't stayed here in ages and from what I recall as a kid, I kept my expectations low. I had found it interesting that the lobby was packed with adults. Not families, but adults. I was guessing a majority of visitors use this Circus Circus just to have a bed. When I entered the room, it smelled like someone sprayed an overwhelming amount of air freshener (I'm guessing for the smoking rooms?). The room actually didn't look that bad. The double full beds were nice and clean, the bathroom seemed spotless, but you could tell that the rug had not been cleaned for years. 
I wanted to visit the arcade area since I haven't visited in years, but this time I was actually excited to pass through the slots area as I am of age. I totally regret that. All the slot locations in this whole casino wreaked of smoke. It felt like the air wasn't being circulated and you were just inhaling smoke. Once I got the the arcade area, it felt empty especially for a Saturday night. There were a lot of carnival games where it seemed like they were begging you to play. I only played the claw machine games where they pretty much jip you because I knew I positioned the claw perfectly, but somehow they just want me to insert $20 before I can actually get a $2 stuffed animal. 
In all, I would say I wouldn't mind staying here just to have a room, but that's pretty much it. They don't really have a food court just to grab a bite, except for Krispy Kreme donuts and Auntie Anne's pretzels. Otherwise, you can step outside and have some Mc Donald's next door.",2,2,1

Another incident was four years ago and it was a nightmare in that hotel. I came with a group of friends for New Years. When we received our hotel key we were directed to the back? I thought we were going into the hotel. Instead we were directed into the shady back area called the manor. All of us were creeped out by the vibe of the place. It was tiny and the interior looked as if it was peeling. The bathroom was puny and the place looked as if we time-traveled to the 70's. So we tried to make the best out of it anyways. The shower was terrible and the  plumbing was loud. 

The walls are paper thin and you can hear everybody from up, down. Once we got in our rooms we finally crashed only to hear some obnoxious and rude a$$ neighbors loudly coming out the room and pounding our door and complaining that we were loud.

I have spent all day gambling on slot machines: dollar, quarters, pennies and $25. and I've lost $1000 or perhaps  a little less than that. However I did win a huge mug with margarita, a t-shirt and now I have two free buffet tickets or points to use tomorrow. I started gambling earlier today and I made  my first mistake by placing my $100 bill into the wrong machine thinking it was a 25 cent machine; however it turned out to be $25 machine!! and I lost a hundred dollar bill in one minute probably less than one minute more like seconds. It was gone. Because I messed up One of the nice managers named Jim was able to help me out and he credited my Circus Circus Players Club card $50. he was hesitant but finally made a decision to help out. That was pretty nice. would have been even nicer if he credited the whole $100 to the card but that's fine. I lost anyways so circus won haha. And if you're reading this Jim thank you anyways for your $50 credit. Aside from all of that I love my room I have a great view of the South strip I can see Trump Tower, encore, Mirage, Palazzo, Caesars and I can see Treasure Island and part of Wynn and other hotels...great view at night. I'm on the top floor 29th floor of the sky rise tower. Very clean room comfortable two queen beds. I will ask for this same room next time.  I've stayed at top strip hotels over the years and NONE with this view.  I was here in LV 3 weeks ago with friends and I stayed at the Flamingo (and I went to see the O circus show at the Bellagio hotel. Great show) but views are limited because close proximity to other hotels w depressing views of dull sides. The pool and its view at Flamingo is wonderful. Circus Circus pool SUCKS.  It's very outdated and dull. But Circus Circus offers a great observ ers view few blocks from the hussle and bustle of ctr strip. In addition The buffet here at Circus Circus is very very good. Everyone seems very friendly here. I like that. I did have to walk xtra distance thru hotel to get to my room which is far in the sky rise tower but worth it. And luckily I brought my tennis shoes. I even dared myself to walk all the way to Excalibur yesterday and back took me 4 hours. Wow. But I'm athletic anyway. My room was very serene quiet with the buzz of distant traffic but very relaxing. Would i come back to circus circus? Sure! P.S. let me add I  was given exceptional room service courtesy of a Hispanic lady named  Connie. Very friendly very happy lady. Also at Big Chili Roberto and a night shift guy on May 20 were exceptional and the giant mug of margarita was\/is superb!! LUV THEIR MARGARITAS. Employees seem happy and lighthearted here compared to other strip hotels. Says a lot for Circus Circus. I will say one last observation regarding the slot machines. I noticed that in the beginning they would play payout and then immediately start taking the money back which was disappointing very disappointing. There was no way I could win because machine would dole it out like I said but take it back quickly. This is how I ended up losing so much money. Money is just money. I will not love it nor will I worship it. yeah I am disappointed I lost $1000  here at Circus Circus today on slot machines but next time I come perhaps I'll be playing the blackjack tables.

They told me there were no rooms to move us to, even though there were still rooms available on the website. They said they would send housekeeping up to clean the room.

How many times do you have to tell the damn room service maids to not come in your room when a do not disturb sign is on the door, and you're naked in your room?   Answer:  Apparently more than twice.

I had placed both do not disturb signs on my door and the maid opened the door......not once but three times.  Once to make the signs on the door handle fall to the floor and her to open the door to see me naked. Twice to open the door and see me naked again.  And the third time to knock first, then open the door to see me naked again.  Her excuse was the signs weren't on the door, but on the floor.  Bullshit.

Then again the next day, with both signs on the door, the maid opens the door, no knock, to find my fiancé laying naked on the bed, awakened by the door opening.

Both times they were asked if they noticed the do not disturb sign on the door.  Both times we got bullshit excuses.  What do these women want?  Why is it so important to see us naked?  And lastly, why does the hotel condone such activity? 

My thought on this is to never come back.  Period.",8,10,3

Most of the popular hotels featured motion simulator rides, IMAX theaters, really stocked arcades, free ""tamer"" shows, and the like.

After ""The Hangover"" came out, Vegas ran with their ""What Happens in Vegas stays in Vegas"" campaign, and the family phase was phased out. No more simulator rides, arcades fell to neglect. No more G\/PG rates free shows and attractions. So these days, to take children and teens to Vegas is a true challenge.
Enter Circus Circus, the only hotel that the younger set has a decent chance at surviving during their Vegas stint. This is moreso due to a very nice amusement park and the ongoing circus acts.

But not all is good in Circus Circus Land. Here's the break down:

GOOD: The amusement park is a nice bargain. There's enough there to entertain toddlers to teens. I really enjoyed the two roller-coasters, and I'm thankful that Circus Circus is the only hotel on the Strip that still has motion simulator rides. Also, the circus act continue to be a nice add-on. It features great stunts of balance and high-flying acrobatics, and it's a consistent venue that's close to McDonalds.

BAD: Kids like buffets, and so do families with kids. But the Circus Circus's buffet is subpar. Yes, it will do the job of getting food into empty bellies, but with so many better buffets on the Strip, and a $17 dinner cost, I'm expecting much more, and better quality. Kudos to the pasta bar; easily the best part of the buffet.
The hotel is also way down at the end of things. It's bordered by a vacant lot that has been vacant for years, and the lot is a few blocks long. At night, it's empty, very dark, and eerie walking south from Circus Circus to the main element of the Strip. There are also some unsavory characters hanging out in the area.

UGLY: Smoke ventilation is horrible. As a non-smoker, I could feel the nicotine doing a number on my lungs. Circus Circus is an older hotel, and they've really neglected their ventilation system. It's so bad that you can cut through the smoke-odor with a knife. This is bad news for children and their young, developing lungs.

All and all, I'm recommending Circus Circus for families with children only because there's no longer any other family-friendly hotels on the Strip (including Excalibur). And while the amusement park and the circus are great touches, families need to be wary of the location, the poor buffet and especially the poor ventilation.",2,0,0

There are some great talents there. In order to enjoy that, you'll have to endure some horrific smells and crowds (especially people with children and strollers). I cannot put my finger on the smell, but I think it's just old\/stale and smokey. Although, I think it's smoke-free and the smell is residual. To be fair, it looks like they have newer\/nicer buildings and they have that Adventuredome with rides. We didn't experience any of that. If I had more time I would have checked out the Adventuredome, but we had a lot of things we wanted to see first.

While I wouldn't recommend the hotel to stay (though there are newer\/remodeled non-smoking hotel rooms that are now available), you can't deny the children their fun and games while they're in Vegas.

Games cost from 25 cents to $3 (that's cheaper than our local OC Fair, folks, and available 365).  As it goes, the higher the cost the larger the prize.  Most of their prizes are current, including Hello Kitty and Minions from Despicable Me.  Most booths allow you to trade in your smaller prizes for the larger ones, if won from the same booth.  Midway also has a fun and FREE acrobatics show performed every couple hours.  It seems always crowded, even later at night, but the energy is vibrant and the kids (and adults) always love it.

There's also a small carousel themed stand\/booth that sells fairly priced snacks and drinks.  The best part is that the entire thing slowly rotates and has ample seating so you can take a load off from all the games.",0,0,0

Sometimes the cleaning ladies don't lock the room properly after cleaning and security has to check afterwards.  l'm sure they (the hotel) will fix the problem as they are currently going through renovations."" 

After my trip, I found at least seven reviews (the earliest dating back to 2011) about stolen items at Circus Circus, some even with follow up messages from the hotel management.  Since the hotel management has been aware of the problem for a long time, why haven't they done anything about it?   Clearly, burglars are aware of this door malfunction and continue to take advantage of it.  

I don't recommend staying at Circus Circus at all - disappointed in management's lack of response to this serious issue.",13,0,0

Seriously, expect too-blue bluejeans and NASCAR jackets and non-ironic airbrushed wolves on t-shirts.  The interior is dirty, smoky, and a creepy retro throwback to the ""golden age"" of Vegas.  

That said, they have tables with $1-$3 minimums, which is TOTALLY AWESOME.  The drinks are cheap (though not free), and the staff is really, really friendly.  And while I can see the point of the criticism of Circus Circus, shouldn't there be at least ONE place on the strip where a blue collar truck driver\/farmer-type from Mid-America can go with his family and not spend too much money?

Plenty of ghouls always scaring everyone. Be warned you are not safe from them creeping on you if you are in line for a ride. Safe place that you can drop off your kids for a few hours. There's plenty of security and a private waiting area that your kids can wait until they are picked up if it's after curfew hours. Also the Fast Pass was well worth it. Not every ride had a FP lane but we passed up plenty of people and were able to do more rides in the end. If I don't get the fast pass I wouldn't go.,0,0,0

Never again. First of all, our room was generally sub-par. Stains on the walls and ceiling. Dust is abundant everywhere. The lack of convenient power outlets was also staggering. The kicker was the bathroom. Mold\/mildew on the walls and fixtures and the wallpaper was peeling off in several locations. The shower\/tub handle was also filled with mold\/mildew. 

The most interesting thing that happened was during our second night\/morning. Someone knocked on our door and proceeded to enter our room at 6:30 AM, which woke us up. We didn't see who it was, but they turned on our hall light, apparently saw us, and then left, leaving the light on. I spoke with facilities, housekeeping, guest services, and a front desk supervisor and all I got was ""I don't know what to tell you,"" ""use the latch on your door,"" ""our maids don't start service until 8am,"" and a free breakfast the next morning when I finally got connected to a supervisor after a half dozen phone calls.

Also note it took over 30 minutes to check in, as the line was longer than something you're likely to see at a security checkpoint at the airport.

Its quite hard to pinpoint exactly what it is but the lobby, the casino, the shopping area all just felt real shabby and dirty. The bathroom was really disgusting with mole-dew? (or at least it looked liked it) along the floor line. We strongly considered checking out and go looking for another hotel, but instead we went out to the streets and spend the night at the strip.
I wouldnt recommend this hotel for anyone. OK, its cheaper than average on the strip, but come on! Spend a few more dollars and youll get a way better experience than living on circus circus. Im sorry to say it but we have nothing good whatsoever to say about circus circus.

First incident: We booked rooms in the sky tower, the bell hop tells us to park then check in before we unload luggage then after that gave us directions to parking for the sky tower. There is no bell hop assistance at the sky tower parking! I give them the 1 star because they did send assistance over to the parking structure. 

Second incident: woke up the next morning to make coffee and the coffee maker is just squirting hot water everywhere and melted the disposable coffee tray. Called the front desk and it takes almost an hour to get a replacement coffee pot. Caffeine addiction on hold...

Third incident: my friend takes a shower and the bathtub clogs. The water started going out slowly then stopped. Called the front desk once again and he mentions sending someone to fix it.... I had to suggest switching rooms, we didn't have time to wait for them to repair it. Upon MY request he switch our rooms. 

Fourth incident: Get to the new room... and THERE'S NO REMOTE for the TV. I call the front desk once again... they'll send someone with the remote. Over an hour has passed so I called again to check the status because we were about to leave. Same guy answers and I guess is putting the info in, I told him I called over an hour ago about it and he says oh you called already? Uhh yes! I asked if we could just get the remote from our previous room and again he says someone is bringing one right away this time. 

Fifth incident: after we move to the new room I guess they didn't switch the free WiFi access we were getting in our previous room. So I'm writing this review using my own data! I didn't even call the front desk about it. 

I asked is there anything he could do for us since we've encountered all these problems in less than 24 hours of being here. He said he could switch our rooms... I asked to a suite? He said no just on a different floor... I told him it makes no sense to move yet again unless it's to an upgraded room.

I hate to have to be negative but I feel like I should warn people.  Here is why.

You will save money initially, but it costs $25 each way to get to the top of the strip at Mandalay Bay.  You figure 2 round trips a day and that's an extra $100\/ per day to save a buck and stay at the most disgusting hotel in Vegas.  

The air quality is so horrendous everyday our lungs were wheezing until we could get out into fresh air.

Nothing is vacuumed and did I mention it smells like farts and cigarettes everywhere.

There is nothing around this hotel\/ casino except empty abandoned construction sites and homeless drug addict transients.

None of us felt safe walking to our rooms alone.

This place should be condemned it is a health code violation.

I could barely see out my window it was sooooo dirty!

There was a pubic hair on the glass table in our room.

I had to pay 50 cents every time I wanted to lock the safe in my room.

The buffet is gross and expensive.  If you want to eat anything that's descent off you go in a cab for $25 bucks to the top of the strip.

Ending this review on a positive note all the staff were kind of nice, but when I told them that my impression of the hotel was that it was really dumpy and smelled like ""parmesan cheese cigarette fart pie"" they just stared at me and told me they were repainting it soon!???

Plus, it'll wear them out and they'll go to bed early.

I haven't stayed here in about 8 years. It really looks beat. They need a lot of upgrading. First thing you'll notice when you are checking in is the receptionists are, to put it kindly, not the hip well dressed type that you would find at the more upscale hotels. You'll also notice the girth of most of the corn fed guests.

I got a non-smoking room, but the stench of cigarette smoke still permeated throughout the entire hotel. So not used to that. What can you do?

The pool, trust me. Pass on that. Even if you have kids.

Didn't try any of the dining offerings. Judging from the reviews on here, I wasn't missing much.

1. The rooms are dirty- and I mean nasty dirty. We checked in and then asked to change rooms 3 times due to heavy smoke smell, mildew and mold growing on the walls, and then large gobs of hair on the bathroom floor.  Not to mention cigarette holes and other random stains on the blankets and sheets. And this was in the more expensive ""West Tower"" rooms. I can only imagine what the low end rooms are like.

2. They will loose your laundry- I guess I should have known better then to send some stuff out given the establishment in general but we needed to have my sons ring bearer tux pressed and I didn't have an alternative. Well, they lost one of my shirts and offered no compensation or even an apology.

3. You will NOT get housekeeping service- Overflowing trash and out of towels by day 3,  it wasn't until I went downstairs and raised holy hell after the second night did they send someone to clean our room. I was told this was due to under staffing and the bad economy but seriously.....

4. No room service- Oh, excuse me...they do have it from 6am to noon. What good does that do me when I have exhausted children who need dinner and I can't bear the thought of taking them out?!?!?

5. The arcade is not maintained- Half of the games and rides do not work and when we went to tell them the DDR machine stole $2 they made us wait 30 min to have a manager sent over to give us our money back. Then they refused to put an out of order sign on the machine....anyone smell a scam? With all of the closures the kids were only able to go on a handful of rides. NOT worth the $18.95 price of admission.

6. They will charge you for a phone you don't use- Hidden $1 a night charge to just have the phone in the room. Granted it's only a $1, but REALLY??? A total insult after everything else we had gone through. 

7. You will have nowhere to park your car- The valet and self park filled up every evening leaving us with no where to park the car after returning from the day.

The building itself looked like it hadnt been updated since the '60s. Our room was in Skyrise Tower and looked like a low-end motel. Looked clean from a distance but on closer inspection, we found crumbs and sesame seeds on the floor and a quarter inch of dust on top of the entertainment center. One of the issues I had was with the AC unit. Although it keeps the room cool, the fan doesn't stay on continuously and kicks on, rather loudly, in the middle of the night. My boyfriend is a light sleeper and didn't have a single night of decent sleep while we stayed here. The ventilation in the rooms is pretty bad too. I have asthma and had difficulty breathing the whole time we were in the building.

The only interaction we had with hotel employees, besides at restaurants, was the day we checked in. Joseph helped us out and was very pleasant and knowledgeable. We rented a car for one day from Avis, which is located in the hotel lobby. It was convenient to have a car rental agency right in the hotel and the woman who helped us was speedy and polite.

We don't have kids, but Circus Circus seems like a great place to bring them. We walked through the Adventuredome, which has rides and games, and the Midway, located above the casino, has carnival-style games and circus acts, like acrobats.

Although Circus Circus isn't nice by any means, we paid for one week what we would have paid for one night in a nicer place on the strip, so I'd definitely stay here again (I'm not super picky about where I stay as long as it's relatively clean and safe, so if you're one of those who refuses to stay anywhere but a 4 or 5 star hotel, this is not the place for you!). People complain about it's location on strip (it's way up north, just before Hilton and Stratosphere), but we had no issues and took the Deuce everywhere, as there is a stop just outside Circus Circus.",2,0,0

I only go here when I have to, which I did last week because of my presence of Frightdome this month.  Otherwise, I would never come here, although I still do think their steakhouse is pretty good and cheap.

I stayed here many years ago, and remember this place fondly as a kid in the 80's when it was actually a happening place.  It's sad how MGM Resorts let it go to pieces, and I'm not sure why they haven't tried to class it up a little, but I guess they want this property to stay cheap and attract the undesirables, like gangbangers, and mix them up with families going to Adventuredome.  I'm not sure why they don't clean it up and make it more family friendly and safe, maybe that is what security is for.

 Housekeeping was phenomenal... extra soft pillows and tons of white fresh towels.  Our room, hotel hallway, elevators  smelled  just like strawberries  (car scent).

The staff at the Circus Circus  Buffet were polite  and sweet.  The Pizzeria restaurant was my favorite.....the pizza was ""smack yo momma"" good! I especially enjoyed the cashier named TAMMIE ....she was hilarious and kind.

One night... we ordered Room Service ""bucket of chicken with mashed potatoes"" ooooooo weeeeeee... that was delicious fried chicken.... I was surprised beyond belief. 

The Adventure Park , and Arcade were fun. I enjoyed the clay face sculptures made by artists for  $19.99.... BRILLANT IDEA!

The Water park was refreshing and relaxing.... and so was the bucket  of ice cold STELLAS! The kids and I also devoured the freshly made potatoe French fries, and Nachos.... yumyum status.

The reason I only gave this hotel 3 stars is because of the insane lack of ventilation in the hallway next to the casino room elevators(next to buffet). The smell is SO strong it's hard to miss.

The lady that helped us was great, waived our early check in fee of $16.50 because my boyfriend is military, she even upgraded our room from skyrise tower to west tower. GREAT! That was very kind of her. We had a very big room! The one complaint was that the bed was not very comfy and we only had 3 pillows. Another thing was that the TV was very small for as big as the room was (which isn't a big deal). The first morning we woke up and decided to go to the breakfast buffet, it was okay. Our eggs and bacon were cold. But that was our only complaint. The pizza place is very yummy! And you can never go wrong with krispy kreme!

Booked a last minute trip to Vegas for the weekend and found that Circus Circus was going to be the cheapest (about $200 total for 2 nights). When we get there, we have to do the infamous hike with all our luggage from the Uber drop off on the Strip side of the hotel, through the Casino to the Lobby. When we were checking in, customer service could have been a little better but we were able to get checked in fairly quickly. Then we were informed that our room would be across the street and down the block. 

Now our new journey to the ""Manor"" buildings began. It was really across the street and down the block (walking away from the Strip). The lit up sign wasn't fully lit, most of the letters were dark outside of the building too. We get to the Manor area and I felt really uncomfortable with the building and the area. First of all, the hallways were dark and smelt musty. There were people opening the doors and yelling at people that were in the parking lot. The elevator was outdated, there were towels laying in the hallways to our room, janitor closets open - this place was just a hot mess! When we get to the room, the room furniture was outdated (not that big of a deal and at this point, the least of our worries. We were staying at Circus Circus and not expecting the room to look good) and the lights were flickering! Overall, we didn't feel safe as 2 girls staying here.

We were able to check out immediately and were offered an ""upgraded"" room that was still not in the main building. We explained that we wanted to forfeit our reservation because we didn't feel safe staying here. Not once were we asked why we didn't feel safe which is kind of alarming. But at least we made it out alive!",16,8,5

 i decided to drive, last-minute, to Vegas on saturday night on Memorial Day weekend....so as you might expect, there wern't a great deal of rooms available.  so we decided to stay at Circus Circus. Jesus Christ. 

1. when we got there they had given away our room....so they ""upgraded"" us for free.....when we got to our room and discovered it was exactly what you'd expect from a motel 6 (basic meat and potatoes room)  we shuttered to think that it was an ""upgrade""....WHAT KIND OF GHETTO-ASS ROOM WERE YOU PLANNING ON PUTTING ME IN?!?!

2. The Pool....70% Urine, 20% Water, 10% miscellaneous!!!  i'm serious, it had a green tint and was full of children, who i witnessed drink 11 juice boxes, a piece, and NEVER take a bathroom break; do the math.  when i go to Vegas, one of my FAVORITE things to do is hang at the pool all day....not here, no way, i wasn't dipping my fucking toe in that water!

3. CLOWNS!!!! THE PLACE IS FUCKING CIRCUS THEMED!!! COME ON!!!

4. The worst part about staying somewhere EVERYONE can afford isn't the quality...it's the fact that EVERYONE can afford it, SO THEY'LL BE THERE!  Just to go from one end of the casino to the other i'd have to wade through LITTER ALLY 30 minutes of white trash, and, 200 year-old Asian ladies who are always confused, etc.  (if that wasn't PC, forgive me, but i just got back).  This place is OVERCROWDED with people that don't wear deodorant, sleeves or shoes!!!

5. The floor is sticky, so are the walls...DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING

6. It'd be fine if it was geared for low-income grownups, but its not....its geared for FAMILIES!  THE PLACE IS A FUCKING CHUCK-E-CHEESE!!!! So the gift shops aren't full of cool shit like at most casinos (like crystal statues, shot glasses, etc)  its full of stuffed animals and toys....the kind of shit you see at swap meet!


7. our maid keyed into the room without asking, and WITHOUT A WORD began searching the room for her cell phone.  now i want you to imagine that.  you are standing there talking to your friend, in your hotel room, in the middle of the day.  SUDDENLY the lock clicks, the door opens, and a small mexican lady just starts combing your belongings without even looking at you.  you try and say ""excuse me, can i help you?"" and her reply, while lifting up your luggage and looking under it is ""cell phone""  .....seriously?

The not-that-thrilling destinations of The Stratosphere and The Sahara are within what might be a 10-minute walk at a normal gait, but turns into a 20-minute journey, slogging along behind the cattle-like herds wandering between the creepy hotels and construction sites that fill this decidedly un-glamorous little portion of LV. Words cannot express how disappointed I was to spend the time and money to go to Las Vegas, only to feel stranded in this hellish little ghetto. Any savings on the room were spent on cab fare getting the hell out of there. I love Fremont Street for retro Vegas, and I appreciate the glam of the new high-end mega-casinos - The Stratosphere, Sahara, and Riviera are in-and-of-themselves, not bad, but their location will mean their eventual demise.

Prior to arriving, previous reviews on this and other websites had me feeling very nervous as they mentioned bedbugs, robberies and a host of other concerns. 

While I don't doubt the legitimacy of those claims, some of which have photographic evidence, this was not reflective of my stay. Upon arriving we (I traveled with a friend) were given the option to upgrade as we had unknowingly booked rooms in the manor which is a motel-like structure adjacent to the rest of the hotel. We chose to do this which added an extra $5+ dollars per night to our ""resort fee"" which totaled about $180+ per guest, per room as my friend and I got separate rooms. I'd expected to pay about $100 so these added fees didn't leave me feeling too great at the very start of my trip especially since many amenities, like the pool, close early or don't exist (ex: fridge or safe.)

Added to this was the fact that we were told our room keys had to stay separated from our wallets and phones as this could cause them to deactivate which is not something I have ever heard and made keeping our belongings together a bit more of a hassle than it otherwise would have been. 

Things, unfortunately, continued to decline from there as we had to walk quite a long ways to get from the lobby to the elevators which normally wouldn't be an issue until you take into account that smoking indoors is still a thing in Vegas so you are walking through clouds of secondhand smoke for what feels like an age. Part of the reason it took so long  was due to a broken escalator which remained so for the vast majority of our stay (there may have been more convenient ways to get to our rooms but if there was we were never informed.) Once we got into our rooms the first thing we did was check each mattress for bedbugs, thankfully of which there were none, though one of the mattresses in my room had dirty bedding and an even dirtier bed-skirt. 

In order to alleviate this problem I called housekeeping who came upstairs within 10 minutes or so and fixed the issue, going so-far as to have me inspect it when she'd finished to ensure there was no other concern. Housekeeping was VERY thorough during our stay, perhaps a bit too much, as they continually replaced all towels despite a notice asking guests to hang up towels to re-use as a way to conserve water which I always did. 

My only major problem during my stay was the fact that, at no point, was I informed that my room adjoined the room next to me (my friend was across the hall.) When checking in I did notice what I thought was a closet door which, if it followed the same pattern as the deadbolt of the room door, was unlocked but I didn't bother with it as there was no handle on my side. Knowing this was an older hotel I figured it was some sort of defect and left it alone until mid-week when I was awoken by very loud commotion that sounded as though it was coming from within my bedroom. 

It was at this point that I realized my room was adjoining and I immediately got up to make sure the door was locked. Given the recent tragedy in Las Vegas I'd already been apprehensive about going through with my trip at all and this definitely didn't make me feel better, particularly when I paid extra to stay in a nicer part of the hotel. This also meant my belongings were unprotected for days. Upon checking out I brought this  up to a manager, Cheryl, was very apologetic and encouraged me to write to guest relations as my earlier email went unanswered.  As of my writing this (10\/23) I have not received a response.

One thing I do want to mention and give credit for is the increased security present at nearly every casino we visited during our stay, with Circus Circus being no exception. 

At any given point it seemed we were never more than 20 feet from an armed police officer which went a long way in reassuring any further fears I had especially after the incident in my room. Overall I'd say my stay was pleasant enough especially as this was my first time to Las Vegas and this hotel is cheaper than others. Getting around was easy once we figured out how to use public transit and it was significantly cheaper than other hotels I looked into though I would have preferred less of a labyrinth with a better pool.

Final word of warning though, be prepared to spend more than you think given that (seemingly) every hotel in Vegas has resort fees and lacks basic accommodations other hotels have like free breakfast, coffee pots, safes, fridges and microwaves. If you are ill prepared Las Vegas will almost certainly empty your wallet if you're not mindful and\/or expect freebies of any kind.",4,0,0

I chose Circus Circus this time around and as with the previous times, it was a positive experience overall.  The line moved somewhat quickly, once I got to the customer service rep. I noticed I forgot my license with the rental car paperwork, so they said ""just go back and get it and you don't have to stand in line"", which was a nice touch (was somewhat jet lagged so I wasn't all there upon arriving!).  

Once I returned with the license they upgraded me from the manor motor lodge to Skyrise Tower, which they obviously made some major renovations to.  The room itself is very nice, and seemed more modern than Bally's, Planet Hollywood, and other places I've stayed.  A key thing which may tilt the needle toward this place over others is the Wi-Fi speed.  I was able to easily stream Netflix\/Amazon Prime, which is a perk that can't be overstated, as some hotel Wi-Fi is so slow it is functionally useless.  

Parking is a breeze, particularly if you're at the motor lodge (where I've stayed previously at one point), and Skyrise.  At other hotels it is a slog to get from your car to the room; not so with Circus Circus.  

If you do not have a rental car, and want to experience the strip, it might not be the best choice, as its a bit of a walk south.  There is an inexpensive bus that goes back and forth up the strip that is affordable, but if my intent was to enjoy the Strip I'd probably recommend something affordable further south, such as Bally's, Flamingo, Planet Hollywood, etc.",1,0,1

yes it's old. yes it smells like smoke.. but what casino doesnt smell like smoke. The new ones, just cuz it's new and probably have better air filters. and yes it's a clustered and yes the color schemes are bright and not so attractive.

but if you're a kid, circus circus is the best, you get the midway-arcade to go play while your parents are downstairs playing their ""midway"" 
even if you're a young adult now, it's nice to go back to circus circus for the midway games..it's way better than excalibur. Sometimes it's nice for a change.

hotel rooms.. i havent been here since i was a young teen. but from what i remember the manors are crappy. the rooms on the tower is quite old, but i heard they remodeled it. But ever since they built the West Tower, we stayed there all the time when we do book circus. It's newer and cleaner and is not smokey. 

i do recommend this place for families cuz both children and adults can have fun. and the rooms are cheap and it's really not that bad. I find it sad to see adults playing at the casinos of bellgio, venetian, paris, etc and u see kids just standing off to the side or even at the lobby. they cant do anything. 

i do think circus circus deserve 4 stars.. not because it's classy and brand new, or trendy.. but because for entertainment. everyone can have fun there. 

i guess part of me whenever i see circus circus it brings back good memories of the times when i was a little girl and my parents would book a room for thefamily and us kids get to watch free shows, and play the arcade and midway games, while my mom would help us hold our jackets and stuffed animals.

They actually weren't sure at first and said they called to confirm with someone that I couldn't, but couldn't explain why. 

I'm pretty sure they were just blowing me off and the icing on the cake was when the guy said ""don't let it ruin your night"" in a way that i felt was condescending. Ruin my night? Buddy, I'm at Circus Circus; let's be realistic about expectations. I don't expect clean bathrooms, I don't expect well kept facilities, in fact, I don't expect anything other than to be treated with the relatively little respect entitled to someone that drops in on often enough occasions to even accumulate comps. Clearly my request for tickets to a haunted house in exchange for the comps I've earned was too bourgeois, so I paid cash for them that I might have gambled with afterwards and went home when I was done.

Fright Dome itself was fun though; I don't blame them and felt like it was worth the price of admission (get the extra line pass; it's worth it!). If I'd have gotten my tickets or at least a reasonable explanation instead of a blowoff, Circus Circus would have earned my loyalty. My two cents; go to Fright Dome and gamble someplace else.",10,4,5

This is where my coworkers and I are forced to stay because it's cheap and convenient.  That said, it's actually not that bad.  You're in Vegas, most of your time is spent out of the room and by the time you actually go to bed you are likely to just pass out anyway.  I wouldn't pick it if I were staying in Vegas on my own accord, but it's not that bad if you are forced to stay here like I am.   

The worst thing about Circus Circus is the damn Crispy Cream.  There is no resisting a doughnut when you're sleep deprived, haven't had dinner, and intoxicated.  You have really hit rock bottom when you are eating a Crispy Cream doughnut alone in your room at 3am inside Circus Circus.  

Contrary to what it may seem, I actually have a lot of fun here.  It's next to Slots-A-Fun, which I just love to work into sentences when I'm drunk in Vegas.  You know, everything becomes slots a fun: ""I'm having slots a fun playing Blackjack"" or ""Come on, doing these shots will be slots a fun.""  Although, I don't think gambling at Slots-A-Fun is actually slots a fun. I also thought about getting a fake tattoo (located inside Circus Circus) that said: I had slots a fun in Vegas.  I even came close to talking my boss into getting a fake tattoo of her husband's name after she shared how much it would freak him out.  He despises tattoos and I thought it would be hilarious for her to go home with something like:  Property of Mr.(omitted for privacy).  

Obviously, the rooms are not the most luxurious, but I've seen worse.  They have been, how do I describe it, used.  I try not to think about it.   

There is a little breakfast place on the floor with the Adventure Dome that serves decent coffee.  Unfortunately, the people behind the counter can be ridiculously slow.  Some of them have absolutely no sense of urgency no matter how many people are in line.  I think they just really hate their jobs. 

Circus Circus also has free buses to shuttle people to and from the convention center.  

I'm gonna go ahead and give it 3 stars (In the Category of cheap Vegas hotels).  It's not the worst and definitely not the best, but I can't hate on it too much.  It gets the job done and sometimes I find myself appreciating the seedier places because they always seem to inspire more of an adventurous attitude, especially since you won't feel the need to spend too much time inside your room.  Plus, I always think of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and hallucinogenic drugs when I stay at the Circus Circus.  It puts me in a good mood... I don't actually do drugs, but the thought of getting all whacked and watching the circus acts brings a smile to my face.",3,8,3

My husband and I checked in with a friend making it a total of two rooms. We booked over the phone and we're told that our rooms were recently renovated and would be in there sky rise tower. So as we check in to this sky rise tower we are shocked at the old rooms, smelling like an ash tray for non-smoking rooms with no a\/c on. I called immediately about our concerns and the front desk kindly moved us to the west tower at no upgrade fee. 

Now, if this is all that would have happened along our stay I could have rated them 4 stars. Now we are settled in and very happy with our new rooms. One night after seeing a show we come back late to find that our friends key isn't working and need to reach front desk to issue a new key. The front desk tells us their machines are down and might take up to 30 minutes to restore but they will call security to let him in. My husband and I are off to bed thinking our friend will have no issues with his room but yet security is unable to open the door and now needs to call a locksmith (by this time it's almost 4:30 am) and we all needed sleep. Locksmith shows up and opens room after almost an hour of waiting and tells my friend that he might not be able to get back in tomorrow and will have to call for another locksmith to replace the lock. The next morning I call front desk and share our concerns and they offer us nothing but an apology. We had to call a locksmith for a lock that wasn't our problem, spend the next hour in a half getting the lock replaced. At this point I am very upset that our friend had to be put through such a hassle caused by Circus Circus and no one even bothered to show their concerns about our stay. 

I had to speak to management at which they offered us a credit for our friends room of the resort fee a whopping $46. The story continues but I choose to let the other minor things slip off, like the total b**ch at the front desk who gave no concern for great customer service and had an attitude with the guest before me and then treated us the same. Ironically she didn't wear a name tag because she probably gets called out all the time for her shitty service.

The day before I get there I called Room Reservations to check if we could get 2 room next to each other as it was my Husband & me & My Mum. I mentioned that she couldn't walk too far & would appreciate a room close to the elevator etc. I had no clue about the layout of the Hotel of Course.
However we get there the next Day Sunday 8th March & try to get a parking space closest to the Elevator & take our Luggage out & drag it across the parking & get to the elevator & to the Registration desk. At the Entrance NATALIE stops us & says we should check in & talk to her as she would like to offer us a FREE BUFFET. Who would say no to a Buffet in Vegas? Not a long wait at the Registration & the Lovely Lady ANITA, cheerful as ever checks us in & then tells us that our Rooms are on another block & takes 6 minutes to walk there, Really? I did mention when I called Room Reservations, that my 82 year old Mother could not walk too far. So we drag our Luggage all over again & stop & Speak to NATALIE, about the Promised Free Buffet. She Then gets us to walk over to another Counter & there the Lady is trying to sell us something. She says we had to pay her $150 at that time & she would return $50 to us & when we stayed at a hotel (A list which she went on rattling off) then we would get a Free stay & get $100 back. But we had to stay 3 nights. We were not interested as we are unable to getaway for 3 nights. When I said that to her, the nice lady she was, turned into a Witch. She was Very Rude & literally shooed us off. I asked her what happened to the Buffet & she Very Rudely said, ""No that's not for people like you who just stay 1 night."" Waste of our time to even listen to her garbage. First impressions, really put me off.
We then get back in to our car & drive out across the hotel & to another building to find our room which is on Block E the Furthest one. Room was clean & Comfortable & we had good Parking, Everything was fine. However there was no Fridge (We didn't need one) & no Do not Disturb Sign. I thought since it was Vegas, maybe we don't need all this. Coffee Machine was in the Toilet, But I was not Going to make my coffee in the toilet. So I moved it into the Room.
We were out with Friends & got back to the Hotel around 2 in the morning, looking forward to sleeping until it was time to check out. We had to forget about that. 9 a.m. the lady knocks on all the room doors saying she was from Housekeeping & needs to know if we were checking out that morning. I was so very annoyed to be woken up at 9 a.m. when check out was at 11 a.m.
Tried to talk to guest Services about it, after 40 minutes on hold, a lady comes on laying saying she's the Manager Guest Services & I tell her all this, she's so Rude & abruptly connects me somewhere. Another lady comes online & I asked her who she was. She says she is the Manager Housekeeping, more Rude to me & when I tell her what happened she says that's the Hotel Policy & there's nothing they can do about it. She says I should have put on the Do Not Disturb Sign. I told her I didn't have one & it seems like no one on that floor had one as this Cleaning lady was knocking on every single door. There was no point talking to her, as she didn't even bother to apologize.
Called Guest Services again & the Lovely SYLVIA listens to me, Apologizes & feels really bad for me. I told her we had a 6 hour drive back & needed all the sleep we can get to wear off the Alcohol & food from the previous Night. She then Connects me to the Front Office Manager, CHAD who was kind enough to offer us a Buffet to make up for it all. However, we didn't have time as we had to get on the Road, with all the time wasted trying to talk to all these people. I was Promised a Refund on Our Resort Fee. Not received it yet. So Lets see.

Granted the saying ""you get what you paid for"". We ended up choosing this hotel because it was the only one we could reasonably afford at the last minute. This was our first family vacation in 17 years since coming to the United States, so granted we were very excited. Upon arrival the room seemed adequate at first glance, but looks can be deceiving. I noticed that the hotel staff failed to clean the room and there was trash in the waste bin. We were forgiving about this and settled in so that we could explore the Hotel and take a tour of Las Vegas. Doing so required using the sink, which we found out was clogged and leaking water from the pipes. We called the front desk to notify them of this problem and needed to wait on hold for 30 minutes before someone answered our call. After explaining the situation they let us know that someone will be there to fix the problem. After storing things in the safe, we decided to explore the hotel rather than waste time waiting for the arrival of the plumber. Upon entering their second floor, we were overwhelmed with a strong tobacco odor. We decided to play the slop machines and lost $40 in approximately 15 minutes because the machines seemed to be biased towards the house (later we went to the MGM and won $20). After returning to our room I prepared to sleep and discovered a sharp metal piece under the sheets near the corner of my chest! The hotel staff failed to ensure safety. Luckily, I was not injured!! The plumber never came to fix the problem and we had to use the clogged sink. The restaurant there is not worth paying for. It has the quality of Home Town Buffet. Lots of food, but lack of taste. Definitely not worth the $15 we paid per person. The best part about the hotel was the check out. After mentioning the situation to a staff member and showing the sharp metal piece in my bed, we were promptly referred to a manager who apologized.

1. Literary: It is one of the few Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas stomping grounds still left standing. You probably won't be able to buy a chimp, but then again...
2. The Circus Acts: In the midway above the casino action, you can catch some free circus performers. It may not be Cirque quality, but there is definitely something compelling and memorable and, well, Vegas surreal. Last time we went I enjoyed the ""Captivating Cat"", a lady dressed like a cat that did trapeze tricks. However, the real star of the show was the one-man drummer band who created some superfly spy music. However, it is like art, some people will appreciate it. Others will wonder why they took my advice and went to check it out. They will shake their head as they are walking away. 

Other than that, I can't think of a good reason to visit Circus Circus. Imagine all the loudness, smokiness, and insanity of your average Vegas casino, and then make about 60% of the population children under the age of 16. Does this sound like a pretty picture? I feel like an old person by saying this, but honestly, when I go there, I can't think straight.  

Go check out the circus acts, say a quiet ode to Hunter, and then exit quickly.",19,23,11

This place holds so many fond memories for me during my childhood, what has happened to you my beloved Circus Circus?

Pros:
It holds a lot of memories for me, as already stated.
The Carousel Bar.
Besides shopping, the Stratosphere Tower rides, the rollercoasters at New York-New York and Sahara and a small arcade here and there, this is pretty much the ONLY thing left for kids on The Strip. 

Cons:
There never seems to be anything new. Not very exciting at all anymore.
Very low-quality restaurants.
Middle-of-nowhere location(not really their fault though, more the fault of stupid entrepreneurs who must blow up everything in sight instead of being resourceful and using what's already there for their project).
Desperately in need of a remodel.

Circus Circus is one of the few old school places left and one of the only things left for kids. I WOULD love to take my kids here if I ever have any, that is, if it didn't have the potential to make them cry from how rundown it is. Please, you guys need to do SOMETHING. It's not what it used to be at all but it holds too many memories for me to handle it if it were gone forever.",4,2,4

We got the monorail day pass and got off on the ""Sahara"" stop like the monorail tells you to.  WRONG DECISION.   It is a terrible, lonely, non-shaded, long walk to the Circus Circus.  PLUS, the stop at LVH turns out to be much closer (like, half the walk plus no scary uninhabited casino to walk through).  
So you'd think that since we saw the entrance of the casino as if seeing water for the first time in a vast, dry desert, we'd be happy with WHATEVER was there.  Nope!  It's really sad.  Like, really sad.  The midway is full of crying kids and closed games and several ""Star Darts,"" which is a game where you try to hit post-it notes with stars on them, stapled to a bulletin board.  It's kind of like one of those really sad church harvest festivals.
The acrobatic act we saw was actually pretty cool.  The acrobats were quite talented.  However, it was not worth it to travel that far.
The Adventure Dome was crazy boring and crowded, and we didn't feel like paying theme park prices for a couple rides.
The whole casino was kind of gross allover, so we didn't feel like eating.
We ended up staying for a very short time.

First of all, we did not have to walk through the casino to get to the registration desk.  We entered through the back where most people were being dropped off by a taxi or parked their car rentals.  So, if your taxi dropped you off at the front, it must be a taxi driver that doesn't know the hotel!!!!

We had to wait maybe ten minutes to register and we did get a guy that was not friendly at all!  His name was Richard - he looked fairly young, so may have been new.  BUT still no smile, no welcome to the hotel, nothing!!!  If you don't like what you are doing, leave!  Don't make people feel so unwelcome to the hotel!!!

When we got to our room on the 22nd floor, the door was WIDE open.  I didn't feel comfortable staying in it so we went back down to change rooms.  They gave us a room on the 35th floor!  Gorgeous view of the mountains!  The rooms were clean.  Even the carpet seemed fine as some people did say that it didn't look very clean but ours was.  The beds were comfortable, the linens were clean and the bathroom was clean.  And like other reviewers said, the wall paper was peeling from the walls but not too bad.  That was probably the only complaint.  We opted not to have our roomed clean the whole time we stayed there so don't know what housekeeping is like.  

There were tons of places to eat.  At at the Westpoint Deli and was very good.  Rock n Rita's was ok . . . very slow with breakfast but expected it from other reviews.  My cousin picked up a dozen donuts from Krispy Kreme and we left them sitting in the hot van when we were at Hoover Dam.  After we got back, we looked in the box expecting a big pool of sugar but nope, nothing melted!!!!!!!!  Kinda gross!!!!!

It was a very busy hotel.  Our room was great, quiet and spacious for the three of us.  Even the elevator wait wasn't too bad.  We didn't have to deal with many of the staff but the ones that we did, they were nice.  

The kids went to the pool once.  But it closed at 8PM!!  I don't know why it was so early but the kids seemed to have had fun.

They notified me that they were unable to help me with the coupon until everything opens at 7 AM I was under the impression it was a place was open 24 hours a day and that i would get good customer service don't go there if that's what you think.  I was told that there was nothing they could do to help me but there is no way I could print my boarding passes without having to pay exorbitant fees even though they were going to provide me with free service after 7 AM and top of it when I complained about the housekeeping debacle they told me I should have remembered to put my do not disturb sign on my door. I've decided to try to use the self-service Internet kiosk and print my boarding tickets from there and pay for the kiosk is down so I was left with no way to leave my mother and children their boarding passes. In the end I would never go back there again I may take my children there to ride rides but to be honest there are many other cool things in Las Vegas to see then a rundown stinky hotel.,0,0,0

The kids loved the new mini water park they just built. Only negative thing I have to say is they shouldn't limit you to 4 wrist bands at least not to just get in the pool. They should separate the pools from the water park and only require wrist bands for the water park.

Room:   I had paid about $8 extra to get a room in the casino tower ($30 per night vs. $22 in the west tower)  I figured with all the walking on the strip itself it would be nice to not have to walk a block through the property to get to my room.  My room on the 14th floor faced the strip, was completely remodeled--comfortable beds, nice linens, clean bathroom.  From reviews on Yelp, I was not expecting much but I was very pleased with my room.  Maybe bad reviews are from other towers.

Staff: I encountered absolutely no line for check-in at 2:30 on Sunday 12\/8, and the gentleman at the desk was very friendly. On my departure, I used the mail\/business center to print my boarding passes and used the bell desk to store my luggage (checking out at 11:00 am, flight leaving at 11:00 pm).  All of the staff were very helpful and friendly.   

Food:  Didn't really eat there, Krispy Kreme donuts and coffee were good!

Gaming:  I played $3 blackjack in the mornings, friendly dealers and plenty of drink ladies coming by.  I'll agree with other posts that the décor and atmosphere are dated, so I really didn't spend too much time gaming here... it was just a place to sleep at night.

Convenience:  I used the Deuce bus to get around, the stop is right in front of hotel (on Slots A fun side).  While Circus Circus is far from the rest of the action on the strip, the bus took us there in the blink of an eye so the distance really wasn't a big deal.  Actually was convenient location to head down to Fremont street and Pawn stars store.",2,0,0

Since we asked for a smoking room, there were no kids running up and down the halls! 
The decor was very nice neutral hotel- no clown pictures in sight! The glitch came when the plumbing went bad- I took a shower no problem in the morning, but an hour later when my boyfriend went to shower it was backed up and had black grease or something in it. It took an hour of several phone calls- by that time the water had gone down and we just wanted housekeeping to clean the tub out. Instead, we were moved to a mini-suite on the same floor! We were surprised, but pleasantly. 
The only bad part was schlepping our stuff- and we chose to do that rather than call the bell hop up to move us a few doors down. :0 Late check out is available- it cost us 20.00 more to stay until three which is fine with me.

The newest most up to date rooms are at the elevators directly behind where you check in. Some of the rooms like the manor area are to be avoided at all cost. Skyrise tower or casino tower rooms are ok too. Were talking about a $30- $40 a night room. It's really just a place to sleep.

There is a CVS just across the street from Circus Circus for your convenience. If you need a tooth brush, deodorant, mouthwash, snacks ect. If you just so happen to get a manor room, there is a convenience store in the RV park adjacent to the manor. If you are in the Skyrise or Casino tower there is a convenience store near the check in.

The Circus Buffet sucks. The pizza place is decent. I always stop at Crispy creme when I'm headed out the door to the strip. The Steakhouse is one of the top Steak restaurants in Las Vegas bar none. You can always get super cheap eats at the McDonald's at the midway. This brings me to my main topic.

The greatest part of Circus Circus are all the non gaming attractions and that's why I will always give Vegas 5 stars. Circus Circus is the place where a kid can be a kid and an adult can let their inner child come out. There is a Midway area on the second floor above the main casino. They have a giant arcade with 100 different video games. They have dozens of carnival game where you can win stuffed toys that are like 4 feet tall. They have ticket games where you can win flat screen TVs, video games, musical instruments, drones, stuffed toys, candy and tons of other things I can't even think of. 

Every hour there are circus acts in the midway with world class performers. There are trapeze acts, jugglers, magicians, acrobats, and all other manners of Circus performers. It's free to see the shows. Seating is on a first come first serve basis. Really the acts are pretty amazing. 

The most notable thing going on at Circus Circus is the adventure dome. Vegas gets super hot during the summer and bitter cold during the winter. Usually the extreme temperatures would make an amusement park a miserable experience. Fortunately the Adventure dome is indoors and climate controlled. They have a roller coaster, a water ride, several other rides that swing you all over the place, mini golf, laser tag, bumper cars, carnival games, an arcade and an area with children's rides. It's a great place to be for any age. Circus Circus is a great place in the great city of Las Vegas.",3,0,2

It's about a $20 cab ride for two people away from the strip. 

Ahhhhh. I made the mistake of staying here in Sept 2008. WORST MISTAKE EVER. Spend $1-200 more and stay somewhere nicer, seriously.

The LINE to check in was absurdly long. Two hours; I'm not kidding. It seriously looped around the lobby like a roller coaster ride line at a theme park, only when we got to the ""roller coaster"" we were actually being checked into the single shittiest hotel room I've ever been in. And I have stayed in $40 a night hotels in downtown Dallas. We noticed most of the younger people \/ couples had the exact same bewildered looks on their faces as we did.

The room was atrocious. There were what appeared to be poo stains (no, not water damage, although there was that, too) on the ceiling of the bathroom. The wallpaper was peeling off in our room, bathroom and the hallways. The bed sheets appeared relatively clean, but it's not difficult for hotels to wash sheets. The carpet looked (and felt) like it hadn't been steam cleaned or otherwise taken care of in at least a year, which in Vegas hotel years is like, 1,000 years.

The pictures were hung straight which is I guess a plus but they were of clowns and other various carnival \/ circus monstrosities. Although, I suppose that's to be expected at a hotel named after a circus... twice.

The casino or whatever was alright. Don't expect great drink service no matter how much you tip. The circus part was shitty at best.

anyhow, as with any casino that i stopped by, i needed to gamble. i've only been here once before, and that was during the whee graveyard hours [probably why it was more bearable then]. this, being probably one of the older casinos and definitely overshadowed by the all the new skyscraper casinos, still attracted A LOT of people. i could see why - it appeals to families. the kids can play on top, and the parentals can have fun adult time downstairs. also, it's one of the cheaper casinos - hence the reason why there were a lot of hispanic and asian people here [as Emmie R. pointed out]. if my parents still gambled, i could totally picture them here.

to summarize, i did not like this place because:

This is the place if you wanna be in Las Vegas with your kids but definitely not for grown ups looking to have fun on the strip! It's at the end of the strip so you always have to take a taxi or you can be cheap and walk. A five minute ride in a taxi costs like $20 so it can add up quickly. This hotel is rather old, smells weird and just feels so outdated. Lots of kids running around and older people too. The cool part is the kids games and circus acts and the adventure dome. I believe adventure dome wristbands are $20 each for unlimited rides. I got on almost every ride which was fun but the lines can be long at times. They also do caricatures in the adventure dome. Lots to see and do. I also tried the buffet at circus circus which is ok. Not the greatest but not the worst. I highly recommend the texas station buffet. It is off the strip but the buffet is excellent and affordable with a players card. I would not return to circus circus unless I one day have kids, but let's be honest is Las Vegas really a place for kids with all the smokers, gambling, women wearing next to nothing and escort flyers being handed out on the strip? I don't think so. Just take your kids to Disneyland beforehand and go to Las Vegas with adults only. Trust me going to Las Vegas with kids changes everything.",3,1,1

We got the CHEAPEST room you can get.  It was old, and located outside of the casino, but the beds were way better than a Motel 6.  If you've ever been satisfied with a Motel 6, you'll be satisfied with Circus Circus, but...it's really far from the better part of the strip.  

Cab ride from the airport was $28.  Cab ride from Planet Hollywood was $16.  So, if you don't plan on leaving much, Circus Circus isn't horrible.  The casino is actually pretty nice, and they have quite a few $5 black jack and craps tables.  If you can afford a few more dollars per night, I would recommend spending $100 per night somewhere else, say Tropicana when they have a good deal.

You get what you paid for, even sometimes the expensive hotel could be bad too depends on each individuals.

So i can't wait to post some comment because most review are bad so i was curious before and when the day was came, i found out this hotel wasn't bad at all.
I didn't get any trouble, nor so bad experience here.

The lobby for check in is nice, i don't like smokey thing but this hotel is separate the casino and check in so you won't smell any smokey nasty thing. And the front desk was nice too.

Got a king room in the west tower ( booked for good deals ) on 28 floors and the room is clean, smell good. Blanket etc are clean, bathroom is clean too. Has a small keurig without the coffee, too bad they don't have small refrigerator. They have iron, safety box too. And the self parking is not bad.  And they give some discount too for breakfast, or dinner on their small booklet. 

The adventure doom for the weekday will closed at 6pm. 

The only thing is so loud just when you flush or you could hear your next door flush or turn on the shower ( if you are in the bathroom too, not when you are in bed )

I didn't see any drunk \/ scary things even came back from watched a concert almost in the middle of the nite but still feel safe. I think the scary ones maybe in the Manor Lodge because it's not in the building but cross from the building, and i saw near with breakfast place there is a way to Manor Logde area.

The cleaners won't disturb \/ pushy \/ rude, as my experienced i put don't disturb on my door.

So far i like this hotel and will stay here again next time for sure. So once again you get for what you paid for.

What we Like:

Adventurdome: only $26
Midway : We can act like kids we love playing the games. This place seems so much BIGGER when I was little, so weird how small it got through adult eyes.
We got a room at the SKYRISE TOWER 22705 .. King bed, I think this is the upgraded ones because last one we stayed at was VERY OLD AND SMELLY LOOKING.
Cheapest rate on the Strip typically $26.00 a night

What we did not like:

We just had a room here 7\/28 - they now have a RESORT FEE?????
$10.95???? Why what is the whole purpose???

ALL THE FOOD IN THIS HOTEL WAS NASTY!!!! 
Do yourself a favor and walk a few blocks down to Mcdonald's or any other restaurant on the strip. You have way too many choices to waste your money here.

We had a coupon here a 2 for 1 buffet - not even worth the half price! I got food poisoning!!!

However, don't be fooled like I was they charge $30.00 for a resort fee nightly. Great place for kids while you go lose their college savings.

Cons: Mamma always told me you get what you pay for. This place is in desperate need of a wrecking ball. It is the oldest outdated smelly place ever. Like the smell of smoke on the air, you'll get plenty of that. Everything else is way over priced. Slot machines are so old and pay terrible.

We booked online a couple of months in advance.  When we go to check in (which was a zoo, but the lines moved along fairly quickly) we were told that the room was paid for but that they needed our credit card for the $8 resort fee (!!!!??)  I knew some of the resorts had fees but it said so on their site!  I never saw anything about a resort fee when we booked so that ticked me off.  

We were famished by the time we got in (flew in from oakland) and had met up with some friends so we went over to Rock & Ritas for a bite to eat.  Decent margaritas, food was so so, definitely not worth what they charged for it, but it was ok.  Checked into our room. I was pleased to find that it had a large bathroom, but our view was terrible.  We were on the 3rd floor of the Skyrise Tower and had a view of the roof.  Meh, get what you pay for I spose.  The bed was surprisingly comfy, but smelled slightly of cigarettes.  Thanks to the very loud A\/C, I didn't get but 2 hours of sleep that night.  Only blew air about 30% of the time and it wasn't even cold air so our room was not only noisy, but muggy the entire night.  We tried turning it off but then it got even hotter so we just dealt with the noise. (not good when I had to fly home and be to work the next day!)

The Adventuredome was not what I remembered it 10 years ago during my first trip to Vegas.  The sign said open til midnight and we got there around 4 and when we went to get the wristbands we were told they were only open until 6 and if we wanted to stay til midnight it's an extra $10 (some sort of halloween fest).  We said forget it and used our free ride coupons we got upon checkin to ride the rollercoaster and left. 

The midway was the typical Circus Circus midway, with the games and shows.  I was disappointed to see that the carousel bar was out of service.

The whole place was filled with smoke, me and my sister got bloody snot from the second hand smoke, for a child's hotel went to all the others like the Mirage and Luxor and all those others it smelt way better and didn't have and barely any smoke.

Back in the day, the blackjack tables had plexiglas cigarette containers so that you could select your cancer-stick-of-choice, order a couple of drinks at a time, and bet the pre-Christmas gift cash at $2 a hand - all very adult-like. 
 
Positives memories:

- That late night drive across the desert.
- $2 blackjack tables.
- Free unlimited cocktails (drinks of choice: tequila w\/beer chasers).
- Free unlimited cigarettes. 

Less-than-positive memories:

- $180 in gambling losses - a fortune at the time!
- A public *%^$#@#*^ story too outrageous to share!
- That costly 84 mph speeding ticket on the way home.

July 2006

That same friend was staying at the Circus Circus RV Park while I was in town. I visited him at his RV, then we headed into the hotel to get a drink. As we walked through the property, I realized that not much had changed...just as cheap & burned-out as 4 decades earlier - the casino, not ME.",4,6,6

1.  Great place to take the kiddos.
2.  Cheap room rates.
3.  Circus acts and games for kids and adults where you can win prizes.
4.  Tables and slots are decent.
5.  Adventuredome

Negatives:

1.  Casino is old and dirty.
2.  Awful buffet.
3.  Rooms are dated especially compared to other hotels on the strip.

Overall, it is okay.  We will always come here if we have our nieces and nephews with us cause they love the place as I once did.  If you have no kids, then do not come here.  It is too much of a ""circus"".",3,2,1

On a road trip one summer with our RV we decided that we would swing through Vegas on our way home.  We wanted to stay in an RV park near the action on the Strip and to our surprise we found that Circus Circus has an RV park on site.  Sweet!  Let's do it.  Oh my GOD what a mistake that was!  Mind you, we were on the last leg of a cross country road trip with two kids and two dogs, so we were already sort of at our wits end, but nothing prepared us for what we were in for during our stay at CC.  

The first afternoon we pulled in and, to our horror, found that the RV park is literally a parking lot with electrical and water hook ups.  Each ""site"" is a parking stall, with no area outside for putting chairs or even the smallest of barbeques.  There were a couple of ""premium sites"" with small patches of grass but for some unknown reason if you were travelling with dogs you were not allowed to have those spots.  Shade?  Non existent.  

Being the middle of summer we thought a dip in the pool might be refreshing.  Wrong.  Even the kids were disgusted.  

We ventured into the casino\/circus tent to check out the action.  What a complete waste of space.  The casino is unorganized and dirty and the midway games for the kids are no better.   After having experienced what we did in the casino and midway there was no way in hell we were going to eat in any of the restaurants, so we took the quick walk across the street to the Sahara and hit up the Nascar cafe which was quite pleasant.

Night two at Circus Circus things went from bad to worse.  After a day of sight seeing on the strip we returned to our RV to find that a good portion of the RV parking lot had lost power, including the section that we were in.  Luckily we had boarded our dogs with a local veterinarian for the day so they were not left to bake in our RV for who knows how long between when the power went out and we returned.  We asked to be moved to a different site so we could fire up the A\/C in the 113 degree heat (at 10:00 at night) which they reluctantly agreed to.  I guess it was around 12:30am when the space next to us became occupied by a couple of yahoo's who put the red in redneck.  They were whoopin and hollerin until they finally decided to hit the strip at about 2:00.  At which time their dogs began barking.  And barking.  And barking.  We complained, as did several other guests, but no one did anything about it.   At around 6:30am we decided we'd had enough and we packed it up and hit the road for home.  

Needless to say, if you are looking for an RV park in Vegas and you see the great ads for CC rv park on the strip run, don't walk, to the next RV park on the list.",0,0,0

Color-cordinated duct tape does not a carpet repair make. In the parking garage, stacked, unwrapped mattresses and box springs from the remodel and what is certain is these, after being stored in an open-air environment, are re-used in the hotel rooms. Same for the furnishings. What else am I to think but; ""if they cut corners here, in this manner, where else?"" Do they scrape left-overs off patron's plates in the restaurants to make new plates for the next person? And these are just the first impressions you get upon driving\/walking-into the hotel.

At check-in, you are immediately made to feel like you did something wrong or are a second-class citizen for ordering your room through LasVegas.com. And that assumption becomes stark reality upon entering your room. Dirt on the floor from previous tenants. A part of a clothing tag there, a red piece of lint there (I would look at that same lint on the bathroom floor every morning as I used the toilet meaning, it was never cleaned) a couple of pennies on the floor there. Things that a vacuum couldn't have missed which tells you that it hadn't been vacuumed. 

An austerity and conservation program that asks you to sleep on dirty bed linens. However, you have the opportunity to request from housekeeping that the linens get changed every day, which we did. This did not go unpunished.

Only 2 towels for 2 people in the bath. No hand towels, no laundry bag, no stationery in the desk, no coffee-maker, no refrigerator and furniture that is stained so severely you are afraid to sit on it or worse, broken so you cannot utilize it.

Hair in the bathtub drain and a faucet in the tub that doesn't shut-off properly. You only have one option, full-on, but that doesn't matter for a shower because the shower head is so compromised that only a bare minimum of water can make its way to you and even that, in misdirected and errant streams. It's hard to even rinse the soap from your body. But you wouldn't know it because the lighting is so poor in the shower because, well, because there is no light.  The light must filter in from over the vanity but it can't because of two opaque shower curtains. Both are on the same hangers and do not permit leaving the exterior curtain open while you attempt to shower.

Aside from lacking common sense, this system, it seems, leaves the property owner open to severe liability should someone fall in the tub due to poor visibility.

The room does include an alarm clock that goes off automatically, every day, at 5AM. With no instruction on how to turn it off.
The phone book is two years old, the TV is old, small and dirty. I have larger screens in my vehicles. It would have been funny but it wasn't.

No working vent in the bath so the mirrors fog up and reveal the hap hazard streaks and wipe marks of the very poor cleaning that seems never to include the far end of the mirror.

The curtains are tattered and the air-conditioner window unit is so poorly designed and placed that it blows open the drapes to create a flickering light should you decide to try and sleep in the daylight hours. The noise is absurd and the unit must cycle on every 5 minutes in an effort to maintain a 69 temp even on a mild 85 day.

We requested more towels the first day and they were promised but never arrived. We again requested more towels the second day (at 8:30 AM) but were told that house keeping didn't arrive until 9AM so our showers would have to wait. At 9:30 we called back and were told ""I just got in, I don't know, I will run your order through again."" Whatever that means. Can I assume that just got in means 30 minutes ago and I don't know means the order was never received? No. Because the man on the phone seemed to know what the order was without me ever telling him. Clearly he had received the order. So we waited and waited and waited. We should be enjoying our holiday, out and about and spending money at the tables. That seems like a good business model to me. But no. We wait instead for towels that never come.

When we finally complain loudly and long enough we get upgraded to another, in another tower and are offered no help in moving our things. So we pack and move ourselves (again, when we should be out enjoying our holiday) and when we get there our ""upgrade"" is, in many ways, worse than the previous room. No hangers. So we call housekeeping and request some and are promised they will be delivered right up to us. That's at noon. We call back at 2. No answer. Try to call the front desk. No answer. Call the operator and ask to speak with the manager. We get a supervisor instead. He promises hangers. At 4pm we call back, still no hangers. I told him our clothes, which we had to pack and move ourselves, are now wrinkled and we have a dinner date. He suggests I use the iron. May I suggest he be sent to class to learn what customer service is?

I could go on & on but no room!",2,1,0

We asked them for the most expensive room they had - it was $54. 

Didn't have any problems with bedbugs, but while checking - I noticed the mattress had a bunch of blood stains on it. I checked the other bed, same thing.  Thankfully I carry a solar shield almost everywhere I go so I slept on that just in case.  Oh I almost forgot - MAKE SURE you ask them to stay in the TOWER not the MANOR.  I heard the Manor has the bedbug problems, and who knows what else.

At night do not go out in the parking lot alone. This place is super sketchy outside.  It's THUGtastic. 

The Casino is awesome.  They have beer pong, jello shots, among other cheapo things.  There is also this weird sorta market where you can buy those cheap ass  samurai swords, Angry Bird T-Shirts, and other junk only you'll be paying much more for it than the 'market'. Watch out though!  If you are lucky you might bump into someone drinking everclear out of a plastic neon guitar. 

The staff is special. I saw a cocktail waitress that migh have been just north of 60, she had some of her teeth left and was wearing a super tight dress over her size 22 body. It screamed - DELISH!  She was wobbling around with a tray of ashtrays and some beer bottles. On the floor, don't forget to look up - There is a circus up there.  I didn't bother checking it out though.

In a nutshell, this place is more entertaining for people watching than say - WalMart. Which can be fun for a while.  However the overwhelming stench is nauseating.  It's like a mix of stale beer, baby wipes, big macs, and pall-malls.",1,9,3

I always woke up with tearing eyes and a congested nose. The bathroom was big and clean, so were the towels. 
The room didn't have a fridge or minibar (in case you are thinking to bring some food, it will go bad).
We also always had problems to get into our room as our keys didn't work well and we had to go get new keys a few times.

It took  a while but when the person brought up the ""clean sheets"" as she attempted to put them on the bed, we all looked in disgust because they too were DIRTY and stained. The attendant was very nice and apologetic but my daughter and I were pretty grossed out at that point.  I look at my bed and see blood on the comforter as well. 

We decided to avoid the room as much as was possible and super inspecting the beds before laying down. Needless to say we didn't rest well - the beds felt like cheap $50.00 mattresses; no kind of firmness or support. Sit on the edge and sink.  Then when we get home, I notice on my credit card Circus Circus billed me for another $134.00 ~ for what I do not know! Trying to dispute this now, but of course can't get ANYONE on the phone to resolve it.

We will  NEVER EVER stay at this hotel again nor can I recommend this place to anyone.",1,2,1

Clean room, good maid service
Walking distance to CVS and Denny's
Has a McDonalds
Free circus acts
Halfway between Freemont Street and New Strip attractions

The Cons:
At $26 a day, hard to say any negatives

First on the list, VEGAS baby!! 
SO on now to the review. Circus Circus... For the kids you are AWESOME. For a free room you cant really beat it. I guess i failed for not picking something closer to the center of the strip. We did end up paying a bit for cabs. 
The room, not bad. Nicer than some of the others i have stayed in but still. The view... you get a MIGHTY F+.

We're talking a little less than 20 bucks a night for four nights cheap, thanks to some online deals. But we most definitely got what we paid for.

Just hearing ""Circus Circus"" filled me with nostalgia, because I can't even count the number of times my family went to the Reno counterpart when I was a kid.

After the drive from Anaheim, I just wanted to pass out in bed. But my journey there would not be easy. Getting from the lobby to the Skyrise Tower led us down a labyrinthine path past screaming children, vendors hawking their wares, and some timeshare people who flagged us down. Didn't know what they wanted when they grabbed us at first. Naive, exhausted me.

We finally figure out the way to our tower (with maybe a little bickering), only to find that housekeeping hadn't even gotten to clean our room up from the last occupant!!! It was 3 pm, plenty of time between then and the checkout time that morning.

Housekeeping says we can stash our stuff    in our room, so we do and head to the casino to kill some time. Doubled my five bucks at the penny slots, so that made me slightly less cranky. Slightly.

Finally, we head up to our room. I just want a nap, so I get under the covers. 

Ugh. The overstarched, just a bit too short sheets. The waaaay too soft pillows that provided no support. Glad I brought my travel pillow and blanket with me, that made things better.

I can sleep on stone and be comfy, so the mattress wasn't a problem for me. However, my boyfriend of the sensitive back felt every spring. We checked out the bed the next morning and realized it was a king mattress on top of two twin box springs. WTF?

Made the mistake of hitting the pool our second day there to kill time before a show. 

I am anal around pools. I've been working around them for years. It was a funky as you'd expect a pool full of kids, but I'm used to that between working at a waterpark or teaching swim lessons.

No, it was a lifeguards that ruined it for me. Lazy, barely watching the pool, more interested in tanning and looking cool than anything else. Safety? Bah. Also, didn't see any backboards or trauma bags. God help Circus Circus if (when?) some kid drowns.

But again, 19 bucks a night. I am a cheapskate, okay? We spent most of our visit outside the hotel, so for that kind of a deal for a place to lay my head for a few hours, I can pretend to ignore a few things.

Never staying here again if I can help it. You get what you pay for, so next time I'll cough up a bit more.",1,0,0

Forgive me if I'm wrong, but I got dropped off as part of a tour (Seagull Holiday), and we had to walk through a parking garage to get to the front desk. Not the warmest reception.

The check-in area was thing first thing that would come to mind. Unfortunately, it was a bit outdated, compared to the newer hotels in the present day.

The hotel does a good job of notifying you about Internet access, and thankfully, it was free. The problem is, the connection is not 'as advertised', which states 5X faster speed. The routers are sparsely located throughout the floors, but the registration for the WiFi takes longer than normal, also requiring you to open your browser on mobile devices unlike most hotels, where the sign in menu pops up right after you've successfully connected to the network.

The signal does vary based on the distance from the router. I only get 1-2 bars, so I would rare it as moderate speed. Compared to the router at home, which does a good 50ish megabits per second, I only get around 13 megabits per second. That's more than 3X slower than normal WiFi speed. Talk about 5X faster... Yeah, if you're standing right next to the router 24\/7.

The furniture provided is nice, and there is a desk like most hotels. I'm counting 6 readily accessible outlets (excluding the ones already in use prior to entering the room), which is good, but not terrific. I would say it's definitely enough for me, but it could be better, because 4 of those outlets are hanging from a cabinet next to the desk.

The room was clean when we first arrived, which was good.

The bathroom (specifically the toilet) needs some attention. I just hate the toilets that have an almost INSTANT response, with the handle recoiling instantly after pushed. Those are very hard to deal with, and I have no idea why those toilets would be selected over more shock-friendly ones.

They have the needed amount of pillows and sheets on the bed. I don't know why most hotels have 4 pillows per bed, but Circus Circus only has 2 per. I don't mind at all, since I don't sleep with two, but I don't know anyone that does. They don't have 4 pillows per bed, just so you know.

The air conditioner is noisy when it starts up, and repetitively slows and steps on it. It's quiet for the most part, but it gets noisy when the temperature hovers above the temperature entered. It takes up a decent amount of space in the wall, but I don't really mind. The lid for the controls on the air conditioner is broken, but that won't be the case for every room I'm sure.

There is a broken fire alarm hanging by a wire in the ceiling, not sure why. There's a new one in the side of the wall, not sure if its working cause it isn't blinking. I hope the sprinkler right next to it works too, because I don't want to die because of Circus Circus being too lazy to maintain the rooms.

There are large mirrors outside of the bathroom, and I'm not sure why.

The TV in the room is outdated. Forget the flat screens, go back to the olden days with the big chunky boxy TVs.

Overall, not the best place, but I'm assuming it's the cheap alternative in Vegas. I didn't book this place, my touring company did, so I got nothing on the price.",1,1,0

Ok, that is expected, but then you have the key cards that stop working even though you have scheduled a 3 night stay. Love being abandoned at a separate location motel attachment for 20 plus minutes without being able to access my room. I had a kid hanging off my arm begging for a nap. I had my husbands arms full of cold drinks and snacks and such. It was just a nightmare. 

Other gripes:
No coffee maker, no extra towels\/pillows, and no reliable air conditioning. A steamy shower in the room caused the windows to fog. It was like being in Miami. It was awful.

Yeah, the paint on the building here is faded and crusty, the rooms might suck, bathrooms might be horrible etc etc, but as for the carnival games floor, I'll always be a fan. If you have kids, it'll be like their favorite carnival game place ever. It's like they want to give away the stuffed animals and prizes here.
Just to name a few, we won: smurf dolls, hello kitty, angry bird, bears, banana dolls, fish dolls, penguins and so on.
If you use the machine and break a hundred dollar bill, you get a buy one get one free voucher. So pretty much every game that the 5 of us played played, we used 3 bucks for 6 games.

The buffet they offer has a wide variety of satisfying foods, from main entrees, to sides and deserts. If you don't wanna leave the hotel, I recommend stuffing your face at the buffet. (Specially the ice cream!)
The rooms were neatly organized and cleaned all around. The air was breathable and there was no horrific smell. the bathrooms were kept stocked on the recommendables. The shower, toilet and sink were up to span. The bed sheets were changed daily and the beds were nicely made. With plenty of tv channels and free WiFi, you'll be plenty busy for those who decide on takin a lazy day.
The casino was also a plus of course. Not overcrowded with people as this hotel is also kid friendly, so the gambling area is sectioned off. There were plenty of machines to choose from to get that gambling fix. One floor up is a wide selection of shops to take a peek at that are not to hard on your wallets. Even though it is Vegas. 
A couple flaws I found. It was nearly impossible to find parking for me, as I had to drive in the very back. Also with construction being done on a main road entering the hotel, traffic can pile up, as I almost witnessed an accident.

I knew that this was not going to be a good experience when I arrived in the lobby.  There was a line of people waiting to check in that snaked out to the front door.  Now it is Independence Day weekend, and I understand that the hotel would be busy.  I would expect to see every check-in station staffed and the management would be doing their best to handle the rush of people as quickly as possible.  My expectations were not met.  1\/2 of the stations were staffed and we stood in the line 30 minutes before we were helped.  After checking in, I visited the men's room in the lobby where I saw gang tag on the stall walls.  Yikes.

We had a Manor room, which is located in three story out buildings located in  the back of the property.  The room was large, clean and reasonably well appointed.  The room appears to have been renovated lately.  I understand why hotels secure the television to the furniture, but I'm not sure why the Circus Circus secured the $20 alarm clock to the night stand.  I went to move the lamp on the night stand and learned that the lamp is secured to the furniture.  In fact the only bit of electronics that was not attached to the furniture (the TV remote control) was missing.

Finally, the level of people here was positively agoraphobic.  The crowds in the Adventure Dome and the Midway sections were so large, the midways were impassable for several minutes.  I understand that the Circus Circus is trying to accommodate whole families including children, but given the number of guests they have in the hotel, i'd think the fire marshal would want them to widen the halls.

It took almost 2hours to check in on a Monday night.

First off, I stayed in the 'Manor."" This is a no-tell motel that they probably bought and now call it Circus-Circus. Seriously, it's the most disgusting place I've ever stayed. I tried to change rooms but they claimed all the tower rooms were booked. The carpet was that weird greasy sticky, it stunk, there was mold on the ceiling, holes in the ceiling, wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling off the walls, tiles stained some putrid yellow, all the clocks and 3 of the 6 lamps were broken, no pictures on the wall, all the furniture was broken (drawers half hanging out and smashed) and this disgusting stink that permeated through the entire building that was basically similiar to mildew. Seriously, it was that disgusting. I'm glad it was the last day when I found the underwear and bra an elephant could have worn jammed between the mattress and wall. I am thoroughly disgusted that I stayed there.

The casino is old and tired. Rock'n Ritas was a sh*t hole with really crappy bartenders and the buffet review will be saved for it's own page. I did walk away with a couple hundred bucks from $1 roulette so I'm not that angry at the casino but it really is a dump and should be torn down.

I even asked for his manager and he tells me that there's no manager available. That's some BS! Regardless, there's always a manager on board. He told me I can file a complaint. I told him that their staff is dishonest and that whoever cleaned up that room should be fired for stealing.

Its more of a family casino hotel in the sense it is more kid friendly than other hotel casinos on the strip. I've been to Circus Circus countless amounts of time and it is a pleasant experience each time though if you're looking for shopping euphoria and gambling then search elsewhere. But otherwise I would reccomend it since it is cheaper than other hotels and offers about same amenities and serves the same function. You can always walk elsewhere to have fun and gamble and later walk back to sleep so its your call but good place and I always had fun. Midway can get addicting even for us adults so be careful about that! But otherwise have fun and go win yourself a teddy bear instead of just losing all your cash on the tables ;) It's Vegas! Have fun! Stay Safe too!,1,1,0

First off its suppose to be for kids. I go up to the midway and more than half of the video games are broken. Including ALL of the pinball machines so there wasn't anything to even entertain me.

Second, the security is limited and very slow. After spending 20 mins in the casino I saw a woman passed out in the middle of the floor and a huge fight break out with children crying. 

Third, the place is very dirty and ghetto. There are holes in the walls and everything is either sticky or gross.

Forth, the food sucks. The buffet smells like plastic burning and the steakhouse that is expensive and for a long time highly touted as one of the best steakhouses in LV falls short. The meat was good quality, but needed seasoning. Service was excellent though. The sides were also crap. Overall not a good meal for the price. 

Whoever is running this this casino (obviously) has the money to control these problems but fails to do so. Ive seen better casinos downtown... and if you have been downtown, you know that is crazy talk.",0,0,0

If you're looking for a budget hotel to take the kids and nothing else, you've found it. That's all it's good for. The convenience to entertain the kids at the Midway Arcade or the Adventuredome is all it's good for. The customer service, maid service, rooms, decor.....really really bad! 

Check this out: you know those little hanging things you put outside your room door? Y'know the ones, , ""do not disturb\/maid service"" . Well, usually my family and I don't want to be disturbed, but occasionally we want maid service: clean towels, empty waste baskets, etc. We put the sign out for ""maid service"" one day before 11am. We got back to our hotel that evening just before midnight. Our room wasn't done. Seriously? We went down to talk to Guest Services. Spoke to ""Richard"" and he told me the maids are usually busy and the maids usually ignore those signs and if we wanted towels or maid service, we have to call and make the request. Wait, what?' It's been my experience  that if you put a ""maid service"" sign on your door, you get maid service. Did I miss something? Apparently, I'm not hip enough on all the new changes. What the F are we paying resort fees for? Well, Richard said he'll take care of it within a half hour. An hour later...nothing. Send in the wife. She spoke to some other person (forgot name), and he apologized and took care of it. He did take care of it and credited one day resort fee. We appreciate that. The overall ambiance of the employee's:  Some smile, most do not. Not very personal and most  have a ""I don't want to be here"" attitude. 

Our room was bad!! Had to slam door to close it. The door frame was coming apart. The loudest toilet I've ever heard, beds have seen better days, thin walls, musty smell and overall the room is in need of a serious makeover. It's an old hotel, I get it, but damn!! Fix some s**t and put some money into some renovation. 

The elevators are questionable and I'll leave it at that. 

Not a whole lot of places to choose from to eat. I'm sure it's plenty for some, but the choices....meh! They have an expensive and tasteless buffet, a Starbucks and McDonald's (big surprise there), Vince Neil's Tatuado ( haven't tried it, but could be promising), a taco place by the Adventuredome, a Krispy Kreme, a place to get slushies, and a deli (looks ok).

Beware of the sales people who hound ya.

If you have kids, sure why not. You're not spending too much time in your room anyways. Just don't expect a whole lot here. You get what you pay for. We probably won't be back ourselves.",2,2,2

True, it is one of the hotels on the farthest end of the strip and catered to younger people, but their establishment isn't so bad. Rooms are quite spacious with an actual air conditioning system, and bathrooms are nice and clean. Unfortunately, they aren't so good with changing out burnt out lightbulbs, and besides news channels, the TV is pay per view. The one thing that really bothers me though, is the carpeted floor everywhere. Everything that you touch there, after walking on the carpet, gives you a nice, static electrical shock. Thankfully, internet is free, and there is a lifeguard at the perpetually crowded pool (there are three). There are four restaurants and a buffet, so you don't have to travel too far in the Las Vegas heat to find food. Shopping in there is minimal; there are a few small gift shops, and none of the fancy clothing stores that other hotels have. Of course, their main attraction is the circus show and their theme park, which is actually quite pleasant. Though targeted to the young crowd, anyone can have a good (okay, decent) time here.",1,1,1

We stayed for 4 days and arrived at 6 in the morning. Although the earliest check-in is allowed at 8am, the bell desk was able to store our luggage until a room opened up for us. So while we waited we decided to hang out in the casino. Of course its an older hotel and the carpet is stained with the smells of cigarettes but towards the exit\/entrance to slots-of-fun the room smelt like a foul fart that pickled and didn't air out.

Anyways, 8am came so we decided to check in, although there was a $10 early check in fee we didn't care that fee was dirt cheap to get into our room 7 hours earlier than normal check in time, we got a nice non-smoking room in the tower above the lobby which was nice. A King-Sized bed and the bathroom toiletries were stocked and fresh.

The only downside of the room was that we could hear our neighbors flush the toilet. 

There is a great cheap breakfast buffet downstairs and the boyfriend enjoined the Krispy Kreme stand. We did get lost somewhere between the adventure dome and the midway but it was totally fun and worth it to play something else besides slots and enjoy a few free performances from circus acts.

I ended up booking 2 nights at Circus Circus through smartvegas.com (highly advise you check out this website) I got amazing room rates! (Circus Circus also offers AAA discounts and military as well, just a heads up) :)

When I arrived at Circus Circus, I was immediately greeted by a lovely smile, and a ""hello, welcome to Circus Circus"", which was very pleasant, and resulted in putting a smile on my face!

I stood in line for about eight minutes, which was a surprise, considering the amount of people that were in front of me (about 15-20 people). I thought I was going to be standing for quite some time, but, Circus Circus proved me wrong.

When I arrived in my room, I noticed the spacious layout, and the beautiful view of the strip. The bed was ok in regards to comfort, and the positioning of the bed was slightly off, considering it wasn't in the center, and the T.V was to the far left. This made watching T.V uncomfortable. The pillows were fluffy and big, but ended up not being as comfy as I thought, this resulted in neck cramps.

The staff at Circus Circus was very helpful, everyone seemed to have a smile on their faces, and seemed to be eager to answer the questions you had. 

I come to Vegas a lot, and Circus Circus exceeded my expectations. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. 

They have a great adventuredome. This is why this made me feel like a kid again. I got to enjoy Vegas, like I usually do, then also enjoy the kid aspect as well, (riding rides, playing arcade games etc). 

The drinks are very affordable, and they have great tasting food as well.

They also offer free Wifi (which is pretty fast) and provide their guests with coupons to restaurants, shows etc as soon as you check in! 
This is something I haven't experienced in my other stays at other Casinos, but be careful because some coupons work, and others don't, its all trial and error. 

Circus Circus is a great place to enjoy a fun filled day with the family, or just a great casino to stay in. This is by far the best smelling hotel on the strip, just an FYI haha

We booked a last minute hotel room at Circus circus manor, which was better but still a little dirty,and it was clear that housekeeping did a cursory job. After a wonderful dinner, we came home and hung out for a bit. My friends fell asleep at 2 am. I went to take a shower, and when I stepped out, the word HELP was written on the mirror. It was written clearly in capital letters: HELP. Not HELD. Not YELP. HELP. This is distressing for two reasons: 1) housekeeping did not really clean at all, and 2) HELP?! Help from what? Dirty bathrooms? Screaming children? Kidnappings? I went outside and said something along the lines of, ""WHICH ONE OF YOU DICKHEADS WROTE HELP IN THE MIRROR?""

So I did the next logical thing anyone would do, which was to stay there, go online, and peruse Yelp reviews of Circus Circus for complaints about the paranormal.  

While I didn't find any complaints about ghosts, I did find reviews about cockroach and bedbug infestations, and because I wasn't having enough of a hard time, some of the reviews came with photos. I couldn't relax enough to sleep with these two competing nightmare scenarios in my head. Finally, at 5 am, I fell asleep with all the lights on. 

Out of morbid curiosity, when I was safely out of that hotel, I went online to see if anyone had complained about our room. Our room number was not specifically mentioned, but one of the websites reported this: """"Help Me"" will occasionally materialize on bathroom mirrors as if drawn by unseen hands."" While it may possibly be just a juvenile prank, one night was enough, and I have learned never to be a cheap ass with hotel stays in Las Vegas.

TL; DR
Do not stay at Circus Circus Manor. Possibly haunted, definitely dirty.",0,3,0

I checked in & there was a small issue with the first room they gave me so I switched rooms- no problem....but they gave me an upgrade for my inconvenience to a mini suite! I thought that was very nice of them to do. The Mini suite was very spacious and I really liked the layout. The Air conditioning worked very well (I like sleeping in a cold room) and I once again have no complaints about the stay.
One of the reasons I like staying at Circus Circus because its a very comfortable, affordable option without giving up any regular Large strip hotel amenities......I would advise you to not book the Manor rooms if you can help it....I never booked those rooms and my stays have all been wonderful",1,0,0

My family and I stayed in the Casino towers which is in the main building and I was very unimpressed. The room was not fully cleaned when we first got there; there were little bits of trash in the bathroom\/closet area, as well as hairs in the sink. The beds were also not very soft and the sheets were kind of stiff. There were few electrical sockets to plug in our phone and other electronic charges-- we had to unplug the alarm clock and lamps in order to charge our things. The toilet in the bathroom is scary... when you flush it, it makes this majorly loud vacuum sucking sound and is pretty startling. 

I understand that this hotel is more of a kid-friendly option, but goodness there are a LOT of kids running around, bumping into you, unaccompanied. It was very annoying trying to get from one point of the hotel to the other with all the kids running around, and even adults who didn't seem to know how to walk and would just stop in the middle of the walkway. 

One thing that really stunk about this hotel is that it is so far away from all of the major tourist attractions on the strip. You pretty much have to take a taxi everywhere or buy a bus pass for the strip. It is at the very, very end of the strip and walking to any of the other hotels is pretty much out of the question, unless you are good with walking longer distances to places. 

We did not stay in the manor, so I can't really discuss that but one of the taxi drivers we used one day told us that the manor is definitely a place to avoid because of the criminal\/sketchy activity that goes on around there. We also did not eat in any of the restaurants, so can't really discuss that either.

The midway area was pretty cool, VERY crowded but neat. I didn't catch the circus acts, which was a bummer. The pool there that I saw seemed REALLY tiny. Not nearly big enough for all the people staying at the hotel. Plus, I was a little weary about how sanitary the pool\/pool area was considering the inside of the hotel was not great.",1,0,0

The hotel room itself was not pretty, and honestly I would have probably preferred a place with a more decent room off the strip, but I can say that a huge bonus was that I got a fridge (upon request).

As for the hotel in itself, it was filled with children everywhere. The pool, all the restaurants, the hallways, etc. You could you hear babies crying at 5 in the morning (which does not bode well if you have to get up at 7, or if you're coming home drunk from partying all night). 

Another bonus was that I stayed at the Manor, which is actually across the street from the casino and the rest of the rooms, so it was easy to get to the car without the hassle of crawling through the entire child filled casino to do so.

They also have the adventure dome wish is pretty cool. It's a good size amusement park. The BEST part of it as an adult is..... It's indoors! You don't have to deal with the weather. Kids love it. I recommend you buying the unlimited wristband for untimed rides. Your kids will LOVE YOU for it :)

The atmosphere is so depressing, as other Yelpers have pointed out.

But Circus Circus is still a run down version of its former glory-day self.

They were friendly enough when checking us in: gave us a map of the hotel and told us where the RTC vending machine is (in front of Slots of Fun and only takes exact change). What they didn't tell us was that no matter what, we would be charged a ""mandatory"" fee for unlimited local calling service each night we stayed there. They only bothered to tell us when we were checking out and stunned us with surprise credit card charge. I'm not sure if all Vegas hotels do that, but in principle, it just doesn't seem right even though it's only a dollar a night.

The walls seemed pretty thin: on two of the four nights, we were woken up by loud neighbors or just rowdy people in the hall. Housekeeping service oddly came in the mid- to late-afternoon AFTER people could start checking in. On the third day, our ""do not disturb"" sign went missing, so it was annoying when housekeeping keep coming by when we were taking an afternoon nap.

The primary reason why we stayed here was because we were in Vegas for a friend's wedding, and she was staying at the Wynn and holding her ceremony there. So we were close by, but that was pretty much the only benefit to staying at Circus Circus.

I consider myself to be an EXPERT when it comes to staying and playing at Circus Circus. Why so? My parents first drug me there in 1994 when I was in the 4th grade and the strip looked WAY different than it does now. I am now 28 and have gone to Vegas probably over 20 times and every time we stay a few days at Circus Circus. I consider this place THE BEST deal and experience on the strip, no matter your age. LET ME BREAK IT DOWN:


STAYING: CC has different room options to fit your budget. When we first started going there we would stay at the ""motel-like"" manor rooms, located OUTSIDE of the main building. The rooms are the least expensive and were clean and cozy. It has been many years since I have stayed in the manor rooms though. From my understanding they have not been remodeled like the newer rooms and towers. We have also stayed in the Skyrise Tower. These rooms are also very clean and nice, but I do not have believe they have been update yet. When we stay there, we always stay in either the West tower or Casino\/Main tower. These two towers have very nice, updated rooms. This past time we stayed in the Main tower. The AC was freezing cold, rooms smelled fresh, clean carpets, PERFECT and COZY. No complaints. 

PLAYING: I was just at Circus Circus over Labor Day weekend. We were there for 4 days. My mom won $5,000....ON SLOT MACHINES while there...that should say something. Not only are the slots loose, but the table games usually have $5 minimums. The cocktail waitresses come by frequently because the hotel is smaller than mega resorts, and the dealers have been working there for much longer and usually have very interesting stories to share. This is one of the only places I know of that has a small section of slot machines that still uses COINS!! It is so cool to hear the clank of the dollar coins when you win :) GREAT PLAYING EXPERIENCE EVERY TIME WE VISIT!

CHILDREN\/ARCADE\/ADVENTURE DOME: WARNING...WARNING...WARNING...During the day you will see children...sometimes LOTS of children. It can get annoying, not going to lie. HOWEVER, this shouldn't bother you too much for the following two reasons:
1. If you have a family, then this is the place to BRING your children. You should be THANKFUL to CC as it is a very kid-friendly place. The adventure dome has thrill rides and lots of games. The arcade has video games, arcade games, and carnival games, and LOTS of cool prizes to be won. 2. If you DO NOT HAVE KIDS OR ARE NOT TRAVELING WITH KIDS, then you should be LIVING IT UP and partying and playing at night (while the kids are no longer walking around) and sleeping in during the day (when the kids are roaming around down stairs in the hotel. Therefore, you will likely avoid the mobs of kids that walk around during the day. NOTE: the summer months are particularly bad (lots of families with kids) any other time, it's actually pretty cleared out.

DINING: CC has several yummy eateries. Though I have never been to their steakhouse, my parents have, and they say it is DELICIOUS. I do know that it has won ""best in Vegas"" for like a crazy number of years in a row. There is also lots of casual dining like McDonalds, Pizza, Krispy Kreme (aka donut heaven), and Rock n Ritas. My personal favorite place to eat the West Side Deli. This place is 24 hours and has AMAZING sandwiches (the hot pastrami is my favorite) as well as YUMMY chicken noodle soup and a strawberry shortcake that cannot be beat. 

LOCATION: Yes, CC is located in an area that is now a little more desolate than it once was. However, the Riviera and Slots of Fun are both a walk away AND both locations offer inexpensive table games :) ALSO, you can get to other hotels quickly. The Duece bus pick up is RIGHT OUT FRONT of Slots of Fun. You can take that bus anywhere you want to go up and down the strip and downtown. Other hotels, you usually have to do some far walking to catch the bus stop. 

POOL: Circus Circus has three pools. It has been a while since I have been, but here is what I can tell you. It is certainly going to be crowded during the summer months...but that's ANY pool in Vegas. Here is a secret...TRY TO GET INTO THE POOL FOR THE CAMPING GUESTS. Circus Circus is one of the only, IF NOT THE ONLY, property on the strip that lets you park your RV at the Las Vegas KOA location at Circus Circus. There is a pool for the camping guests, but it is very close to the main pool. The pool there is LARGER and LESS CROWDED. 

OTHER\/GENERAL STUFF\/TIPS: There are TWO valet areas. One up front, one in the back. If one is full, check the other. Circus Circus has improved with time. Some people think that it is old\/outdated, but NO, I do not believe it is at all. In fact, I can say that I am impressed with their attempts to stay fresh and modern. I do wish they had wider walk ways, but that would be my only suggestion. Make sure to join the players club to earn awesome food\/room comps while there. ENJOY!",11,1,3

1st we got an amazing deal (not really hindsight) $135 for 2 nights at ""motor lodge"" which is pretty much a Travelodge \/  best western style motel hiding under the ""circus circus"" name very disappointing. 

2nd one of these informative reviews had it down packed you check in then have to walk across the street to your damn there trailer-park \/ RV  lot smells horrible looks run down & the rooms are beyond out dated I wouldn't recommend this motel to my worse enemy 

3rd like someone mentioned NO ONE HELPS you to your room you walk across that side street into your motel room past a half way decent swimming pool and pass 2-3 buildings we were in building C on the 3rd floor 

4th the place is just point blank run down the fitness center (not saying anyone works out on vacation in Vegas) looks like something out of a bad 80s movie.

The memory faded over a decade and while I was told a client would comp me a room elsewhere, at the last minute this was the only one available. 

I figured, fine, I just need a place to sleep and shower between the show and evening meetings and events, but the amenities here leave too much to be desired. 

The neighborhood at night is a cross between The Warriors and The Walking Dead. I travel well-armed and aware but I am putting that out there for those that might not

Maybe I am prejudiced because my credit card was fleeced here years ago but the staff, employees and businesses here come across as seedy and scummy like they are out to rip you off at any chance

The $29 a night rate may tempt you but you will spend more cabbing it to and from the real casinos if you make the mistake I did

The bed consisted of a mattress pad, flat sheet tucked under the mattress, another flat sheet, blanket, and yet another flat sheet. Feather pillows.

We did not have houskeeping come in (stayed saturday and sunday night) so I can't comment on that aspect. Adventuredome is crowded and noisy.

There are small improvements. Food is just a bit better, like coffee. The shops aren't mindless tchotchke stores, although they get there.

Then there are the time-share buzzards that troll the lobby, dressed like they were hotel staff. They chat you up like a Turkish rug salesperson, offering free tickets, but it's all about selling time-shares. These trolls seemed to be sanctioned by the hotel, which dropped the entire rating from a four to a three-star.

We chose CC since we were dragging along our 4yo with us this trip and wanted to have some convenient things for her and us to do together. After reading a lot of the reviews I felt that I made probably one of the worst decisions of my adult life and that our daughter would suffer some psychological damage later in life, but....low and behold.....things we're alright. Yes it's older and rundown in comparison to the strip hotels, obviously. You can tell they are upgrading things slowly but surely and I was actually put at ease upon entering. I hate cigarette smoke, but know it's unavoidable in Vegas but the ventilation throughout the hotel seemed good. Check in was the worst experience for us. Took about an hour on a Friday night\/Saturday morning about 12:30am, would have thunk so many people stay here and check in that late. 
I can't remember the tower we stood in but apparently it was the remodeled tower and we were definitely surprised about that comfort and quality of the room. The beds were super comfy and the room was pretty dang spacious. I was expecting the worst and was very pleased. Take it, we usually stay at the Vdara so this was definitely a ""culture shock"" of sorts expectation wise but at the same time, we're not picky people. The restroom was nice and roomy and good mirror space and lighting. The AC worked like a charm and every stinkin' hotel employee we had contact with was very nice and helpful, and not in that...I work at a 4\/5 star hotel so I have to treat you nice, way. It was genuinely nice, especially the house keepers. 
We had booked 2 nights and I had actually booked them separately since we weren't sure how long of a trip it was going to be so they were going to swap us rooms for the second night, I called the front desk and asked them if there was any way we could stay in the current room so we wouldn't have to pack up and unpack again and after about 10 minutes they made it happen without a fuss.

It's 6 decks, double after split, dealer hits soft 17, no late surrender, and split aces receive one card. They have a $5 double deck game as well pitch (so cards are dealt face down). They also have a ""party pit"" which has lights and loud music. The way the party pit works is if you get a blackjack while the lights are on, you get 2-1, instead of the 3-2 payout for blackjack. The thing is, you must be betting $10 a hand. 

The $3 tables are often full, but it won't take long to find a seat. There has only been 1 table on my visits, but plenty of $5 tables for blackjack. 

One word of advice is to sign up for the promotional chips offer. You give them $30, and they will give you $45 promotional chips for table games (blackjack, roulette). You play the promotional chips until you loose them. It's basically an extra $15 of the casino's money to play with. They also give you win cards with the chips which advise you on how to play the game (for example, in blackjack, if i have a 16 and the dealer is showing a 5, what do i do?). One thing to note is that some of my table mates were a bit offed that you ""have"" to loose the chips. It's gambling for a reason. No one ever wins every single hand. If you win, you get real chips, and you stack those up. Play the promotional chips until you are out. You can repeat this offer every 6 months. 

The nostalgia of Circus Circus is awesome. Not only was it a place for my childhood, but now, my blackjack needs as well.",0,0,0

The rooms were clean, and housekeeping was efficient. The most important thing is...the beds did not feel STD infested, were comfy, and the bathrooms had showers with constant pressure and temperature. So Circus Circus already trumps Tropicana in that regards. Circus Circus is also dirt cheap for a strip Casino to stay at. However, what Circus Circus does lack is a good strip location. It is a pain in the ass to get anywhere central strip from Circus Circus.
   the only thing close by to Circus Circus is Slots of Fun and Peppermill. Peppermill Sucks, and Slots of Fun..well its okay..but honestly i don't come to Vegas to gamble at cheap shit places...if that's the case I might as well gamble at the casinos where I live and save the airfare. The buffet at Circus Circus is so, so...and the little kiddie place..well it's okay, I miss the arcade games they used to have...but i think that's when i was a kid.
  What kicks ass at Circus Circus is the steakhouse there... http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg#hrid:Mec4tf5edLjEn_uClhQzYg\/query:circus%20circus%20steakhouse  Unless you've been there, you don't know how awesome it is...and I'm talking PRIME steak up there with all other topnotch Prime steak joints (Ruth's Chris, Smith & Wollensky's etc.).  The gaming at Circus Circus is cheap(er), and honestly...the kid situation and them running everywhere isn't as bad as people say it is. I had an okay time at Circus Circus. I think it's a great deal, but I'd rather pay the extra $$ for the night for a nicer casino a little more central strip, but that's just me. It's a perfectly good option for those who want to save money and\/or have families.
   Get off your high horse...Circus Circus isn't going anywhere.

We even filed a claim for the bugs and they had their own housekeeping department inspect and determine that there were ""no bugs"" even though I pointed out spiders to the security officer.

1) Our room was spacious and clean. We stayed in the Skyrise Tower. The beds were relatively comfortable. The bedding was clean and the bathrooms were huge.

The Barista cafe on the second floor has delicious breakfast sandwiches and Iced coffee. Too bad they close at 3pm?????? 

Oh and there is a 24-hour Crispy Creme.

Now the bad, and there was a lot of bad. 

While checking in with a attendant named ""Lulu"" we were told that if we wanted a late check out it would cost $20 to check out as late as 6pm, but we would have to wait until the day we were checking out to tell them that we wanted a late check out. So Sunday when we called to get a late check out all of a sudden it is now $40 for a late check out. With no explanation about the difference or honoring the word of ""Lulu"" at the front desk. So we had bell service hold our bags for us for just a tip. 

Getting to the hotel rooms in the Skyrise tower is a nightmare! After walking all the way through the casino you have to take two separate elevators and walk through the waves of screaming children at the adventure dome to wait in line for 10 minutes for an elevator to get to your room. The ceilings in the hallways and the rooms are barely 7ft. My husband is 6'10"" and had to duck around the light fixtures and fire sprinklers. Getting to your room is at least a 15 minute ordeal that will make you want to never have children!


Food:
Rockin Ritas, the ""hip"" place to eat in the Circus Circus has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The waitress acted upset to even have to wait us, she took two out of four of our drink orders and left to help another table. My husband and I shared a plate of nachos and the chicken smelled bad and was almost  a powdery consistency, and the cheese on top was not even melted. So we decided not to eat them and the waitress was very rude to us when we told her what was wrong with them.  
The  Blue Iguana refused to give my husband a cup for water without buying a $3.49 soda. He ordered a taco salad for $7.99 that the bowl was so oily is was soggy and the lettuce was so warm it tasted like it just came out of the microwave. 

The Children:
This hotel would be a hay-day for child protective services. I understand that it is Circus Circus and is one of the only child friendly hotels on the strip but while walking around the casino at 2am hoping that you would get a break from all of the children running around and actually try to enjoy the casino. You walk by groups of children sleeping in the cafes and on hard plastic chairs close to the slots while their parents are gambling. It makes it hard to enjoy yourself when you feel so bad for the little kids. 
During the day you cannot walk through the walk ways without tripping over little kids that are not being watched, or huge double strollers that parents are barreling down the walk ways with. You have to have a lot of patience to deal with the amount of children here.

Gift Shops:
The shops here either feel like second hand gift stores or cheesy flea market stores. They sell old souvenirs from other casinos in their Viva Las Vegas stores. You can get an Flamingo 2007 lapel pin for 2 for $.99 there! As well as shirts with mis spellings or crooked printing for 3 for $10. Other than that you can get a light up tattooed naked Marilyn Monroe shirt or a pair of jeggings that have ""Las Vegas"" spelled out in rhinestones on the butt. Pretty Classy.

""Resort"" fee:
I am not sure why Circus Circus is considered a resort, when there are zero amenities.  While we were there all of their pools were closed with no explanation. Their fitness center was closed and their wifi did not work. But no way would they refund the resort fee.  

Overall:
I know this is very long winded but I hope that people will really take this into consideration when staying here. If you have children with you, this place is okay. Do not stay here if you do not have children with you, it just is not worth it. I just cannot tolerate places that change their prices after they have already told you one thing, and places that have terrible customer service.",12,5,2

Overall Circus Circus is a great deal. It's one of the cheapest casino hotels on the strip, but it is still well-furnished, clean and comfortable.  Best of all, there is no smoking so it isn't toxic like a lot of the other hotels on the strip.  There's good shopping and the indoor carnival and outdoor splash park are great fun.

1. The hotel is old and is for families. This means there are a lot of children running around to create noise and messes. Based on the name and theme you should know there will be children everywhere. So, if you can't handle that do not stay here.

2. You are going to get what you pay for in Las Vegas. We were there NYE so all the room prices were jacked up. In order to save money on rooming we chose to stay here. The rooms weren't horrible but after seeing ny ny where my friends were staying we realized its all in the price you are willing to pay. This is a low budget place for people with kids so if you want glitz and glam go further down the strip.

3. This hotel is not best suited for young adults without kids. There are only a couple of bars and really no other night clubs. We found ourselves often leaving the hotel for most activities. 

So overall it ranks average to me because it fit the bill for a place to stay and a surprisingly comfortable bed to sleep in. That being said it did fall short for adult entertainment and fun things to do. The biggest downfall though was definitely all of the children who were not being supervised by their parents and always in the way. Next time i'm going to planet hollywood.",0,0,0

The room was o.k, I mean it was clean. The only bad thing was the shower. It drained very slow!!!! By the end of the shower there was at least half a foot of water.  What really got to us was the following: We traveled with our 2 kids ages 12 and 14. One of my kids lost $55 and pair of sunglasses as they rode the El Loco rollercoaster. As they got off the ride they were able to see where the money and glasses were. They took several pictures of the items lost and showed us. We then headed to security to see if there was anyway of getting those items back. We were sure that the answer would be ""no"" and we were fine with that. After all they do warn you about your valuables. We were greeted by a very friendly security office T. Murray, the other office at the booth told us that if they were able to get an engineer down there they would be able to get the items. Well both the security and the engineer went to see if they could retrieve the items. They came back with only the sunglasses! This all happened within 20 min. Which is sad, one of them kept then money! The area where the items were was totally un accessible to the public therefore no one else had access. How sad that they did this. Really?? You found the glasses but not them money?? Clearly either the security guard or the engineer took the money!! We then proceeded to make a formal complaint since we had the pictures to prove the money was also there. Our report was taken by the Security Supervisor Mr. Porter. The only reason I gave this hotel at 3 star is because of the help and kindness of the 2 people that made us feel good. Otherwise I would have given it a 1 or 2.

I stay here all the time (get free rooms every year because pop's got the player's game card). They're remodeling the place so rooms are getting nicer (even though they are decent) and I honestly have to say, I have NEVER gotten any bedbugs problem or anything related to bugs at any of my stays (even as a kid). I'm not really into anything fancy & pricey like the Wynn Hotel etc so I'm fine with Circus Circus. Heck I rather spend all the money paying for food than booking an expensive room.

It is older, dated, smellier, and just simply tacky. But decades ago the property added a indoor amusement park and it simply is a big attractor. You can get some very cheap rooms here and the kids will have fun, but it will change your vacation dynamic because it's on the far north end basically near nothing.  There is a shuttle to Caesars, and you can walk across the street to Wynn and Encore or a bit further down to Treasure Island and Mirage.  I've stayed here and seen Vegas better than staying in key locations on the strip center.  There's something about it that just makes you want to explore out.  

This hotel is particularly great if you have one parent who actually wants to gamble and doesn't care where they gamble.  So the other parent can eat, and play and go to the corny free circus and amusement park for $30 all you can ride all day.  

Also because this is a 3 star hotel it's best to book here directly, but you don't have to worry about a low bid price stealing your 4 star bid.  I like that for it's honesty.

Some negatives-- 
This hotel feels old and dirty. As you walk through the parking garage the soot or smog is so bad, that people have taken off their shoes and slapped the dirt onto the ceilings, so it looks likes 1000s of people ran on the walls and ceiling.  Their is a smell of smoke in some places. And nothing, nothing is updated.  

Positives--
Great for kids when one parent gambles and the other just wants to stay nearby and keep the kids happy.
Most MGM resort properties have a lot of issues with upselling, and making you feel lost or insignificant. That just doesn't happen at this hotel.  I think that one difference in ethos and character is what makes this place a fun 3 star hotel for $50\/60 bucks a night. Simply put this hotel knows it's one step up above a motel 6, and is proud of it and you will have a great time with the right attitude here.",0,0,0

I would like to give 0 star if there is such option. Too many dramas I didn't expect from a big hotel.

After we got into our room, there's no chair! It took them 20 minutes to send us a chair. Then 2 hours later around 11pm, after i put ""no disturb"" sign, they sent us a second chair.

Towels in the bathroom are not clean. Took them anlong time to send new towels. It was so long i had to call them again. I was told it took 30-45 minutes to get replacement towels!

Next morning, no hot water. Called the front desk again. Was told they already knew the issue. Asked how long it took to fix, the answer was ""we don't know"".

The lobby and casino areas were filthy, including human feces on the bathroom floor in the lobby. Hallways to the rooms all smelled of stale cigarette smoke. Ice machine on our floor didn't work. Extremely bare bones amenities in the rooms.
To top it all off, our car was broken into while parked in the hotel garage, along with at least 3 other vehicles. Smashed windows and glass everywhere. When we approached hotel staff for assistance, such as a security report, or contacting local authorities, no one could be bothered helping us. We even had to sweep up the glass ourselves so no other people would get hurt or suffer damage to their car. We had many items taken, which was a total drag, but the lack of empathy or customer service made the experience significantly worse.

I arrived at the circus circus quite late due to a delayed flight, and was shocked to see a queue at the check in.. A queue at nearly 1am? Are you kidding me... Only two people manned the check in counter(there were others standing about, but not working) and it took me around 20 minutes until I reached the counter (after 25 hours flight and transit, yay!) 
The first guy couldn't even find my booking, but he called for help and he was replaced by a really friendly, helpful guy whose name I sadly didn't get (sleep deprivation will do that to you). He put me in the casino tower and gave me a upgrade to a larger room for no reason at all! Epic friendliness.

The room itself was large, roomy and clean, a large TV and free in room WiFi. It had a slightly outdated feel but for under 30 bucks? Who cares! However, NO fridge! Not even a tiny minibar, which really sucks.. I do like my water cold.

As far as restaurants go, I only tried the buffet and the deli. The buffet costs 14,99 which is quite pricey, the food was fresh but the selection was quite limited. The coffee tasted rather bland and watery, the orange juice was fresh and ""real"" so that was ok.. They only really have one highlight: the omelette dude! This guy makes you omelettes on demand with your  ingredients of choice for no extra charge. And they're Delicious!
The deli was good, they have decent coffee and snacks, again pretty pricey.

Later on she will deny it. And the front desk manager, the security person ( a guy who rides a bike), and somebody who can be reached only by phone (800 number) all of them, will support her stupity. Also they will let you know that they are not responsible for replacing the 500 dollars denture.
My mom is almost 80 years old, diabetic and traveled from México to visit Las Vegas and find out that an idiot maid, throws away her denture into the trash. How sweet that is.
Nobody cared that it was around 3 o clock and my mom was with empty stomach, low sugar blood levels and still she was not mad because she is a very sweet and kind person.

So I wake up from the 9 hour car ride and I'm like how much longer til the Sahara.. they go oh yeah about that were staying at circus circus. Suddenly my mind is spinning, creepy clowns, small children, rollercoasters. GET ME OUT OF HERE. but then I realized it's also a casino and theres bars.. saving grace. So we roll in, wait 30 minutes to check in, get our rooms, not too bad, but the sink didn't work.(but a repair man was up there within 20 min) But honestly for how cheap it was (like 100 a night on CES weekend) it was a good deal. I think I only got like one bedbug bite. And im not kidding.

The restaurants there were ok- it's vegas so it's super over priced and very tacky if it doesn't have a celeb chef. BEST DEAL EVER though: $2 bloody marys or margaritas, and $ 2 shrimp cocktail or chips n salsa 2am-2pm, how can you go wrong? and $6.50 for don julio shots, all at the ""Garden Grill"". Now another great deal, the buffet.. so for like $25-30 you can eat all you can eat bfast, lunch n dinner, just beware of what time it's closed at. I missed a meal being hungover and lazy. The foods ok, it's just a really good deal in vegas.  I seriously ate there like 5 times. and if i needed a soda, or anything i'd just go right in. It's a hook up when you want to have $$ for shopping or gambling, $30 a day on food is a good idea. Now when you gain 10 pounds, don't blame me.

So we had kids with us, a 12 year old and 2 year old. Lots to do for them at this place. Honeslty unless you have kids or have been coming to vegas since it was becoming popular you wouldn't want to stay at circus. no clubs. closest night life party happenings would be like the rivieara (pass) encore and wynn (unless I win big i can't even fathom entering those doors for more than a cocktail and a ooooh ahh), and then you have to walk to TI.(which smells like a christian audieger brotherl). it's just kinda weak. 

But anyways in the hallways leading from the casino to the towers.. theres those kiosk things. and those people who attack you as you walk by. Now i say attack and not approach because I maybe walked the hallways 5 times a day for 4 days and i was harassed ""where you from"" ""oh your skin, try this"" ""want a massage"" and it was the same shit everytime. so finally this one bitch (*for the third time that day, and honestly they could tell me apart from the other clientel, they had seen me all day, leave me alone), shes all ""where you from"" and i couldn't help but ever so maturly respond ""uranus"". After that they fucked off.

the floor has great slots. When it comes to slot play im all about the ghetto casinos. and they have my favorite top dollar machines. they rock. I wouldn't be caught dead playing a table at circus, but that's just me. 

Adventuredome: kinda lame, but as far as people under 21 are concerned, it's kinda where it's at in vegas for them.

midway: rip off, but super fun for kids. Don't be suprised when after 30 minutes you've gone through $60 on games and you have defective looking stuffed animals in your hands.

I realized this because I booked my Circus Circus stay through Hotels.com yet again and as I was checking in, the front desk clerk was extra nice and noticed that it was my birthday so she said she would give me an upgrade. When we got to our room in the West Tower, it looked exactly like what I expected and booked through hotels.com except, I was hoping for more since the front desk clerk said she would give us an upgrade. Ahhh, at last I got to the window and noticed an actual view (now there's upgrade). For the first time that I've ever booked through Hotels.com, finally I can see something other than the parking structure. 

Unfortunately, the nonsmoking room still reeked of cigarettes. I went out to purchase a bottle of Fabreze to alleviate the smell for my young asthmatic children, but ended up being unable to sleep at all that night. Happy Birthday to me. I called guest services first thing in the morning and spoke to a very kind man named Chad, who graciously moved my family to the same type of room, located at a floor on the higher level. The smell of cigarettes was gone, we had a better view and of the actual strip too (WOW), PLUS we slept much better that night. Actually we slept in all Friday, and then all through the night, missing activities outside our room.

Don't get me wrong, I understand most of Las Vegas can smell like cigarettes. But noway to where I sleep and bathe. I could have gone to any other hotel or vacation destination for that matter if my only intention was to stay in my hotel room and sleep. But because of the horrible experience we had the first night, and for a birthday getaway, we are disappointed.

Pointers would be: 
- make sure you book in the West Tower of Circus Circus if you prefer the newer and more contemporary room. 
- if you mind the smell of smoke, report it to guest services right away, rather than suffer through the night and flush your payment for that night down the toilet. 

The three stars indicating it is A-OK, is dedicated to the willingness of the guest services supervisor to work with our family. I approached the situation in a well-mannered tone, without needing to complain, and they took care of the problem courteously. I would have loved to stay an extra night because the room we were moved to provided us the rest we needed from the nightmare we experienced the evening before. Circus Circus in general is a great hotel for families. My kids enjoyed the hotel amusement and adventure activities such as Adventure Dome, the Circus games, and free Circus shows which they were only able to try out very briefly after we checking out, before going home. However, our potential third night fell on a Saturday where the rates went to a price we just couldn't risk to pay after our first night experience.",1,0,0

I normally stay at The Quad so my expectations are not that high but circus circus still didn't meet them. We stayed at circus circus manor which is actually more of a cheap motel than a casino hotel. This place smells like mildew, the walls and ceiling are super thin, it is similar to a cheap apartment I used to live in. I can loudly hear the people up stairs walking across their room. I can hear conversations and tv from the people in the room next to me. 

Lastly the location is not great. It's a long walk to anything to the point where you are either taking a cab or walking 2 miles to get to anywhere interesting. If you have to drive or cab everywhere you might as well stay off the strip in somewhere nicer that is just as inexpensive. It's cheap for a reason.",2,3,1

Here was our experience of dining at Circus Circus's Buffet:

We entered from the strip....expecting...oh...I don't know....maybe a Circus? There were several very nervous and unhappy looking ""performers"" trying (bless their hearts...) to accomplish circus acts. Unfortunately, while we were there, the Circus acts were an embarrassment for the performers (many of whom seemed untrained and somewhat desperate).

We made our way through the rather dingy and ill kept casino.....trying to find breathable amounts of uncontaminated air to breathe. The circulation system wasn't great....the cigarette stench was overpowering.

We tried some slot play....I don't think we came across any tighter slots in Nevada.

Finally....we made it over to the buffet. Well....more accurately, to the massive line for the buffet. Here we had the pleasure of standing shoulder to butt with the thronging masses...as we all crept foreword at a worm's pace...while being forced to watch television monitors which admonished us all to ""Take all of the food you want...but be sure to eat ALL of the food on your plate!""....again...and again...and again....in English and then again in Spanish...until you just wanna plunge a fork into your own heart..to kill the pain!

The food was of limited selection....basically mostly deep-fried and of questionable freshness. The service was on auto-pilot...headed for a mountain.

Bleak.

Save yourself. Go somewhere else!

Part of the reason we decided to book here was the Adventure Dome Amusement area. Nothing was ever told to us in advance about it not being open, even though we called the hotel directly about the Adventure Dome.
Complained about issues with bad A\/C and leaky shower faucet, nothing was ever fixed. This was after out first room that we were assigned had to majorly wet carpet leading from the bathroom into the main area (squished when walked upon.)
""Resort Fees"" were more expensive than the actual hotel room, and we got no benefit for the outrageous fees. (Almost $31\/night).
Clearly this is an OLD property that the ownership company no longer cares about. This property was once a Las Vegas Icon, and now it is looking like the unwanted and neglected stepchild.
Worst Las Vegas Experience EVER. We will NOT be returning to this property unless upper management gets off their backside and fixes this property.
No shuttle service, no shuttle for the Strip, no transportation services of any kind. Yes, they have free parking, but that is useless unless you drive to the property, which people flying in are not likely to be doing.
Left messages for management about problems and poor experience, had to leave several messages before finally getting a response two full weeks after our stay.

The problems with the room included,
1. An ant plague in the bathroom around the sink,
2. a previous occupant had ripped the door of the fridge and it looked like it had been that way for a long time,
3. door keys that didn't work,
4. a tap in the bathroom that you couldn't turn off and ran day and night,
5. Homeless person begging food off our plates in the restaurant while we were eating. I have compassion for homeless people but I like to eat in peace.
6. Water pouring from the roof in the corridor outside. They cut a hole in the roof to fix the leaking plumbing but left it unfinished for a week.
7. Buffet had limited choice of cold, overcooked and unhealthy food.Hotel was full of unhealthy overweight people, walking heart attacks.
8. No thought about their internal sign system. Impossible to find anything using the signs.
9. Some rude, nasty and lazy staff.
10. A 45 minute wait to check in.  We needed to do this three times due to Expedia being uncontactable. Expedia have not published my review like probably many others from ripped-off guests for this hotel.
11. The hotel faces two huge bankrupted boarded up casinos, blighting the landscape, The Fontainbleu? project, a 2.5 billion dollar project now rusting and abandoned and the Sahara Casino. It looks like downtown Detroit rather than a holiday destination.
12. Slow wi-fi that continually dropped out. Only works for email.
13. Dangerous parking garage. Poor thought about pedestrian flow for a kid oriented hotel. Something that they should fix before there is a fatality
14. Poor sound dampening in the rooms. You don't want your kid hearing what you can hear.
15. The whole place needs a massive refurbishment
16. Unhappy desperate staff.

There were lots of problems with this hotel and I can't see them staying in business. The management need to be replaced. We left early but lost our payment for the room due to what appeared to be dishonest behavior by Expedia. We called them several times to cancel our booking within the required time frame but they didn't answer the phone. I guess cancellations must happen often with this hotel and they thought they could make some money from me.Consequently I wasted a lot of time waiting on the phone and a lot of money on a hotel room that was not used. Expedia are exposing themselves to a class action related to their methods of doing business. Expedia need to replace their CEO with someone who understands how to retain customers. Someone who is not a short-term quick buck thinker. My advice is never to book through Expedia.

One of the front desk staff said to me that he receives daily ongoing complaints about Expedia and another said that he would like to see Expedia closed down so I am not alone.

However, I actually stayed there a few months ago when Hurricane Sandy prevented me from returning to DC, and I needed a cheap place to sleep for a couple of nights (read: I had no money left after getting the ""prison treatment"" from the blackjack switch tables at Bellagio).

Well, let me tell you, there is not a bear riding a bicycle under the ""big top,"" but I would rather let a similar and much larger Kodiak bear maul me publicly than to spend another night at Circus Circus.

Because it was near Halloween, the hotel was apparently running a haunted house just outside my room. So just imagine the joy it brought me to hear someone RUNNING A CHAINSAW every 30 seconds until 2:00AM. Hey, don't worry me trying to sleep, guys. Just make sure you send LEATHERFACE up to my room when he's done carving up the kids downstairs and\/or meticulously pruning the shrubs outside.

When I did venture outside of my room, I was confounded by a layout that was surely masterminded by a sadistic meerkat. Admittedly, I am not great with direction, but I also know that ""Hey Jimmy, put something together with your Legos"" would be a better design strategy than whatever was used as a blueprint for the building.

After meandering around for much longer than necessary and finally finding a place to eat, I noticed that the Mexican food restaurant in which I was standing had a faucet leaking sludge just beneath the fountain drink machine. If Erin Brockovich had been in line with me, I'm sure she would have discovered that PG&E was knowingly leaking chromium into my chimichanga.

The only upside to Circus Circus is that instead of a ""late checkout,"" you can actually pay $5-10 and stay late into the afternoon, which I suppose is preferable only to being waterboarded or watching an episode of ""Whitney.""

I was so miserable, I actually choose a red-eye flight to Charlotte followed by a seven hour drive in a rental car to DC instead of staying an extra night. It was expensive. I was exhausted. And spending a full day on the road while trying to navigate the remnants of Hurricane Sandy was not very safe.

It was still better than Circus Circus.",7,24,4

I read up on Circus Circus, and as I was on a  budget I thought heck I can do it for 8 hours ( was actually in the room for only 8.5 hours total) The price seemed right... so I thought...

Now Vegas is experiencing over 14% unemployment, at a tax rate of 10.5% which for some reason politicians never understand KILLS BUSINESS. TAXES KILL BUSINESS politicians please read and write this on the chalk board 5 thousand times!

Not only is the tax rate just insane for this place, but the fees hotels sneak in is crazy and have to be driving business away. I know it making this girl think twice before I go again. Heck I might just camp next time that's how bad it is there, I think. 

So back to CC, the actually charge you a fee for having a phone in your room... yes you read that right!! $1 gets you a phone! YIPPEE 
READ BELOW

The following mandatory hotel-imposed fees are charged and collected by the hotel either at check-in or check-out: Telephone fee: $1 per room\/night. The above list may not be comprehensive. Mandatory hotel-imposed fees may not include tax and are subject to change.

The total came to $32.34
TAX $4.39!!! Just what are you dirt bag politicians doing with our money? Paying to get spanked? Oh that's right lobbyists pay you for them to get spanked and your vote... you just buy the drugs and put it under misc. from you slush funds

Back to CC... sorry get side tracked... The beds if that is what you call them in CC. I really thought they were training me to be in the Circus to lay on a bed of nails or glass. THE SPRINGS in the MATTRESS could be felt, I think there was an 1\/8th of fabric between me and the mattress... and I have some padding on my own bones...  again I would like to point out that I am a camper, so use to sleeping on the ground. This was sleeping on harsh springy metal! OUCH ALL NIGHT. I tried to sleep on my pillows even!

The room was pretty decent in being clean and not feeling like I was going to walk away with some skin rash or worse.  I think it is a few steps up from being a total loss and that is why they are not remodeling yet.

I do have something positive to say tho. Their staff and security is great. Nice and personable folks. I had to change rooms due to a partying neighbor and they had no problem moving me and having security meet me to show me to my new room and someone bring me the new key card. My car was safe and I felt safe walking around outside.

Of course the security guard looked like he most definitely worked out and was packing a 9mm Smith and Wesson! SEXY!

I don't care if you don't act on this complain but I will not stop telling your other guests how horrible your hotel has become .  I booked july7-9 and the reservation Kya was wonderful. So even if I saw all the negative comments, I still went ahead to book $167.00 queen tower room for sat-sun. My fri-sat was free as well as my Sunday -Monday. Kya assured me that these are renovated rooms and very clean. She didn't ask for a credit card , maybe because it wasn't my first time. ? I also booked another room under my players card for sat for a friend with the same rate and gave me a reservation number, no credit card asked . We checked in Friday around 11pm, tired and exhausted. I informed the desk that I had another room booked for the next day but apparently she did not  charge that room  with my card!??? After seeing the room on the 4rth floor , I called and requested to change rooms. The carpet was filthy dirty, the pillows  smelled like sewers,  and the curtains were so dusty ! The air conditioning unit was bad and I swear I could hear everything that my next door neighbors were doing! Arghhhhh! So with no sleep , I went to the front desk around 11am the next day and asked if I can pay the other room that I reserved coz we were going out. The front desk who was very strict said they don't have any other rooms coz they were fully booked! I respected that , and went out gambling ang came back around 10pm sat for 3 things. I was in the players lane and was speaking to the front desk (Nory? ) I again requested for a change of rooms knowing that the rooms in front of me were vacant. She said it was impossible coz they were really really booked. Then I asked for the second room that I booked over the weekend. All of a sudden this woman who was around 70yrs old or older , dyed blond hair, rude , with a horrible accent and very disrespectful interrupted. She said **** it is not a guarantee to get a room even if you have a reservation number. (She was sarcastic when she said) there is no payment made so she can turn me away!!! Surely there are other hotels!!! Whaaaaattttt? (Wow, talk about loyalty to your hotel... she would rather lose a client! Than be nice! ) anyway , there was an exchange of words as I was really tired at past 10pm, I was embarrassed to my guest, afraid they wouldn't get a room and this woman , this aged front desk clerk was making a gesture that's so rude . Anyway... it was great that the manager heard us... Mary Grace  was so patient, very fluent in English (Filipina) and efficient in her job. While this was going on.... another guy was screaming at that same aged, rude blond woman because She was really rude! Wow! 
I know the management has a union but please take this woman away from the front desk! After all, they are the first ones to face the client. Pls ask manager Mary grace what her name was! In less than 30 mins... 2 customers were upset with the same lady! I'm afraid one day she'll meet a customer who'll do something more than just get upset! (You know what I mean when provoked?!) Oh Noooooooooooo, warning ! Warning ! 
It didn't help that even when I was moved to another room on the same floor, it had he same issue. Smelly carpets, dirty, no A\/C, stuck up shower....rm456, room 417, and 423. I almost recorded the conversation of my next door neighbor at 1am Sundayit was that clear! 
So yes... what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas , even the bedbugs should stay in your hotel. 
I respectfully ask that you investigate and re train your front desk clerk especially this aged-blond-woman-with an accent  who is very disrespectful.

We had to go directly to parking structure  and lug all luggage 1\/4 Mile to check in because they wouldn't let us drop at the curb. I am just about ready to take the loss and go to the Palms.

I am writing an edit to my review. After talking to valet in the morning, Clark, who was so helpful, said to get to valet when I returned to park and he would make sure I was taken care of. I should ask for Shawn, who was also very helpful. I had a place in valet. I told Clark that it was nice this trip to have something done for me and not to me. Props go out to them and all of the hard working valet.  MANY THANKS. For this I am giving 5 stars to valet. My original rating on the hotel itself still stands because of how we were treated.

Biggest mistake of my life.

The room wasn't TOO bad except the ripped up pillow on the couch and the fact that it smelled like skunk\/weed as soon as you walked into the room. (Non-smoking too, btw). I loved that the bathroom was kind of separated from the room, but other than that, nothing was all that special.

One night we asked for 4 towels, and I don't know WHAT happened, but 40 minutes later, we had to call again to see what was going on because still we had no towels.

When we called again, they said OK, and we got a call a few minutes later. Someone asked, ""Did you ask for a fridge?"" Uh, NO? We asked for towels.

So a few minutes later, someone knocks, and guess who\/what is at our door. Maintenance... With a mini fridge, being dragged by the cord.

???????!?!?!?

I don't even know.

We told him we asked for TOWELS, not a FRIDGE, which sounds NOTHING alike, and he came back with THREE towels, and 2 washcloths.

Whatever...

We also checked out the pool with were filled with a bunch of kids splashing about and I got bit by spiders :( Drinks were nice at the cabana, only $5.99 for the slushy-type drink and you can fill it with whatever you want.

Almost everything about the circus circus experience was horrible.

From check-in to check-out.  

Our room was so old and outdated, the tv must have only been 18 inches (non flat screen), and there was dust all over it!!!  The plug jacks were falling out of the walls, we had a non-smoking room that was obviously never really a non smoking room.  And I hate to sound crude, but the shower curtain had poop on it, like someone used it after they ran out of toilet paper (and no it wasn't us)The customer service at this hotel was the worst I have ever ever experienced in my life.  Rude, not helpful, mean ugh I could go on.  And it was every employee i encountered was this way....maybe thats how they train them??? 

There is NO ventilation in this hotel....Normally its expected but in such a kid friendly environment I would think it would be better.....the kids arcade was just of old stale smoke!!!  My son couldn't breath and ended up very sick !!! I, myself am a smoker and my lungs hurt from all the smoke and no ventilation. 

Room service got our order wrong, the Mexican restaurant got our order wrong.  The billions of sales people stalking you all over the whole hotel was out of control.

I could go on and on for days about certain situations while here but i would never have enough time......I will never ever go back to this hotel again and if I were anyone thinking of going I would re think it.....especially if you have young kids or kids with asthma or respiratory issues.

The outside looks pretty crappy, mainly because it's old. It's at the end of the strip so it's kind of far from the main hotels. The inside doesn't look too bad though. The casino is okay. We stayed on the second floor (nonsmoking) and the room was surprisingly nice. I heard that there are pictures of clowns in some of the rooms so I was very glad our room had none. The beds were comfortable but the pillow I was laying on felt very weird. I was able to sleep on it but when I felt it, it felt as if they got chunks of cotton and threw them in there. The other pillows felt normal though. There are no fans in the bathroom so you can hear whatever business is being done inside. The water took a while to drain too so the sink flooded once because I wasn't paying attention. The bathtub takes a while to drain too but not when the shower head is on. There aren't enough outlets either. We had to unplug 3 different lamps in order to charge our phones. There's no fridge either so I had to throw away my OJ and it was just a hassle to keep getting ice to keep our drinks cold. Check-in is at 3pm and if you want to check-in earlier, you have to pay an additional $35. That sucks because we got there early and since we were tired, we had no choice but to. My friends told me they never paid an early check-in fee before at other hotels. Check-out is at 11am and when we asked for a later check-out, they said it'd be a $10 charge + tax so we left. I never had to pay for a late check-out if it was only an hour later. I don't know if I would ever stay here again. We'll just have to see.

Make sure to bring an extension cord and some Febreeze or something. 

It's entertaining for kids though as they have a trapeze artists performing at a certain time. They also have an arcade too. 

The McDonald's here.. EHHHHH. The FIRST thing I ordered was a small OJ. It was like $1.99. I ordered a hash brown and a sausage and egg biscuit after. I pay the girl, go to pick up my order, and there's no OJ. I tell the person who gave me my food and after going to the girl who took my order, she comes back and says, ""it'll be $2.50."" Uh. WTF? I ask if it wasn't put in and they both say no with this unfriendly look and tone. I told her I don't want it and left. Augh.",0,0,0

Didn't think we'd be able to get anything even remotely close to the Strip, but Circus Circus was miraculously not full yet. It definitely cost more than I would pay for an average last-minute weekend hotel stay, but for a night-of reservation in Vegas AND the fact that it was within walking distance to the Strip? I'd say it was definitely worth it. 

We were put in little buildings across a small street from the actual resort, kind of an over-flow situation, I think. All things considered, it was fine. The room was not immaculate, but it was definitely clean enough. I wasn't grossed out or anything like that, it was just obviously a little old and dated. It was not super nice, but it was definitely nice enough. We were comfortable sleeping there and it was just what we needed it to be for our little night-in-Vegas stop during a cross-country road trip.

Absolutely the worst place to book when you're planning on leaving in rave outfits to EDC everyday. I've never had so many dirty looks. 

It's a strange kids\/adults hotel. The Casino in Circus Circus is disgusting, all the slots were grimy, the waitresses that offer you alcohol were in their 50's but wearing a push up bra (so gross). The Black Jack and Poker tables are just as bad, super rude dealers that actually snapped at me for not having my id out when I went over to one. 

All the places to eat either sounded disgusting or were disgusting. The Steak House is suppose to be good but it was never open so I didn't have a chance. 

The Buffet, disgusting over cooked food, everything tastes bland or greasy. 
The Deli where the casino is, old fruit platters that are rotten, sandwiches made sloppy and taste worse than Subway. 

I was in the main tower and the rooms are so cramped. It's what I'd expect to see at a Motel 6 in the fact it's like they shoved a bed in a hallway.

As for rooms, they're spacious and comfortable. Only thing I would complain about is it's lack of bathroom items. Only a small squeeze tube of shampoo for a room for two and a squeeze tube of lotion. Oh, and a Lego looking soap bar that doesn't smell that great. I haven't stayed in many hotels in LV, so this may be average.

The entire back of my Mom's legs were scratchy, she put it down to some allergy that she might have contacted during one of the tours we took. I also had scratchy bumps on my face. Since there are no mosquitoes in US, I started searching the bed for any insect and just 3 days before my return, I discovered a bed bug in the morning, smashed it on the floor rug, and when my Mom tried to lift it from the rug, there was some fresh blood on her hands. 
We informed the house-keeping and the Main Desk. They sent up 2 Ladies from the Staff for the survey and they asked us to move to another room. Since, we couldn't take the time off for a shift, we asked the nice lady, Felix, to spring clean our room while we are on the Strip. Felix did a wonderful job, replaced all sheets, cleaned the room, did the bed, the bath very sincerely. But, bed bugs usually dig themselves into the bed frame and mattress and even in the carpets, so that was just a temporary thing. 
During checkout, when we requested compensation for the unsanitary condition of the room, we were directed to their risk management cell, which we have contacted after returning as I did not want to miss my flight then. The bite marks, especially on the backside of my mother's both legs are severe and scratchy and she is taking medical treatment. They told me that a formal report needs to be filed by their Security Division and was surprised that while we were staying in the Hotel no one told us to do the same. 
Point is, if the rooms have bedbugs, its way too much to pay $100 per day to just use it for sleeping at night and that too suffering from insect bites. Not to mention, if some of them manage to find their way into our luggage, we might end up building a colony of them right in our home. Instead of expediting such a serious issue, the Circus Circus management is busy pushing the buck to other departments.
I have stayed in so many 3-5 star Hotels in Maryland and never faced a BedBug problem. The Hotel needs to burn their mattresses and have their beds and carpets go through an extermination drill in order to make the stay of Guests comfortable at Nights.

Or that there are kids there. Or anything related to other guests. So you shouldn't base your review off other people. 

That being said, I had a great time staying here. I did take the advice of yelp, and avoided the manor rooms like the plague. I booked through their website and reserved a Casino Tower room with a king bed. I arrived sometime around 3, and after a short line I was checked in. They charged me $190 for three nights and told me that the deposit I had paid was separate than the total cost and that it was actually $240 for the three nights. Meh. Okay whatever. Not too happy about it but I was tired and just wanted to get checked in. They gave me a coupon book, and a map with instructions to get to my room. 

When I got to my room I was expecting a kinda shabby but hopefully clean place. I didn't get that. I got a nice room with a couple chairs, a table, a nice TV, a safe, and a huge bed that was pretty comfy. Inspecting the room I did't see any bugs or signs of dirtiness. Inside of the bathroom was the coffee maker, a tub and shower, a toilet, a sink with a mirror and a hair dryer as well as clean towels, soap and shampoo. Having walked around all day and traveled overnight the first thing I wanted to do was take a shower. The shower does take a little bit to warm up...but after a minute or two, I had a nice hot shower ready with good water pressure.  The next day when I came back from being out my room was very nicely done... they even folded up the blanket I had for when I was traveling and put my stuffed bear in the middle of the bed by the pillows. There was clean towels. Definitely not any complaints about housekeeping. 
However, I did get woken up a bit early one of my three nights because of construction going on.... not sure if that is the hotel's fault or not though. 

I prefer to checkout at the checkout counter, and when I did they were confused on why I was charged $50 too much and refunded it to me. The checkout took maybe 5 minutes at most. 

So overall I'd probably stay here again if I came back. The minus one star is because if I hadn't done the checkout at the counter I would've been charged $50 too much which is pretty much enough for another night.",14,1,2

Staying on the Strip on the weekend has prices that rival Manhattan!  If it's Sun-thurs, then you can afford to go to the bling bling hotels because the prices are usually 1\/3 or 1\/4 of fri\/sat night prices.  However, if you want to stay on the strip, be prepared to pay up for something nice.

If you came far enough to fly into Vegas (AKA not close enough to drive in) then dish out some more money to stay at a nicer place. This place is perfect for those of us who are either broke, have kids, or would rather stay somewhere cheap so they can spend the money eating out at Bellagio or watching shows like O. Or those of us close enought to drive out here 3-4 times a year and don't want to spend $1000's on hotel a year because we're not ballers who can get comp rooms at the nice places.  Seriously.  Anyways, who sleeps in Vegas anyways? If you sleep, then dish out the money and stay somewhere nicer.  Remember, those nice hotels have 100's of millions of dollars worth of debt in building them. No wonder it's $200-$500 a night to stay there on a weekend. If you want a good deal, don't come on a weekend or holiday.  (Yes, you can stay at places like Monte Carlo for $60 a night... but ONLY S-Thurs on promotion!!!)

Yes, this is a 2-3 star hotel, but I'm giving it a 4 because there are too many one star rating from dreamers who think they can stay somewhere nice on the strip for under $100 on the weekend. Dream on. Also, the extra star if for the great midway for those of us who don't gamble.  And an extra star for finding out I can get a room for friday and saturday night for a grand total of $215 four days before I leave for vegas.  Do I want to spend $550 to stay at Bellagio?

As we pulled up to Valet.. there is a very large sign on the Valet booth... parking is now $15.00 per day.  As the Valet came to the car. I asked him if that included paid hotel guests.. Yes indeedy it does!...Shame on you MGM!..Not only is that a greedy act.. but you are also screwing the Valets out of tips! Which I know it is considered a tipping position and they are nailed on it on their taxes. but yet dont even now get near what the State thinks they do due to your charges on parking. so not only do you screw over a long time patron.. but your employees too.  Of course I tipped .. both arriving and leaving.  But I know alot of people do not do so now due to the charges for Hotel Guests as well.. Our room in the Casino tower was clean when we arrived but during the stay.. although we did get maid service (whom we tipped daily also) You could tell all they did was wipe up water on the shower walls and sinks.  Made the beds hastily.. no vacuuming... only one trash can emptied..We asked for two extra pillows and one blanket... waited four hours to receive it. after two phone calls to housekeeping of ""we have been waiting...""  and assurances of ""it will be right up!"" and if you are a stayover you wont be serviced till well into the afternoon. One recommendation... Dont eat the Dinner Buffet.. Ick...But the brunch buffet was actually better than I anticipated. Unless things change here I wont be returning. Not that Im a cheapskate. but some of the Perks that drew me to this place are gone...even to the booklets offering discount coupons. Shame on you MGM",0,0,1

If you are looking for luxury there are so many more options.  This is just a straight-up old-school Vegas hotel.  Good enough for me.  I stayed in the Manor and will come back.  I appreciated the circus performances inside the casino.  I also like how I can easily get to Downtown from Circus Circus.  Getting to the meat of the Strip and getting Downtown is like equidistant in opposite directions, so I prefer Circus Circus and the Stratosphere when I come to Vegas.  But if I were looking for Luxury I would probably stay somewhere like the Cosmopolitan, etc.  But Circus Circus allows a person like me who doesn't make a lot of money to come to Vegas regularly and enjoyably.  So for that, I salute Circus Circus.  Good job!  And I like this part of the Strip too because it is a little more authentic than the rest of the Strip.  Less Touristy.  A little more like I imagine Vegas used to be like.  Go explore the Downtown area by continuing North from Circus Circus on Las Vegas Boulevard.  Go ahead and walk.   It may get a little dodgy at points, but its not that bad.  I did it myself and I was fine.  Just don't look like a mark.  It's worth it.  The buffet is great at Circus Circus too!  I felt like I got good value for the price at the buffet.  I hear the steakhouse is great too from people I've talked to.  I'll try that when I come back.",0,0,0

I booked the hotel based on price never being in las vegas before. After reading the yelp reviews after booking, I was terrified. Horrified images came to mind like bed bugs and musky smells.

It turned out fine. A simple double bedroom with no frills. No couch, no kettle, no coffee maker, no fridge. I was in the highrise tower with complimentary parking conveniently located next to the tower.

There was an additional resort fee of 7.95 per night in addition to my vacation package. I knew beforehand so I was fine with the fee. It included internet which was a must for me, and worked with no hitches.",0,1,1

To call Circus Circus a dump is an insult to all the other establishments who have worked hard to earn their rank as a dump.  From the lobby and the hallways, to your room, dirt and stains from Origins Unknown is the motif.  Rooms have peeling paint, loose and dirty caulking in the bathrooms and stains top to bottom.  Beds are flimsy, and the linens filthy.  And as an added perk, you can hear people using their bathrooms when you walk down the hallway.

Most of the clientle  (who come in all shapes, sizes and colors) look like they are on work release.  The smoking that these demons do with their children in tow (in a ""family friendly"" casino) makes the Bhopal Union Carbide Gas Leak Massacre look like a guppy fart.  Definitely a place for kids if you feel like putting the fear of G-d and cancer into the rugrats.

Most of the gift shops push imitation ""bling"".  We're talking pasty diamonds in the shape of a Mercedes Benz logo medallion strung on a chain and Yankee caps with multi color rocks sewn in the logo.  One can Over Gold (electroplate of course) quite easily.  Very plastic slip-cover clientele, serious fucking Ghetto.

The in-house restaurants are horrid.  Not one reaches mediocre.  A humorous antic-dotal of serving Mrs. Beasley's cat for an entree would apply, but I have a feeling other restaurants who do sneak in fried cat and other vermin on the plate, prepare it much better.

This doesn't mean Circus Circus is like Riker's Island.  Riker's has cleaner rooms, cleaner sheets and better food.   I advise you not to drop the soap when you shower.  Not because you'll be gang raped (although who knows who will break in)  but because your soap has hit the tub floor and must therefore be destroyed so as not to spread infectious disease.  Stand under the spillways of Hoover Dam instead.",3,9,2

The good:

- Fast check-in, free room upgrade (for us).
- Plenty of extras ($20 food\/beverage, $10 slots) and amenities.
- Clean, above-average rooms.
- Lots of restaurants, shops and games.
- Few kids (in the middle of January).
- More open gambling tables than you'll likely find at other casinos.
- Cost.

The bad:

- A\/C will keep the room cold, but the fan won't stay on and is kind of loud when it does.
- Adventuredome was closed for repairs during our entire stay.
- Parking is very confusing\/inconvenient.
- Buffet is mediocre and overpriced.
- Distance from the heart of the strip.

The ugly:

- The people who immediately try to scam you with timeshare presentations when you walk in.
- That creepy 70s neon clown sign.

Summary: Un-cleaned rooms. Keys that don't work. Incompetent front desk staff. Riff raff guests. 

Long version: We should have suspected it was going to be an unpleasant stay as soon as the check in process began. There was a long wait and only a few staff actively working the front desk. Once we finally were able to check in, we were told that we could not add an extra cot\/bed to the room even though our request for one had been confirmed. We were told that it is illegal to put an extra bed in any of the rooms with two queens\/kings. Obviously, we did not want the hotel to break any laws, but they should ensure that the websites their customers use to book their rooms through do not allow guests to pick an option to add an extra bed if it is in fact illegal. Mishap #1.

We then arrive at our rooms. We had requested two adjacent\/attached rooms, which we were given. While the keys worked for one room, the second set of keys did not work for the other. Mishap #2. Fortunately (or so we thought) the inner door between our adjoining rooms was open. Once we went into the second room however, were we met with the 3rd mishap. It was disgusting. Beds not made, wet towels on the floor, toothpaste\/makeup caked in the sink, diapers in the trash, wrappers and soda cans everywhere. 

We called down to the front desk. We spoke to Francisco. Instead of letting us finish explaining what was the matter, he would talk over us, making incorrect\/incomplete assumptions about our complaint. When he finally shut up and let us speak, we had to repeat ourselves several times because he was not fully comprehending. We just needed 1- new working keys for the adjoining room 2- someone to come clean the adjoining room (that simple....). Because we were not communicating well with Francisco, we asked to speak to someone else. He said he would transfer us to a supervisor. For 5 minutes no one picked up the transfer call. We hung up and then re-called the front desk. Francisco answered again. Great. We explained no one picked up the transfer call. His response was ""oh I'm not sure if any supervisor is there."" Why would you transfer us to a supervisor.... If you didn't know if anyone was there to pickup???? Mishap #4. 

Since apparently Francisco was who we had to deal with, seeing as no supervisor seemed to be available, we once again re-explained the situation. He said he could try to call housekeeping and see if they could come clean it. We asked for an estimate for how long that would take because we wanted to go to bed relatively soon as we had an early wake up the next morning. He said he could not give us a time estimate. Since he was not sure if any housekeeping was on staff and what their availability was, we requested instead to just switch rooms. Of course, no more adjoining rooms were available. So we asked if we could just keep the clean room we had and switch the dirty adjoining room to a different one that was at least on the same floor (we have children, older but still would like to have them relatively close for both safety and convenience). Francisco said there was one more with 2 queens left on our floor. Fine we'll take it. It was literally the last room all the way at the opposite end of the building, but we were both too exhausted and frustrated to continue this phone bantering. We asked them to bring up 3 keys for the new room. 

The keys were brought up by Mike. We asked him to come with us to the new room, which he grumbled about because ""I'm just the bell hop and I don't control if you can switch rooms if you don't like this one."" My reply was that we didn't only want to check to make sure this room was clean, but also if our keys worked so that if they didn't he could bring them back down to get us new ones without us having to call the front desk and waste another 15 minutes. 2 keys worked, 1 did not. Mishap #5. We were pissed and our energy was spent at that point to even wait for Mike to get us a working 3rd key. We would deal. The room smelled musty and damp, but we were tired and it at least looked like it had been cleaned after its last guests. 

Tips about rooms themselves: As previous comments have mentioned it seems the Manor buildings house the worst of the hotel's accommodations. They are across the street from the casino\/front desk. There are only 2 open outlets in each room. Bathroom has a pretty poor venting system. Wifi is available but only in the rooms. 

When we thought we could finally lay down, we were met with the sounds of screaming and arguing outside in the hallways. Finally through babies crying next door, we got to sleep. When we woke up in the morning, eager to leave, in our building's main entrance was a drunk man making obscene noises and crawling (literally crawling) up and down the stairs. Guess we will take the elevator.

I guess some people don't mind, or can afford to drop a couple hundred per night on a room. This place might not be as modern as some of the other places on the strip, but I found it to be very nice and affordable on any budget. I just don't see paying a lot on a room when you're only there to shower and sleep. At $31.00 a night, you can't beat that, especially being so close to everything else on the strip. I'd rather spend $31 a night on a room and have more money to have a good time.

while i have indeed experienced much better, comparing this hotel to the other low budget hotels in vegas, it wasnt too bad at all. its definitely really crowded, but the front desk agents move pretty quickly and check in was smooth and quick.  we did have a little trouble finding our rooms because we thought we were in the manor rooms (which are separate from the hotel and have its own parking lot), but we were actually in the tower, so we did quite a bit of walking back and forth. haha but that was our fault.

the room itself is pretty ghetto, but i mean for $20 a night, it definitely served its purpose for our one night spontaneous trip to vegas with my friends and it was fairly clean. im glad i can now say that ive stayed at some of the best.. and some of the not so great.. hotels. really makes you appreciate putting in that extra $30 to stay somewhere nicer.  but it IS really close to the wynn\/encore, which is where i find myself partying all the time, so cab fare is cheap!",4,5,4

We were robbed- inside of our room- while we were in it!


I was sleeping in my underwear since the building is hot and was totally exposed while this was happening in a space that is suppose to be secure.

When the security came he took our statements and gave us information to contact a third party of Circus Circus and that maybe they'll be able to help us more. I requested the hotel manager to come speak with us and the security manager came instead with no more information than the first man.

Not much food options at this spot as well. Thy bf and I ended up walking out of here for food.

After reading all the reviews about the hotel, steakhouse, and all things negitive. I still booked at Circus Circus because of the package at the Chapel of the Fountain. 

1. The chapel was beautiful and the renewal was done with every option I asked for. Maria was a great help and made sure everything went well.

2. The steakhouse was the best....I have been trying to recreate the steak I ate to no success....It was cooked to pefection. The free bottle of wine was a great complement to the meal. The garlic mashed potatoes and veggies. They also gave me free chocolate cake on account of my vow renewal..It was just okay, but how do you complain over something that was free.

3. My room was the best...we stayed in the whirlpool suite which had a fridge which was great because I was able to buy a case of pop instead of spending 3.50 for one. It was also cleaned    everytime I requested. 

4.The Adventuredome Roller Coasters were better than Cedar Point which I go to every year. I think this is because your inside of a building so they were scary. I loved it..

There was a few things that I didn't like so that is why I only gave 4 stars.

1. The people that hound you about a timeshare. After staying a week I was done with the harrasment. 

2. The children in the gaming areas were a surprising shock.

3. It was a far walk to everything besides CVS and McDonalds.

4.There was also an electronics festival going on and it was half naked young men\/women everywhere. 

These are the only things that bothered me. I had a wonderful time and would go back without a thought because I have seen Circus Circus with my own eyes and I know its a great deal.

To be fair, I stayed in one of the (most) recently remodeled rooms in the West Tower. This gave me easy access to the hotel lobby and the cab line, although it put me pretty far back from the Strip. However, if you're staying here, you're probably going to be taking cabs a lot, as it's easily a 30-minute walk to anything that's not the Riviera.

I only stayed at CC for about 36 hours, but I wouldn't have minded staying longer, especially with a big group. There's plenty to do here - penny slots, cheap blackjack, bars and restaurants. If you want to use the Deuce bus that runs up and down the Strip and to Downtown, there's a stop with easy access.

Our stay was perfectly fine aside from the issues we experienced with the door to our room. Evidently the door didn't always lock whenever the door shut (the security later made this sound like a common problem) so when we were gone, the door was basically open to anyone to come in. 
We came back after clubbing on Saturday night to discover that we didn't even need to use the key to get inside and that many of our items had been stolen (Coach bag, Michael Kors wallet, cologne, clothing, curling&straightening irons, make up, boots, jewelry, credit cards, and my backpack with all my notes for school -_-) 
We contacted the security who basically offered us nothing other than an incident report. They wouldn't check their security cameras or confirm if they even had any, while the hotel didn't offer any sort of compensation. Only the maintenance came to repair the door in the morning and told us ""at least this won't happen again"" uhmm, cool thanks? We were leaving and all our stuff was already gone.
My friends and I all tried contacting the hotel on repeated occasions. I was never able to speak to a manager, and like my friends, was instead directed to ""risk management"" who wouldn't claim responsibility for the fact that the reason we had been robbed was because THEIR door was broken. 
Even worse, when speaking with the security, they described how frequently ""door pushers"" come through the hotel and push on the doors of the rooms to see if they will open since they oftentimes don't lock as they should. 

TLDR; The room wasn't bad at all, beds were comfy, buuuut that doesn't make up for the fact that hotel is not a safe environment and your room will be vulnerable to intruders.

Beds were soft it was your basic room with the exception of no icebox which was fine considered when your in Vegas you don't spend much time in the room. The hotel features:
Pool
Shopping 
Gambling 
4 restaurants 
Nail salons
It's on theme park equipped with roller coasters,
Shows for kids an much more. 
 It's also located kinda in the middle of the strip not to far from all the action either way you walk. An trust me you will be doing a lot of that. Its also located right where a 24\/7 bus stop is just incase you don't really feel like hurting your feet from walking constantly day and night. I think if I do go back to Vegas again I would stay here.",7,0,0

When the Las Vegas strip was still the Las Vegas strip (let's say pre-1990); when it was a flagging, sagging, ultimate kitsch and unmatched destination for anyone from the downtrodden, to the rat-pack high rollers, mafiosos and Winnebago set, I came here with my parents to blow through for a night, enjoy the scene, take in some hotels and see what the place was all about. My parents and I had just come from a drive-through of Death Valley (a whole other story, for sure), and we checked into none other than The Flamingo, aka, the original hotel of William Wilkerson and Bugsy Siegel, and first outpost in this dry, middle-of-nowhere desert experiment and nascent empire.  The hotel was definitely updated from the original, but probably not by much. I believe it was owned by Sheraton at the time. Props to Bugsy, who met his untimely demise in a hail of bullets, largely because of his dealings at The Flamingo. 

After checking in, we made our way down the strip by car, and as you looked way down the boulevard, all you could see was a collage of neon with brands familiar to those at the time, Sands, Sahara, Caesar's, Dunes and others. One sign dripped into another, making it hard to distinguish which sign was nearer or further, but creating this magical electric landscape that is unmatched by anything up to then or since. Along our route, we stopped into Circus Circus, where my parents doled out $5 in quarters for me to crank into the pinball machines on the second level of the tent (no longer in use), while they pumped their own respective $5 each into the nickel slots. Yes, my teetotaler parents were also high rollers.

Them days were magic. That neon collage is burned into my mind, but alas, that place called Las Vegas is no more.  Now, the city is the home to conglomerates, with one gi-normous multi-thousand room hotel connecting to another, and a competition as to who will have the latest, the most glamorous and the most outrageous concept, the best restaurant, the most Gucci\/Ferrgamo\/LV stores packed into their weird indoor\/outdoor mall that's supposedly meant to transport you to Paris\/Greece\/New York\/wherever. It's a little much. That's Vegas for ya, right?

Few places in Vegas retain even the slightest vestige of those years gone by, but Circus Circus is one of them. The unabashed cheez-whiz veneer envelopes an interior that bursts with Velveeta-y goodness. I'm sure the rooms are seedy; I'm more than sure that staying here might not be the best idea if you want luxury, but Circus Circus delivers on so many levels, it's hard to even describe. To me it's de rigeuer on your Las Vegas hotel tour. Don't expect the Bellagio fountain show here, though. This is a horse of a different color, but absolutely positively brilliant in its own way.

To wit the following:

* Mutant bartender at the bar all the way in the back, dressed in cheez-tastic bartender outfit that hearkens back somewhere in the range of fifty years.
* $1 Jello shots in your choice of flavors: red, orange, yellow, purple.
* Same said $1 Jello shots pulled from the refrigerator and served to you in, yes, believe it or not, plastic Solo cups replete with cover for portability.
* Very obvious hooker sitting at the bar waiting for customers. The convergence of heroin un-chic, bad tattoos and massive cleavage were something to behold -- and ultimately make you want to spray yourself with Lysol and Febreeze.
* Harlequins-on-acid mural at the top of the escalators in the back that are hard to even imagine painting, let alone commissioning and approving.
* $4 bedazzled light blue (and white as an alternative) t-shirts that have Circus Circus emblazoned across the front in the old school style.

This is barely scratching the surface of this gem. Folks, if you walked into this place without irony, you got what you deserved. You don't get it, and I feel dramatically sorry for you.

For the rest of you who have some nostalgia for what Las Vegas really should be, what it used to be, and what it no longer is, this is where you can find it.  A must-see. FIVE FREAKIN' STARS, BITCHES.",9,15,9

If this is your lodging of choice in Vegas, you'll appreciate it far more if you use the ducats you save on room and board to fund a complete and total 24\/7 bender.  You won't care nearly as much about how dingy the place is, and you may find unintended humor in the following:

1) there is actually an RV campsite associated with the hotel.  Right on the strip. This contributes to the unusual and entertaining mix of people from all different walks of life at the casino.

2) the official mascot is a clown named Lucky, whose ugly mug is plastered throughout the hotel.

3) there's a 24 hour long ""circus"" act performance right in the middle of the casino.  Too bad they don't have live bears and lions - hilarity would ensue if one escaped and ate 30 senior citizens at the slots.

4) the steakhouse, which seems to have taken its decor cues from a '70's porn movie, is rumored to be the best in Vegas.  

5) there's an amusement park right in the hotel, complete with a roller coaster and carnival games.

If I managed this joint, I would turn things around by requiring all employees to dress in full clown regalia (including casino dealers) and install a strip club where the performers were also required to wear clown attire (at least at first).  If business didn't pick up immediately, you'd at least then have an excuse to follow some of the suggestions in the other reviews about tearing the place down and building a new hotel (or parking lot).",0,1,2

At least 1 time each year and occasionally 2 x a year. This visit we had company. My brother in law and his wife. They are in their 60's and I was trying to help save them money ao I suggested Circus Circus.  BOY was I DISAPPOINTED!!!!!! 
Check in was great,  1st in line at the VIP area, lady behind counter had awesome personality and she was quick.  That was the best of the week.
I booked reservation 8 weeks in advance. Prepaid for everything ( 2 rooms). I requested Casino tower, a high up floor and close to elevator and single bed. 
We did get Casino tower,  not too high up, 10th floor, and the kast room furthest away from elevator  x 2 rooms. Okay. I can deal with it.. 
Upon entering room, we inspected it and found mold in the bathroom and hair wirh black specks in tub. This is unacceptable!! So we changed rooms. Okay on we go. We were hete in March 2017, now they gave removed all the mini fridges and coffee pots. You have to request and pay extra for fridge , WHAT!!
The coffee pots have been removed due to an accident in a room that could have resulted in a lawsuit. Okay.. now I am frustrated. 
Still, we deal with it..  Guest services did comp us 2 x fridges since we had to change a room. 
Now, last full  day there, we left early for our function. Forgot our tickets and had to go back. Hubby says, run up to room and get them. A long sprint I assure you.  I sprint up to room only to find out my card key does not work. SH#$%%^T!! However, housekeeping in in the hall and I ask if she can let me in.. No is her response. Okay I get it. Soo she calls security to help. I wait 10 min and they arrive. Leisurely chattering. We walk all the way down to room, as they say, may we see your ID..I dont have it, its in the car, which my hubby is driving around the block in. Sorry ma'am we cant help you. Soo at this point, must go downstairs to guest services for help. I get to elevator,  push the buttons and hear all sorts of banging noises and the doors wont open. I wait 6 min then finally 1 if the 3 elevator doors open with maintenance inside. He says, this car is not working but I can go ahead and take it down for you. I am hoping this was a kind gesture not sarcasm. Now, 30 min later I am bCk downstairs at guest services. They will not let me in either.. No ID on me. Soooo, I ask for a manager. She pulls up room info, verifies my personal info and still hesitant. Soo my saving grace was that I memorized my reservation #. NOW  I get a rekeyed card!!! Yes!! I trek all the way back to room, get my tickets and head back down to hubby who has now been driving around for 40 min. That was last straw. We will not ( after 10 yrs) be coming back here. This hotel has other issues and they are spiraling down quickly. Stay elsewhere and get your moneys worth!!!!",1,1,0

Now it's one of the older casinos\/hotels on the strip so take that into account. Location next to a paused casino development doesn't help the cause either as this only makes it feel further away from the other big name casinos than it really is.

The check in staff were OK, flat out dealing with what looked to be a bus load of recent arrivals so fair play. The staff at the box office for shows were shocking, not in the mood for answering questions about the shows like when and where they were on and prices for different ones, times and days only interested in selling you a ticket

Now whilst I did get one of the cheaper room deals but was at least hoping for a bar fridge as it was April and quite warm which would have been nice to have a cool place to keep water
The air con system whilst working very very efficiently was noise so could really watch TV and relax. Also the walls were thin. Thin enough that I could tell what the next room was watching on their TV - solution flick thru until you find what they have on and mute it.

The casino still allows smoking inside which I think most do but being Australian and currently living in the UK with long existing smoking bans for indoor public places this was difficult to acclimatise too as I was needing to wash the smell out of my clothes before it spread thru by whole bag

The staff I talked to on the gaming floor where incredible helpful and polite and given I was a newbie to all this more than happy to talk me thru the rules of the game and how the gambling worked and didn't have any issue if I just watched for a few hands\/rounds

I checked in on Jan 2 around 11:00 pm, and after I was about to go to sleep, I found my pillow case dirty (some brown spot on it), I called the room service and a nice lady said she will have someone give me a new one. probably half an hour later someone showed up, just delivered the new pillow case to me, without even asking me if I need help switching it. I know it was late at night, but hey, I still think they should ask if they can help.

Then next morning when I washed up, I found lip stick stain on the first towel, and brown spots on the second and third towels ,which was really not what I expected.  I ended up threw them on the floor and went to the manager to complain.

One thing I need to clarify is, I booked it through Priceline, and they put me in the motel style Manor building so I cannot speak for people who live in the Towers. 

Anyway, I went to front desk to ask the manager if this was pretty normal for a three starts hotel. The manager was really nice, said sorry,waived my resort fee, and switched me to another room in Manor (He is the reason that I give a two star instead of one). However, when I stepped into the second room, I saw BIG STAIN on both of the beds. I had no choice but turned back to the front desk again. Another manager talked to me this time, and I felt like I was treated as a second second class citizen. I showed her the pictures I took on my bed, asking her if there is anything she can do for me, maybe a upgrade or switch to the Tower (which is the same\/similar price base on their website) and I am willing to pay. She was very impatient, and told me there is nothing she can do for me, and I am not getting an upgrade. I know there is a big event going on, and probably all the rooms are overbooked, but come on, at least tell me that you are sorry before you told me that I am not going to get an upgrade?  By looking at her face, and listening to her tone, I feel like I should be the one who apologizes because I brought her some trouble. But you know it is not really my fault that both of the rooms I checked in are in unacceptable situation. I asked for an upgrade the second time but not the first time is because I was trying to be nice and thought the first room was just an isolation issue. After checking out two rooms, I got the idea about this Manor building and asked for an update. I think this is really reasonable but I got a big NO NO without the manager feeling sorry for this situation. 

Anyway, I got switched into ANOTHER room because the second manager told me that asking house keeping to change my bed sheet will take a long time. I will suck it up with the third room since I am leaving tomorrow anyways so I guess I can live. But this is really not my expectation from a 3 star hotel on Strip, nor to match any hoteling experience I had in Las Vegas before.",2,1,1

The rooms in the West Tower are decent since they have been renovated in the last couple years. The hotel is still technically on The Strip, but it is a bit of a walk to the center of The Strip. I'm pretty active so it wasn't an issue, but it can be for those who are not able to walk long distances, especially with how hot it can get out there.

Every time we check in the staff seems so annoyed. It's probably because of the overload of people vs staff, but still not excusable for someone trying to enjoy their vacation. Plus, the very last time we stayed there (about a month ago), our room wasn't even done being cleaned (the cleaning lady didn't put the covers back on the beds and there was a large garbage bag laying in the middle of the room). We went back downstairs and got an apology and a new room, but then after the new room was assigned we were told how we could have gotten a deluxe room upgrade. Then she hastily said we can use it next time... Why not offer it to us now especially since we just had to come back down to switch rooms anyway??? 

The lobby is always a disaster zone. I have walked through many hotels on the Strip and it never seems as chaotic in other places as it does at Circus Circus (lots of kids running around). I think they need to hire more staff to get the lines going more quickly for check-ins\/out. Walking through the lobby towards the back where the casino is just gets worse. The hallway is too narrow for the amount of people that are trying to get themselves and their suitcases to the elevators and the rest of the crowd trying to get to the restaurants and casino. Again, I don't experience this at any other hotels on the Strip. However, I would say that this is a good option for families with younger kids as they do have an arcade game area upstairs as well as multiple circus shows a day. I have never been to the Adventuredome but that seems like another good advantage for families with kids.

As far as the restaurants go, the Pizzeria is a decent option. The pizzas are big and pretty tasty. The Westside Deli has average cafeteria level food if you're looking for a snack. Vince Niel's restaurant (it has changed names multiple times now over the years) is just ok. The food is average but the service is below average. We went a couple times in the last few years and decided not to return. I'm not sure if the menu has changed with the recent name change or not. And the last place I will mention is the buffet... DO NOT DO IT!!! We had comp dollars to use for dining and decided to give it a whirl. Bad mistake. The food is horrible. The setup is like a highschool cafeteria. We went up a couple times to fill new plates and noticed that there was a plate of pie randomly laying around by the buffet and each time we went up there someone kept taking bites of it and continued to leave it there (our guess was an employee... but how weird???)

I do recommend getting the player's card here because you can get points and decent rewards pretty quickly as compared to other hotels in Vegas. 

We have decided that we won't be staying at this hotel any more and will start giving other hotels a chance to see if we like it better. It will be worth the few extra dollars to not have a free room, but hopefully have better dining, customer service, and be closer to the heart of The Strip.",0,0,0

 I've never stayed at Circus Circus and it was not on my radar at all until I caught a glimpse of their ad promoting the newly installed slide at the pool. Wha???... I had to look no further. 
 Booked a room on a Monday, coming out of EDC weekend. Rate was $21 plus $31 resort fee, lol. Check in booklet included a $5 off coupon for Adventuredome- how can you go wrong?
 I was really bracing myself, but was VERY pleasantly surprised. 
 I got a room on 25th floor of Sky Tower, close to pool and Adventuredome entrance. Got a very nice view and room was much nicer than I expected. Was able to check in 2 hours early with zero questions asked. 
 All staff I encountered were super friendly and polite, cheerful and upbeat. 
 Again, so impressed! 
 Only downside is I wasn't too excited about affordable dining options, so we drove 1.5 miles to Palace Station and ate at their buffet, twice, so that worked out really well. 
 Pool check in is kind of a cluster, but two beers on tap, Bud light (bleh) and IPA (oh well), at affordable prices, make it up.
 Kids, who have stayed everywhere up and down the strip and are spoiled as can be, cruising and traveling around country throughout the year, having stayed at an eclectic mix of everything from motels to boutique hotels, both said ""we hope we get to come back!"". I can see why- between Adventuredome, pool and buffet, I think we hit all their faves in one trip.",0,0,0

And by nicer, I mean even the gutter-tier Riviera and Sahara hotels would suffice as better options.

It is easily the most awful hotel experience I've ever had in Vegas --- and that's said as both a kid and a young adult.

There is absolutely no such thing as guest service here. The place is overrun with little kids, dressed in nightmarish pink 1970's-style decor, their pool area is a kidney-shaped pool that's no bigger than 15' x 10' and built along the edge of the parking area and only closed off by a tarped chain-link fence (yes, it's that ghetto).

I am embarrassed to admit that I've stayed here a few times in the past...mostly when I was a kid on a family Vegas outing.  A stay in their regular rooms is a 0 star (note the 1 star rating I gave this place is because Yelp doesn't allow 0 stars). A stay in their RV Park room. OMG. A very solid -10 stars. It's reminiscent of one of those horror film motel rooms, BUT with clown decor.  Like, this is where Stephen King's terrifying ""IT"" clown would stay if he came out for a few nights of Vegas debauchery.

When I stepped in, I literally was transported back into what I was confident to be 1973 (ballpark year), suddenly possessed by a very rationalized fear of possibly contracting some kind of disease just by LOOKING at the inside of the room. Either that, or accidentally discovering a dead body concealed under the bed frame as I bend over to tie my shoe laces. This is one of very FEW things that can scare a fully grown adult male in the real outside world. I'd rather be camping and crashing out in a sleeping bag and tent in the wilderness. The only real fear involved there would be running out of TP to wipe my ass after a sh*t in the woods.

The buffet. Wow. *Gags*. Really not much more to say.

It's true...the saying ""You get what you pay for."" There's a really good reason why rates here are so cheap.

Basically, it's the worst and last place you could and should stay at on the Strip if you've come looking to ""get away"" and have a great time. Their clientele consists 100% of large families with kids, more kids, old people, rednecks, more kids and trash. If that's your kind of scene, then you're in luck. But most people leave distraught, horrified, mortified, and tarnished.

The only notable and cool factor feature of this place is the indoor theme park by the name of Adventuredome, which features a large roller coaster and some thrill rides.",14,22,8

When you come from a nice and clean hotel  and get to the circus circus is hard not to notice the differences. The lobby, main floor carpets, hallways and elevators need a lot of TLC. It seems like they haven't done anything since they builded it. From outside the hotel does not show a happy circus with its full white and faded red colors. Parking lots and hallways leading to the hotel are super dirty. The pool has stains all over and the towels provided serve as exfoliators of how rough and old they were.  I'm guessing the towels were blue at some point, now the are a really bad faded blue. It's hard to get to the pool, you need to take different elevator and hallways and is not well marked. Is not like it says""pool 3 floor"" and then the pool faces a parking lot were there are workers looking at you sunbathed.. very uncomfortable. The room itself was clean. I checked the sheets and the towels weren't as rough as the pool ones. We were offered an upgrade to have a better view of the strip.... is not worth it. You are so far of the strip you only see the parking lot. Don't buy it. Not what upsets me the most is that we picked a non smoking room and upon arrival we were informed that if that rule is violated we will be charged $300 that's a lot. But we were fine cus we were all non smokers. In our floor there's signs saying is a non smoking FLOOR. yet the floor smelled faintly of old smoke. On our second night when we open the door to go get iced a terrible smell of weed hit us. When we called reception they kept saying they will send someone to investigate which it never happened. I made it very clear I didn't want to be charged extra from someone smoking and then me getting blamed. Which it didn't happens thankfully but the stayed w as very uncomfortable because the weed smell kept coming in every time you opened the door. We didn't let this damper our stay cus once the doors were closed the room was OK.

The pools aren't spectacular, but they made sure the water was cold especially for the days being so hot in the summer.

When we returned they were NO WHERE to be found but the room was cleaned by the room service maid. When she went to ask about her glasses all they did was take a report with no reassurance that they would take care of the situation. Upon check out she again asked about her glasses (mind you, we checked the room very thoroughly before even bringing it to their attention) and they said that the ones to handle the situation were only there on weekdays and not weekends (how convenient for them at times like this). And that they would have the needed department contact her regarding the situation. We asked if there were some type of ANYTHING they could do to rectify the situation or anything and they said no, wait for the call. My sister told them that she NEEDS these glasses especially to drive because her sight is pretty bad and they basically said its not their issue. When she was finally contacted back they basically told her that the maid that cleaned her room denied ever taking anything (of course bc what employee would admit to stealing while on the job to be at risk of losing the job) and that it was MY SISTERS FAULT that they were even missing for not putting them in the vault.

They are unwilling to answer any questions, and did not help the children unbuckle from rides. The rides were bombarded with parents after each ride, because the ride attendee would just walk to the exit and hold the gate.

There's no sense in paying ridiculous prices for a Vegas hotel when you'll be out and about from 12pm-4am (walking the strip, meals, day clubs, night clubs). So why not pick the most cost effective hotel? 

Well I'll start with...The saying rings true that you get what you pay for. And so when I arrived at Circus Circus I was sure to leave my high horse at home. My friends and I stayed in Building C of the manor, and for the price we paid, it was good! The building was a little run down, but our room was decent: two king-sized beds, parking literally right outside of our room, not a lot of noise or foot-traffic (sounds like my kind of place!)

When I told my dad we were staying here, he said that it was the cheapest place on the strip when he used to visit back in the 70s.

Given, the reviews, I was fully expecting this place to be gross. Lucky for us, it was not. Our room was clean if not updated. 

If you're looking for a place just to sleep (or not sleep) during your stay in Vegas and don't want to spend a lot. Circus Circus is still a viable option. 

Pool is pretty meh. Food is gross. Casino has seen better days. It's dark and has the signature stale cigarette smell (come on NV it's time to ban indoor smoking).

My only run in with the staff was with an overly aggressive bellman who got in my personal space while I was looking for my check ticket. Seriously, dude. There is no one behind me in line, lay off! He then proceeded to take over ten minutes to find my bag and wouldn't take no as an answer when I said I didn't need help to the room. I get that you work for tips, but the fastest way to lose your tip is telling a female customer that she's not strong enough to lift her own luggage. I overheard another bell demanding a tip from a foreign tourist (who had no idea about tipping). Guess I shouldn't expect the staff at a tacky hotel to have any tact.

So we decided to walk from Caesar's; have lunch and gamble a little at Circus Circus.  It was a nice walk.   We were hungry and tired by the time we arrived at around 1PM..  Looked at the map inside;  decide on the Blue Iguana.  Asked a cashier how to get to it. She gestured to her right, ""Just take the escalator right around the corner and it's right at the top"". After wandering unsuccessfully in the direction she indicated;  we asked at a security desk. He pointed vaguely further on and said pretty much the same thing about it being upstairs.  We finally found the far distant escalator.. and had to walk quite awhile through a VERY LOW END, very sad ""mall"" of junk shops.  Finally foundy the Blue Iguana.  It was CLOSED. Maybe one off those two employees could have mentioned that? ? Okay. . So then let's go to the other restaurant up here.  The Garden Grill I think was the name I had seen on the sign.  It was boarded up. Really? ? 
 Downstairs,  the casino was swelteringly hot.  Upstairs was uncomfortably warm.  The temperature, smell, and that irritatingly long, poorly directed trek prompted us to decide to leave.  We asked another security guy the fastest, simplest way to the Las Vegas Blvd entrance.

The beds were alright enough to sleep on but the carpets felt like 35 years of dust, dirt, and human shedding compacted enough to tickle passing toes. The best part of this place is knowing you don't have to call this place home.

The first night of checking in, we were on our way to our room when we noticed large black beetles running through the hallway. Disgusted, but thankful they weren't in our room (YET) we continued on. 

Once we got into our room, we discovered a black beetle running across the floor. I am not talking a small bug. These beetles were at least 2-3 inches. There was also one running across the bed. 
We discovered a few more the next day, but the real problem was when we opened our curtains. It was hot, so we kept them completely shut the first day. The day after, we got back from long night on the strip and I decided to look out the window. I opened the curtain to look out to a rooftop where at least 50 of the disgusting black beetles were running around. In herds. SO DISGUSTING. They were less than 5 feet away from my bed and I could not stop thinking about how they were there partying right next to my bed the night before and I had no knowledge of it. We had to switch rooms at 1 AM. After a long hot day out, this was not at all what we expected to come back too.

A little rinky dinky.

I will admit. Not the best thing I have ever seen. A couple of factors play into this of course. 

1. We were there for the first act of the day.. and we were early for that.

2. We only stuck around to see the one act.

So I won't hold it against them too much.. but the morning's act was a chair juggler. A little bit ho' hum I guess... lacked some of the pizzaz of a trapeeze artist or something of that nature. 

It's a bit of a tired area and the seating is just metal bleachers (if you choose to sit, but there is plenty of vantage points around the midway if not).

The reason it's a 4 star review, is it's FREE!.. and as I mentioned before, in a world like Vegas that gets more expensive by the day it seems, it's really refreshing to see a hotel still embrace the sentiment of getting you in or at it's front door with a free attraction.",2,1,1

I am writing a book about Las Vegas and therefore interested in the seedier side of the city, however, this place is a true shithole with no redeeming qualities, even from a literary perspective.

The one thing that will hit you in the face like a hard slap from a prostitute is the overwhelming smell of mold and decay the moment you step through the doors. That and a carpet stained so many times by so many different bodily fluids it is currently a putrefied shell of its formerly colorful and cheerful self. 

Unfortunately for me, I encountered a double whammy visiting this place: holiday weekend and what seemed like the end of some performance. Swarms of people swept me into their human wave and I could not escape before taking a lap around the bend-I have never seen this place so crowded, mostly people with their packs of obese children (really is there no better place to take your kids?). I took a brief detour to the casino floor and that's when things really got ugly. There were beer bottles and garbage  strewn everywhere, while one listless employee halfheartedly swept a few straw wrappers into his dust pan. At 3 pm there was a man so drunk he could barely walk straight or focus his eyes lurching in my direction, blind to his surroundings. 

Fearing that I would either be bitten by any number of vermin or mugged in full view of everyone in the middle of the afternoon, I made my way to the door and RAN away.

I'd rather take my child (or myself) to a prison yard (which is basically what this was) then EVER come  here again. Unless you're a glutton for punishment, you'd be better off staying home.

Oh and the best part is that Circus Circus is located smack dab in the middle of a tweaker-deranged homeless person hangout. In one day, I spotted a disabled woman tying up her arm in the street in broad daylight, a very deranged man running down the street, full-speed in 110 degree heat with his eyes simultaneously bugging out of his head, and what I assume was a homeless man wearing shoes 5 sizes too big while attempting a zombified walk\/stagger which culminated in his swaying in place in the middle of the street for an undetermined amount of time.",0,0,0

I spent quite a bit of time looking for a place that was kid friendly, and had a great Casino.  Circus Circus Las Vegas Hotel and Casino was the one that stood out.

We booked for a week after school let out in June of 2017.  I knew the Hotel was 30+ years old, but with a waterpark, an adventure dome, a Midway, free circus acts and a large casino all in one place, I thought it was a great choice.

Unfortunately, the waterpark was mainly for kids under 7 years old, the adventuredome had only 25 rides, and half of them were for smaller children.  The air conditioning was so bad, that the smell of cirgarettes reeked through everywhere we went.  

The room had part of the popcorn ceiling falling off it, furniture was missing (no place to sit other than the bed), the carpet was worn and stained and the wall paper was peeling off in the bathroom.  There were holes in our sheets, no blankets, and I was bit several dozen times by either fleas for bed bugs (not really sure which).

I stayed here 8\/28 - 8-30.. What a mistake that was.

1.) I requested smoking room with two queens in the casino tower and was guaranteed them by two different people since I called twice to verify. Upon arrival, i was told that there were no smoking rooms in circus circus anymore. They stopped smoking rooms the week I booked. I believe that they should have notified all those people who requested smoking rooms, if not what's the point? May as well have stayed elsewhere.

2.) Once we got to the room, the tub looked old and yellow, the sheets were stained, and the curtains smelled very badly. 

3.) The alarms went off at 5:30AM for about ten minutes non-stop to notify everyone of an emergency. So of course everyone was peeking their heads in the hallway and saw nothing. Finally it stopped, five minutes of quiet when BOOM!! AGAAAAAIN the alarms went off to notify the emergency had been taken care of and that went on for ten minutes. TERRIBLE. I don't see why every single person should know of an emergency unless it is risking our lives as well which I'm sure it was no big.. Probably just some drunk fight by the slots.

We had alot of fun while we were there and was definitely worth it, but this is a review about Circus Circus so lets begin.

The place is definitely old and shows it.  We got to the hotel and the minute we walked in the front door someone started trying to hook us up with complimentary shows and passes, but required a major credit card (if its complimentary, why do you need my credit card?)   We get to the check in area and there was nobody there.  We waited about 20 minutes and finally someone showed up.  Circus Circus charges a mandatory resort fee for each day you stay, and apparently from what I've read on other Hotel Reviews, pretty much all of them do... So we weren't surprised nor did we care to pay it.   After we got our room cards we proceeded to head to our rooms.  We showed up on a Tuesday so there was hardly anyone around and that's understandable.  We had to walk an ungodly distance to get to the tower our room was in.. The place really looked run down, everything was expensive and there were lots of kiosks everywhere selling useless junk at ridiculous prices. (i.e. Fake jewlery, hats and crap).  Anyways, we got to our hotel room, and it was decent... about the equivalent of what you can expect from a Motel 6 or Super 8 as far as decor was concerned.  Our view was overlooking the north end of the strip where you can see the Stratosphere and in the distance, downtown.  The view was pretty nice if you ask me.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  The window to our room was partly open in the corner and was nailed in that way so we couldn't close it.

The food there was bland at best and I would recommend eating at other places.  We enjoyed the free circus acts, its surprisingly entertaining.  Come the weekend and all hell breaks loose... There are children EVERYWHERE bumping into you, screaming, acting like.. well... Children and we dare not try to go to the pool.

There were no attractions for 20-30 something adults, like clubs or anything like that.  We would have to venture into the strip or downtown for that.  The casino sections are amazingly boring and poorly lit.

Overall, Im sure this place is great if you want to bring your kids to Las Vegas (why?... its Las Vegas.. should be adults only), but for grown ups, I recommend staying else where.   Other than that, it was an ok stay and we don't have anything else bad to say about this place.",2,0,0

First of all, it's a tough hotel to navigate. You might be staying on the 4th floor, but only on some poorly labeled tower. The elevators don't clearly indicate where they go, so I had the experience of going to the 4th floor and seeing that my room was on a different 4th floor. Cool. The elevator to get to my room was tucked behind the meeting rooms. Cooler.

The valet put the wrong number ticket on our car, so it took them 20 minutes to get it. Coolest.

My favorite part of the stay was when I used my key to get into my room, then went to the vending machine to get water and came back to find my key stopped working. First of all, what? Second of all, when I went downstairs (which is quite a walk from the room) to get this straightened out, they informed me I couldn't get back into my room without my ID. When I explained my ID was in the room, they basically told me I was out of luck. Eventually, the person who had the room under their name had to come and yell at them so I could get back in.

Their buffet is terrible. Everything tastes the same. They have very strict security (lots of chains) to get into the buffet, which is weird because no one would want to sneak in after tasting the food. We got the buffet for free because of the aforementioned key snafu and it was still awful. They should have paid us to eat there.

(The Mirage though, after we inevitably left Circus Circus, let me use my maiden name Credit Card).

Because we were tired we decided to charge the room to my husband's card (they didn't honor the original price either), and we went to our room in the Circus Circus manor... it was gross. The carpet was stained, the room smelled, and the walls are paper thin. I really mean super super thin walls, we could hear every conversation and tv channel in all the neighboring rooms. 

Needless to say, we left, got a refund (which we were told wouldn't be placed back in the account until after the weekend which meant we were also short on funds for the trip).",2,1,0

Outside, below our window, was the pick up door for food disposal and other pick up services. Trucks honking and backing up alarms sounded throughout the night. Drivers repeatedly honking,shouting and pounding on doors. I am certain that this can be done at other times through out the day. I will most likely book this location for my next trip in March 2014. I will not stay in the much more favorable West Tower.

**And by the way, the front desk is awesome. Seriously, great staff. Kind, organized, knowledgeable, professional and down to Earth. Check in was a breeze.

One night the water went out for the entire West Tower (I think that's what it is called) but no big whoop, as we only stopped off to rest for a bit before heading back out.

What almost caused us to call and complain was when housekeeping decided to vacuum the room directly above us at 11:51PM!!! But it didn't last long. Thankfully.

If I had a major complaint it would be this - the heavy and obnoxious sell from the time share rep. All we did was ask an employee of the casino where the front desk was and she led us to this older dark haired lady who proceeded to drill us on our relationship status, our annual income, while prodding us for our credit cards and $20 each. This vulture was selling time shares.

You know what? Shame on you for this. Totally out of line. Your employee led us to this obnoxious sales rep who was invasive and manipulative. At least I know what to look for now when approached by such con artists. I refused to participate. This lady gave me very negative vibes.

Otherwise, I liked its location and the room was comfortable. I'd return and steer clear of people selling time shares.",1,0,0

Located a bit off the strip, this would be the most ideal place to stay if you are bringing children.  This is one of the ""original"" hotels, so some would probably call it out dated.  It isn't new and shiny like the Linq or Aria, but it has a neat feel and is super family friendly.

Our room was great, the service was exceptional, and if we ever did bring children (though I doubt it) this would be a fun place for them.  They have an actual circus that runs throughout the day, for free, as well as amusement park rides & games located upstairs and in the Adventure Dome.

We didn't spend much time here, other than to sleep, but we did enjoy our time.  We didn't eat at The Steakhouse, but several people mentioned how good it was whenever we were asked where we were staying.

My only word of caution:  If you are trying to save money, do not stay here.  Because of the distance away from the strip and most of the sites you'll probably want to see, you'll spend a small fortune in taxi rides.  The weather was brutal, so we took several rides, and we spent quiet a bit of money on them.  If you are looking to walk the strip and be close to everything, I wouldn't recommend this location.",7,0,0

The minuses - Dated dated dated. Standard def, CRT television in the room (who  still does this - doesn't it cost you more in electricity?!?), awkward to get in and out of when we visited (music festival had everything jammed up around the place), and they hit us up as soon as we walked in to tour their new hotel. Not what you want when you're just arriving from a long journey.

I was drawn in with their $29\/night rate, however that only tells half the story because they add a $16(ish?) resort fee per night to cover things like wifi, etc. Keep this in mind when shopping, because I don't believe every place does this.

I won't go so far as to tell others to stay away from the place - it was far from the worst place I've stayed in (a certain Red Roof in NJ holds that title), but we probably will try a different place on any return visits. We were LV newbies, and this fit the bill.

I don't even know where to start. We stayed in the manor. Upon arrival we noticed that the rooms were incredibly barren and had few amenities. There is no mini fridge, coffee maker, microwave, etc. The televisions are straight out of 1980. But this is just the beginning.

On the first night, my girlfriend and I heard a baby screaming right outside the door. We opened our door to find a shirtless, shoeless baby wandering the halls in distress. An Asian family was watching him and doing absolutely nothing about it. We had to take it into our hands to call the police who contacted security who took at least 40 minutes to show up. But we wouldn't know if they ever did show up, since the baby's cousin finally came to claim her child. What the fuck. 

This is the icing on the cake. At a certain point, on the last night of our trip, our cards all got deactivated. No big deal, it happens, right? So I ran back to the front desk to get a new set. The man behind the desk promised that they would work. I got back to the room, cards don't work. Okay. I ran back. This time, the lady said they'd work for sure. Uh huh. I drove this time. Came back to my room, and... nope. Card still doesn't work. So we called security to let us into our room. He took his sweet ass time but eventually showed up. At this point we just wanted to get into our god damn rooms. When we get in, we call the desk to bring us new cards. A bellman comes by, leaves the cards with my girlfriend and runs the hell out of there. Not his problem anymore, eh? Well guess what? These fucking cards don't work either! So I ran out to tell him what's up. He tells me to call the front desk? Really dude? Call the front desk? You call the front desk! 

And that's where I'm at now. This all happened within the last hour. I'm sitting here trapped in my shitty circus circus room waiting to see what the fuck these incompetent morons are going to do about this situation. 

Don't stay here. You'd be better off at a motel 6. Just steer clear. If you have kids, definitely enjoy the adventuredome. If you like steak, eat at the phenomenal steakhouse. But do not, I repeat, DO NOT stay here. 

Wow.

An update:

We waited and waited but help never came. I called the service desk again. They told us that we could have a new room assigned to us. Well we didn't want a new room. We wanted them to fix our door and not make us move our stuff, since we were leaving the following day. I was really pissed off so I made my way back to the front desk. Michael, the biggest asshole in the hotel industry, told me a whole lot of nothing. He showed no remorse for this nightmare of a situation and eventually told me to speak to the manager. I went to speak to her, but was met with a whole lot more of nothing. At this point, they should have comped our entire stay. Who treats customers this way? Anyway, the lady told us security would come to the room and to go back and wait. Ha! I've heard that one before. So a fairly long wait later, security came by and told us that our door had been ""pinned"" and that's why we couldn't get in. He said we have to go back to the desk to deal with the situation and get new cards. Long story short, these cards finally worked but it was too late to go out at this point so this was how I spent my final night in Vegas.",7,3,2

We only came to Circus Circus to bring my son to play some games at the midway and to check out their adventuredome. We were in Las Vegas for spring break vacation. 

First annoying thing is that people were smoking in non-gambling areas. I understand that it's allowed to smoke indoors in casinos but for a casino\/resort that caters to the family environment and kids, you would think they would restrict smoking in non-gambling areas. Just walking to the adventuredome, we had at least 3 people walking in front of us smoking. My wife and I can deal with that, but my kid shouldn't have to. Also, if you are going to allow smoking in areas near where kids will be, at least upgrade your ventilation in those areas. The smoke smell was so stagnant and irritating to your eyes and mouth. 

The pricing for the adventuredome is obviously geared to force you to get a all day pass. For my son to ride one ride, based on the type of ride it was, he spent $9. LMAO, that's for one ride. My son isn't tall enough yet to ride a majority of the rides and so it wasn't worth it to get an all day pass. The midway was the only decent area for my son to enjoy.

There are bike security guys who ride around to keep the place secure but there is no parking or security attendant in the attendant box at the front of the parking lot.

We've been taking our kids here for 3 years now and were excited to have them experience the new adventure dome. We have a five and a 7 yr old .

Our 5yo was 44"" and the 7yo was 47.5"" just under the 48"" requirement for big rides. I thought good they won't  be fighting over who goes on each ride and they can go on all the same. I was shocked  an thought I was part of a hidden camera joke to find the ticket attendent requiring  me to purchase a 48"" ticket for the 7yo. I said he's under the line and placed him under the measuring stand. The attendee insisted no he would have  to purchase the 48"" ticket I was in total disbelief and said your joaking. The attendee snidly replied 'i wish I was'. I felt sick, embarrassed, angry and disgusted. I couldn't  belive what I was hearing.

Fast forward to the present when I went there a couple times since I had some friends stay at the hotel. As far as the casino goes, there definitely needs to be some renovations done. The hotel rooms also need some improvements done as well. I suppose given the price it's a good deal but I would at least try and look elsewhere before I book a room there.

The rooms were good. They were clean and maids clean the rooms pretty well everyday and they change our towels when needed. One thing I didn't like was that the walls were pretty thin. I could hear the neighbor's conversation. 

Also, I wished these rooms had more security or at least the rules are enforced better. We requested non-smoking, so the receptionist put us on the non-smoking floors. But our neighbors were smokers! and we could smell the smoke seeping through our doors. We called the front desk to complain and they told us that they were send security up right away. But nothing happened... we still smelled smoke and no matter how many times we complaint, we never heard or saw security take care of the matter. 

Also another thing that I disliked was how anal and rude most of the workers are. I thought that the staff at the midway were suppose to be kid-friendly, but no they scare away the kids. They barely speak to you and they give you this stare that makes you want to give them a 10-foot radius.

I didn't dare run the faucet.. I could see a bit the necklace the top of the sink. After mentally freaking out a bit I called the front desk and an hour later they sent their plumber on staff up.

After I explained the situation he got some tools, opened up the pipes below the bathroom sink and retrieved my necklace for me. That was a HUGE relief for me.

I did not find the smell pleasant at all, and no I am not one those people who are sensitive to certain smells. But this is the only casino that has  such a weird and nauseating smell compared to any of the hotels off and on the strip. Thank god the room didn't smell like the casino though. The smell was so strong that it sticks to the plastic bags of your food takeout as well from the Westside Deli that is located around the casino area.

I made reservations for a king room in the West Tower, but when I was ready to check-in they gave me a double queen instead, since they ran out of the room I initially booked for. The room looked clean when waking in, but upon further inspection I found old blood stains on the sheets and black stains on the towels. Also, they really need to clean the windows. In addition, the towel rack was broken ( it fell off when I tried to take one the new towels off the rack) and surprised to see no one has attempted to fix it.

Pros are that its a good space for families and kids because of the onsite arcade and Adventure dome, plenty of slots available, and the waitresses often come by and quickly you your drinks.

We were pretty clueless as to which hotels were good, so we saw the very low price and booked. I am writing this review as a 20 something year old professional who enjoys having fun on her vacations and has an about average budget to spend on vacations. 

Clientele\/Guests: 
For me personally, I expected to be around people who resembled the cast of The Hangover. I noticed that there were a large number of families, children, and interesting looking people who stay at this resort. The people did not make me feel unsafe or sketched out in anyway, but they were not the glamorous Vegas party crowd I had heard so much about. These are the people who sit in the casino ALL day and still think that mullets are a cool hairstyle. The people seemed to be of lower taste, I'll just say that. There were a lot of kids around which almost made me feel ashamed to be carrying my giant drink all over the hotel. Nearly every morning, there were screaming children and parents in the hallway which woke me up and was annoying. If I would have the decency not to come back to the hotel at 4AM drunk and being loud, as an adult and parent, kindly remind your children that not everyone is awake at 6AM and screaming loudly by everyone's door is a bit rude. From Tuesday to Thursday, no pretty looking people or young adults engaging in drunken shenanigans here. On Friday and Saturday, the scene got much better. There were much more couples and young people hanging out in the casino, the bars, and enjoying the drinks and louder music being played that was absent during the week. On Saturday night, the casino actually seemed like a pretty poppin' place to be. 

The Room:
We stayed in the West Tower, and after reading some reviews, I was dreading it. However, I was not the least bit disgusted or skeeved out by our room. Everything was really clean and organized, I never once felt grossed out by our room. Even the bathroom did not seem unclean in anyway. The beds were pretty comfortable, but I found it strange that we were never given a comforter until Thursday. This was not an issue because it was too hot for a comforter anyway. When we were finally given a comforter on Thursday however, I was so happy to see that it was delivered in a sealed plastic bag, never opened, almost brand new! Awesome! Usually I get disgusted by comforters and throw them in the corner of the room. Be prepared that the room can get FREEZING cold upon arrival or after the maids leave, but is easily fixed with the control panel in the room. The shower was OK, but not the best. It was very clean, but quite annoying to operate. The water has three temperatures: freezing cold, room temperature, and scold your body\/third degree burn hot. Also, once you turn off the water it never actually turns off, it drips perpetually. Overall, the room was great to stay in, very comfortable and clean. I would recommend staying in the west tower to anyone on a budget. 

Amenities:
Circus performances, oxygen bar, indoor amusement park, frozen yogurt cafe, several restaurants and two bars. 
 
Overall, I found my stay at Circus Circus to be just fine. There was nothing outstanding about the hotel, but it was not bad either. At the end of the day, we really went there just to sleep, shower and change, play some slots, and grab food when we didn't feel like eating anywhere else, that's all a hotel really is. The entertainment was on the strip, so we didn't spend much time in the resort. People will say that Circus Circus is ""off the strip"" which is NOT TRUE. Circus Circus is at the very end of the strip and seems far away from the other hotels to some people. My friend and I are both decently active, so walking from the hotel to the other hotels on the strip was not much of a physical challenge for us. The only challenging part was timing, if we had a reservation somewhere and wanted to walk we tried to leave very early. There is the Deuce bus which is right outside of the resort and across the street which goes up and down the strip, we took this many times when we couldn't walk. Would I stay here again? If I had to, I would. The hotel is inexpensive, clean, and comfortable. I think I'd prefer to stay somewhere more geared towards my age :)",13,0,0

The place is crawling with small children, the rooms are pretty dumpy, and although the hotel may claim it's on the strip, it's about 1.5 - 2 miles from where any of the real action is.  If you're looking for a cheap room, stay at the Imperial Palace.  Rates there are similar to those at Circus Circus but you're right in the heart of the strip.

I should point out that the casino does have fairly low minimums - $2, $3, and $5 blackjack tables can be found.  The ""Slots O Fun"" building seems to have most of the cheaper tables.  So if you're a low roller, this place might be a decent spot to hit for some gambling ... just avoid staying in the hotel.",1,0,0

I must say we were very satisfied with our stay and fleas we did choose this hotel for this trip. At check in the receptionist was very nice and helpful. She was able to upgrade my parents room and have our rooms be across from each other which made it convenient l. 

We valet our vehicle and the bellmen were awesome! The rooms were nice. No issues. I requested additional blankets and towels and the lady brought them up fast and was very accommodating. 

The adventure some was exciting for the kids and pretty cool. There was also an arcade upstairs which is just what the kids love.

I recently went back after many many years, now as an adult, with my mom and my sister's family. This is one of the few places in Las Vegas where you can bring kids and family. This review is for the carnival games area, not the hotel or casino.

-- LAYOUT --
The carnival games area is on the second floor and shaped like a circle. This makes it easy to know where you started.

-- CIRCUS CIRCUS --
I remember the fun I had as a kid. Games were really cheap, and there were gigantic plush animals as prizes. I secretly wanted one as a kid but didn't really have time, or talent, to win the games. Now as an adult, I had the money and time to try them all, and if you take inflation into consideration, all the games are quite reasonably-priced.

I first went on the Jurassic Park shooter video game. I tried the triceratops level, and while I couldn't beat it after several tries, that was the funnest $2 I spent there, and I highly recommend it. Who doesn't want to play against dinosaurs?

I then gravitated towards the carnival games with giant stuffed animals. The first was a game where you had to knock over three square wooden cubes stacked one on top of another with an oddly shaped ball. I spent $10 for six balls. Each and every time, I would hit two of them off the table, but there would always be one left. Apparently, the trick is to hit it exactly between the bottom two cubes. I tried that but to no avail. I've worked at carnivals as a kid, so I know you basically had to get some of these shots just right. Sadly, I couldn't win a large plush for my niece at this one.

There are a bunch of old and new types of carnival games where you can win prizes. It's incredibly cheap (proportional to the prices from ten years ago). Most games cost $1-3. 

There are lots of claw crane machines available which range from 50 cents to $2 depending on the size of the prize. Only play these if you see a loose doll at the top; that's the trick.

There was some acrobatics show at some point, and you had to get there at least thirty minutes early to get a seat, otherwise you can watch from the sides.

-- ATMOSPHERE --
The took off a star because of the look of the place. Circus Circus feels a bit dated, and a nice fresh coat of paint along with some decor upgrades would immensely help it from looking like it still lives in the 90s.

-- SUMMARY --
There are games for kids, games for adults. And don't forget to check out Adventuredome if your kids prefer rides instead of games; it's in the same building. Together, Adventuredome and Circus Circus is a great place for a family to go in Las Vegas.",2,0,0

We visited on Tuesday, June 25th and treated all the kids to play carnival games and watch some free circus acts in the crazy, chaotic atmosphere of Circus Circus Midway.

We went early to avoid the crowds and our group was enjoying our visit.  Service was overall great.  My little niece lost one of her small ""consolation"" prizes virtually minutes after walking away from the booth, and after unsuccessfully searching for it, the lady just gave her another one.  That was very nice.  

The kids played in the one where you hammer a launcher that flings a chicken into pots and the little kids really struggled with it.  The nice lady there gave them 2nd chances without us asking or the kids even complaining. That was very nice.

Then we came across Ms. Hoan, who was working the Buoy Game.  There are a bunch of little bowls on water and you toss ping pong balls into them.  Most are clear but there are a few red and blue ones.  I believe the blue ones are for the big stuffed animals.

So get this...

Our 9-year old tosses about 10 balls without winning a prize until he finally lands one in the blue bowl.  We erupt with cheers.  

Ms. Hoan is on the other side, however, and another family tosses a ball in the same blue bowl which shoots our ball out.  They erupt with cheers and the two families look at each other uncomfortably.  Ms. Hoan comes over and we both explain to her what happened.  Ms. Hoan looks at my 9-year old and says ""Nope...I only see their ball in their.  You get nothing.'

WOW!!!  The other family apologizes and looks horrified as they walk away with their huge giraffe.  My son, to his credit, shrugs it off and we move on to the next game.  

As a few minutes pass, I become infuriated and I go to the Customer Service office.  A supervisor by the name of Brian apologizes and gives my son a big stuffed animal.

Circus Circus - I recommend that you review video of this incident.  Ms. Hoan is a disgrace to your brand.  The incident occurred at approx 3pm on 6\/25 at your Buoy game.",8,6,2

About our stay: 

Although prices were cheap, ya know what they say... you get what you pay for. Honestly, I was expecting at least a coffee maker & a mini fridge inside the rooms. Some customers do take meds that require them to be stored in the fridge, not an ice bucket, an actual refrigerator or a mini fridge. Not my case but just thinking ahead, here... for other customers. Anyway, other than that, the rooms were not that bad. Beds were clean and everything was neat & organized. They replenished the towels..which is good. 

What I absolutely hated, though, was being woken up at 4am by either maintenance workers or housekeepers. They talk so loud that it woke both of us up, two nights in a row!

1.  It's great value.  It's one of the few places on the strip where you can get weekend rates of less than $100 a night.  Sure Wynn rooms are nicer, but are they really 4 times nicer? (at 4 times the price ).  Also when Echelon Place next door opens (if it ever opens), are you really going to pay top $$ to stay at the Mondrian and the Delano.  I'm just going to walk over from CC to check out the new hot place in town.    

2.  It's old school Vegas.  CC and Caesars were the first themed casinos in Vegas, both started by visionary Jay Sarno.  Caesars has been remodeled beyond recognition since its 1966 opening, only the original Palace casino remains.  CC, on the other hand, has retained the same low-roller circus theme which has been successful for over 40 years.  

3.  It's iconic.  No other Vegas casino has had the same pop culture exposure.  Please refer to ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" (the book) or ""Diamonds are Forever"" (the movie).  Hey the place was good enough for Dr. Gonzo and James Bond. 

4.  It's surreal.  The circus is supposed to be seedy and dirty with lots of screaming kids running around, right?  A lot of people don't like all the unsupervised kids but I think they just contribute to the overall theme.  At the same time, their parents are gambling away their college educations.  That's kind of cool.

5.  The food is good.  Yeah, I know you're laughing but the steakhouse is considered one of the best (if not best value) places in town.

6.  It's fun.  I've seen a lot of posters here refer to CC as ""ghetto"".  I'm not sure if that's code for something but everyone playing at CC knows how to have a good time.  Case in point, I held the dice for over 30 minutes at the craps table at the Wynn.  People there were so stoic that I had to sarcastically ask if ""anyone was having a good time"".  All I got was blank stares.  The ""homies"" at CC, on the other hand, were hooting and hollering, trading good natured barbs with the dice crew over $5 bets.  It was a good time.

7.  You'll miss it when it's gone.  You know you will.  So go now.",6,2,4

First, the good. The room we stayed in was pretty and clean and didn't smell like smoke at all. We stayed in the Casino Tower on the 8th floor in a non-smoking room, and even though we were in a non-smoking section (we always stay in non-smoking no matter where we stay in Vegas) we were glad that it didn't smell like smoke like other places ""Non-Smoking"" towers.

Now the bad: 

Casino Main Entrance valet- there was like only two dudes. Took  about 15 minutes to get the car because these two poor guys were taking turns parking cars and bringing cars back. One or two more guys would go a long way. The entrance where the hotel registration was didn't have this problem.

Ice Machine- It wasn't hot this past weekend. Ice machine on my floor was out of ice TWICE. No ice coming out and the thing said ""Making Ice"". We had to go down a floor to get ice. Not cool.

The Room- Although the room was pretty, one major design flaw. The sink and mirror are on the INSIDE OF THE RESTROOM, NOT THE OUTSIDE, like other hotels, so if someone is dropping a deuce or taking a shower, you are assed out and have to wait to do things like paint your face, brush your teeth, shave or any other kinds of things you'd do while someone else is showering, which could be awkward if the person you are in the room with isn't your significant other. 

The Bed- It folded like a taco when I lied down in it which means it was worn, even though the white linen was nice and crisp and the duvet was neatly pressed and damn near new.

Overall, it wasn't a BAD experience, but it was not a GREAT experience. I'd probably give it at least one more shot.",12,1,0

We actually walked along the north perimeter of the property and saw staff unloading brand new Serta Pillowtop Mattresses.  There are no fridges or in room coffee.  We went to Walgreens and spent 30 bucks on a small coffee maker, foam cooler and 2 pounds of premium coffee.  SCORE!  

Spend an extra 10 bucks and upgrade your room to the West or Casino Tower.  We loved the West Tower because the elevator is super close to the downstairs valet exit providing easy access for GrubHUB pickups.  

We also went to The Steakhouse inside CC with three kids, ages : 6, 3 and 2...  BOMB.  Sure, there are better steak joints but holy wow the steaks were melt in your mouth amazing and the service was outta this world.

With its big top attitude and its indoor amusement park it very well may be. The beauty of this particular hotel doesn't lie so much in its size or even the circus like atmosphere. The charm lies in the fact that it was something new and relatively untried along the Vegas strip. Rather than build to suit the gamblers they were hoping to attract, this particular hotel was wise enough to offer something new and untried by appealing to families with children rather than solely to gamblers.

The gamble seems to be paying off in a city that is known for both its hits and its misses. Other hotels and casinos are also working to cultivate the family friendly image that Circus Circus has basically proven. Not only did this hotel build The Adventuredome Theme Park they also decided to make accommodations even more family friendly by accommodating RVs at the Circusland RV Park. This offers a great place for families to stay that might not otherwise grace the theme park, hotel, or the casino.

Don't forget that there is a casino involved and that is the primary purpose of this gigantic hotel, resort, and theme park. The casino makes the expense of building it all very much worthwhile and brings in big business of its own each and every day. In grand Vegas style there is also the requisite onsite shopping and of course full service of wedding options in addition to a wedding chapel and banquet facilities in which to hold the reception of your dreams. The shopping at Circus Circus offers everything from ultra exclusive boutique shops and salons to stores such as Under $10 and the trading Post, which offers fad jewelry and other kid friendly gifts.

This hotel has a somewhat unique concept that sets it apart from the many others along Vegas' strip. If you are traveling to Vegas with the family I very much recommend at least checking them out and comparing prices and packages with the other hotels and resorts in the area. Keep in mind that comps are like money in the bank particularly when they involve food or activities that you were planning to do even without the comps. So you may be able to negotiate a much better deal even if you're paying a couple more dollars a night by having free parking, complimentary meals, or tickets to events, shows, or attractions.

Now we're on to my favorite part of the discussion. Dining options. Circus Circus does not disappoint when it comes to offering variety to its guests. In addition to The Steakhouse, there is The Garden Grill, Mexitallia, Pink Pony, Circus Buffet, Pizzeria, Westside Deli, and Barista Café. The food offerings accommodate varying budgets and familial needs by offering some kid friendly dining choices to visitors and guests as well. The good news however is that if these restaurants aren't appealing to you there is another hotel, casino, or restaurant next door that has different fare to offer.

If you are looking for a great place to stay in Las Vegas along with the family there are very few hotels that will offer the overall environment of fun and wonder that you will find at Circus Circus. In addition to the wonderful rooms, the great food, the casino, and The Adventuredome Theme Park you will find that the shows here are as kid friendly and entertaining for the entire family as the atmosphere in general. This is a great vacation destination anywhere. Considering the fact that it is in Las Vegas and it is very nearly the perfect vacation retreat for those with children.",7,0,1

When I ordered the tower king rooms, I did NOT expect to only be on the fifth floor and only get to see the very top of the below building. Nor did I expect them to place us in an area undergoing construction! We should have at least gotten a discount for putting up with that!

Plus, when we checked in, there was a HUGE line that took forever to get through. 

Our room amenities were limited to a very small bottle of lotion, a miniscule amount of shampoo+conditioner in one, and one lego-sized cube of soap. The alarm on the clock didn't work, and there were chips of paint missing all over the toilet seat. Plus, the bath drain would get clogged and fill up during a shower. 

The hotel itself had tons of entertainment opportunities, such as the adventuredome, casino, arcade, carnival-area, and pool. 
But the staff in the carnival area were rude, and one even told us we weren't allowed to sit in the lounge chairs. Like, wtf?!? Then what are the effing chairs for?!?
Furthermore, the pool is only open from 9 AM to 5 PM, so you can't use the hot tub at night. We were tempted to sneak into another hotel's pool area because we missed the cutoff - but we didn't.
Also, you have to pay for internet here, which is the pits. I can deal with 2 or even 5 dollars a day, but it's $11-something here! That's ridiculous! I brought my laptop, but we didn't end up using it at all because of that insane price.

The hotel will advertise that it's on a prime part of the strip, but actually it's on the very South edge. Non-in-shape people, like myself, will probably have to pay for other modes of transportation to get to the REAL prime points farther down the strip.

On the good side, our bathroom was pretty large, and the hair dryer actually worked. 
Also, the buffet here is rockin', in my opinion. And I love love love the crazy decorations and lights surrounding the outside.
There's also a free, but very minimal, circus show that starts at 11 AM everyday. However, from what I could tell, it was only a few acrobat routines and that was it.
On the morning we checked out, there was this really funny clown paid to pretend to be really sleepy in the lobby. I posted a couple pictures - I thought that was a riot. Definitely a great comedic addition.

Anyway, I could have paid a quarter of the price at that gross Travel Suites neighboring Circus Circus, and not have gotten even half the hassles we had to deal with here. I also heard Luxor had been doing a $70 dollars a night deal, which I should have gone for considering they're so much more elegant of a hotel.

Well, I lived and learned. Circus Circus is not worth it. Though I know it could have been a lot worse.",3,1,2

So, we enter the casino, as while in Vegas, once thing you do is check out all the other casino's and this was the only reason we visited this casino. 
First thing I notice was the over powering stench of cigarette's. If I wanted that much nicotine in my system, I would have brought my own cigarettes but not being a smoker I settled for the free nicotine in the air. The cigarette smoke hung around like smog on a bad summer afternoon in anyone one of a number major cites that I could name.
The carpeting was about as worn as mine at home but I suspect that Circus Circus budget is a lot more than mine and they can well afford to replace that aging carpet that was full of suspicious stains that I decided I would be better of not knowing their source.
This casino is marketed towards those on a tighter budget and it shows, with the bulk of their slot machines catering toward the nickle and dime crowd.
I am not a tall person by any stretch of the imagination but the low ceiling gave me the impression I was a giant and a little claustrophobia.
The whole casino seems like it is stuck in another time period and does not look like it has moved on from the 60's, which would make more sense, if this was their intention but I doubt it.
We did not stay long, as none of us wished to contract lung cancer from the ever present nicotine that was taking residence inside of us!",1,1,0

My husband, 2 year old son, and I booked a West Tower room for 4 nights (July 14-18). We were visiting family and our son was with us, we thought the family friendly Circus Circus would be perfect, but we ended up leaving early after a serious incident. 

Check in: Arrived at 3PM, to find a huge line that looked like it would take hours; no surprise considering the time. Kudos to the front desk staff for their quick service - only took 35 minutes.

Room:  Although our room was updated it was already showing a lot of wear and tear. The furniture had stains and many scratches. TV was crooked. Leaky tub faucet and the light in the bathroom was out. Left a lot to be desired, but considering it is a budget resort, we weren't expecting much. Had clean beds, no complaints. Bell desk was quick getting our bags up to the room, but wasn't very friendly and did not help bring them in. 

Grounds: The resort is a zoo with a constant flowing sea of children. Not an issue for us, but could be a major con others. Grounds are reasonably maintained, if a little dated. There is an issue with casino and Midway location. Children are to stay out of the gaming area, but the location of the Midway is above the casino and the only access is in the middle of the gaming floor. Not only is this inconsiderate to players, it is confusing to kids. That aside, the circus acts were amusing, games were reasonably priced ($1 or so), and the operators were fun. Location not an issue with the Adventuredome as it is located at the back of the property. Lots of rides for a reasonable price if you buy a day pass. Perfect for those with kids. 

Casino: Visited when Grandma asked to babysit our son... We always enjoy the casino at here. The dealers are super friendly and they have $5 blackjack. Slots seem pretty loose. Cocktail waitresses are outgoing and fast. It should be noted that they don't use brand liquors, but drinks are still free to players. You can usually get your standard beer selection. 

Food: Restaurant variety that is able to accommodate most tastes. The buffet was your standard buffet at a decent price, but pretty limited for those diners with dietary restrictions (I'm gluten free). However, they did whip up some custom dishes for me and made sure to take special care. Our bus person was also very helpful and attentive. Despite the mediocre selection, our buffet experience was quite exceptional due to the hard working staff. 

We were having a pretty great time at Circus Circus. However, on the 3rd day of our stay that all changed...

On Wednesday, July 16th, we decided to spend the day on the Strip. Before we left, we neatened up the room, made sure our bags were closed and out of the way, all to make it easier for the housekeeper. When we got back, our room had been cleaned and seemed in order. That is, until my husband opened his bag. He had a money clip in the bottom of his bag with $600 exact. We use this as our gambling money and only remove cash in $100 increments (we're VERY meticulous). While out he realized he forgot to lock it in the safe after the previous night, but didn't think it would be an issue since it was in the very bottom of his closed, packed bag. When he checked after we got back, his money clip now only had $440 and his clothes looked as they had been moved. Nothing else in the room was disturbed. If someone broke into our room, other things would have been gone. Someone was trying to hide it as it appeared they attempted to put everything back in place. In our minds, the only person who could have done this is the housekeeper.

We immediately called security. They said someone would be right up (took 45 minutes). The security woman apologized for the delay but was very thorough and attentive. She explained the investigation process and told us to contact risk management in the morning. We contacted them the next morning and were told there was ""nothing we can do"" and ""this is why we provide a safe"". We know we should have used the safe (honest mistake), but we should be able to trust the staff not the go through our bags and steal from us. They told us the investigation would take a minimum 10 days. We understand the process takes time but we asked if they'd do anything to help in the mean time. We still had 1 night left and this really soured our trip. No offer to make it right, no refunds, not even a real apology (just ""sorry, you should have used the safe""). Victim blaming is not an apology!

We went to the front desk to see if they would be willing to do anything. The manager there too said there was nothing they ""could"" do and offered the same ""apology"". 

We immediately checked out, went to Harrah's, and were very happy. It's a shame we couldn't even get a real apology from Circus Circus. Their loss. We go to Vegas at least twice year and have a growing family, their key demographic. Obviously, we won't be back.",17,1,1

The hair dryer was broken.

I've stayed at the circus circus before and it is definitely not my first pick for a vegas hotel but it was the most reasonably priced option for a holiday weekend (St. Patty's day). Plus it had been long enough since my last visit to forget the bad and remember the good. The bad stuff first. Check-in, check-in is mayhem...total mayhem...., plus you get to hang with every drunk partier who can't afford anything other than the motor lodge super saver rate-just think bad frat party. It took about half an hour+ to get through the village of the damned check in line. It's here we should fast forward to the OTHER bad thing about Circus Circus....Check OUT....which is impossible. I mean....getting out of the building is impossible. On Sunday-you should get up regardless of your hangover and try to leave as early as possible. The elevators can not handle the volume of guests that the hotel books, after waiting nearly 45 minutes for a downward elevator with enough room we decided to walk down....yeah...on the stairs... from the 32nd floor. It was grueling-but not so much as having to ascend five flights after finding out that the exit stairs kinda go to nowhere-so up to the fifth or sixth floor to try to catch another elevator-but that took another 20 minutes so we ferreted out the other staircase which took us down to the third floor where we could then find an empty single hidden elevator to the lobby. The parking garage was equally hellish. 

So the good....the West tower rooms are kinda ok, during the week when they're dirt cheap I'd say they're stellar, on the weekend the rooms soar up to the $100 a night mark, it's supply and demand but honestly-vegas is rad any day of the week, maybe even moreso when there's fewer tourists so the review should be taken with that grain of salt....if the tower room I had was $40 or $50 like it is during the week-I'd be way more stoked.... . 

The bed was comfy and although they already show their age after the recent renovation... the rooms were pretty nice. I do have to say it was super awesome that the concierge upgraded us to a jacuzzi room on check in-that was amazing. It is on the strip (more or less) so that was convenient, and I did win enough at the casino on their super loose slots that the room ended up being reasonable on price. Weird crowd though-lots of unusual characters-kinda what you'd expect to find at the cheapest rooms during a busy weekend in vegas. There were a lot of kids milling about-I noticed this in other's reviews and it's true. 

Would I stay here again...maybe...but only on another weekend where I couldn't get one of my standby hotels like The Cabanas at El Cortez, or The Artisan.... if you want the total tourist experience then yeah-this is a good choice...

Once we got to the third floor I saw that our room was near the elevator. I thought it wouldn't be so bad but boy was I wrong. At first glance the room seemed okay. Yes it remind me of a motel 6 or a travel Lodge and not the resort I remember as a kid. There were water stains on the ceiling, stains on the bed,floor and dresser. TV was old and didn't have a clear picture. Missing artwork on the walls and a heater\/ac that barely kept the room warm. I will never stay at circus circus again. Especially for what I paid for that room I feel I was robbed. I would have gotten the same experience staying at a motel 6 but I would've saved a lot more money.",0,0,0

I had a completely different idea about what Circus Circus would be like and thought that my 19 month old son would have time of this life here.  I YELP everything prior to visiting an establishment and I didn't once thing to check the reviews on this place, which I total regret. 

Here is a short rendition of what I imagined: entering and being greeted by carnival characters  (i.e. A guy on stilts, a happy clown, or a juggling guy on a unicycle); carnival music, non smoking? (Okay I must have been dreaming), just all around fun, clean, and inviting.

Here's what I observed: a dirty casino with the top floor being reserved for boardwalk games tempting kids with their cheap stuffed animals. The place was smokey (more second had smoke for my little son) and so filthy! If you think Vegas is all about money and about attracting the customer beautiful decor, high-end gifts, and clean floors, not Circus Circus.

The only decent thing there was possibly the little flying trapeze act.

This is where kids' carnival dreams go to die!!

I think I've seen the last of Circus Circus unless it has a serious makeover; More kid-centered: better games, prizes, non-smoking, happy faces, CLEAN.",21,10,4

We checked in got our room and keys walked up to the room and the room was dirty, bottles everywhere but housekeeping wasn't finished cleaning rooms on the floor. We booked a room with two beds in the skyrise tower by the way so we went back to check in to tell them that our room wasn't cleaned and some nice lady gave us an upgraded mini suite in the casino tower so we gladly took it. The mini suite was great roomy, clean, bed was comfortable, nice view on quiet floor and service was great to us. We loved our stay here and to get a mini suite as an free upgrade for their mistake was great for us so we couldn't complain. The casino is like every other casino in Vegas.",0,0,0

Make reservations six weeks before we arrived in Vegas for the RV lot. What a disappointment nothing but a big windy dirty dusty parking lot. Small problem when we arrive to could not find our reservations shame on me we came a day early. First night we tried the buffet what a joke I've had better food at the school cafeteria bland no flavor waste of money 36 bucks. Every morning we were awakened by the lovely sounds of all let's build some crap right next door with beat beep beep beep backing up equipment ten o'clock Wednesday morning water for the whole RV park shut off without notice. Called RV front desk no help called hotel front desk put on hold and transferred four different times.. 27 minutes later I walked over to front desk to find the manager still on hold. Went to VIP desk and ask for a manager was told sorry we did not know about the water shut off oh let me buy you a pizza package deal. told manager way past pissed off for just a pizza. Manager manage to comp 1 day .next day notes on doors about water shut off. Right hand does not know what left hand is doing. Price per night during the week was $48 way too expensive. Weekend rates you'll love this $76.00 dollars a night for a freaking parking lot. I've had better luck staying at a Walmart. You can bet your sweet ass I will never spend money there again. One of the best things about the whole deal was getting to walk past the garbage and recycling Center for the hotel to get to the main strip. Just love that smell,0,0,0

Following the advice of fellow yelpers, and expedia-ers, I avoided booking at The Manor room, and spent a little more (not that much more) on the West Tower King. 

I forgot to pack my CSI Spy-Kids Kit, but I was still able to conduct an in-depth inspection of my room. Room was clean, there were no signs of bed bugs, or human remains and the linens appeared fresh. It was safe to say, I was rest assured. 

People have claimed that the linens here are not routinely washed after use. If you happen to get a room, and the blankets smell like bananas..... then yes, the sheets have not been washed, and my bag smashed a bunch of bananas onto the blankets. Sorry. I came here just to run the Rock n Roll Half Marathon, and half marathons makes me eat a lot of bananas. lol.

Some side notes:
- Check-in was a long and tortuous wait. 
- Finding my room was a joke. For some reason, the numbering was off and I was completely lost. I wish the check-in people informed me of this prior.
- No fridge, but Keurig... in the bathroom.
- Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk.
- You are at the dead-end of The Strip.
- Use the monorail to go to hotspots of The Strip. However, getting to the monorail requires more walking. Closest one from the hotel was a street down at The Westgate Hotel.
- If you purchase monorail tickets online, there was a discount for Rock n Roll marathon runners. The ticket booths will charge you full price if purchased in person.
- I hardly stayed in my hotel, so I cannot really comment on it's amenities like the Adventuredome, circus acts or restaurants. Sorry, I have better places to see.... like The M&M Store. Lol.",6,4,2

The room itself was also pretty bad.  I don't expect much from hotels, but two limp pillows and a mattress that felt like a crappy cot didn't make for a restful evening.  I think I would've felt better sleeping on the floor - like, if you aren't even going to try to give me a mattress that makes my back say ""hey, this is ok,"" then don't even bother.

I first have to say the customer service was great & if you are coming to Vegas with kids, this is the place! The gal who checked us in took her time & gave us a a good room on the 17th floor in the Skyrise Tower, quiet hallway.   The room was ok, just a standard hotel room. Our bathtub & sink clogged everyday, so I finally went to the front desk on our last day & talked to a manager, Mary Grace. She was so friendly & switched us to a room on the 19th floor in the West Tower. The rooms were more modern\/updated & in my opinion, nicer & a bit bigger. She also gave us a pass to the buffet for our family. 

Ok so strictly reviewing the hotel, the physical building: it is old, kind of dirty & needs a better ventilation system. I could definitely tell the difference in ventilation when we went in other hotels along the strip. Circus Circus has a strong smoke odor, especially by the casino area. Overall, it is kind of dingy & dirty. The building needs a complete overhaul.

The rooms: we started out in a deluxe two bed room in the Skyrise Tower. The room was somewhat clean (there were pieces of old candy between nightstand & bed) & the bathroom was a good size. The beds were comfortable. These rooms have been updated at some point as the carpet & furnishings seemed to be newer. When we moved to the West Tower the room was a bit bigger, the carpet was stained & air conditioner was not as cold. This room seemed to be newly updated, except the bathroom. 

Adventuredome: Two of my kids got wristbands for all day & my 12 year old was really excited to do laser tag. He went in a few times & said it was just a big open room with a few spots to hide...boring. I played mini-golf with my son who did not get a wristband. It was a crappy, very old mini-golf. He liked it, so I guess that's what counts. Overall, a waste of money for us. If your kids will ride the rides...a good deal.

Buffet: there are five of us, so no matter where we go to eat it is always close too $100, if not over. Buffett was good & two of my kids LOVED the clams! We ate dinner at the buffet twice & breakfast once. The food was good & I recommend the buffet!

Midway & Circus Acts: this was our favorite spot as a family! The circus acts are really good! The shows are about 10-15 minutes & the performances are great! The midway games are so fun. Our favorites were the water gun clown face (pop a balloon) & the toss a chicken in the pot games. There are also arcade type games that dispense tickets. We played air hockey & ms. PAC man. The kids really liked the midway!

Pool & Water Slides: on our first day we got there & checked in. Kids wanted to go to pool & water slides. We found out water slides close at 6 pm & pool at 8 pm. Seems early for water slides, but whatever. We get out to the pool & it is SMALL & CROWDED! Just gave me the hebegebees looking at all the people, you could not have paid me to get in! My kids were even saying ""gross so many people ""! They played is splash pad for a bit. We got up the next morning & headed right to water slides...the kids got down twice when a lifeguard said she thought they should close the slides because a kid with scrapped up knees went down & she thought his knee might have been bleeding. WTF! So, the pool ""engineer"" closed all the slides about 40 min after they opened. 
The other thing about the pool...I had a bottle of water I had bought upstairs at the little snack mart by the casino & the security guard told me I couldn't take it out to the pool because I didn't buy it at the shop right there. I told him I bought it upstairs & he said yeah but it's a rule. So I said you are telling me I can't take water outside in the hot weather. He then told me there were drinking fountains outside or I could buy water from the store right here. What a JOKE! I told the security guard that I needed the water for medical reasons & he could call hotel management if he had a problem with me taking the water to the pool. He didn't say another word. 
If you stay at Circus Circus do not expect to go in the pool unless being packed in like a sardine does not bother you. 

I will not stay here again solely because the building needs to be updated badly! I really appreciated the great customer service & the rooms were ok. The rest of the hotel is in need of major updating. I guess I should expect that for how cheap the rates are.",3,1,1

The hotel is pretty big but is poorly lit and is not clean mostly. The Midway (Arcade area) is huge, but doesn't have a lot of new games.The Adventure Dome is pretty cool and has some nice rides. Circus Circus is caters to families, which is the reason why I don't really like this hotel. I heard that the rooms are dirty and disgusting. After seeing the renovations done at its sister property, (Circus Circus Reno) owned by a private company, I'd have to say that this hotel lags behind its counterpart in terms of cleanliness and appeal.",1,1,1

I'm guessing most of the bad reviews are for the super ""cheap"" rooms in the manor.  I booked a room in the casino tower on a non smoking floor.  I opted for the king suite room which was HUGE and unlike other reviewers said it did not smell like smoke at all and i'm very sensitive to that.  It was very clean and looked updated. The TV had a lot of channels more then most hotels do. Only downside I had was there was no fridge, but it was so cheap and nice that wasn't an issue.  This place is awesome for kids so much to do!  All of the staff I encountered were very nice and helpful, check in was easy and express check out was nice as well.  So do yourself a favor stop griping and try staying in one of the tower rooms its not much more then the super cheap $20 rooms.  I paid $42 for a king suite which had a huge bathroom and lots of room for the little one to run around.  Parking was also easy and felt safe.

I stayed one night at this hotel on the 31st and checked out on the 1st on new years with my boyfriend. The hotel had signs all over the building notifying us to call in for a late check out so the next morning around 10, I called in asking for a late check out and they told me unless we paid $55, they would not give us a late check out. 

So my boyfriend and I totally understood and thought ""Oh because its new years, I bet everyone is trying to check out late so thats why they are probably doing this. Lets just hurry up and check out by 11"" 
I decided to go take a quick shower but the hot water was not working. I left it on for 10 mins but still no hot water. I asked my boyfriend to call the desk and ask them to check it out for us. The lady at the desk merely accused us of lying and that noone else complained and we were just saying this to get a late check out. We complained and told her that we were NOT lying and to send us maintenance at least to the room if she did not believe us. She responded ""no other room has complained, how come your room is the only room with no hot water"" she proceeded to tell us that she was going to charge us 55 more dollars if we were not out of the room by 11. 

We were extremely irritated by her tone of voice and her attitude. I got in the shower HOPING it would turn hot during the middle of my shower but NO HOT WATER. I showered in the cold, checked out at 10:30 and walked over to The Riviera Hotel right across where our other friends were staying and dried my hair there and got ready. 

I cannot believe the attitude the lady at the desk was giving us. We spent 300 dollars on the room for ONE night at the very least we expect HOT WATER. and if not, she should have sent maintenance us right away. We even asked to speak to the supervisor, and she told us that there was no point because she would tell me the same thing and AFTER we checked out my boyfriend called AGAIN to speak to the supervisor and FINALLY they connected us with the manager. We told her the story and she apologized and told us that that should not have happened the way it did and she would email us for a complimentary stay at the hotel. 

Instead, we got an email about a survey about our stay. It was really a horrific way to start the new year with the attitude from the customer service there and having to shower in the cold, and having to walk across to the other hotel in the cold. 

Props to Cheryl the manager who emailed us back with the complimentary room. Other than that worst customer service ever for Las Vegas hotel.",10,8,0

I've been coming to circus since I can remember as a little kid to now as a grown adult with kids of my own. I come here and stay here for a weekend when I'm here with family with kids. I rate them and give them some stars because they are the only casino I think in Las Vegas that's kid friendly. No other casinos are kid friendly besides circus circus!!! In vegas...

They have plenty of games and circus shows and rides and arcades to keep the kids going for a least that weekend you stay. So this casino hotel gets the stars for helping us adults out with the kids..

Now as for a grown up and adult.. I give this casino 1 stars.. I've learned to notice how ghetto and small this casino really is. First of all.. all there machines don't win? Well for my luck.. and also I had a incident with losing my phone and I went straight to security and they are no help whatsoever!!! I asked if they can check there cameras real quick pls to see where I dropped my iphone they said they can't talk about or look at the cameras!! BS.. some type of security surveillance. 

Overall stay.. I lost $1000 in just gambling and plus a $800 iphone for two days in circus circus!!

What can I say?  

Unlike some of the old ""this is Vegas past"" hotels and casinos found downtown (Binions, El Cortez), this place needs to be leveled.  In it's hey day this is where my friends and I would shack up for a cheap weekend on the loose.  We would get one of those motel rooms out back and squeeze six of us into two full sized beds.  But back then it was clean and doable.  Today I wouldn't go anywhere near one of those rooms as the place has really decayed without maintenance since the 1970's.

As soon as you enter this denizen of filth you notice the unmistakable smell which seems to be a concoction of cigs, booze, filth, unclean patrons, and vomit.  Then comes the reality that there are hundreds of loud, out of control children running around loose with twenty bucks in their pockets as they try to win straw stuffed animals and characters from the pseudo midway games.  

The casino looks and feels like it has not been wiped down for decades.  Sticky everywhere you don't want to touch anything unless you are packing a roll of Brawny and a spray bottle of bleach.

This phrase kept running in my head during my one day at Circus, Circus. 

Why only one day, you ask?

Well, my heart couldn't take it.

It wasn't the meth heads or the white, cracked-out trailer park kings or the families of twenty or more with their ginormous asses blocking the walkways, or the creepy gaze of tattooed men staring hard eyes at my 10-yr-old daughter, or the smoky, dark hallways dotted with unwatched and unwashed children, or the hospice-like feel of the midway and its sad, dated video games on life support, or the oversized skating rink feel of the Adventuredome and the Frankenstein-like vibe of its rides like they were all built in a meth-lab-turned-factory with the severed limbs of former discontinued state fair attractions, or the ridiculous prices charged to ride them.

No. It was the hopelessness that the collective images filled me with. The feeling that this is where we're all headed-man and casino alike. That when the glitz and glamour of the casinos of the south side of the Vegas strip began to tire, this is what they'll become. An unkept sarcophagus storing the broken pieces of ourselves that no one wants but the desperate and sick and derelict. 

And that's the problem with Circus Circus. Because Vegas is not supposed to pin you down to the darkest threads of reality. It's supposed to take you away from all of that. The grocery store in your town you can no longer visit at night. The homeless guy you pass by on your way to work every morning. The grungy kid from high school that never stopped being the grungy kid from high school. The Jerry Springer episodes that flash on your television while you're scrolling to CNN. Inner city graffiti, discarded tall boys, young men in trucker hats and baggy jeans gripping the skeletal arms of their young mom girlfriends. Vegas shouldn't remind you of this.

But Circus Circus does.

Unfortunately while sharing adjacent rooms for three nights with my family we were Robbed (so far looks like employee) while we were aseep! Pants with wallet. money. credit cards and keys were taken. We made a report with security and metro police after finding out a female used stolen credit cards (we have pictures in a store of her) tried getting help from so called Risk Management David Garner who won't reply! after showing pictures of female using credit cards and other employees know who she is... Hmmmmm sounds like a cover up since no reply and I was told of my many calls for a week that I'm Harassing them! Really??? You can be robbed and Not safe in the hotel? But if you dare complain or reach out for help Don't bother they cover up for themselves! They truly don't care about their guests only the casino floor where their money is!!! We want the female caught and aressted!!! Thank goodness for REAL detectives (LVMetro) helping us. Now let's wait for a customer service to reply... Hmmmm let's see them say how sorry and concerned that an unfortunate incident happened while our stay. Whatever! how about we will be contacting you to resolve this with an aresst of the girl in the picture and help pay for your loss. Would be nice to say the least.,1,0,0

-Is it just me, or is EVERYONE who works here Chinese\/Philippino? I'm not trying to sound racist, but really... what the hell? 

-When walking in the promenade ""mall"" I guess it was the same day Criss Angel was there, so I was crowded between smelly, sweaty teenagers and if I stopped for not even two seconds a security guard would approach me and tell me to keep walking. This place seriously needs to work on organizing their lines.

-The pool was a lovely shade of brownish green, and if it was a crayon color it would be named Diarrhea Delight. They need to do some serious cleaning in there because not even my little brother wanted to swim. 

-It took me fifteen minutes just to walk to the elevator from the lobby, and I nearly got lost every time. This place is huge. Walking around past the casino and around the whole hotel really isn't fun. Especially when it's 2 in the morning and I just want to go to fucking sleep.

-Everywhere I walked it smelled horrible. Walking around the casino in Circus Circus is like rolling around in an ash tray, naked. Oh, and I just love the drunk ass ghetto guys running around. More entertaining than the circus acts.

-The buffet was GROSS, and for being so expensive you'd expect it to be DECENT at the least. The mashed potatoes were boxed, all the soda tasted like Listerine, and the meat was disgusting. Salad was okay though. Every restaurant in there was so expensive, and definitely not worth it.

-I won't lie, our room was nice, but what the hell was up with the bottom drawer of the cabinet under the TV being fake? I had to cram all the stuff I brought with the other people I stayed with in two drawers. 

Overall, this place is a roach motel for clowns. But if you have kids, they'd probably enjoy it.",3,6,1

I am not joking my brother played basketball a few times and got one in  a hoop and the guys face was expressionless and looked a little mean,and just threw the bear at him. Same with the lady at the water gun shooting game, only me and my brother were playing and I beat my brother and she just gave me a bear, not enthusiastic or anything.

I suggest you not play the claw machines I must have wasted 30 dollars and got nothing, spend your money on getting tickets its much better!

We got there at about 11am, well before check in. Got in line only 3 people in front of us. By the time we got to the counter the line was down the hall. So perfect timing for us. Got to line and asked about early check in and the lady went to go see if the manager would allow it, and they did. And let me say didnt even charge an up fee of sny kind for it. Bumped up to 28th floor of the skytower. And i gotta say as long as we have the kid with us we'll be staying here. 

I read alot about dirty, ghetto old rooms. And ours was anything but that. I work all around and live out of hotels year round, and this room was bad ass. Soft matress clean room plenty for the kiddo to do all around since we werent in the room long  It was my first time here so getting around at first is a little confusing, got lost more than once trying to get back to the car, but once we found the proper parking garage we were golden.

I was stunned and amazed by the amazing customer service Glory and this hotel gave me. The room was very modern and nice. The bathroom was full of granite which gave it a luxurious look. The room had a desk, two lamps, a flatscreen TV with many channels, and a safe. I was also very lucky and won in the hotels casino $800.00. They also have an amazing steakhouse, which gave me a free bottle wine on the house. The customer service at Circus Circus is beyond amazing.

I didn't notice a ""trashy or ghetto"" feel to it.    It's normal, average family people enjoying themselves.  

We stayed in the Skyrise tower on the 21st floor.  Just past the Adventure Dome area.  

You have to enjoy children. They are everywhere-hey, it's a circus people! What else would you expect?  You should enjoy walking if you don't have a car, because it is towards the end of the strip.  We walked just about everywhere. It's ~15-20 min walk to get down to the main part of the strip.   We did use the Deuce bus pass 1 day which was very nice. 

The price is great.. We arrived ~noon.  Not too many people in line and they had a lot of people working the desk so check in was speedy.

I felt like we were staying in an amusement park\/county fair but even better because it was air conditioned, no bugs or hot sun beating down on you for the day.  It was so much fun.  The rides aren't bad for such a small place. Midway games were cheesy but fun.   Reminded me when I was a kid and was given a roll of quarters to play in the arcade when we visited our local amusement park.

The casinos were ok.  We don't gamble much so a few dollars in the penny slots each day made me happy.   At least this one didn't have the strong smoke smell that many of the other ones on the strip had.  Slots of fun  has a pizza smell instead of a smoke. 


Pay attention to the type of traveler you are.  Do you want a lot of service? People waiting on you hand a foot?  Do you hate children?  Do you want to be right on the strip with lots of dance clubs nearby? Do you want trendy decor? Go someplace else. 

This is a good place for families and people who enjoy the simple pleasures and don't mind walking.  Yes, it really can use a coat of paint on the outside-I really think the tent is supposed to be red and not pink.  But remember it's been around a few years.

Watch out for the ""information"" booth when you first get into the lobby.   Silly me, I thought it was a real information booth.   It's a sales pitch for some vacation\/time share thing.

Even at the time, it was considered tacky. They used to have real circus animals and one of the games was to throw balls at an elephants' privates to see if he would scream (one would win a prize.)

If that's you, go to the Wynn, Vdara or someplace else. But if you have kids, this is the place for you. They can keep busy all day in the Adventuredome or the Midway that surrounds the circus act area. McDonald's is right there too, should they get hungry. 

Now for us big folks, there are a number of restaurants and watering holes to choose from, both at the mezzanine level and on the casino floor. The rooms? Well, the West Tower rooms are fairly nice but please stay away from the Manor. That is just a bunch of old motel rooms that are somewhat removed from the main facility. The only advantage to the Manor is that you can park your car next to your room and you don't have to schlep your luggage very far. But now that most luggage comes with wheels, that shouldn't be much of an issue. The nicer rooms are only a few dollars more, and worth it.

Now here's a secret just for you. Don't tell anyone else, OK? Pull your car into Garage 1 and find a parking place on Level 3 (Green). That way you won't have to take the elevator; just walk right through the doors onto the Promenade level, turn right and take the escalator down to the casino level, another right or two and you'll be at the front desk. The elevators servicing the West Tower are close by, too. Very convenient.

1. The casino could use a makeover.  They have newer machines, but everything else is just stale.  It also has the really old smoke smell about it.  Ewww.

2. All of the walkways are now crowded with little kiosks in every opening.  It is just super crowded and cramped.  Not to mention a lot of the people working the kiosks are overly pushy bordering on rude.

3. The Midway is still a fun place to go with kid's because of the circus acts and all of the games.  However they have raised the price of all of the games.  Games that were $.50 are now $2 a pop.  What used to be a fun and affordable day out with your family now costs a mortgage payment!  It was pretty empty as well, maybe its because its to expensive now.

4. The parking is chaotic. It also seems dangerous because no one knows where to go or where to stop.  We were almost hit 4 times just trying to leave and get back out on Industrial\/Dean Martin.

The restaurants and food aren't much better. No Starbucks in the hotel but there is a Krispy Kreme. Bought a milk for my daughters from there along with some donuts to bring back to the room. Donuts were great the milk was bad I just dumped it.

We did go to the buffet. Awful! Don't waste the money I can get better food going to golden corral. The place was clean but not worth the price go elsewhere.

Spend the extra money elsewhere to get something better I wish I did.  Circus Circus is so far away from everything else on the strip you'll have to drive or take a can to get to anything. The monorails don't even go out that far.

However, recently when me and my significant other booked a 2-night stay at Circus Circus,  we were shocked by the way we were treated and antagonized after reporting that bugs were in our room. The day that we checked in was Wednesday,  and we pretty much was only able to do dinner and rest for the remainder of the night since we were exhausted from traveling. The next morning my significant other woke up with (2) bumps on her forehead and (2) bites on her left arm--  the size of a penny. We headed down the strip to the LINQ for a arranged brunch at Chayo Mexican Lounge. We ordered and enjoyed the view, until we noticed that the bites started to increase in the sun, spread bigger and inflamed. Her arm and her face started to itch tremendously. We then concluded that it was a bug bite...we went back to the hotel where we gave a statement, they then gave us another room, not to mention the bell boy never came to transport our baggage and we had to do it ourselves. They took a statement and told us our clothes would be laundered.

My significant other was stuck in the room all night, and Circus Circus staff had nothing to offer her for treatment. They told us it's a CVS down the street,  we didn't drive out so I had to walk about 3 blocks to Walgreens to pick up medical supplies to treat my significant other.  We were stuck in the room all night while she itched and scratched as her bumps began to get more inflamed and bigger. At this point we were outraged at the amount of effort we were not seeing from Circus Circus to accommodate us.  In the morning we called their risk management dept. and they first said they couldn't  help us until the investigation was over which would probably be 2 days after we had left, which made no sense...they then told us we could get another day in the new room we had only if we paid 91$ , which was about the normal amount for a room according to the sites I checked the day before.  They finally offered a 6pm checkout time on Friday, which made no sense, because we didn't know who would be checking in after us at 6pm. We accepted it because we lost out on all the events that were booked on Thursday night.  

We left and came back Friday at 5:20pm, and we are locked out of our room. We headed down to the front desk where we asked about our key cards, they said it had  been de-magnetized, but my card and my significant others cards were nowhere near any magnetics at all.  They reissued the cards; it's about 5:45 now and we have to rush to the room to pack. We're still waiting on the rest of the laundered clothes at this point, so we call countless people including supervisors, managers, security, everyone who should know something didn't know anything.   We waited till about 6:25pm and finally got the bag that never got laundered at all from the manager himself. So we possibly could have taken bed bugs back to our home  since they didn't  take care of this situation...it's now Monday and we haven't heard anything from them since Friday! 

Better Business Bureau and Risk Management have both been contacted and we still haven't had no follow-up.",0,0,0

GOOD - The price was great, even in the newer towers ($29\/night). However there was a ""resort fee"" added per night...but the cost was still not bad.
The Circus acts were GREAT. My kids really enjoyed seeing the acts. 
The Adventuresome was fun. With the discount coupon you receive on check-in the price is reasonable & the lines were not long at all so all day riding did not become all day waiting in line.
The rooms were really good considering the price. Don't expect the opulence of the bigger swankier hotels more centrally located on the strip.

NOT SO GOOD -
The advertise a ""water park"" which is actually 3 slides, 2 pools, a kiddie play area & a hot rub! Our local YMCA has a better ""water park"" than this. Although admission to the ""water park"" is included in your ""resort fee"" it was not exclusively for hotel guest. It was VERY crowded & although my sons were able to get in the pool, it was so congested that playing & swimming meant constantly bumping into on having others bump into you. The seats by the pool are ""reserved"" & cost $40...for a lounge chair!!

BAD - In the land of plentiful buffets & restaurants galore, the Circus Circus buffet was absolutely the WORSE I have experienced in Vegas. The options were limited & the food was not that tasty. The floors near the serve yourself drink station was sticky. Just bad all the way around.",1,1,2

I kind of like this seedy little place.  The location is great and I like the layout inside.  I highly recommend the Slots of Fun out back - pure gambling bliss at insanely cheap prices.  

The Adventuredome is great for kids, though last time I went I found it pretty lameo.  The carnival games area is the best though - first time I was here as a kid I won SO many stuffed animals that I had to give some away because I wouldn't have been able to get them all home on the plane.

Ive stayed in Circus Circus  twice. First time I was like 10 years old (25 right now) and it was in the manor rooms this was ok. Though i went there a lot every time i go to vegas.

2nd time was in June and the place has changed a bit room wise. I went for free through the MyVegas game on Facebook. Got a West Tower Room. The room was renovated clean with a flat screen. For people saying why pay for the resort fee. most hotels on the strip have them only way to get around them is with player comp which i use for my other times in Vegas.  The check in was fast as i had a comp card that had its own line.

To get back onto the room yes I know I got in for free but I did check the room to see what bargain I was getting. The rooms for the price are great for a Sunday-Thursday at about $30 is a great deal. Yes its far from the strip but just use the bus( quick tip if you buy your day pass from a local bus its only $5 not $7 like the deuce) Yes you can pay more for luxury and so on but come on if your in Vegas the room is only for some certain things, sleep, shower, hold your stuff. Not going to lie when I have comp i get the best room I can get but who doesn't.

The resort is what it is its made for children and people not really into gambling. yes it has its stuff but this place is a budget resort. The pool is for kids no adult partying in this place, but you can get to most hotel's pools now if you pay. The food is alright its not great. I would just make the short trip to Wynn\/Encore for better food. Adventuredome needs new rides it had the same stuff when i was a kid i only went there to not waste the free coupon.  

Conclusion. If you are looking something close to the strip to just walk this place is not really for you but as I said their are ways to get there for cheap. The room is what it is great value for a nice room. You get what you pay for but just remember all you need in Vegas is that room to have fun with. gambling dining clubbing are what your there for anyways. So why not save on the room to get more money for that.  yes there is a $10 a night resort fee but thats cheap the nice hotels charge $15-20. Just remember if you have a chance in vegas get every casinos comp card it will save you headaches they charge the cheapest online and usually wave the fees. 3rd party website are only good for non gambling casinos.

hoped this helps ignore the 1 star reviews they were looking for luxury while paying the price for regular. Of course your going to get that. Thats why the expensive hotels cost that much.",1,1,0

I never knew Circus Circus had a carnival like area, (but I should have guess from the name of the hotel...) until my bf took me here. I'm not sure how much rides are because everything was closing or closed when we arrived at 5:45 on a weekday. They have a bunch of booths set up just like a carnival! I saw some water shooting games, darts, ball throws, basketball tosses, etc. They have lasertag and I think mini golf as well. If you have small kids I think they would really enjoy the Adventure Dome. 

We walked through the casino and went upstairs to more games and had a lot of fun. Its a good place for a date, kind of reminds me of Dave N Busters or Game Works back in CA. Casino was ok, nothing that stood out to me. We did end up playing some roulette.",0,0,0

Drank at some bar on the 2nd floor while watching a college football game and waiting for my family to be done in the carnival game room.  Got carded and everything.  Hoorah!

Played some games, won some prizes, gave some to my future gf (now ex) when I got back home, and gave the rest to my little sister.

That new mini-amusement park they added here that they charge admission to is HELLA GHETTO!  Makes this Circus Circus more ghetto than the one up in Reno.

My friends and I wandered over to this end of the strip and pulled an all nighter. I ended up sitting down at one of the bars that is right near the beer pong tables and casino cashier to play some video poker while my husband and 2 other friends wandered around elsewhere in the casino. So anyways I ask the bartender for some change so I can tip him, since I only had a 20 and he told me he couldn't give change, it is a policy but that the cashier was over to my right and I could get change from them. The problem was that I was by myself, had money in the video poker machine, and a drink...I was not about to leave it alone at 2am with the trashed people playing beer pong behind me. What upset me even more about the whole situation was that one of the managers was behind the bar helping out the bar tender because he was new-so when I had asked for change he said let me ask my manager, and then his manager told him the BS policy, and talked about me like I wasn't 2 feet away from him, didn't have the courtesy to acknowledge that I was even there , ""She can go to the cashier, its right there"" That is just rude! Especially since I was obviously spending my money at that bar, and would have stayed longer had the manager not been such an asshole!
Anyways so I cashed out of the video poker and went to find my friends because I was getting hungry. They were hungry too so we tried to find some food in Circus Circus...the only food they claimed that was open at that time of night (2-3am) was their crappy appetizers from another bar in the casino. We asked if there were any restaurants near by, or any open ones in any of the nearby hotels, they said no. 3 of 4 of us decided to just order some of the appetizers they offered. We got the sliders which were surprisingly tasty and then some sort of artichoke dip that was just meh. Then we headed across the street to the Riviera, where my husband found am Irish type pub with a full menu open 24hours. He had a nice chicken and mushroom pot pie. I was pissed. LOL

We had an awesome time!!! My expectations were really low because of all the yelp bad reviews but was amazed. A lot of fun games for kids and adults at the midway and we enjoyed 3 circus type shows for free :) Here are some tips but first... is you like glam and wow DO NOT stay here and DO NOT compare Circus Circus to the other casinos ... each casino is different for a reason. I strongly recommend Circus Circus for families visiting Las Vegas. Keep in mind they do have a resort fee but internet is included, $ 9.95 per night. READ READ before you book any room!! This is stated on their website btw. 

Tips:

1. Before you visit casino\/hotel look at the casino\/hotel layout and that way you will know where everything is! ( they have a map\/layout of casino on their website) or you can just google it.

2. STAY AWAY manor building. Its an old motel across the street from the casino..it's a walk! and that's why it's so cheap. Duh!

3. We stayed in the main casino tower and our room was remodeled , nice flat screen tv and our room was BIG and CLEAN. This tower was quiet and we never had to wait for an elevator. Also we were closer to the MIDWAY. Stay here :) the west tower in more crowded so if you want fun and want a quiet room stay at the casino tower.",9,0,0

There were a lot of flashing lights, which bothered me as an epileptic. Also, the place felt dingy and smelled a little gross (which seems to be a standard for anything in Vegas that doubles as a casino).

It was my first trip, but like most Californians, my cousins are Vegas experts.  They knew everywhere to go and the best places to see.  I had such a great time that I came back and told my friends all about it.  They made me promise to go to Vegas with them.  I glibly agreed.

When it came time to plan the trip they asked my advice about where to stay.  I told them a few nice places on the strip.  Then when it came time to book the flight my friend saw a flight+hotel deal that she thought was too good to pass up.  The hotel was Circus Circus.  She asked my opinion and I told her that this is the one place that I know to avoid.  She didn't take my advice and we ended up staying at Circus Virus...I mean Circus Circus.

I assume that most people stay here either because they have children or because it is cheap.  If you have children, this is an okay place to stay because it is away from the flashy sin on the strip and they have carnival games and a McDonalds on location.  

However, if you stay here trying to save money, you have made a mistake.  There are plenty of good deals to stay at NICE places on the strip.  Staying at Circus Circus forces you to take cabs to get everywhere.  When you stay on the strip you can walk to everywhere that you want to go.

When you walk into Circus Circus you see the vestiges of the great hotel that it used to be.  I am sure that when it opened it was thought to be fabulous.  However, compared to the other hotels that are on the strip it looks shabby, worn down, and kind of sad.",3,4,2

Room: Upgrades to a Casino Tower Room. They were decent looking as you walked in until you saw the stains on the sheets . There were pieces of trash in the back of the head board . And the toilet wouldn't flush . We had to call maintenance for assistance . Overall, the room was ehhh. 

Price : We paid about $90 per night which is not much but on average this hotel is $25 per night . There was a $70 per night plus a $17 additional charge per night that I requested for an ""upgrade ""  to the best quality room. ( casino tower ). I was better off staying somewhere kid friendly off the strip . 

Environment : Not as kid friendly as I thought it should be. People looked sketchy here , I didn't feel comfortable . The people hired to work here , you can tell don't really care about making this about the kids . Overall disappointment . You are the only casino to have the opportunity to make this about the kids ! And you fall way short .

Pool: the worst part . My daughter loves the water and enjoys pools. Within 20 minutes , the lifeguards yelled at everyone to exit the pool. It seemed urgent . We really had no idea what was going on, until swimmers began saying there was poop in the water ! GROSS. The worst part is that within 10 minutes they allowed everyone back into the water. No drainage . Nothing. I didn't even see if there was any type of solution. That's when we grabbed our stuff and left immediately .


Overall, Never again. Not worth trying . I simply stayed here for my daughter and it ended up being a nightmare. Better off staying somewhere much nicer and taking a drive to the Adventuredome.

DONT STAY HERE!",8,4,1

The front desk transferred me to a supervisor, I waited for a couple of mins, no one respond, I hung up and called the front desk again. Then I finally talked to a fat white woman supervisor. I told her u don't need to apologize, u r just a supervisor, u r not responsible for cleaning the room. It's ur staff's fault who didn't clean the room. But since this is ur hotel's fault. I need refund. She only says she could change me to a clean room, but she said I booked on Expedia.com, I can't get back my money, neither reservation, nor resort fee. I was tired and sleepy and also frustrated cuz it was almost 3 am in the morning and I was given a disgusting room and I walked a long way from self parking to lobby front desk 2 times which cost me 10-15 mins walking each direction. I insist it's hotel's fault, I deserve my money back and 3 days' free stay. The fat white woman just say NO and called the security and forced my friend and I to leave. I never use any single dirty word, nor did I insult her. I was just insisting my rights and hotel's fault. The fat white woman just refused to admit it and refused to refund me anything. Now it's almost 4 am. I walked across street to Rivera Hotel, however all the rooms r full. Now My friend and I have no where to go, we r freaking tired, sleepy and frustrated. I will sue Circus Circus in court for my legal rights! Tips: never ever book any room in Circus Circus, lousy management, bad staff, unreasonable people. I bet Circus Circus is the only bad hotel on strip. Just don't book this hotel no matter how cheap it is. U will feel sorry for ur money spent on Circus Circus even a cent.",5,3,3

Let me say that I have very high standards when it comes to the cleanliness and safety of hotels, and I still found Circus Circus to be fantastic.

Our room was spotless, and cleaned and maintained brilliantly by the housekeeping staff. The bed was really comfortable, there was lots of storage space, the bathroom was big and came with lots of clean towels, shampoo, soap, etc. A coffee machine, hairdryer and two safes were also provided. The air conditioning worked perfectly (albeit loudly) and with 40degrees heat outside, this was hugely important.

The hotel in general, like most Vegas hotels, was like a city in itself. In addition to the casino, there was a huge variety of restaurants, shops and bars within the hotel, as well as an oxygen bar, a kids theme park and of course the obligatory wedding chapel. We didn't use the pool or gym, but it was nice having those options on hand.

There's a lovely McDonalds (seriously, really clean and the nicest staff ever) and a Subway right outside. 

Yes, the hotel is a bit of a walk from the main strip (30-45 mins based on how fast you can walk in the heat) but really, that's obvious from looking at a map. You can't book a hotel and then complain about the location afterwards.

I had no problem with any of the other guests whatsoever. At the end of the day, you're in Las Vegas, if the sight of drunk young people or old people smoking at casinos bothers you, you've come to the wrong city. (For the record, there was very few of either of these examples in Circus Circus)

Only complaint was that we waited in line 25 minutes after check in just to get into an elevator! I realise that at peak tourist season at check in time there will always be lines, but I've never encountered such a long line in any other hotel just to get an elevator.

It's not the most luxurious hotel in Vegas by any means but unless I become a millionaire between now and my next trip to Vegas, I would happily stay here again.",3,3,1

The room we booked ended up being in this weird offset barracks area instead of being attached to the main hotel.  It was a hike just to get to the strip.

I played poker here with a bunch of degenerates and every day gamblers.  I won $35, which was nice.

The one shining star: There's a taco place in the food court, which had cheap and good food.  Nothing amazing, but they actually made their carnitas there.

If you MUST bring your kids to Vegas, this might be a good place to stay--there were tons of kids there.  But Vegas with the kids?  Really?  Are you sure that's a good idea?  How about ANYWHERE ELSE?!  Or leave them at Grandma's.

We check in go into our room and there's a blood stain on the ceiling, walls, chair it looks like someone was murdered in our room! Then you go into the bathroom there was mold everywhere!!! So we decided to go down to the lobby to complain. We get attacked by the time share people. They tell us to go on the tour we get free stuff so we had nothing to do so they said put $40 down you'll get it back after the tour. They said wait here for the shuttle so we waited shuttle was full they said we are gonna go in a cab we will give you the cash. We are about to go in the cab and they say sorry we don't have cash can you pay for it and we will reimburse you. Hell no! We said no we have no cash and all of a sudden cash appeared.

Worst place to stay in Vegas! 
They just don't care! 
We made a reservation because my daughter had Cheer Nationals in Vegas and we thought this place maybe a kid friendly environment which it was geared toward kids with the Adventure dome and such. When we arrived first thing out of the car I noticed the awful stench of rotten trash in the over crowded parking structure and figured well that's Vegas baby. Oh no as we waited in line to check in I observed the walks of life this place attracted and the dirt caked on the carpet. In my mind I was thinking this is already not where I wanted to stay, but it was midnight and we needed to get some rest after a 4hr trip turned into 6 hrs. due to a fatal accident on the way in. As our turn came to check in we were greeted by a lady and she looked up our reservation as it was brought up we noticed the charges did not match what we booked. Hotel taxes and room rates were increased only a few dollars but that wasn't the point. The point was it was inaccurate! Well we were tired and just wanted to hit the sack so we paid and were going to deal with the issue at check out. The lady hands us our cards gets a map and write floor 5 and room 099 and directs us on the map how to find the room. So we proceed to follow the instructions. While trying to locate the room carrying bags of luggage and dragging two kids around for a 1\/2 hr. we were unsuccessful locating such a room on the 5th floor of 099. Mad as hell as we walked back to the check in I slipped on a flight of stairs that had a plastic edge wearing flip flops and landed flat on my back. Writhing in pain for about 10 Min's. not one person even security walked over to me and asked if I was OK! And yes they saw! Finally making it to check out tired and in pain we asked to speak to the night manager. We explained out situation to him and asked what can he do for us. This guy was a young little punk with and attitude and should never of been put in a position as a manager. He did nothing but offer a extended check out time from 10 a.m. up to 1 p.m. OH YAY GEE thanks! So he resets our room cards and tells us floor 9 and the room number. After 10 Min's. we arrive finally. The room was a standard 2 queen beds and didn't appear all that bad comparable to a Motel 6. 
Morning arrives and is my daughters big day. We hop in the shower and first thing we notice was black mildew all along tub\/shower line wall OMG REALLY! I have pictures of this gross and unhealthful environment. In horror and getting out of the shower I grab a bath towel again notice a problem not so much for me but my other half. They only provided 4 bath towels, Zero hand towels and Zero wash cloths. Running down a maid service problem was fixed but the point was these things should of been taken care of before hand. The entire day we were at the competition and visiting around town. We ate dinner at The Garden Grill in the Hotel before we went back to our room. Another horrible experience in itself. We were seated in a booth that the backrest of was loose and coming apart with on the other side a larger man was seated and every time he sat back it popped the backrest approx. 6"" into my other half's backside violently. So we decided to relocate and mention it to the waitress. After that we heard the words chingada being used as she conversed with another waitress about us. We did not arrive back to the room until midnight and just went to bed. The next morning we packed up and wanted to get out of there. I think with our experiences we were just done with this place and decided to get one last shower before check out. The hell continues as my lady steps out of the shower I hear Oh MY GOD EWWWWWEEEE! I was thinking holy crude what now!!! Yes ladies and gentlemen when you thought this couldn't get worse well it did! She almost stepped on a cockroach getting out of the shower!!! Unbelievable!!! I scooped it up in a cup and wrapped it in the plastic trash bag to take to the check out lady. We finished and went to check out. I calmly handed the lady the plastic bag with the cockroach in it and asked in a very loud voice ""Would you be willing to pay for a room that had these in it"" She responded by setting the bag in the trash by her desk and said no in a hushed voice. We proceeded to tell her about our problems in detail and show her our photos. We asked what are you willing to do for us? She replied the best we can do for you is credit 1\/2 a days stay and all the hotel taxes. Again we were unhappy and were tempted to dispute charges. 
We promised the kids we would take them to the Adventure Dome for some fun. This is how they get 1 Star! Now this part was geared for kids and have to admit I even had a bit of fun on the rides. We bought a unlimited day pass which was reasonably priced.

 The second time, I decided to stay here again when I was the legal gambling age and drinking age.  I barely slept  in our room.  I managed to stay awake with minimal naps, redbull, candy, Krispy Kreme and coffee.  We stayed above the casino and the room was remodeled.  The beds were comfy.  We had a nice view of the strip.  Great pressure in the shower and the hot water maintained.  I don't smoke, neither my husband, so when we were in the casino the ventilation wasn't that good.  But they didn't pass the law in Hawaii yet (no smoking in restaurant, indoors, smoking has to be 20 ft. from any building etc.) so it was bearable.  

For my most recent stay, I traveled with my family and my parents. We stayed here for six days. My oldest child is 8 and my youngest is 17 months.  We stayed in the manor lodge.  It's the farthest away from the casino, about half a block.  There is an indoor bridge that helps you get there in a few minutes.   Parking is located in front or in back of the building. 

There is no smoking allowed in the manor lodge that we stayed at.  The room was a decent size.  We got two queen size beds, which were nice and comfy. There is NO refrigerator, but a cooler instead.  There is No microwave.  We were on the ground floor and it was pretty quite through our whole stay.  The wall paper was peeling a bit, but that didn't bother my family.  We had a bathtub, good shower pressure, and it stayed hot through out my shower.  However, when I turned it up to a certain degree you could hear the pipes banging each other.  This also happened to the other room near us.  But I could only hear it when I was in the bathroom.  

The room had a decent flat screen  tv that showed about 20 channels.  Two of it had children shows.  It had a safe but you had to pay to use it each time.  The housekeeper came around at 9:30 am.  

I didn't realize on my last two stays but they have 2 outdoor pools.  Its underneath the bridge and closest to manor lodge.  Everyday it was filled with families.  We didn't use it because the heat was just to unbearable for me.  My oldest son asked a few times, but I offered to go to the midway instead.

The Casino:  
The ventilation has improved, but at certain times you can smell the smoke. Servers would come periodically any time of the day and offered drinks.  Security is pretty on it in ensuring your kids are just passing through and not watching you gamble.  

Midway:
Circus Circus has the world's largest permanent indoor Circus.  There's a good assorment of games that you would find at the carnival.  About 200 according to our hotel pamphlet.  They also have a good amount of arcade games.  There are a few games where your child will win no matter what, as long as there under 12.  Thre are also FREE cirucus acts almost every hour.  We watched about 5 acts and there were all worth your time. C'mon, it's FREE.  At Midway they have a McDonald's in the area and a spinning carousel type of snack area that sells hot dogs, gelato and other carnival type of snacks.   

The Adventuresome Theme Park:  
If you have kids 12 and under make sure to stop at the Adventure Dome.  Check out my review for this place:

    The buffet, unfortunately,   is underwhelming.

    Because the crowds are sparse, idiots are using hardened nails or something to scratch mirrors and stainless steel elevator doors.

    The room was pretty good, decent TV, it sat in a monstrous wood thing.  Room seemed fairly recently remodelled, no worn carpet or anything, no complaints.  It was stuffy when we first got to the room because of the ""green"" ac\/ heater \/ air circulator that won't go on until it senses motion ( unless overridden ).  That is stupid  IMHO.  First impressions count.

    The trapeze act I saw was impressive.  I was playing slots on on the floor, and the way they have it arranged, there were bleacher seats above me for the families, but I could see the show from a level below.  They were very talented, but had sort of a ""mail it in"" feel, because the crowds were sparse.  They were also easy on the eyes.

    Payout percentages on slots seemed OK.  I was up but of course started betting more with ""house money"" and gave it back.

To this day I wonder why, if they had gone to such expense, had the bride-and-groom-to-be opted for a ceremony as tacky as this? Were they going to watch the full-fledged circus acts afterwards?

I am so happy that we decided to come ahead just in case we didn't think the scene was suitable for our little one.

We went for the upgraded rooms and it felt worse than staying at a Motel 6. 

The whole casino is horrible beginning from the NON EXISTENT POKER ROOM That they advertise online. To he horrible stink! Let alone THE HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! 

We checked IN RIGHT PAST MIDNIGHT We checked out 3 HOURS AFTER CHECK IN. Nobody in the front desk seemed bothered by the disgust look in our faces. 

When we explained about the moldy wallpaper and rusty bathtub\/ sink. They proceeded to tell us that we were actually in the ""newly Renovated"" tower therefore there was nothing else they could accommodate us with.

Needless to say, We decided against bringing our daughter and siblings with us. We left to the RIO hotel and casino.BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE!!!!!

It decayed it into a rundown motel status with a Harrah like cheap buffet food. New carpeting should be needed.  Rooms are a joke and you can get the same hotel price in the newer hotels like Luxor.

If there's any redeeming value, it's the fact that besides Treasure Island and Sahara, this is place where you dump the kids and give them $20 to spend on ridiculous carnival games. Some of those games reminded me that they are preparing kids to life of gambling.  Some of those games have risk involve where they can gamble their prize for a bigger prize if they can repeat the win. Yikes!

If the accountants and execs at MGM are wondering why their company is hemorrhaging cash Circus Circus is the place to look. The property is in tear down condition and no one is in the Casino. There is an entire floor of games but I still wouldn't bring kids here. The Luxor is a much better place to take your family, please don't take them here. Two stars only because the price is right.

MGM executives, board members, and shareholders. I am now talking directly to you. Circus Circus is breathing it's last breaths. The selling of gaudy Mercedes and Playboy branded rapper\/thug necklaces tells me this. No educated person(people with money) would wear these. Casino\/hotel competition is pretty stiff.

I give it four stars because it's the only family friendly hotel on the strip. Quality wise the hotel is old, smelly and crowded. The worse thing about it is you have ever to walk through the gaming areas to get anywhere, which means you have to inhale a lot of second hand smoke. 

If you could put up with these down sides, it's pretty decent considering the family stuff,big rooms and great price. Lots of couples and singles stay here because of the price and being in the strip.

Though it's on the strip, it's a distance away from the ""main"" strop. A good twenty minutes walk to Bellagio, that's like an hour in 100 plus heat! However, the good news is gets a bus stop right in front and you dun have to stand in the sun to wait for it too. Buy a day or three day bus pass and you'll be right with this hotel.

Do your self a favor and stay away as far as possible from this place and specially the manors. We stayed here because my parents swore by it. I have never heard anything good abut this place and it was last minute but I thought ""how bad could it be""? Bad couldn't prepare me for what I was going to experience. The rooms are out dated and poorly maintained. I would rather sleep in my car that stay a night at circus circus and one of its manor rooms. The first thing we noticed was the odd smell in the room. Almost as if it hadn't been aired for weeks. We wanted to give it a chance but things just got worst. We noticed a stain on our sheets and couldn't take a shower because of how dirty the bathtub was. We left to shower at a family members room and called maintenance and house keeping to address the issue. We came back hours later to find that the sheets had Ben changed but the pillow cases were turned and fluffed. There was even blood stains on one of the pillowcases. Spoke to a manager who moved us room to another down the hall and when I told them I wanted to get out, she replied with ""well I'm booked, I can't give you a room I don't have. I can how ever give you tickets to our buffet for 2"". Reluctantly we moved 4 doors down to a very similar room, where there was stains on the head board and the paper wall was pealing from what looked like moisture. There was no coffee maker, no extra towels not even a water. The room walls are so thin we could hear our neighbors T.V playing all night. It was incredibly hard to sleep. Check out was at 11 and even after all that we had been through a lady from room service tried to open out door at 10:40am to try and clean. They did a poor job at handling us as a guest. They did deliver on the 2 buffet tickets, but after seeing how they maintained the property and how they handled guest, I ran for the hills. Don't ever stay in this place specially the manor.

They said they were fully booked. This was Tuesday morning. Really, CC? Fully booked?? I found it very, very hard to believe that they are somehow the only hotel on the strip that was fully booked. This forced me to a)sleep in the car and deal with everything wrong with that situation, or b) cough up money we planned for other things for a room at another hotel. Forced us to pay for another night at another hotel. Left a bad taste in my mouth, especially after the girl at the desk gave a longer diatribe about how ""she's not hiding rooms from us and she leaves when she leaves so she doesn't care and there's nothing I can do deal with it."" It was 5AM and we just drove all night. There's a time and a place where that's acceptable, funny even, but that wasn't it.
Stayed on the 29th floor of the West Tower this time. I liked it! In my opinion, it is the nicest tower. My family got ""upgraded"" to the Casino Tower but it's very dated and out of the way in terms of location. The room was spacious, water precious was awesome and it honestly I've gotten a lot less for a lot more in Vegas. They let us stay until 3PM for $20 instead of $70 on Friday due to noisy neighbors and that was really nice of them.  My only qualm is parking... I suppose I got spoiled by the Skyrise Tower last time as it has its own separate garage. Parking for all other towers is horrible. No supervision (but free!), people hitting and scraping cars, ridiculous. But then again, that's not CC's fault. A bigger covered garage would be nice though.

It is a decent hotel with the basic amenities, in a slightly more kid friendly environment than the other hotels. The pool is not the scene that it can be at times with the other hotels though.

I would suggest using priceline.com or hotels.com etc to get a hotel, I have done that and ended up here for all but one of my Circus Circus stays. It is an older hotel with a different ambience than many of the other casinos. 

There is a shuttle that will take you from one end of the strip to the other cheaply that leaves from here multiple times a day as well as cabs cruising up and down the strip. If you like to get in a workout, its a nice walk to work out those sore muscles after a car or plane ride to some of the other hotels.

The pool is bare bones basic. The casino is reasonable but nothing that I play too much at. The midway shows are fun for all and no other hotel has the free circus\/midway acts that they do here. They also have the kid allowed gaming area which is a fun place even for adults to enjoy.

I had to wash all of my clothes because they stunk so bad (even the clothes I didn't wear and some of the brand new ones I had bought) we were in a non smoking room, well I couldn't tell that we were.  You could also hear everything going on outside our door even whispered conversations!  They should knock down those roach motel buildings outback and build a brand new tower.  You could tell also that they do not change their sheets or wash the covers often. They had a coffee pot but inside the tiny bathroom!!!  So unsanitary.  Their 150 dollar rate was a waste of my money. I went to bed at around 4 am and I was packed and checked out by 7 am that morning.  That is how bad of a stay we had.",1,0,0

So I decide to do a quick vacation.  Eight days. Fly out and arrive early.  Got upgraded, and checked-in early, etc.  Awesome!  Everything is going fine.  Found one dirty towel and threw it by the door.  No big deal.  I was anxious to hit the casino floor and check out the huge amusement park-type hotel.

It was my first time in Vegas and I'm stoked!!!

Never got to experience any of the restaurants, but there's a McDonald's upstairs in the circus game area.  They give you a receipt coupon thing for a freebie for next day if you do a quick survey.

So I played a ton of slots and got lucky.  Did the free $15 coupon in chips for $10.  Mind you they're only for play and can't be cashed in.

Checked out the kiosk for an emerald necklace for mom.  Rachel is right.  They are pushy.  What went from $55 went down to $40.  ""I'll be back I promise, I'm here for another week.""  ""$35""  ""Deal.  Tomorrow though!""

Went swimming.  It was hot out!!!!!

And sooooo..... I guess after I ventured across the street and got drugged I misbehaved and knocked a few things over in the gift shop.

Ended up in the hospital, etc.  (embarrassing)

After I got out had to get new key to my room, couldn't get in, had to get housekeeping call security and they came.  Big guy question me, then cute security lady with short hair and gun said I was being evicted because.....

Whatever.

She commented that I was one of the most polite evictees she's come across in a while.  Probably why she needs the gun (HA!)

So they allow me to gather my things and cash out my chips in the safe.  I payed via a booking site so I had to go back through them about finding a new place.

The booking company actually refunded me and was in the process of trying to help me find a new place.  Almost an hour phone call and being on hold and yadi yada yada they tell me Circus said you can come back, but we have to rebook you since we just refunded you.

Instant bust!  Money is limbo now.  Plus I was still confused\/mad\/embarrassed. I dunno.

Cute hotel.  Dirt cheap.  Super small drinks (compared to Wynn).

My takeaway is that it's cheap and affordable and not a bad place.  Some things like need improvement like more employees during busy times at front desk and maybe bigger glasses for cocktails.  Also I couldn't figure out the buffet.  It was always roped off.  The frozen drinks are amazing.  You can get a plastic sippie and get it refilled.  Not just frozen, you can do bloodys too.

Also Concierge needs an attitude check.  Prior to my departure I needed a new keycard.  I was now a Players Plus member so I didn't need to stand in the ridiculously long line. Someone had jumped in front of me and was paying cash and so I went to the concierge desk to ask can someone else help me with getting a key card replacement; can you get a manager to help me, etc.  I had to go to the bathroom...grrr!  They point to the line where the dude jumped in front of me and says that guy at the desk is the mgr.  Oh also there wasn't anyone at that desk for a hot minute.  Nonetheless, they could have told the Mail & Information Desk also does key re-issues.  Complete fail.

(Most of the staff was polite, even while I was getting the boot.)

Anyway...even though I got kicked out I enjoyed the place.  Really missed out on the amusement portion though.  Bummer!

Hopefully I can check out the rides when I'm back in December!

We went for the cheapest casino we could find to supplement our hiking in the area vacation. We do this once a winter. 

The bad:
We were put in the back 40.

Want a quick drink and stagger to your room.

The last time we were in las,  we stayed at a competitors hotel. It was an Internet deal also yet they put us in the towers associated with the casino. 
They got us to spend money on alcohol. 
Gambling. And great bar seafood ( wasn't cheap) 

Perhaps we got the trailer park quality because the hotel knew we used a travel site to book?

Advise.  
Don't stay here or bring your kids unless you can confirm you are in a tower with elevators that dump you into the main casino.

If you have kids\/a family, this resort\/casino is definitely geared towards them with the midway, the on site indoor theme park (The Adventuredome) and the shows & events they offer. 

I can only give it 2 stars due to the fact that it looks so dated from the outside and the lobby and some public spaces are not in great condition and are pretty filthy in places. Also, while this place is amazingly cheap to stay at (especially for Vegas and considering it's only a stones' throw from the strip. Rooms on Sun. - Thurs. nights were going for $26\/night on Expedia and I'm sure you can probably find them cheaper if you search around.) those cheap rates are both a blessing and a curse; Because it's so cheap to stay here, it appears that a lot of dirty asses end up at this hotel. During my 1 afternoon here I saw several groups that were missing teeth, appeared to be unbathed and were pushing a stroller with one hand while drinking a can of Natty Light with the other. 

One special treat to look forward to is when you're in the taxi line to leave this place. Rather than simply have taxis que up near the entrance, they're held just around the corner and out of sight from the hotel lobby. They have an attendant who asks where you're going and then she blows this deafeningly loud whistle (seriously, the whistles that NFL referees use have nothing on this woman!) to signal the next taxi to come and pick you up. God help you if you're the 10th person deep in line or if you're suffering a hangover, as you'll hear this whistle over and over, splitting your ear drums each time until you're placed in a cab and put out of your misery.",4,4,2

However, I unconsciously gravitated towards this strange destination for two additional reasons:

-Generational reasons:  my father passed-through here in the 1960s, back when James Bond graced the place with his motion picture presence  
- Confirming ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" Mental Images - I had to see the rotating bar,  morphing carpet and the 2013 experience of the American Dream

With eyes wide open as to see how much luxury downshifting I was going have to endure, I walked into the lobby, unfortunately without a head full of acid, confronting a check-in line that took about 20% longer than normal.  Although there were no moving carpet designs, the lobby did have cool clown art you can get lost in.  While heading to the elevators, I confirmed my stereotypes: an endless number of overweight blue collar folks, marching along with their three foot margarita plastic cups, using this ancient amalgamation of anachronistic building structures as the ground of their Vegas experience, venturing-out for mercurial walks up-and-down the strip to go see the Stratosphere observation deck, the M&M store, Bellagio fountain, ""TI"" pirate show, Mirage Volcano, maybe grabbing a drink at the Rum Jungle.  With one stale smoky whiff of the place, you know that you are among those that consider the Downtown Freemont Street experience a Vegas must-see destination.  There I was, among them, with good reason:  I now have a family.
It wasn't always like this you know.  For me, Vegas used to be all VIP tables, bottle service, and exclusive parties to hang-out in.  To give one example, one time, as part of a big-time poker player's entourage, I attended a debaucherous private party in the Palms, in a room so sick that it had its own full-court basketball court with a 24 hour bartender,hobnobbing with the Hollywood A-List.  Now, with disposable income squeezed and family in tow, the previous dynamics of reality being have been pulled from under me.  All those things I once valued, like choosing between the Venetian or the Bellagio because of the danceclub; now, the vacation attributes that come front-center are things like the amusement parks, cheap hotel rooms, lazy pools, and hotels that didn't treat kids like kryptonite.  I could try and fight it, blowing $400 or more bucks on a room only to be reminded that your kids can't dip in this or that pool, but there are better things to throw your money at.  So bring-on the Orleans with its kidsclub, arcade and 14 movie theaters... bring on Excalibur and the Tournament of Kings.    
So why four stars?  Because it delivers that family experience that your kids will love, on the cheap.  in other words, you can squeeze the most out of Circus Circus with the understanding that the Bellagio cabanas and the Wynn suits can wait.  Whereas every casino in Vegas had done an about-face when it comes to the family, Circus Circus has accepted us with open arms.  And their new remodeled rooms are of the same quality as you get in the 3 or 4 star establishments:  clean sheets, new and updated furniture and a view of the Adventure Dome for the kids.  All this for $25 bucks a night and coupons for discounts in their unhealthy restaurants below?!?!  I'll take it and so should you.  And best of all, you too can get that anachronistic nostalgic experience that I had been asking for:   With the right lens, you can witness Tony ""The Ant"" Spilotro family gift stand still there (the mob enforcer from the movie Casino that got buried alive in the cornfields);  with the right imagination, you can go to the Midway arcade to watch Sean Connery filming of Diamonds are forever;  and with the right philosophy, you can even peer outside your room at the same mountain watermark left by the ephemeral wave of flower power that inspired Hunter S. Thompson write his most memorable monolog in 'Fear and Loathing'.  Yes, with the right outlook, you too can appreciate the mutating warping of the third class blue collar American Dream, while still having a blast with your family, reminding you perhaps that life has a way of equalizing.  Even if you lead a charmed life, you lose everything, and death will be the ultimate equalizer.  The only thing you can do is make the most of what is given and your given life situation.  Once I did that, stopped judging, I noticed how everyone was nice and it was a blast to see all the colorful people milling about.  Best of all, after all these years, I got to explore and see Vegas finally DURING THE DAYTIME, and not just using the daylight hours to nurse yourself out of that wicked hangover so you can party and drop $2Gs again the next night.  Thank God that stage is over!",14,14,4

A lot of reviewers have given this hotel a low star rating and not without reason. The hotel & casino is not the BEST hotel\/casino in Vegas and may actually be one of the worst for adults who want to party and gamble a lot, but if you are traveling with children and want everyone to enjoy their time this is by far the best hotel.

When my family stayed here (back in the 90's) my siblings and I practically lived in the amusement park. We got a 2-3 day pass and spent most of our waking moments there. We rode all of the rides, watching the ""street"" performers, ate the junk food, played the games and had a grand old time... while my parents enjoyed a cocktail\/beer and some light gambling (they aren't big drinkers or gamblers so they were satisfied) and some ALONE time. They didn't have to keep an eye on us because the four of us were in a fairly secure environment and were able to look after each other so they actually got a little break during their vacation (we were traveling around the country via RV for 3 weeks prior to Vegas). They were even able to enjoy a dinner together, as a couple. It may not have been the flashy, fancy Vegas but it was special to them nonetheless.

Plus, the circus that takes place in the neighboring tent provided my youngest sister a special outing with just her and my parents while us older kids laid around watching TV (something we WANTED to do).

The pool on the rooftop was pretty disappointing because it was small, cramped and HOT. Sure it was the middle of the desert in the middle of the summer, but the boring concrete hole did not please us at all. We stayed for a total of 5 minutes at the pool and called it quits.

The hotel is situated at the end of the strip (well almost. Not as bad as the Stratosphere) so it does limit your mobility if you choose to venture from the Circus Circus grounds. We decided to hop in the minivan and make the journey down the strip to Excalibur (clear at the other end) to watch Tournament of Kings, but traffic was a nightmare. Needless to say, we would have been better off walking the 4 miles. LOL

The rooms weren't fantastic and there were problems even back then. So I can understand why people would be complaining about the rooms now.

So maybe things have drastically changed for the worst in the past 13 years, but for a family spending just a few nights in Vegas it was the ideal location.",2,0,0

Circus Circus was the only hotel in the area with availability. Had a bad feeling about it then and there, not to mention horrible reviews, but had no choice. Boy did I regret this, and I'll never come back here again! 

I reserved a King Bed room in West Tower, I received upon check-in a double queen in Casino tower, facing a wall, and no, the front desk didn't seem to feel apologetic at all. I dropped the luggage and left. I was back around 1am and went to bed right away, but couldn't fall asleep because of the motor like sound traveling through my walls. I called the front desk twice, requesting somebody to come check my room and take care of the noise. Security showed up, stepped in and then joyfully declared :""Oh, thaaaat? That's just an elevator!"" Oh, thanks, now it makes it ok, let me put myself to sleep now that I know that there is no way to block that noise!!! Third call to front desk with a request to be moved anywhere but next to the elevator, but to no avail. They offered to move me the next day with ""an upgrade"" to a slightly larger room with a king bed, well thank you very much, how kind of you to keep me up till 4am (I guess that's when the elevator traffic died down and I finally passed out) when I have to be at work at 8 the next day, and then generously move me to a king bed room that I actually booked online to begin with and paid a bit extra for!!! The room turned out to be second to the elevator and next to a vending machine that just couldn't stop buzzing,  and the window could not be opened. I gave up.",7,2,3

From the check in counter it is a short walk (5 minutes) to the Circus Circus manors. There is parking next to the manors if you prefer to drive and park over there. 

Upon walking into the Manor (C) I could see the place was showing its age. I can tell the interior has been maintained, but that is it. Every time I walked the halls there was the smell of some kind of cleaning agent. The rooms were clean and accommodating for someone that would need rest, and would need to get cleaned up the following day. 
However, when neighbors moved into the room next to mine I got to hear things I would rather not have heard. 
~In one of the rooms next to us I could hear a couple getting it on...or a porn shoot was going...all I know is that room would need to be sterilized (wallpaper, mattresses, toilet paper...all of it.). I hope that the room I had stayed in was not the scene of a crime...shoot. 
~The other room next to me was a family of four and the kids were loud. Thankfully it was not as disturbing as the sounds that came from the other room, but on the night before checkout there was a moment where the kids and dad was yelling at each other. It was a bit uneasy to listen to as it reminded me of a domestic disturbance argument I heard in the past. This one was simply just a father disciplining his kids in an argument exchange. There was no crying or load bangs\/noises.

I enjoy dealers that at least put on some makeup and try to make themselves look nice. Most dealers are very aware of their hands and have their nails done. Not here. I know it's shallow but they were just horribly unattractive and I think it was mostly because none of them ever smiled. The first table I sat down at the dealer kept coughing all over the cards. They don't have electronic card shufflers which seemed odd. The next table we went to the dealer was just very rude and barely spoke English. When I was getting ready to leave the table she insisted that I color up and when my husband started separating my chips, she very rudely grabbed them from him. I think her name was Yong. The last table we sat at was with an elderly but American woman dealer and she honestly looked like she was ready to commit suicide. She never smiled, never really acknowledged anyone at the table.

The first thing that bugged me was the $15 Valet. Entering the hotel It was crowded. Check in was smoothe. The person helping us was very nice and helpful. We upgraded our room. THANK GOD otherwise we would of had a room in a outside building. Looks like a old Motel 6.  The elevator to our room was hot and stuffy. Once we got in our room. We noticed it looked old. The carpet,wallpaper ect looked dated. Before bed we noticed blood spots on the sheets. The beds are pretty comfortable. The vending machine on our floor did not work. The only reason we stayed here was because of all the fun activities for children. Its so crowded and things arent organized. Doing anything is impossible. House keeping made the bed didnt change the sheets. So of course we saw the blood stained sheet we had taken off back on the bed..The staff was impeccable. Really sweet and attentive. Christina in valet was really helpful. We lost our Valet ticket.She made the process of paying and finding my car smooth Now waiting for them to bring my car was a 16 minute process. Me being disabled made it very difficult to wait in the heat. Once I got in the car. I had to show my registration and ID to get my car which was fine. Overall I would never recommend this hell hole to anyone. The handicap parking is a far distance from people with disabilities to get to. I cant forget the pool area. They offer a really nice water slide and a little splash area. The pools were all murky. Crowded definetly not enough pool space for the size of the hotel. I will never stay here again",0,0,0

Circus Circus is just fine, particularly given the very low price point for a strip property.  Admittedly, the lobby is a bit of a labyrinth (aren't all the strip hotel lobbies?); the solution seems to be requesting a room in the ""West Tower,"" as those elevators immediately adjoin the hotel check-in area.  My large-sized clean room on the 20th floor had two comfy queen beds, and a nice LG flat screen.  Wifi (""included"" with $8.95\/day resort fee) was serviceable.   No toiletries to speak of, so keep the expectations low there, but the towels were fluffy and plentiful.  Maybe other ""Towers"" are tired, but not so for the West Tower.  I didn't eat at the hotel (except for Krispy Kreme pick-up), and the circus ""midway"" is actually pretty fun.  You know what?  I'll stay here again.",4,2,1

Overall, this place was better than the expected for the price we paid.  I think that people need to keep in mind the price being paid here and the expectation for quality.  The room was grungy but clean on the surface.  The bed linens and towels were clean and new.  The TV was old, not a flat screen but it worked.  The internet was free and it worked.  The staff were friendly in every encounter.  The bed was a little soft but it was not too bad.  The room was noisy. If you are going to stay here make sure you bring good ear plugs, you are going to need them.  The noise didn't bother me, we just said , hey people come to Vegas to have fun and some of the people in rooms around us were definately having fun.  Overall this was not a bad place to stay.  I would not spend too much time in the casino because there are many many kids!  I mean a ton of kids.  
One more thing about the room, there is a kurig coffee maker! bonus and plenty of hot water for showers.  If you want to stay on the strip for not much money this is the place to stay.

There were a lot of children running around and things were a bit dingy and run down, but the price is pretty awesome. Do beware of the additional resort fees, which do get you a coupon book with some decent stuff like a free premium ride at the adventure dome and 2 midway games, plus some deals on drinking and gambling. Resort fee also covered free wifi. There is a gym which was much nicer than I expected, but very difficult to find. Many people asked seem to not know where it was hidden and there are no helpful signs. I would suggest it be kept open 24 hours a day since this is the city that never sleeps, but the hours started early and ended semi late. The pool didn't appear to be anything worth checking out unless you are super hot, especially if you have used any of the other pools on the strip. We did have a problem with an alarm clock next door going off in the middle of the night, but staff did get it taken care of eventually.

We obviously spent time at Adventuredome and the pool, both of which were clean and great for kids. Even the high schoolers working the games were nice! The pool, although a little outdated, was very clean, and had plenty of clean towels and life jackets for the kids. The snack bar line could use more help because I ended up waiting almost 30 minutes for a snow cone and the showers in the women's restroom were broken.

I think some people book last minute get a hike in price for doing so and then complain because it's ""ghetto"". That's probably because it's cheap, affordable and attractive to families with children . This is the first time I have stayed at the hotel with my 3 children and for the 70 dollars I paid for a Saturday was great and couldn't be beat. I can't lie..the decor needs an upgrade, especially the bathroom but we weren't planning on staying all day staring at mismatched colors. There are casinos, restaurants, circus shows, Adventure Dome, shops and a pretty spacious pool. I did hear that if you book last minute the chances of being sent to the motorlodge was high and from the remarks, I'm guessing it's pretty scrappy over there. I stayed in the skytower with the kids and they loved every minute. If you don't want to be around a bunch of teens, children or obnoxious people....and want ""luxury"", then I suggest to drive a bit more south to other hotels. You'll find ghetto and sketchy people all up and down the strip regardless. From my point of view and in my opinion, the price was right, children had a blast and didn't cost me an arm or a leg.

Update--08\/17\/2014
My original review was placed on our first night. I felt like I need to update this place after my first night stay. This might be funny to some and perhaps serious to others, but I think my room was haunted. I took a shower and put the kids down, organized a few things before I slipped into the bed. I turned off the lights and closed my eyes. I was woken up by what seemed like something jumping on the bed, so I jumped up and turn on the lights but there was nothing there. I thought maybe it was part of a dream that had wake me up, so I just went back to sleep. I had the most creepy feeling ever and as a mother of three sleeping children..my nerves were on edge. Again, I heard something in the corner of the room so I just turned on the lights and left it on. I called down to the front desk and didn't want to seem like a crazy person, so I asked if there were any other rooms available. I was told they were completely booked and they apologized. It was about 1:45am when I went to sleep (again) and was woken up by a huge bang  at 3:17am (mind you the light in the bathroom was left on) and when I stood up..everything on the table was now on the floor!! MY Purse, bag, ipad, papers from check in and a cup of juice. All of it on the floor, almost as if the table tipped over -_-. Needless to say, I ended up just staying up turning on another light and opening the blinds. I ended up dozing off at 7am and the sun was coming up so I felt a bit at ease. At exactly 8:15am, I hear someone trying to open the door. I went to look through the peep hole and it was one of three housekeepers in the hall way. She apologized and said she had the wrong room!! Are you freaking kidding me??? First the angry ghost and then the early bird housekeeper. Checkout is at 11am thank you very much. SO.....Sleep at your own risk lol.

Ritzy? Nope.

Fond childhood Vegas memories?? You bet!! Damn, I remember how this was THE spot for a vacation. More arcade games than you'd ever find at any game place or bowling alley. Enough of them to make me dizzily overwhelmed and ready to faint! More quarters to blow on them from your parents than they would EVARRR give you during any other rational recreation time. A bunch of different areas that you could freely wander to and from without any parental helicoptering. Ahhhh those were the days... Even us kids got to irresponsibly indulge in Vegas!!!

But now, a fast forward to the miserable adult reality of today...

Circus Circus is now one of the last surviving original 80's boom hotels on The Strip. Unbeknownst to most people, it has a pretty damn good steakhouse too! I haven't had the chance to visit in forever and a half though, sadly! =( The recently renovated rooms aren't half bad either, especially if you are looking to crash out for a bit and be on your merry way.

There is a walking distance CVS on the next block which is quite convenient. You aren't in the heart of The Strip so you can make an escape to I-15 quick and easy. Heading to downtown is easy as well since you are on the north end of strip hotels.

I've actually found this to be the most convenient spot overall for activities happening at the LVCC, since it's walking distance but just far enough away to avoid the mega-people-and-traffic-jam that happens with big events. No need to deal with parking headaches, taxis, or any of that annoying crapola. This is especially key when an event ends and around 25,000 people pour out of the LVCC at the same time and look for transportation to vacate the area.

Industrial Road in the back is the locals' ""secret"" back road to avoid all of the hoopla and delays of Las Vegas Blvd. Shhhhh don't tell anyone though!! ;)

Overall I've been pleasantly surprised with this spot after rediscovering it a couple years ago (after not staying here for a LOOOOOOONG time). For quick trips where I need to take care of some business in town and need to avoid delays and headaches, it works and works quite well.

With live circus acrobats still performing overhead, the big smile I get from reminiscing over childhood fun here is also part of the lure too!

Oh! And the ""F--k Me"" smeared on the wall behind the door in some unknown black substance wasn't quite the greeting we had expected.  Thank you for handling that so quick and giving us extra coffee, sweet cleaning Lady Maria! She had a smile and was so nice!

UPDATE: (I dropped a star.)  A loud, wierd buzzing goes off at 7:15 am on Dec 15th. My wife goes to check it out because the sounds are unfamiliar. She calls the front desk and is met with a shorr, frazzled and very put off attendant (whom I'm sure has answered several calls about the same thing). She says it's a fire alarm and was a prank. I understand stress... but yikes! Anyway, of course she couldn't know what I do for a living. She couldn't possibly know that I know that the intermittent strange and loud buzzing in the hallway doesn't randomly sound off when a pull station is activated. No, that's a continuous alarm. So, was it a faulty sensor? Did an employee try to reset the control panel? Who knows... but being rude to an abruptly awoken GUEST of your hotel? Bummer folks. Absolute bummer. (Did I mention now the neighbors are awake now too and once again TV and conversation fills my room. So much for sleep.)",4,5,0

I read some reviews about the hotel and they sounded scary, mostly about the Manor Lodges which are separated from the main hotel. So I booked a room in the Skyrise Tower (connected to main hotel) which turned out not to be so bad. Pros: friendly hotel clerks, newly-remodeled and clean room as advertised on their website, clean carpet, comfy beds, no stains on the sheets, no roaches, no bedbugs, spacious bathroom, lots of storage space, easy elevator rides and relatively easy walk to main hotel for dining and Midway for circus acts, and nearby parking garage.  Cons: no mini fridge (but I heard they could be rented), walls kinda thin (I could hear a baby crying next door, but fortunately I didn't hear it until the day we left), cigarette smoke smell in the bathroom the last day (probably through the vents which I told hotel clerk Lulu about because I didn't want to be charged for any cigarette smell cleaning since none in my party smokes), smell of pot in the parking garage, sketch characters loitering by the garage (we did, however, see hotel security escorting two of these characters off the premises) and location of hotel is kinda far from the hub of the strip.

Yeah it is Vegas and it happens a lot but it was just a little more tense since we couldn't get passed them and they even waited in the halls to see what room we were in. 
The room itself was not great, it looked like a motel that you stop at on the side of the road. There was mold in the bathroom and around the room, peeling wallpaper, and still some remnants of the last people who stayed in the room. Our neighbors were so loud we could hear EVERYTHING they were saying. ALL NIGHT. 
We had to walk across a parking lot and a busy street to get back to the main building so we could get a cab. And as a safety factor for three women walking alone, did not feel comfortable once again.
In the morning, we realized we had some bed bug bites. Not really the nice experience we were hoping for.

The rooms are nice and there are plenty of activities for both kids and adults. The Midway Acts are incredible and complimentary every day, so it's a perfect show. The performers are very talented and come from all around the world. 

The Adventuredome is Las Vegas' only indoor theme park with more than 25 rides and attractions. They have thrill rides for adults and kiddie rides. I've taken my cousin there many times and her favorite attraction is the 4-D theater showing a SpongeBob Squarepants film.

If you're looking for a place to eat, the Pizzeria is delicious and very well priced. They have incredible buffalo wings. Also, I LOVE Vince Neil's Eat-Drink-Party! I highly recommend the buffalo chicken fingers.

As a kid I always wanted to stay at Circus Circus., simply because of the midway and Adventuredome. Never happened. Now as an adult my husband and I stayed INCASE we couldn't find a babysitter and had to take our son along. Luckily we did have a babysitter but unfortunately we were  stuck with the room... March Madness weekend, everything was mostly booked and overpriced.
Check in was at 3pm but we wanted to check in early since we arrived at 10am. Check in fee was $35., umm no thank you. So we returned around 2pm after a meal and a walk on the strip and were able to get the room by then. There was a charge of $10\/per night for the resort fee. Which includes wi-fi access, fitness room, pool etc.
Stayed in the Manor Lodge which is inconvenient because of the walk., but whatever. The bed was comfortable and the room was pretty big. The wi-fi was horrible! I could only get a ""decent"" signal standing by the fridge in the corner. As soon as i walked to the bed it would disconnect. WACK! Speaking of the fridge, it was broken. We couldn't chill our drinks smh.

I could see how easy it is for people to not like this place, but as one recent yelper guest mentioned, you have to acknowledge you are getting what you pay for, which is mediocre at best.  Definitely not the worst place to stay, but many of you would be better off and happier spending the extra money to stay somewhere else closer to the exciting part of the strip.  If you give this place high marks, it is probably based more on the experience than the look.

Good things:

- It's cheap.  It's really not a bad choice if you're on a budget.
- It's a quick walk to the CVS in case you need a few extra things for your stay.  Less than a mile north on Las Vegas Blvd.
- They have Keurig coffee machines in the rooms rather than the ordinary ones that aren't even clean.
- Plenty of closet space for personal belongings.
- The view outside the window is not actually of a neighboring building's roof.
- FREE WIFI!  I know for a fact that there are other hotels along the strip that actually charge you for it.  This is one critical factor that can determine someone's level of happiness.

Bad things:

- It's far from the actual Las Vegas shenanigans.  A cab ride to the other side of the strip can potentially run you up as much as $20 depending on who drives you and when.
- The shops around this place don't tend to open very early.  But then again, not many people tend to wake up early in LAS VEGAS.
- You might have to deal with that turn that goes into either the parking garage that leads to the check-in desk, or into the Manor rooms.  There should be a signal light there, or at least stop signs.  Cars usually plow right through there regardless of pedestrians crossing or not.

Things that aren't necessarily good or bad, but are left up to the person to interpret and decide:

- This hotel has a ton of kids as well as gang members.  The same people who react to this can respond 2 different ways:  ""How can you like gang members?"" and ""How can you dislike kids?""  Not all gang members are bad.  And many kids are.
- They still have CRT TVs.  Of course they work, but it's tough to watch things on those after watching flat-screens for a while.

All in all, choose to stay here if you aren't picky.  But if you're trying to ""impress"" someone, be ready to get laughed at.  I'll let you imagine the dialogue.",5,8,3

Sadly the bar is now a gelato stand. 

And this Americana gem I thought I'd re-discover in my adult years (once I was finally old enough to appreciate ""Fear and Loathing"") was just so uninteresting. I mean, they have free performances on the Midway, but they're so short and the wait is so long.

I stayed here with my boyfriend for a short getaway this summer (from August 10th - August 14th). We paid about $27 a night after booking it on Expedia.com or Hotels.com or whatever.. We should have known, based on price, what we'd be getting. However, when we got there, it was confirmed that we were in fact OVER paying these people.

Checking in was ridiculous. There were people everywhere and several different lines. We eventually found the right line to be in and the lady at the Front Desk was pretty nice. She gave us a map and after 20 minutes we finally found our room on the 19th floor in the main building (thank God we weren't in the ""manor,"" across the street). The room itself was to be expected of what we were paying, but after one night there, the sink in the bathroom clogged up (the tub started to do the same on our last night there). Of course there was no one to come and fix it. 

Also, Housekeeping NOT ONCE cleaned the room. In fact, we were left a little note upon checking in that two of the three nights we were staying there were the ""days off"" for our maid. Awesome..

The view was okay, but all I happened to notice about it were all the other (aka, ""better"") hotels we should have looked into. There's a stupid $1 fee to have the phones in the room. Well, why not just unplug the phone and take it to the front desk and keep my daily dollar? Oh, that's frowned upon. Not to mention, because of how I paid with a debit card, they put a $50 hold on my card for this stupid daily phone fee. Outrageous. Several calls to the hotel were answered with, ""Well, we don't work in the accounting department. You'll have to speak with them."" Eventually the hold disappeared and I figured out it was for the phone. 

Check out was a joke. There was no personality of anyone working that day at the desk. We were about the fifth people in line and it took all of two minutes to process everyone ahead of us. And there was no print out of charges or anything of the sort. They simply asked my room number and name and said ""That's all. Next!"" Rude, rude, rude.
I felt uneasy as I'd like to have known if there were any charges placed on my room that I hadn't approved (since being here more than ten minutes I learned it's not considered top of the line, I wanted to be sure of everything). 

I ended up leaving a shirt there, one of my favorites I'll add, but no one was ever avaliable in any sort of Lost and Found Department. I was apalled. I worked in a resort in Tucson, Arizona where every little complaint or problem was handled properly and as quickly as possible. Maybe this made me a little biased?

I got a very good price on our room. All I was expecting a decent room, with a decent bed, in a decent building.

That said, this was a truly dreadful stay. It's not even worth extensive detail.

To begin, the signs for getting visitors around the large hotel property are useless.

Check-in was quick enough, and the clerk was efficient, professional, and amiable. Nice.

Anything nice ended there. We hiked to our room to drop off our bags.

Oh. My. Gosh. Our building (in the Manor area of the property) was filthy on the outside. The carpet and halls were dirty, and the building smelled terrible. We requested a non-smoking room... and we were welcomed by the overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke when we opened our door. The carpet in the room, as in the hall, was extremely dirty. The furniture in the room had huge gouges and strips torn out of it--some as long as a foot or two. Classy. No, not classy.

The television was quite old, but whatever. Not a qualifier for quality for me. Just ended up being another thing to add to the tally of sub-par experiences.

The bed comforter was smelly and dirty. Shiver. I tried not too think about that one too hard.

The bathroom might have been the worst part of the room (ew). There were yellow spatters and splashes and stains all over the walls--seriously, so ridiculous. They were things that would've easily come off with a wet rag. There were filmy splashes and stains on the doors, too. The whole place DESPERATELY needs a wipe-down. Seriously. It would improve it massively. Oh, and you only get shampoo (no conditioner) and two bars of soap, so plan on that. No lotion. No bath gel.

Then, the worst part: Circus Circus walls are only good for keeping out light. I AM NOT JOKING. Our neighbors staying on both sides of us, speaking in regular tones, were clearly audible--many times we could hear everything they were saying. That's not to mention when other guests came home at 12:30 AM and later after having a good time at the bar and speaking rather louder than usual. Anywhere in the hall? You'll hear what they're saying. In their rooms, a couple doors down? You'll hear them there, too. You'll hear everything in the whole building. We even had earplugs that we put in a little after midnight... still noisy. The room air conditioners are like blow-driers. They're that loud.

Last, their ""Commitment to the Environment"" cards fall pretty flat, when their tub faucets and shower heads pour like rivers. Flow control, anyone?

Directions that lead us to no results since we got lost. The layout of the casino and hotel is extremely confusing and is not intuitive at all. 

Finally we made it to our room and noticed a weird smell in the air. Not that of dead prostitute or cold tobacco thankfully, but it was rather funky and we had to crack the window open to freshen things up.

The room was decent but far from great. It was clean at least but the beds were a bit soft. The internet wasn't complimentary either and was something like $8 per device which I thought was rather expensive, especially in this day and age; at least it was fast.

Although I'm sure that Circus Circus, at some point in time, might have been a nice play to stay at, it seems very beaten up and is now just a tacky, worn out and in dire need of rejuvenation kind-of-place. It's pretty bad in there and almost creepy. Looks like it hasn't been touched since the 70s or something and the casino floor is another great display of where I would not want to spend a dime. It smells bad and the croupiers are creepy looking.

There's a Krispy Kreme donut shop and a few shops on the lower floor and they have an entire part of the building that's under a giant, ugly purple down known as the ""Adventuredome"" where there's some kind of theme park. It was closed when I tried to scout it out, possibly because it was past 10PM. It didn't look all that great.

As far as food options go, there's very little that they offer .There's a buffet but it looked terrible. We settled for Rock & Rita's for our breakfast and it was not all that great. There's a few bars but most of them are lame and past their prime as you'll be able to tell when walking around the place for over an hour around 10:30PM-ish.

In many ways, this place could be used a set for a sequel to Steven King's ""IT"" movies or something. It's definitely creepy enough. Maybe they should just blow it up and build something else there. It might actually improve the value of the land and Circus Circus seems to be past it's prime... Way past it.

I doub that I'd ever want to stay there again. There's many better options and most have a better location since Circus Circus is at the very beginning of the strip.",2,6,2

Upon checking in they give you a coupon book to use in the Casino. There are free drink coupons in there for Slots o Fun, When you go to use them the bartenders in there are huge A Holes.

Check in was probably the only nice part of this place. Quick and easy. Got to our room in the Manor, room 1954, and the light and fan were on in the bathroom which we thought was odd. Looked inside and the toilet was overflowing with someone's shit. Call it in and 2 hours later someone comes out to fix it. Then they notice that no one cleaned the bathroom, obviously, so there are no towels and no soap, so they say someone will be right out. Sometime past fucking midnight housekeeping showed up to clean the bathroom and woke us all up. We asked them to come back in the morning but no one showed up until we called again and still took them until noon. So had to skip a shower after driving 2 days to get here. Casino was fine but the people at the tables in the pits were jackasses including most the dealers as we tried to find a table to throw money away at. Outside of the 3rd day we basically got ignored by the waitresses serving cocktails. On the second day we noticed the safe doesn't work and we had no TV remote which again took several hours to get. Oh and I almost forgot without warning they barricaded my car in behind caution tape and metal fence barricades? Wtf.

Honestly I don't know why either are as popular as they seem to be. We chose this as one of our places to move around the strip a bit but coming through the door you immediately regret it. 

Kids, kids, and did I mention kids EVERYWHERE. And we're not just talking cute Gerber Baby kids, I'm also talking the stay in my black painted room teens and B-Rad Malibu's Most Wanted wannabe's, yeah you know the type. The place is dark and crowded. While we expected a place called circus circus to be a family type theme\/ clientele it was a bit overwelming.  The ONE saving grace of this place was the AdventureDome which has basically anything your child and your inner child can think of doing such as roller coasters, water slides, rides, and other various things for ""junior"" to do while daddy spends his college tuition.

Overall, the adventuredome itself gave this place 1 star however there's really nothing else here to save it. The strip in my opinion is full of better alternatives to stay at depending on your lifestyle, age, and budget. Circus Circus just isn't one I will ever go back to since who brings kids to Vegas?!?!",0,3,0

Oh and here's another example of FEES FEES AND MORE FEES, if you want to check in before 2 PM you can pay an extra $20 (and pay resort fees, so total would be $50 just to jump the line). Some hotels in my experience are courteous and let you check in when the room is ready (for instance the MANY Indian casinos throughout CA and OR) but not in Vegas! When I checked in the employee was kind, when I balked at the cost of the fridge (an extended stay so a fridge was kind of necessary) she said she would have one brought up to my room at no charge. Of course that never happened, even when I politely inquired about it two different times. All in all, the cost for a 3 nights stay only amounted to $48 a night including fees. (Of course the rate I signed up for was $24 or so but those DAMN RESORT FEES).

West Tower is the best tower-the bed is actually quite comfortable and the room is very clean; try the brunch buffet because the selection is great (lots of meat choices) and the service\/cleanliness is terrific; (side note: there was a clown eating at the buffet a second ago with a napkin tucked into his bowtie ~ excellent); Slots of Fun is damn fun - beer pong $9 on actual pong tables just do it and laugh at your inability to play the simple game; and most of all, you can sleep during the day since housekeeping works 24\/7 it's not all vacuuming and banging doors at 7 a.m. 
Is it glitzy and glamorous? No. It's in need of upgrades but nothing terrible or seedy. Lots of parking if you have a car, the place is clean, has plenty of activities that you probably won't have enough time to enjoy (although there aren't any nightlife\/karaoke options), and it's a heck of a great value.

The blacklight showed the story of a sexual movie or something, because unholy amounts of semen were spread along the walls.

Ok, in all seriousness, let's talk about this hotel. I usually stay at the Trump Hotel or Treasure Island. However, due to a short notice trip to LV, I was forced to stay at Circus Circus. The parking situation was interesting. LV parking tends to be crazy if you're new to it, but this hotel's parking seemed disorganized. I'd suggest having more signage and have them be more visible and easy to interpret. It be great to know the best parking place for a certain part of the hotel that one is staying in.

Another note, the interior of the hotel can be very confusing for the new visitor. Up and down stairways, making a left and then a right, and another right...wait did I already pass by this area? Again, just like with the parking situation, signage would be great throughout the entire lobby\/adventure area. My suggestion to new travelers? Do the extra walking outside to the parking structure and just walk in the front entrance. Don't test your luck with the elevator near the parking area. Also, the entrance to the parking structure has an entrance to the main lobby for the elevators to your room. Just be sure to read the sign to know which elevator will go to your desired floor number.

If you're like me and are a bit sensitive to cigarette smoke, this is NOT the place for you. Even the non smoking section has the tendency to smell the opposite. If you dare to walk through the casino, you're going to have to hold your breath for 2 mins before heading out the front door.

The rooms... not too bad, I've been in worse. I was actually ok with the rooms, although the decorations could've been updated. The view isn't great, even from the top of the building. Nowhere near the strip, so you're going to have to walk quite a distance to get to the strip, or just use your car or get someone to drive you.

I will say this though, the staff (as far as my experience goes) was the best part of my stay. They're the only reason I'm giving 3 stars. They were so very nice, helpful with directions, flight itinerary printing services and other tasks. I had some very loud people on my floor who were making a lot of noise late past midnight, which forced me to call for security (which I honestly didn't think they would actually send anyone up). But they did! Pretty quickly too, especially since I was on the top floor. They had the hallway cleared out and told the people to be respectful...etc. then they went the extra mile to knock on my door to make sure everything was alright and if there was anything else I needed.

Overall, will I spend the night here again? No. I'll go back to trump hotel or treasure island. But I will definitely visit for the circus shows they have. I'm a fan of circus arts, and you can't beat a free show.",1,0,0

When we checked in, we were told we were being given a ""free upgrade"" to what they called the Skyrise Tower and were given directions on how to get to our room.  We parked, unloaded our luggage, and walked to the elevators, where we saw a large number of firefighters walking back and forth in full fire gear, carrying different types of equipment.  An employee told us the elevators were currently down and that the firefighters were ""inspecting something"".  He instructed us to go BACK to the check-in desk and have them change our room to the West Tower.  We trudged back to the car with our luggage and a cranky four-year-old and, while driving back to the check-in parking, we saw a large crowd of hotel employees who had apparently been evacuated from the Skyrise Tower.  When I I went back inside to request the change in rooms, the clerk again claimed we were being given a ""free upgrade"", this time in the West Tower, even though that is where they had to put EVERYONE who had just been checked in to the Skyrise Tower!  They tried to make it sound as if they were giving us something awesome to make up for the inconvenience, but it was really just them blowing a bunch of smoke up our ***.  I understand that things happen that are beyond their control, but I find it impossible to believe that they didn't know about this apparently major problem in the Skyrise Tower at the time I was originally checking in.  It was obvious the firefighters had been there for quite some time.  I don't understand why they would continue booking guests into those rooms if the entire tower was inaccessible for an indefinite period of time.  Additionally, I feel like they should have offered us something REAL, something tangible, like a 2-for-1 deal at their buffet, to make up for the inconvenience, but they didn't even offer us so much as a complimentary soft drink.  

After we FINALLY got to our room, my 19-year-old daughter and my four-year-old niece got changed into their swimsuits and went down to the pool.  They returned only a few minutes later, stating that the pool had been closed because of wind.  Thank God they have free circus shows, because otherwise the four-year-old would have been completely unmanageable after having to sit in the hot car for a long time while we sorted through the room debacle and then having been told she could go swimming with her brand-new floaties only to find out the swimming pool was closed.  

When we returned to our room for a bit of rest before going to dinner, I attempted to get a drink from the vending machine on our floor (THREE DOLLARS for a small bottle of Gatorade?!?!).  The machine accepted my money and the LCD display stated ""Vending 1"", but nothing came out.  I called Guest Services and they said we just had to go to the cashier's cage and let them know what had happened and they would give us a refund.  My daughter went down to the cashier's cage, but they refused to assist her because she wasn't 21 years old.  She wasn't asking for a cashout from a gambling machine!  She wanted a refund from a vending machine that ate our money.  I am disabled, so that's why I sent her down to request the refund in the first place.  The person at Guest Services DID NOT tell me that someone over the age of 21 had to request the refund.  

At the end of the evening, when we were all exhausted and wanted to go to sleep, we discovered that the beds appear to be from the same era as the Flintstones, because the mattresses are hard as a rock!  Needless to say, none of us slept well that night and ended up in horrible moods the next day.  My daughter and I are contemplating a 10-day trip to Las Vegas in the summer of 2017 to celebrate her 21st birthday and we most definitely will NOT be staying at Circus Circus.",1,0,0

The games at Midway are classic games that you play as a kid (like throwing a ping pong ball into a little glass cup or throwing darts at a balloon to try and pop it), and of course they're expensive, but what really bothered me was the crappiness of the stuffed animals that you got after winning once. In order to get the bigger nicer stuffed animals, you would have to win multiple times and then trade your crappy little ugly stuffed animals for the bigger ones. Kinda sucked.

Adventuredome really didnt look like too much fun. I really had no want to ride any of the rides or buy anything. The casinos were much better, although the card dealers weren't very nice. I definitely got yelled at by this one dealer multiple times for nothing. She was a beezy for sure. I sat at her black jack table for a good couple hours, and the next day she also carded me again.

I will start at the parking garage. We parked at the red 2 section and ended up having to go to orange 4 so we could reach the elevator to the building.

The place looked kind of dingy already and this just made me break out the sanitizing wipes.

The Adventuredome is what I believe to be the main attraction. A huge glass structure with rides and attractions and oh so much fun for the family. If this place was actually clean it would really be great for kids. Lots of fair foods like cotton candy and plenty of cute rides they would all love.

I'm gonna try something new...

Check in\/Lobby experience:  LONG line of folks coming in for the weekend.  When I walked up @ 9:30am on Thursday, I was 8th in line.  2 clerks checking guests in and out, making the wait really painful.  When it was my turn, 2 more clerks appeared (guess their break was over).  Bonus for the rest of the folks waiting in line, which was now more than 15 deep.  Clerk was cordial, but not overly friendly or informative.    2 stars.

Lobby area:  Really dated, dark, and generally shabby looking.  It could use a coat of paint and new carpet.   1 star

Room:  We lucked out and stayed in the West Tower.  These rooms were newly renovated:  granite countertops, flat screen TV, new carpet and wallpaper.  In general the room was much better appearing than we expected based on the lobby experience.   The beds really comfy, a plus.  The bathroom was clean and had granite upgrades.  I didn't notice any shampoos\/lotions, etc that you see in other hotels.  Oh yeah, there was a bar of soap that the maid changed daily.  The room didn't have any paper or pens.   3 stars

Valet parking service:  LOVED these guys!  They were really friendly and offered directions all over.  If we were coming back for a quick pit stop between shopping trips, they were willing to leave our car on the side for us.  Bonus.  They gave the best customer service of anyone we met on the property.  5 (although if I could give 10 I would) stars

Casino:  Old and dated.  The only casino we went into where we would always leave smelling like smoke.   Ugh!  Maybe the newer hotels have better air filtration systems.  Did enjoy the trapeze show overhead on Saturday night.        1 star.  

We didn't explore the Midway or eat at any of the restaurants.  Had a bad experience in the morning at the bagel place...Juanita was more interested in sharing stories of co-worker angst and drama with her work partner than making us coffee...  Really?  

**Noticed there were not any recycle options anywhere on the property.  I ended up taking our used water bottles with me to put in a recycle bin elsewhere.

PROS
1. The staff is great. 
2. The Circus acts are great. 
3. Vince Neil's has karaoke. 

CONS
1. The whole first floor of the hotel is like walking through a smoke chamber. I'm pretty sure I have second hand-smoke now. It just wreaks and lingers on everything.
2. The kids. If you want an adult vacation, don't come here. I get that it's circus themed but kids are running around everywhere. The crying, screaming...no thank you. 
3. I wanted to get a massage so I looked on the Circus Circus website. Went to the spa after seeing a package online for a facial\/massage package. It turns out they no longer offer this service even though it's advertised throughout the hotel, very disappointed. 
4. The rooms don't have: coffee pots, bathroom fans, comforters, a mini fridge.
5. Hotel workers in the lobby and entrances are constantly trying to sell you 'complimentary' things.

My parents were thoughtful enough to stay here every time we were in Vegas, when we were kids.  While they did what they did, they would hand me and my brother lots of cash and leave us to our own devices. We would venture off by ourselves to the upstairs arcade and would circle it for hours, trying to win something from the carnival style games and stop to watch the free circus daredevil acts.  My favorite games were the water gun and some game where you would roll rubber balls up this ramp to get Tic Tac Toe and, of course, the pinball machines. Looking back at everything now, CPS would have certainly cited my parents for child neglect.

Our room was much nicer and cleaner than the last two rooms I've stayed at here.  The tables have one of the lowest minimum bets on the strip for those who don't like to risk much.  The slots aren't as loose as they once were, but still pay out better than some of the other casinos.  Mediocre eats too.  Circus Circus is near the end of the LV strip.  I consider this place average all around.  I'll consider this place again, if I'm low on funds.",10,10,8

The Staff were great, hardly any kids where we were at.  I believe there may be two sides to Circus Circus.  Our rooms were on the Skyrise section with a nice window view.  

The room was decent; which i thought was okay due to the fact that we wouldn't be in our room much besides going to bed or getting ready to go out.  They also had a spacious restroom and cable tv.

Having just spent this past weekend there for a friend's Vegas wedding, I can promise you this: They haven't made one upgrade in the past 40 years.

Dingy, faded and sad is how I would describe this once festive relic. Everything -- from the ugly hotel signs to the faded lobby carpeting to the smoke-clogged casino -- looks and feels old. Not in a cool, vintage way, either. Just old.

But my real problem with this hotel was what happened when I checked in: First, they gave me a room in what they call ""Circus Manor,"" which is essentially a shitty little annex across the street from the actual hotel. At no time during my booking process was there any indication that I'd be in the Manor; I had paid for a regular room in the hotel. But OK, I figured, how bad could it be?

Pretty bad, it turns out. The first thing I noticed was that the hallway carpet outside my room was soaked. An electric blower had been set up to dry it, but to no avail. Once inside, I immediately relieved myself in the bathroom, only to discover that my toilet wouldn't flush. I called Guest Services, and after a good five minutes on hold, the hotel employee told me to expect an engineer in my room shortly.

He didn't show for over an hour. And when he finally did and began working on the toilet, releasing dirty water all over the bathroom floor, he informed me that it would take him a good while longer to fix it. I was already running late for the rehearsal dinner, so I called Guest Services again and insisted I be moved to another room. 

Well, the room they moved me to was right across the hall in the Manor, and I immediately discovered that the bathroom floor in that room was also soaking wet. The engineer, feeling bad for my predicament, called Guest Services himself to ask that I be upgraded to a room in the hotel tower, away from all this wet misery. They had him on hold for literally 20 minutes.

I could not wait another minute, so without waiting for him to get through to them, I grabbed all my stuff, moved my car to the regular hotel parking lot, and waited (another ten minutes) at the supervisor's desk in the lobby. It was only then that I was finally moved to a clean, dry room on the 23rd floor of the tower, without any real apology or conciliatory gesture. (Like, how about offering me the buffet for free, people?) The rest of my stay was uneventful.

Look: I realize Circus Circus is no luxury resort, and that there are far more upscale (and pricier) places to stay on the Vegas Strip. But this mega-hotel is owned and operated by MGM Resorts, a multi-billion-dollar corporation. Surely they can provide even the most basic upgrades and customer service to this depressing ghost of a hotel. And if they're not willing to make those improvements, they should put the place out of its misery.",7,3,1

Honestly, we were pleasantly surprised with the great customer service and the modern and new room (in West Tower). However, the registration and parking arrangement is so strangely laid out and chaotic and the room was dirty, with hairs everywhere, including ""those"" hairs in the bathroom. Bleh. The toilet was dirty inside and yellow streaks up and down the outside. The tub faucet leaked and there was a loud rattling noise in the wall(AC, elevator?). The pillows are lumpy, broken up cotton chunks like they stuffed five cotton balls in a case and called it a day. We slept horribly. 

We were impressed with BP the valet who was very helpful and courteous with our baggage check. Valet and baggage assistance is tip-only for cost and very helpful due to drop off and parking arrangements. They securely store your luggage and give you a slip to call when you want your baggage brought up to your room. I had them come up to get and hold our luggage after check out so we could explore. They made it very easy. Just don't lose your slips!

Between 2000 - 2010 my family and I would  vacation at Las Vegas once every 2-3 weeks for the weekend. At times we stayed every weekend. Circus circus was one of our original choices due to child friendly amenities. Previously when we booked two separate times the 2nd was in fact a second chance  we were even more displeased. Lobby looked amazing but after we arrived to the suites it's was a portal to the land of lost items. Yes euivebt to a dump. Smell of vomit reaked. Garbage everywhere and flies! Sorry hun blow flies don't show up until a couple days where something has become rotten and left. The room was NOT cleaned. Looked like someone had thrown a hotel party. We immediately twice mind you went down and argued to cancel reservation. We went elsewhere. This last time we 8\/11-8\/12 we stayed elsewhere but did a walk through thru the stores changes do happen? Right! The lobby ok and some hallways had garbage to the top.  However the 1 star comes from the experience in the store. Allow me to be more specific. You cross the street coming from the self parking area. Turn a right through two glass doors and take a right it's the first store with options for souvenirs.  We walked in and made our way to the coffee mugs. Upon check out the woman charged us waayyy more and did not say a word. She had scanning it twice and then did some typing on The register. She was not very polite asked for the card. I stopped my spouse because the amount did not match. We only came for 1 item 1 single mug for our niece. Unless it was made out of swavroski crystal the price that it read was definitely incorrect. When I questioned her she said oh . Ok and yelled for her coworker. She came back annoyed  and fixed it. Then we went to pay debit  and they asked for ID. We had to explain what a military ID was. Even if it was for a DEBIT where we input the PIN number. Then we asked for our receipt. Again she had to call the other gal who was just walking around.  We asked a couple times if it was an issue.

This has been one of the worst hotel experiences I've had in my life, and I've had some pretty bad experiences. I urge anyone planning to book a couple nights at Circus Circus to read the entirety of my review which, please note, all took place in one night. 

First of all, we were charged an extra $10 per night in a mandatory fee that covers ""free"" wifi, and...uh...I don't even remember the rest because it was so useless or scammy. When asking the concierge about the hidden fee, he spoke to me and my family in a completely condescending, patronizing tone of voice, like we were dumb people. It infuriated me. He insisted the fee is stated clearly (it's not, I have hawkeyes) and then said ""I don't have time to argue with you"" when I asked where on the site it was mentioned. 

Next, the elevators are all rickety and one of them was broken. Not to mention numbers and buttons were scratched clean off. What a ****show. 

(BUT. HERE IS THE MEAT OF MY REVIEW. PLEASE READ!)

To top things off, my room had a leak in the ceiling. I tried calling the front desk and got a voicemail the first time, request to ""leave a message in the mailbox"" the second time, and an unanswered call completely the last time. Then housekeeping insisted it was the air conditioning and sent me to a disconnected line. Last, the room maintenance guy (who I reached after four tries hitting some weird message\/mailbox thing) told me he'd send maintenance crew to the room. Of course, the maintenance guy shows up an hour later, rubs the carpet (what?), holding a flashlight that is constantly flickering like a strobelight and just suggests I move to another room. He gave us a room on the 32nd floor with a lame excuse for a view of the strip and guess what? That concierge from earlier told us no room on that floor was available today. Ha. 

Then in the 32nd floor room, we opened the door to be greeted with a blast of cigarette odor. So we go downstairs and demand another room. We get a sorry from the supervisor, a few buffet coupons, and a new room with a draining problem in the bathroom. 

This ""hotel,"" if it even deserves to be called that, is disgusting. Yes, it's cheap, but for a tiny bit more money, you can get a WORLD of a difference in quality.

We couldn't wait to get out the second we stepped in.  It felt like walking into a bad part of town Walmart, except instead of the elderly greeters you have massively depressed looking employees and clowns everywhere.  Oh mah gah.

Also, for some reason I had a hard time figuring out where to check in upon arrival.  Maybe I'm distracted by blinking lights to easily, but the front desk was a bit tucked away and caused a luggage lugging excursion around some very drunk gamblers.

This experience reminded of going out with the boys, the end of the night is approaching and out of desperation to find anything better your friend just decides to go home with a slightly overweight girl, with a few missing teeth, heavy clownish makeup, really bad hair extensions, humongous hoop earrings, an ill-fitting outfit that helps her resemble a zebra print marshmallow, wearing frayed black leather peep toe shoes that reveal severely chipped toenail polish, and she stinks of sweat, Jennifer Lopez's ""Live"" perfume, and Marlboro Lights.

Just like the girl your boy ran off for a night full of fun that he will soon want to forget, Circus Circus is used up, run down, and in desperate need of a makeover. The place could use a little paint on the walls (less creepy clown makeup, dentures, and a pedicure), a revamped food menu (a diet and workout plan), and a better air filtration system (the desire to not wear perfume not sold at Wal-Mart and eventually quit smoking Marlboro Lights).

A solid choice for people on a budget or who have youngsters who like roller coasters and the midway and fun dome. They have been trying to keep things up but compared to all the new mega resorts its hard to keep things as crisp. I remember years ago when they were painting the ceilings on the casino floor. They were going from black to white was it? 

There are many different towers. I like to always pick the tower that is most convenient based on the elevator location but whatever you do stay far away from the Manor Motor Lodge. Clean comfortable sports book with booths, cheap good pizza there nearby.

I once couldn't find my car in the garage. I spent hours looking for it in the hot hot heat to the embarrassment of a bunch of friends. Its so confusing these big places and if I remember correctly I was looking in the wrong garage or the wrong floors or something. After all that I usually just park on the roof.

Good value. I deducted a couple stars mostly just because I'm not a fan of staying so far north on the Strip. I have always disliked that part of Mandalay Bay for the same reason - too far south.

Within three days in our first room I killed 5 cockroaches. I called and complained and they said they would move us to another room. We waited an hour for the bellhop to arrive to escort us to or new room. He didn't even help us with our bags. He walked is to the elevator, held the door  open, and pushed the button to our floor. I combed over the new room and found the lamp was missing a light bulb. I called and asked them to send somebody to fix it. They said they would while I was out to dinner. I came back from dinner and the light bulb was still missing. I complained again about the bellhop and light bulb and they said they were going to upgrade us to a suite. We got to the site and it was worse than our budget room. The only difference was the beds were very far away from each other. Very romantic. I asked to be placed back in no light bulb room. It still didn't have a light bulb by the way. They sent an engineer up another hour later to screw one in.

My boyfriend and I were on a short trip mostly centered around seeing our favorite artist perform at Planet Hollywood, and trying to conserve money, we booked at the Circus Circus.  It was so bad that we both wanted to go home a day early by the time we'd been in Vegas about an hour!  We're not quitters, though, and we ended up having a ton of fun in Sin City, we just didn't spend very much time at all in the room.  

The food available was gross.  Kid-friendly my ass - we walked through the lobby at about 2am on our way back to the room and everyone there was - I'm sorry - trashy.  Think mullets and Nascar.  Then came the pack of YOUNG girls coming down the escalator in their underwear (not exaggerating) with a bunch of skeezy looking guys with them.  The walk TO the hotel is flat out scary - this place is like the skid row of the strip.  The sheets were like paper towels and our ""fitted"" sheet didn't even cover the whole mattress.  The tub was dirty when we got there.  The mattress was more like box spring.  We wanted to check out ONE HOUR late and were going to be charged $20 to do so - are you kidding me?  The hidden $1 charges for things like having a phone in the room are just annoying.

When I pulled up the confirmation it only included prices, not specifics about what kind of room I book so there was no easy way to prove what I had paid for because I prices change from day to day online and could not match up with what is currently online. Other than that the website is old and hard to use to begin with. The woman that I spoke to at the desk was not helpful and border line rude when I tried to address this and the person on the reservation line, who although was much more friendly, was not any help.

The room that I was placed in is OK. It is something that I would expect at best western, but not on the Las Vegas strip. But for the price normally (weeknight,non-holiday) its not the worst. However, the particular room I was placed in was facing a solid white wall.

The casino itself is more like a casino in Reno than one on the strip. It is at the very least outdated and at the worst kind out dingy and smelly.

I was disappointed by the lack of bars open and the mount of people on the floor. It was kind of dead and the people who WERE out there seemed close to it (not just older BTW). 

The best thing I have to say about this casino is that it is kid friendly. Great if you have kids or want to go wild and be loud without others caring, but not so great if you want to be able to use the pool and sleep without a room full of screaming kids next to you. I think there might actually be a pro wrestling match going on down the hall. I'm 21 in Vegas so whatevs. but other people probably care.

 I would go somewhere else unless you don't have other options. The customer service sucks. The hotel is blah and the rooms are meh.",3,2,2

Since we are loyal MGM property customers we decided to look at Circus Circus because of the reasonable rates and newly remodeled rooms (according to their website).  Upon arrival, we were told that our room was outside of the main building and that it was only a 4 minute walk.  After a 10 minute walk with all of our bags we arrived at a small motel like dwelling that they call the ""manor"".  When we opened the door to the motel building we were overwhelmed with the smell of urine and dirt black carpet.  There were no elevators so we had to haul our luggage up a flight of stairs to get to our room.  

When we opened the door to our room we were less than enthused about our hotel accommodations.  The room was extremely dated, with old peeling wallpaper, popcorn ceilings, and a TV from the early 90s.  The floor was full of stains from who knows what, forcing us to wear our shoes when we were in the room. 

The bathroom tub faucet was leaking the entire time, the ceilings were covered in black mold spots, and the faucet to the sink had low water pressure.  When we took a shower the water temperature fluctuated between scalding and ice cold.  When my husband went to iron a shirt there was more mold growing in the water reservoir of the iron.  My husband has allergies to mold and my asthma symptoms were exacerbated this weekend and I attribute that to the mold and lack of cleanliness.  

The location of the room was so far from the hotel which deterred us from gambling at the hotel, so instead we took Ubers to other casinos and literally spent the entire day away from the property.  Since we were only in town for two nights and wanted to spend time with family we decided we would wait until check out to speak with a manager about our stay  When we got to the registration desk the line was ridiculously long and at that point we were so exhausted we wanted the experience to be over.  We had someone at the business center check us out, print our receipt and after that we left.

It does not end here.  We arrived at the parking garage and there was a line 35 people deep of people waiting for ONE working elevator.  There was no sign or attendant indicating that the other elevator was out of service.  When we finally got onto the kid filled elevator there was an open condom wrapper on the floor that made us feel uncomfortable given the fact that this hotel is geared towards families. 

Finally our experience was over.  I would not advise anyone to stay at this establishment.  We paid $200 a night for a motel experience that was far from satisfactory.",8,0,0

I had to make a last minute reservation for one night and found a special on Hotels.com thinking I came up. Oh the regrets.

Firstly, when you make a reservation on their site or a third party, you can clearly see the photos they use aren't of the room you get. So right off the bat it's false advertising. Strike 1

The manor is a piece of shit. I paid nearly $130 for a room that looked like a homeless person lived there. The carpet was gross. The bed had strands of hair. The sheets had holes\/rips. The bathroom door had holes and blue tape holding together broken pieces. They say there's no smoking, yet the entire area smelled like smoke. The walls are so think that you can legit hear your neighbors showering. 

And to add to all that, the location is so meh. If you're staying in building e you end up having to do a lot of walking just to get to the hotel entrance. 

Also during my check-in around 11pm on a Saturday night, the staff were all grumpy. I get that you're working the night shift, but jeez at least fake it. They functioned like robots who didn't know how to sympathize. 

For a few dollars less, you can stay at Super 8 a few blocks away and be at the heart of the strip. 

I used to stay here with my family as a kid. Nostalgia got the best of me. Never again. I'd legit rather sleep in my car than ever set foot in here again.",18,7,4

Where to begin...so having gone to Vegas a few times and staying at off-strip hotels, I decided to try for a ""cheap"" but closer to the strip option. So on my arrival, I called the front desk asking where I should park based on my reservation. They couldn't tell me until they checked me in, so I decided to park in that huge parking garage. I called them again to ask where the Front Desk was (I had not seen it on the way in) and again, they had no idea where I technically was. I could only hope that I was parked within CircusCircus.

After finding my way in, I found out that my reservation for the ""Manor, Section E"" was on the other side of the hotel, so I had to go back to the parking garage and move my car to the motel-quality rooms. My room was literally at the farthest possible location from the main lobby. This is fine, though, its just part of going to a new hotel so I won't blame them too much for this one detail.

Once inside the room, everything smelled smokey despite it being a smoke-free building. The carpet was tainted with black dirt, not sure what it was, but I wasnt planning on taking off my shoes at any point. I settled in for the night and tried going to bed but the room was quite hot. I tried turning on the A\/C but it would not turn on. There was a lot of noise from nearby rooms, and I'm pretty sure my bed's headboard was sharing the wall with the adjacent room's bed headboard since every time they were getting ""busy,"" the rocking motion would translate to a slam against my head. I can't blame the couple for doing it, but the hotel is poorly set up if my headboard is responding in this manner.

When I woke up the next morning, it was because the pipes were rattling so loudly from someone taking a shower. I took that as sign to just get up and shower too, but first I decided to sit on the john for my morning appointment. Upon flushing, the dirty water completely exploded and splashed into my legs and my right arm (since I was using it to flush the toilet). I flushed it again and it repeated. I concluded that the toilet was designed to splash you back. I took a shower immediately following. Of course there was no hot water. At 6 am, this wasn't the best way to start my day. 

I went to the breakfast buffet shortly after and stood in line as a single cashier slowly processed people in. I guess this is the least terrible part of my stay. After eating my fill, I felt tired again and decided to head back to the room for a nap. Around 11 am, the maid was trying to get into the room. I left the security latch on but damn if that was going to stop her. She kept opening and closing the door until I got up and went over. She asks if I was planning to stay another day because check out time is at 11 am. I told them that I reserved for a 2 night stay and that my checkout was the following day. She looked perplexed and said it was OK. She left and I tried sleeping again. Less than 20 minutes later she comes back and repeats the situation. This time I show her my email confirmation stating that I had the room 2 days. She finally leaves and at this point I just decide to leave the room for the day.

It was then when I realized how far away CircusCircus is from the strip. My god that walk was horrendously long. I arrived at the strip to find out that hotels all have free parking, now I wish I just drove over. I ended up leaving the strip before sunset because I didn't want to walk back to the hotel in the dark. Those streets don't look very safe at night. I went for the dinner buffet and took a walk around the Adventuredome. It was just this horribly overpriced kids carnival. I went to the Casinos in the hotel and really felt the age of the place. With my poor sleep from the previous night and all the walking, I didn't have much more energy to drive back to the strip.

I come back to my room and see that my dirty clothes were put away with my clean clothes. How kind of them. I also found that the dirty towel I left on the floor after the toilet spill had been folded and put on the rack, but at least the maid left a new towel on the counter. I got ready for bed and all I could hear were children screaming from one of the adjacent rooms and more pipe rattling. The room felt hot again but I was already dreaming of better places to be.

Circuscircus was pretty cheap, in cost and in my experience. I'm not sure if I'll go back to Vegas if other hotels are like this. I don't get to travel much because of my low income. It is worth stating that if I had the money, I would try coming back and staying at a better hotel. Maybe the experience would be better.",0,0,0

Problem is, its very claustrophobic inside, and nostalgic, but not in a good way. The clowns on the wall are borderline too freakish for words and the smell of tobacco is overwhelming. I think though that you'll find that its not as run down as one might expect. It's just tacky. But at 25 bucks a night how can you complain? ? You get what you pay for. It's a place to stay and kids might actually enjoy it. Just hope you're not attacked by creepy clowns in the middle of the night and that a midget doesn't try and hump your leg at the poker table.

She had never been to Las Vegas before and literally booked the entire trip. She booked her hotel off a deal that came with a flights so we ended up staying at Circus Circus. When we got our room we were told it was in the Manor which is not part of the hotel. It's across the street (which was fine) but when got to the manor I was scared for my life . First of all it was about a 10 minute walk from the hotel . The Manor is also a row of building that look like a row of run down crack houses in the ghetto . Mind you it's Vegas you aren't going to be the room for long. As we were getting to our room the smell was so bad. I'm not knocking on anyone who smokes weed but the hallways teamed of it . Our too
 Was non smoking and it smelled like someone died in there . It wasn't clean at all . I felt like I was going to catch something. My face broke out 2 mins of walking into the room and sitting down . My sister went out to smoke and some random guys smoking weed were asking if she was alone for the weekend. 

My sister and I both called the front desk and asked how we can get a new room and or get a refund and we will find another hotel on the strip cause this was just unsafe . They did however move us back into the actually hotel towers but told us that if we bought a package deal the Manor is were they usually out all those ppl. We only had to pay an extra $5 a day so that was not bad to get a upgraded room and it was decent view extra. The toilets were clogging bough on all levels albeit that was the biggest down fall in the new room. Over the hotel isn't that bad . The drinks were strong and free since we spent time in the casino. We also checked out adventure land the roller coaster LOCO is pretty fun. 

Bottom line for this hotel I believe you shouldn't buy a bundled package flight plus hotel or you will be out in the Manor with the rest of crack heads . Lol",5,4,2

I had a great time, all the carnival whatsoever, video games that were not event available here in New York then and stuff. Las Vegas seemed more kid friendly at the time but then the casinos took out their video games, same with Atlantic City actually in the mid to late 90's.
I went back here in 2009 and it really did nothing for me, lol. Not even a bit of nostalgia, like oh I was in this exact spot over 14 years ago.

Also, it is way out of the way, the very very edge of the strip before you get to the end of it but before the many many wedding chapells that you will pass by going further downtown. You can skip this casino, especially if you have been here in the past . You are not missing anything.",3,1,0

First of all the pool area is surrounded by the parking lot so while you're swimming you will see cars going by, buses, campers etc.  The cleanliness of the room, I would say was below average. The elevators are extremely small and it was an extremely busy weekend so the wait time was very long.  Circus Circus has the air conditioner off in the hallways and no ventilation in the elevators.  The carpet in the hotel  had an unpleasant smell.  I know this hotel has been around for ages but it's time for it to be demolished!!!  And being right next door to the Camp site and Travelodge made matters worst....all the undesirables were right there!  They couldn't give me a room for free to stay here again!!!!",2,2,0

So Michael helps me first and he is so rude the way he spoke to me about standing in the other line I always checked in at the players club line. So I agreed next time I'll check in the regular line Marygrace stated it's fine to heck in this time but next time at the regular check in line. Ok. So Michael was still so rude so I refuse to let him help me check in. So then I switched to Maggie who was also rude she checked me in I upgraded to sky rise tower she had keys ready and room ready and then she decided to go in the back for about 15 minutes comes back with a big Caucasian lady and she says ""we're going to cancel your reservation and give you your money back......"" at 11:45 pm(I'm 7 months pregnant) haven't slept all night drive 8 hours to be told this after my room was reserved and keys were about to be handed to me. Mary Grace comes over and helps the big Caucasian lady and they both say they don't have to tell me why but that they can't accommodate my needs.. what needs? And then after making me feel so uncomfortable and upset Mary Grace says you can stay if you want but your not welcome after anymore .... with no reason...... I'm not going to stay when you made me feel like this? Horrible people. and I already felt uncomfortable driving for 8 hours and they also said I can't book at any other MGM hotels so they pretty much caused me to drive and stress out no sleep for 24 hour and I'm 7 months pregnant. I have to see my doctor because now I am not sleeping right and this really really affected me mentally and physically I almost got in 2 accidents on the way home. To me : why did they not call me prior to say this? Why did Maggie set up my room only to leave me waiting with keys n front of me and say we're canceling"" at 12 at night!!? Hey had no remorse! They let me walk out tired and scared and stressed! Now I have now see my doctor to make sure nothing is wrong! I almost crashed twice on the way home! So horrible and not professional not kind that they would check me in to cancel my reservation! They should be fired. That was very wrong! I will see my doctor and make sure everything is okay and if so will be reaching out to my lawyer. I really feel someone of very higher professional educated power should get back to me on this situation and handle these uneducated horrible employees. I had always recommend this hotel to my friends and family and bigger parties of people with my age (21-25 and 35-40) range why would they choose Circus? Because of me. It is so upsetting because my family went here since I was young as well we were never treated in such a manner. I cannot believe this happened to me. So very unprofessional and wrong in so many ways. It's very sad that these employees are a reflection upon this fun hotel. These employees are not representing MGM hotels in a good way at all. Hire me for a day and I can show them how you should treat guests. MGM is a professional hotel company and only professionals and nice individuals should be able to represent them no matter what. Horrible.

The noise in Hotel is too much to bare and the ones making the noise don't have the excuse of being drunk (they're kids).  So basically you have to deal with brats the whole night.

Quite frankly, I'm glad we didn't. The hotel looks old and dirty. The only part of the hotel that I found tolerable to look at was the lobby. This comes at no surprise since in order to check the hotel, one must enter the lobby and that's your first impression of the ENTIRE building. Nice way to trick people. 

Trying to kill some time around the area, we decided to play some games in the arcade. If you're wheelchair bound, it'll be very easy to get lost and you'll probably feel it's impossible to enjoy the ""fun"" located above the casino. I would consider mapping out your trip of the place before you enter to prevent further frustration.

After having a little bit of fun in the arcade we had to find out where to redeem our tickets earned. There are two areas. One area is only opened up on the weekends. There is no sign indicating this, so you'll probably stand there for a few moments wondering why employees are passing by you without helping you. Only AFTER we stood around for a few minutes and asked, the employee informed us of another prize station on the other side.

The wait there was just as irritating. We waited for about five or ten minutes. I was debating whether or not I should simply hop over and collect the proper prizes myself and leave the tickets on the table. Finally, someone showed up. No apology for the long wait, not even a ""hello"" or a general acknowledgment of our presence.  More of a look of ""What do you want""?

I suppose the upside to the  trip was the employee let us slide with our prizes being 5 tickets short.  But that was really the highlight of my experience with employee contact.

To the employees: Smile. Guests like me are the reason why you're even employed. Be happy about that.",0,2,2

When we checked in there was no line 1 AM Vegas time and went up to our room. It was the last room of the hallway and took a little time to find we were in the West tower and the elevators are located near the lobby. They gave us a $20 food and beverage credit as part of our Expedia deal. It is at the end of the strip and was conveniently located near all the main resorts and attractions. For the price ($500 for car and hotel for 6 days) it was not bad at all and would come back again. We did not use the swimming poor or spa, the buffet was ok and we used our coupon and got in for $16 for 2 people. The Mcdonalds located outside the front entrance was one of the best McDonalds I have ever seen from the food to the atmosphere do not go to the one on the second floor of inside the hotel. The lobby was a little smelly with a strong perfume, i am not sure what they were trying to hide. There were a lot of kids and plenty of Asian people who do not speak english in the hotel.

Boyfriend & I entered in a little before 9, check in time is 11 so we had almost 2 hours to kill before entering in. ACTUALLY check in time is at 2, you can check in at 11am but you have to pay $10 extra, not bad just to get to our bed earlier and rest a bit more. We walked around the waiting area, we came here for EDC and there were A TON of people here for the same thing, it was nice to see some fellow ravers before EDC even started :)

I liked how there were convenient $10 and under thrift stores to buy presents, a small tiny store that sold Hello Kitty items and a LED clothing shop which is PERFECT for EDC outfit & accessories. There's also a Auntie Anne's & Krispy Kreme right next to each other, yummmyy! There's also this cute pizza spot called Pizzeria , I ordered a delicious Pesto Pizzazz Pizza :]

The hotel room was alright. We got the smoking room, it smelled like stogs in our room but the sucky part about this room was that we didn't even smoke in our room - _ - Since we were spending our time mostly at EDC, we just came back to our hotel; slept, watch a bit of tv, took showers, got ready and other things.

But no they left them all night to freeze.  The next day. My Mother told me she was cold all night.  Couldn't take a shower because water was too cold.   I called ask for supervisor.   They put Johnny front desk manager on line.  I explain to him about the problems and he told that I know nothing about what is going on here because I am not in the rooms.  He stated that he would change their rooms and credit back 1 night per room.  I said thank you.  Front desk screwed up and changed only 1 room.  I called Johnny back.  he wasn't happy because, I called him back.  So he stated I will put your family out.  He was very loud and rude.  He said front desk will make the changes.

However, I decided to give it a try for old times sake. As a child, we ALWAYS stayed in the manor. Circus Circus was the place to be, so I figured it could not be THAT bad and it will be nice to reminisce. I did know though, that I definitely wanted to stay in the actual hotel this time and to stay far away from the manor. (The manor alone is why this place gets a bad rep in my opinion, and has such few stars.)
Check in was the quickest I have ever had in Vegas. I did check in around 5 on a tues, which may have contributed to it being so quick and painless. (Only one couple ahead of us, and less than 5 minutes when at the counter.) 
I booked the West Tower King Room. The elevator was literally right across from check in, and a short walk from the parking lot. The room was much better than I expected. (I usually stay at Mandalay Bay, but knew not to look forward to a room any where near as nice.) It was relatively modern, with a restroom larger than I expected. The bed was a little soft for my liking, but my boyfriend LOVED it. Though it was soft too me, I slept very well. However, they have THE WORST pillows. (One pillow was too low and sleeping on two was too high.) The air has a high or low option. I enjoy getting to input a number for the temperature, but settled on the high setting. This set the room to a decent temperature, but definitely not as cold as I would like. The restroom had peeling wallpaper and poor circulation. However, I had no problems with water pressure or leaky faucets like others have reported. Also I never heard any noise outside my room, though this may be because we were in the last room at the far end of the hallway. Housekeeping was great. No problems there as the room was always spotless. I was very disappointed that the room had NO keurig coffee maker. Why advertise something and even include it in your ""resort fee"" if you do not have it? This is the second mgm property advertising keurig coffee makers and not having one.   
As for food, this is where they lose a star. I wanted to try the Blue Iguana restaurant but it closed at 9. It's Vegas, so obviously people will be out late. I got back to the hotel at 9:30 and was bummed it was closed. Also the garden grill is basically only open on weekends, another downside for me. I did end up trying two places. I had breakfast at barista bagels and more. They have a $5 breakfast bagel that includes egg, cheese, and sausage or bacon. I had this in a cheese bagel which was SO good. I also tried the Westside Deli. I HAD to eat here to reminisce. As a child I always ordered the footlong hot dog with nacho cheese. I was thrilled to know they still had these. They are $5.50. I would not shut up to my boyfriend how these used to be $2 and then went up to $2.50 which was heart breaking as a child. (This was over 10 years ago, which he continuously reminded me but it was SO great to reminisce.) 
They are the same hot dogs from that long ago, in the same place. The hotel decor also is the same, which is why so many people are skeptical of CC. However, never judge a book by it's cover. Yes it does appear a bit run down, but the room is FAR from this. Also the staff was THE BEST I have had in Vegas! Every time I passed one, they always said hello with a smile. They were happy to answer any questions people had, and were great with directions. 
This hotel is on the strip, but far from other attractions. One thing to consider if this is important to you. I drove to the other end of the strip and then walked around. If I had walked to the middle of the strip from CC in 100 plus heat, I would of been too exhausted to do anything else, not including the walk back. I would stay here again on a budget trip. It truly is great for the price. The pool is just a pool, which is the only reason why I would not stay here again on a ""relaxation trip"", but as a great place to crash it does the job.",0,0,0

Once in the late 90s as a kid looking to have fun, and once in 2012 as a broke recent college grad looking to save some cash. In two separate decades this hotel has completely disappointed me which is a feat considering I'm under 30. 

A lot of people will say this place is good for kids, as a child I hated it because I couldn't really roam as I wanted (no casino will let your kids run free) and the clown vibe was creepy. Take that and mix it with having so many issues with their indoor amusement park, it was pretty much the worst. 

As an adult those clowns just get even worse. Small pool. Like really small pool. So small when people pass you the water gets warmer...that could be caused by something else, but I won't worry about this because there's enough chlorine in the pool to bleach your skin.

The rooms are old, and a bit musty. The casino is small and not enjoyable. If you want a trip to Vegas away from kids, this is not the place (don't worry we didn't expect to be kid free). If you want to go to a good hotel, this is not the place. 

That being said, the biggest problem with this hotel is LOCATION. If you want to go to any portion of the strip it's going to be a $20 cab ride at least or a 2 mile walk. If you've been to Vegas in the winter you know that means a freezing walk, and in the summer you will be drenched in sweat by the time you reach the boat at TI. 

There are better family friendly spots, and there are better located cheap spots. The only reason to stay here is a free hotel, or the desire to walk more than you've ever walked before.",2,2,0

First we arrive and the GPS took us to the hotel entrance where we used the valet with no issue.  We get in line for the check-in, took about 10 minutes, great!  Pulled the $20 sandwich trick, dude knew what we were doing, awesome.  We go up to our room and there is a manager lady inspecting the room.  She saw a small tear in the lamp shade and said she was going to replace it.  She left the room.  In the meanwhile we pulled back the sheets to find both beds had torn sheets and both had big stains, but they were clean.  We go into the bathroom to find that the ceiling is leaking above the shower head.  It was a huge bubble and was dripping pretty fast into our tub.  I called the front desk and they told me to sit tight engineering will be there in 45 minutes.  I requested a new room and they asked that I stay until engineering gets there.   Engineering shows up and so does the manager lady.  Engineering says yup, you guys may want to get a new room.  Manager lady got a bellhop to bring us keys to our new room after another 30 min wait.  So we move rooms, tired and cranky but they took care of it.  We get to our new room and it looks great.  Until my nephew went to look out the window and found 3 used Q tips laying on the floor where he was standing.  I was grossed out as was my wife and nephew.  I went to the hallway to tell the house keeper who could not understand me or the things I was saying.  I got frustrated and went back to my room to call the manager.  They were sending housekeeping and the housekeeping manager.  In the meantime my wife stepped on a staple and we found 4 more thick gauge staples around the room.  Housekeeping arrives picks up the Q tips and says sorry.  They leave.  Still a little grossed out.  By this time it's been 2 hours since check-in so the wife and nephew went to bed and I went to gamble.  It took me a bit to find the casino floor as the signs were not clear, but I finally found it.  It was way to cramped so I never even sat down and headed to the Rio.  When I came back it was much later and I decided to sit down to enjoy some blackjack.  Table was nice, dealer was nice, rules were the norm and they only had $10 tables.  The other players were pretty unsavory characters.   There was definitely some gang affiliations going on with-in that casino and not just one.  So I retire for the evening to my room and went to sleep.  It was quiet and a decent bed.  I woke up the next morning and went to take a shower.  The tub was filling much faster than the drain could keep up which grosses me and my wife out.  So I finished and told my wife, she didn't want to shower in there.  As I am getting dressed my wife is out of the bed and says eew a bug on our sheet.  She goes to flick it off and I said wait.  And I got down and looked at it and said ""do you know what that is?""  She says no, it's not a bed bug is it?   Now I have only heard of these but have never seen one, thanks to the power of Google I Google'd it.  Sure enough it was a dead bed bug!  I was irate!  I called the front desk and demanded to speak with a manager immediately! They connect me to a supervisor who I told I found a bed bug and I wanted to cancel my room for the night and wanted a full refund for both nights!   He offered me a refund for the next night but wouldn't give me one for the previous until there is an investigation of the bed bug which could take 10 days.  He then Sent security to the room to start the investigation with written complaints and pictures of the bed bug.  When we went to check out I found the supervisor and asked him if he had see the pictures, he said yes.  I said is it what I thought it was, he said he was legally not allowed to say and I could find my answer if I Google'd it.  I said I want my money back for last night now.  Again he said he couldn't.  I said what if I stood here in your lobby and started showing people the picture? He said he would have the police escort me off the property.   So I left peacefully and went to the mgm grand for the next night.  This was just a terrible experience and will never go back.  It's been 13 days and still no refund.  I will try to add a photo!",12,4,2

My borfriend and I stayed in LV just for the weekend, so we didn't spend much time at the hotel anyway. It's at the end of the strip, and it's easy to take a bus from the hotel down the street to see the Bellagio fountains or check out other places along the strip. The buses come every few minutes, so you don't have to worry about waiting too long. Also, you can drive your car and park it in some other hotel's parking structure while you walk around, and then drive back. That's what we did and it made everything a lot easier. We had dinner at the Garden Grille...the food wasn't bad (our lunch at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant was the best, though) and the waitress was super nice, she even gave me a free margarita. As for the room, the bed was actually comfortable, but then again I was exhausted from walking around all day and could have fallen asleep anywhere. The room was a pretty good size, no, I couldn't hear people in neighboring rooms through the walls, but people in the hallway were a different story. I didn't go to the adventure-dome, but I did spend about 45 minutes in teh midway. It was crowded. I'm sure all the parents just drop their kids off there when they want to gamble; that's what mine did when I was younger, lol.

Maybe I'm giving this place a good review because I won a giant pillow pet from that game where you toss rings onto bottles. I named him Ceasar.",0,1,1

I don't have too many memories here after the age of 4, though I have gone back to visit the Adventureland dome place and ridden that rollercoaster in there.  The adventureland dome is fun and they also have an extensive arcade and fun center, which is cool, but other than that this place is a little older and I don't think I would want to stay there now.  It's also quite a bit off the strip so this wouldn't be my first choice of hotel to stay at.

I do not care what anyone says,  the entire place smells like an ashtray. Yes,  they claim the rooms (specifically the West Tower) are non smoking. Right. Maybe no one is actively smoking in them at this second but smoke has permeated ever crevice. Our kids and I were sneezing and sniffling the entire 48 hours we were stuck there. 

The elevators are inadequate - either out of order or perpetually unavailable. 

The lobby is ALWAYS jam-packed with people waiting. ..waiting to check in,  waiting to check out,  waiting for their car\/cab,  waiting in general. 

Nothing in the facility has been updated since before I was born (I'm old). 

The pool is ridiculous. ..the capacity exceeds 3000 people but there are not nearly enough chairs to accommodate. There is zero shade unless you care to fork over big bucks to rent an umbrella or cabana. 

You'd think that given the dilapidated,  unpleasant facilities that food and drink would be less expensive compared to the rest of the strip. ...not so.

Yelp considers 2 to be ""Meh. I've experience better"" what a great way to sum this place up.

Our first two negative experiences happened at check in, the receptionist were nice, some of them were hard to understand but I don't think it was any fault of there's, more age related. Anyways we got our key card and proceeded upstairs to our non-smoking room. I swear, i've walked into some rooms that might have a ""faint"" smell of cigarettes, but this 1st room was as if someone took cartons of cigarettes, put them in the middle of the room and little them all on fire before throwing them out the window just as we walked in. We both were sick with colds so could not stand the stench. We walked downstairs again and politely told the front desk what happened. She apologized and said they were trying to fix this issue (it must happen a lot) but at least they are trying to fix it. Okay fine, second times a charm, we quickly are handed a new set of keys with a different room to test out.
Our second room smells fine, and we quickly get excited, but it was short lived as we try to turn on the lights and soon realize that not a single light switch works, including the bathroom. At this point i'm viewing the hotel as a hike to and from the front desk and consider activating my step counter.
Our 3rd visit to the desk we are polite again and explain what happened in this room, the women now seems amazed (maybe most people give up by the 3rd try?). So she quickly walks away and mumbles something about manager, she is being nice, i honestly cannot understand what she says though. I look at my female friend for a translation and she shrugs and mumbles manager in recognition of all i understood. 
Okay so the manager comes out and starts typing a novel on the keyboard and apologizing, he is also very nice and courteous, he helped us with 1 night resort fee which we definitely appreciated and moved us into our 3rd and hopefully final room.
Upon entering our 3rd room everything is in order, smells, electricity, running water... so i'm happy camper, my female friend collapses into the bed in exhaustion from our hike in zion park and now in Circus Circus. 
Day 1 complete at Circus Circus... why is the clown so scary looking?

Day 2
Goes fine, the building doesn't explode but watch out for the toilets, they flush so hard i swear they could suck your arm down with it. Okay not really, but they will surprise you if you're not ready for it.
So it's 10pm, (12\/17) I tell my friend we should watch a movie, she shrugs without thought while staring at an ipad. I think she knows i'm tempting fate at this point.. 
I click the menu and it tells me to call the front desk for movies. Okay...that's a little outdated but sure. I pickup the phone and make the call, front desk doesn't answer, instead it is the operator, who tries to connect me again... no luck, so she tells me they will call me back in a minute. I wait 5 minutes and call back, she tells me they haven't forgotten about me and hangs up again. I wait 30 minutes and call back, reminding her it has now been over 30 minutes, she apologizes and says she will personally go check on why the hotel wont accept my money for a movie (not those exact words, but seriously..) I wait another 30 minutes and start writing this review. I have now been waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes including the writing of this review.. I'm not one to give up but honestly.

As many others have mentioned, Circus Circus is pretty outdated and far from the action. The casino and other facilities are unimpressive, old, and are more reminiscent of Reno rather than the famous Las Vegas Strip. 

Shops and eateries are pretty meh 

My room was clean and adequate, however, it felt very much like a motel. Not as bad as others have mentioned, but perhaps this was because I was here for CES and the hotel wanted to have its best face on for the techies. 

I suggest you shell out the $20 more per night and stay somewhere like the Luxor or even Excallibur. Trust me, it will be worth it.",2,0,0

Wir haben uns für dieses Hotel entschieden, da das Preis\/Leistungsverhältnis & die Lage recht gut ist. Das Hotel ist im typisch amerikanischen Style eingerichtet & seine drei Sterne wert!

Das Zimmer wurde täglich gereinigt & Handtücher wurden ausgetauscht. Die Einrichtung ist nicht das neuste aber auch nicht kaputt oder abgenutzt. Es ist alles vorhanden was man benötigt und von den Hotelstandards her kennt. Es gibt gratis WLAN im Zimmer. Für Las Vegas ist es typisch, dass es in jedem Hotel  Früh\/Mittag und Abendbuffet gibt. Somit gibt es solche Buffets auch im Circus Circus. Wir waren zum Frühstück- und Abendbuffet dort & es war gut. Eine gute & große Buffetauswahl und man kann sich was frisches kochen lassen. Aber auch im Hotel gibt es Restaurants, wo man auch gut & günstiger essen kann. Natürlich kann man das Circus Circus Buffet nicht mit anderen 4 oder 5 Sterne Hotels vergleichen. 
Direkt vor dem Hotel gibt es eine Bushaltestelle, von welcher aus Bus den ganzen Tag den Strip auf & ab fahren. An der Bushaltestelle kann man Bustickets für verschiedene Tage lösen. Gegenüber ist das Riviera Hotel mit einer Hertz Autovermieter. Im Circus Circus kann man kostenlos parken. 
Vom Hotel aus, kann man innerhalb von ca. 10 Minuten zur Fashion Show Mall laufen um zu shoppen oder essen.

I stayed at the manor which is across the street from the actual hotel and casino. I think it was pretty nice not having to trek through the casino with all your baggage. You can park right outside your room. I would recommend staying here if you need a cheap place to stay read my complaints below to see if it is right for you. 

Arriving: If you are staying in the manor I would not bring your luggage in since you will have to move over to the manor anyway. Self parking was pretty dirty due to all the kids spilling their liquids.

Check in: Check in was very quick and polite.

Compliments:

Air conditioning worked A-okay. 

Room was clean.

No reported bed bugs.

Next to Encore so good for clubbing.

Bed was comfy.

Complaints:

Most noticeable complaint is the windows they have a bit of a gap in them so when the wind blows you will hear it.

So we book a room to Circus Circus from one of those discount websites.  It was a great deal, half price and close to everything we wanted to visit.

We get to the hotel and once we find our way to guest registration we are greeted by someone who clearly was at the end very long shift and wasn't at all pleased with the idea of checking anyone else in.  She very unceremoniously informs us that the room we booked wasn't available and we will be placed in another room.  No apology, no compensation.  When we asked if there was another available room that we could perhaps pay to upgrade to she simply said ""No"".  I also found it a little unsettling that there was a resort fee on top of what we had already paid online.  It was nice to hear that this resort fee did come with access to their wifi.  

I try to not let my experience at guest registration ruin my trip so I head to our room, which mind you is literally as far away from guest registration as you could get and still be considered Circus Circus.  Our room was in the very back of their property in what I'm guessing is one of the original buildings from when Circus Circus was built.  If the decor was any indicator it was some time in the 60s, probably the last time our room saw any real attention.  

We settle into the room and I attempt to connect to the wifi I was told about at the front desk.  The one thing I'm thinking is probably the only thing I'll get of use out of this resort fee I paid.   To my surprise I find that there is no available wifi.  
 
None of this was all that terrible really, it was a cheap price and really how much time do you want to spend in your hotel when you're in Las Vegas?  The real problem came with the paper thin walls.  I could hear people in the adjoining rooms as if they were in my room with me.  Being Las Vegas no one sleeps, ever, so clearly I was a fool to think I should expect any sleep.  

In the end it was all too much for me and my trip was cut short.  After driving for nearly 5 hours and getting almost no sleep I opted to drive home.",8,3,2

This past Saturday my husband and I stayed at The Circus Circus, only for one night, as a little pre honeymoon trip. It was absolutely wonderful. 

We arrived at about 11am and we went to eat at the Pizzeria. Amazing food!!

We then decided to see if we could check in early. The front desk staff were incredibly kind. We were asked if we wanted a lower floor or a high floor with a view. We asked for a higher floor and we were given the topmost floor in the Skyrise Tower. The view was INCREDIBLE to say the least.

We ended up spending most of our time at The Circus Circus. We went to the Midway, walked around the Adventuredome, and played the slots. 

Sure at the Midway it can seem to be a rip off but people need to understand that those games are designed to not be easily won, especially the ones with the large prizes. We really enjoyed ourselves even though we had some problems with the arcade games and not giving tickets. But the arcade staff were more than willing to open the machine and give us as many tickets. 

The casino, yes, is smoky, but it wasn't debilitating as I've seen from other comments. That comes with casinos, especially older ones. 

The housekeeping staff were amazing, if we had any questions or needed anything they were more than willing to help us out. There was one girl in particular who stopped to talk to both my husband and I on several occasions. She was so sweet and it was very nice and easy to talk to her.

We enjoyed our stay so much and we do plan on returning in the near future.",5,3,1

I don't consider myself to be ""snooty"" by any means but words can't even begin to describe how disgusting this hotel is. Although rooms were $29 a night, it was NOT worth it for many reasons. Number one, I was sent to the ""motel"" section, which wasn't even part of the hotel. I legitimately feared for my life. The people who were staying here looked like they walked straight out of a prison gang. I witnessed a large fight right outside of one of the bars in the casino and I swear there was a woman shooting heroin on the stairwell when I was leaving. Secondly, they did not provide any soap or shampoo in the room and the sheets had a huge nasty stain on them. The room was just dirty and smelled like mold and body odor. The beds were hard as a rock and killed my back. Needless to say, I checked out after the first night, got my money back and went to the SLS across the street which was only $25 more a night and many steps above Circus Circus. Never again!!!",0,0,0

This hotel is the best place in Vegas to spend fun time with kids.  Ours are 7 and 5 and they had the most fantastic day here, so much so we went back the next day for more.

We spent one day doing the fair rides which were perfect for our boys .  There were plenty of rides for them to go on and best of all there were no queues (W\/e April 8-11 2011) and because they had wristbands they were able to go on each of the rides over and over again. It was dream come true for them and I have never seen them smile so much - they had the BEST time.

Over the course of the two days we were there we also saw some of the free Circus acts which are superb and worth taking the time to watch.  The acrobats particularly were amazing.  Our 5 yo tells us that watching these shows were the best part of our holiday.

We had our cartoons drawn by the cartoonist on the Fairground floor and they are brilliant.  The kids loved this experience and the pictures were great and reasonably priced at $20 per head.

We also had our photographs taken Gangster style upstairs.  This was great fun.  We were all dressed up as 1930's gangsters and then had our photographs taken.  I wans't bowled over by the quality of the photographs.  They clearly can take excellent pictures as they have many great ones on display but I suspect it depends on the photographer and ours lacked in imagination and skill.  Still, we came away with two prints, one as part of our family package at $49 which we felt was very reasonable and one of our boys for an additional $39 which was extortionate but expected.  As with all of these things they make their money through the extra prints you can't resist buying once you've had the shoot done.  Fortunately we only liked one of them!

All in all, if you have children you must take them to Circus Circus, succumb to the child in you and just enjoy,  It's tacky but an awful lot of fun.

All this said, there's not a chance I'd stay here, even with children, it's clearly a dump and although super cheap  just too awful to stay in if you can help it.   It is crawling with children and is seriously unglamorous and tacky.",2,0,2

Sadly, one measured 41"" and another 31"".... So, we had lots of upset moments because they couldn't ride. I recommend waiting until the little ones are at LEAST 42"" for a decent experience. Height limits were not brought up by the front desk during the call for booking, or when I checked in...even though I asked about the little guys. Somehow, housekeeping failed to clean our room after our first night. Also, the pools and hot tub closed at 6pm!!! Which meant we didn't get to play the first evening after a long drive.

We got a refrigerator (due to a milk allergy) but it froze everything on the lowest setting.....& it took 3 calls to get...The buffet was boring with many prepackaged ingredients.  this was a low budget version of Vegas to say the least.

When I was little we always stopped by Circus Circus to play the midway games.  It was so cool back then.  Now, it is looks so run down.  It even smells funny, oh wait that's the buffet...YUCK!

Before heading back home, we had to make one last stop to play our games.  My game is the one on the bowling ball that you push along the rail and if it stays in the dip, you win.  I was crushed when I circled around the midway and could not find my game.  Wah!  My mister decided to try his luck at the Tic-Tac-Toe game.  At one location he got diagonal tic-tac-toe, but he wasn't a winner because you could only do vertical and horizontal.  When did they change that rule?  We found another tic-tac-toe game and you can win diagonally and for $2 you get 4 balls.  My mister finally became a winner and got me a a teddy bear with a Las Vegas hoodie.  He then tried his luck at the milkcan game, he knocked the cans down with one bean bag.  His prize, a small blue gorrilla.  What happened to the prizes at Circus Circus?  They used to be so cool.  Now they are all budget. They had a crane game with South Park dolls.  Of course my sister has to try it since she is the Crane Game master.  She zeroes in on Cartman and after the 2nd try she gets it.  She tries for Kenny, but couldn't get it.  My mister tries and after the 4th time, he wins her the Kenny doll.  We also tried the water shooting game, but the clowns' heads looked like they were about to fall apart.

I totally agree with some of the other reviewers, this place does feel depressing.  They don't have to go balls out like the other strip hotels to renovate, but they can at least freshen it up a bit.  Circus Circus is nostalgic Vegas to me I don't want them to change too much, but something needs to be done.  Their parking lot feels like a jail.

So, you want to go to Las Vegas and bring you kid with you because you think Circus Circus is appropriate for your child entertainment, well I got news for you; DON'T!!!!. I had an horrible experience in this hotel, let me start by saying that I have asked for a non smoking room and I received a room that has nicotine stain all over the sealing and walls, I have a 3 years old daughter, and that was unacceptable, we literally couldn't breathe. Along with my daughter, my wife and my mother in law, we brought our little Maltese dog, whom is a service dog and he come with us every where we going. We booked this hotel for 2 nights and at 2:00 PM on our second day, a Security person knocked on our door while my 3 years hold was sleeping and rudely and loudly, demanded us to pack and leave the promises immediately. Because of the little dog, I told him that Rocky was a service dog and that I would talk to them after my daughter woke up, he reply again rudely and loudly, that there was nothing he could do and again demanding us to evacuate immediately. Anyhow, to make a long story short, this place was full of drunk people witch I guess in kind of normal for a casino business, also full of pat smoking individuals, etc...... I just can't believe that they kicked us out like we were some kind of criminals, because of a 5 pounds SERVICE dog, and they can't even wait for my little one to wake up, this is 100% outrageous.

It all started when I had a COCROACH crawling on my arm at the Circus Circus Buffet (LEFT A REVIEW ON THAT TOO) and how she handled my situation. She was not at all sympathetic to what happened and all she kept doing was looking me up and down  judging me, her demeanor was as if I was just trying to get something for free. She didn't even apologize for what happened. It would have been nice to be offered a free meal somewhere else or even a better room. So first the bridge to the hotel had a broken escalator and moving walkway. When we got in the building that the room is located it smelled of mildew and must as if the carpet hasn't been cleaned or dried properly. When we got to our non smoking room first thing I noticed was the smell of cigarettes in the room, I thought maybe it just needed to be aired out so I attempted to turn on the AC unit which did not work for the first 15 minutes, when it finally did turn on it smelled even more. I'm not really one to complain unless i cant stop thinking about it, I  figured maybe you just need to run. That seemed to do the trick luckily the AC started working fine. As far as the TV goes its a tube TV that has a high pitch ringing the entire time it's on. As far as the bathroom it reeks of cigarette smoke, especially the shower curtain. Its all that you can smell as you shower.

I spilled grape soda on the bed and it soaked the sheets. I called housekeeping to get the bed changed. They sent the staff right to the room however  the maids were very disrespectful and had major attitude. Once the maids saw the stain, the main maid with attitude (blonde curly haired woman) said we were on drugs...... I don't understand where you get a grape soda stain to be drugs.. but anyways. I get that it was late nigh,t but even though I offered to change the sheets  Emma (Housekeeping staff) told me to let the  maids change the sheets. The maids were bothered by the fact that they had to change the sheets and gave us even more attitude when they found out we needed a new mattress pad and blanket. They sent an additional woman with the proper bedding. They changed the bed and we still ended up tipping them $20 even though they didn't deserve a single penny for their nasty attitude. I thought that was the worst of it, only to fund out that the hotel management was an even bigger drag. So I called  to complain about the service and Emma transferred me to Judy  who is the housekeeping supervisor. She transferred me to the hotel supervisor (kerry) who once I said I wanted to speak to a manager put me on hold for a few minutes. Once I was able to speak to her she, told me she would transfer me to the hotel manager Johnny. After she came back from putting me on hold she basically told me that he didn't want to talk to me and that I should contact the Hotel manager Michael Gatling in the morning after 9am. So now I'm stuck feeling violated and disrespected and even more frustrated that the hotel staff, from housekeeping to upper management has treated me with the utmost disrespect.

I will update later with more detail of what transpires.",3,6,2

It is an older hotel so there are some area that reflect that for sure. They do not have many eating options in the hotel but the places I did go to were good the best place to grab a quick bite was the deli. Housekeeping was really nice and really helped us out with extra towels and pillows they were quick. 
The biggest disappointment for me were the elevators they took forever. At one point I had to wait about 20 minutes just to get back to my room. I was tired from being out and now having to wait that long was ridiculous. I feel this is something that needs to resolved or figured out asap. We were on floor 16th and there was only a few elevators that can be used versus the other ones that would go to all the floors... That was weird",6,0,1

Old looking buildings..ghetto people hanging outside..smoking and doing drugs.. a lot of shady criminal activities going on over here and it's terrifying. I feel unsafe walking to my hotel room in the dark. That's not even the worst part. The bathtub had gunk all over it. The bedsheets had a brown stain on it.. the pillows had a brown stain on it and what appeared to be drops of blood.. disgusting ..I called guest services and they said they'd have someone clean it. We had to go to my brother in laws hotel elsewhere to take a simple shower.. when we came back around 10pm the bathtub STILL had gunk on it!.. they didn't attempt to even clean it. My sheets seemed changed until I flipped my pillow over and the stains were still there! YOU CANNOT HAVE HUMAN BODILY FLUIDS ON YOUR ROOMS! It's dangerous..hazardous to MY HEALTH!.. I called guest services seriously upset AF.. I spoke with Tony I believe who put me on a ridiculously long hold to come back and not even remember he put me on hold. Because the fact that you have someone else's bodily fluids on a new guests pillow is not urgent enough? I demanded to be switched out of this room..out of these Manors but they're all booked up they said..they switched us down the hall and that someone was going to help us move our stuff. 30 minutes later a security guard comes to drop off keys and that's it. Didn't help us or anything. The new room has a deep red stain on the headboard..I'm praying it's not another blood stain. Given the ghettoness of this place I wouldn't put it pass them. It's so disrespectful, disgusting..UNACCEPTABLE!! My husband called to speak with a manager.. she offered buffet tickets. Like that is going to help this terrible experience. I will not even dare to walk into your buffet. It the rooms and the surrounding areas are this freaking disgusting then I cannot imagine the buffet to be any different. Your hotel should be ashamed of yourselves and the terrible service you offer. Your hotel should be closed and your customer service is the worst.

First of all, the hotel:  Don't stay here.  Period.  The rooms are dingy and don't look they've been cleaned since the days of the rat pack.   And just to get checked in, you have to stand in an amusement park style line, complete with velvet ropes to direct traffic, for up to an hour.  Not really what I was looking forward to after a long flight and multiple delays.  And don't ask the staff for ANY extras (towels, blankets, etc.)....all you'll get is a dirty look.  

Now for the amusement park:  It's OK.....definitely not great, but considering that it's inside a hotel, I guess you shouldn't expect too much.  But the roller coaster is a nice diversion, and the midway games are fun.  It's a bit overpriced for no more than what you get with it, and they close entirely too early, but again.....it's in a hotel in Vegas.  Need I say more?",4,2,2

My room was in one of those manors unfortunately. I don't know why it's not even part of the main hotel.  It's a pretty scary and dangerous place to stay especially walking at night or evening for that matter. 

It's away from everything.  The signs inside and outside of the hotel were unclear. Looking for the registration desk and stuff was annoying cause it was soo dArk! I mean geez.. 

When my friend and i walked to our room, the cleaning crews were still inside cleaning like really? We checked in and hour after check in time and the rooms aren't even ready?

Free boarding pass printing

The outside of the hotel is faded, we were told by a local that the place is grimy.. carpets are about 60 years old. The ventilation was terrible in the casino, the smoke really bothered me here. 

I booked a massage at the so-called Spa. The website looked great and it showed that they offered a variety of treatments. When I arrived at the Salon, I looked and and asked if she could tell me where the Spa was. Unfortunately, she said I was there. The Salon was old and dirty. She opened the door to show me the room where I'd be getting my massage and I almost walked out. It was a closet - no joke. The table was pushed up against the wall because the room wasn't big enough to fit in the centre. The towel she had on the table was stained and she gave me a wrap robe to put on that was stained and gross. To give you an idea of the size of the room, I am 5ft2 and when I reached my arms out I could touch either side of the room. There were brown and yellow splatters on the wall and the massage was less than average.

I can understand Vegas hotels and casinos reaching out to families. After all, mom and dad have money to lose. But this is ridiculous. Check in took 45 excruciating minutes, complete with screaming BRATS (note, I say brats, not kids- these were out-of-control BRATS), pushy Midwestern people who thought they owned the place, and drunken attitude-saturated teens who mistook MTV videos as a reflection of actual reality.

The room was generic- which is to be expected of Vegas. After all, they want you out spending your money, not holed-up in your room.

When I go to Vegas my standards for where I stay are typically pretty low.  Usually all that I need are a bed, a toilet, and a shower.

The Circus Circus prides itself on being a ""resort.""  If you're into that kind of thing and you plan on staying in one place for a while, then it might work for you.  I was there for a conference, and for some time away from life.  The hotel is a $14 from the convention center and the monorail that takes you up to the strip.

My stay was Thursday night through Tuesday morning. The room floor was dirty, cereal inside the ac vent, hall lamp was broken and never fixed during the stay. 
We noticed the next day the window was broken and the armoire had a large split on the side of it. We took photos and went the the hotel lobby to report it. The manager asked us what happened and we explained we went straight to bed and i caught a flight immediately after check in. She said we should have reported it sooner. We expalined we were tired and slept right away and thats why we were there first thing in the morning. 
Saturday morning, i go to uuse the hair dryer; it starts grinding and smoking. I immediately went to the front desk and explained what happened and also added there is a lott of rattling. The desk clerk said its normal for it to make noise. I expalined again it started smoking, she said its normal to smell something like that. I told her there was visual amoke and i wanted it replaced. Sheade note, -Never replaced the whole stay.

I made a call to the room maintenenc to request a role of t.p.. They said they would be up in a few minutes - i ended up waiting 2 hours and having to call back to request

I have no doubt this was probably once a nice Casino, but please find another place for your family.  We visited this past December.  Luckily for us we were in the RV Park.  Because once we went into the Casino we were appalled at the condition of the casino.  There was a chemical smell permeating the place (we were told they have had insect problems, I do not know about this, but really makes me wonder what that smell was)  and the smell was overwhelming.  
The dinning spots were overpriced, and again we wouldn't have eaten there if you had paid for it.  Now let's talk about customer service.  Customer service?  Well first they have a skeleton staff and service is minimal.  Perhaps there employees were all home sick from the smell?
We frequent a lot of Casinos.  We live near Reno\/Tahoe and have plenty of Indian Casino's where we live.  So we feel like we are somewhat experienced about what makes a good Casino.  One of the high priority's for us is good security.  Well don't look for that here.  Besides the rowdy folks stumbling through the Casino at a high percentage, there is the matter of the security at the tables.  Hah!  Husband was playing 21 and was verbally accosted by a player who was not happy with his play.  The other players rolled their eyes at this individual.  Then the man became very aggressive and told my husband ""Fight like a man and let' go outside"".  Where was the pit boss?  Security? According to the other players this man had been going on like this for quite a while.  This would never happen in the better casinos!
We met a couple from Europe who were also in the RV Park. I asked them if they were taking their children in for the rides etc.  He said emphatically NO!  He said  he had gone in to check it out and did not feel like it was a safe place for his children.

This is all coming from a 15 year old girl so keep that in mind ( I'm not very optimistic and this is my real opinion) overall this place is good ( I feel bad for the people that have gotten bad experiences here )",0,0,0

I have been going to Las Vegas for... ahem... about thirty years now with my family and extended family.  Now that I have a kiddo of my own, she has come with us a couple times and has loved it.  

Circus Circus is not somewhere I would ever go on my own.  It is outdated and really dark inside.

However, for kids, they have the best midway on The Strip.  The games are easier to win, with some games giving every child under 12 a prize just for playing.  That makes it a lot easier when you have children who are unevenly matched in their game skills.  Of course, they will have to learn not everyone can win a prize at some point, but that is another topic.  

The midway does not open until 11 a.m., so plan for a late breakfast before heading to Circus Circus.  Waiting around for it to open is not fun, especially when you can see every game, but you just can't get to it.

Also, if you are a few tickets short of the prize your child wants, the staff is really accommodating.  You usually won't have to go play more games just to get those few tickets.  However, YMMV.  At the Excalibur midway, you cannot even be one ticket short (and the games cost twice as much to play).

Additionally, the midway does have live gymnasts and acrobats who perform several times daily.  That is free fun for the whole family.

The parking situation is not great at Circus Circus, as it can be a little confusing.  Also, there are signs everywhere warning you that your car may get broken into and that the hotel is not responsible for theft or damage.  That is a little bit worrisome, as we did not see signs like that in any other parking lot.  That said, we did not get broken into on either of the last two days we visited and parked there.

Overall, if you have kids, Circus Circus is a must stop.  If you don't, skip it.",5,0,2

It was honestly our choice because of price but wasn't obviously the best hotel around. It was seemingly clean enough and the beds were comfortable.  It did smell a little more than I thought it would (the smoke smell).  My only real complaint would be the elevators. They were ridiculously slow and it seemed that only 1 or 2 worked for all of the floors of the hotel and casino.

1. It's a historical casino\/hotel (kid friendly)
2. It's cheap

Now let me tell you why they don't deserve the other 3 stars.

Any room in the Manor section of the hotel sucks, majorly. My son and I stayed in Manor A 2nd floor. The walk to the room was properly instructed by the hotel registrar and had us walk through the entire casino, passed the adventuredome, out onto a non working escalator in a hallway adjacent to the building where Manor A was actually located. We later found out on our own that our room was just a few feet away without the detour, smh.

After 30 minutes of sweat and tears wasted by being misled we was tired. So as we're relaxing I noticed that there is NO air ventilation in the bathroom (if someone goes #2 run for your lives!) even if the door is closed, eventually you have to open it and the smell will still be in the bathroom. The sink dials are incorrect. Hot is the the right and cold is to the left when it should be reversed. I found that out after scolding my hand. 

My son wanted to take a nap and noticed the purple ""blanket"" nicely decorated on the bed is not even a blanket  it's just decoration. I thought he was lying until I tried to open mine thinking it was just folded into fours or something. Nope. It's not a blanket. Not to mention the light on my son's bed side table didn't even work. The outlet where my lamp was plugged into is missing the outlet face. Isn't that a hazard? 

The wallpaper is falling off the walls. The walls are too thin and I was woken up by our neighbors blasting the tv (on cartoons, I get it, this is a kid hotel but damn I shouldn't have to hear them) at 7am. Thanks for waking me up like this isn't Vegas and people aren't up all hours of the night. 

With all the money we pay for hotel\/resort fees one would think this hotel would have upgraded their rooms by now. Just because this is the ""kids"" hotel doesn't mean it has to be crap. No hotel shuttle or airport shuttle. No gym. No microwave but you can get a fridge for an extra $20 a night. But you won't be able to heat up your food because microwaves aren't an option. 

Overall they should be happy with the 2 stars I gave. They need to upgrade this place or shut it down. I definitely don't see it lasting forever under these conditions.",5,3,1

Now, it's just a complete dump that had a few renovations over the years with the smell of piss as their hotel fragrance.

This hotel is on the same league as the Excalibur, Luxor, Riviera, and the Quad. Located on the north part of the strip in a bad area, I wouldn't walk outside towards the main part of the strip, (Caesar's Palace, Mirage, Treasure Island, Venetian, the Flamingo Hotel) but if you insist of walking outside at night to gaze in the Vegas lights. Stay with a big group and ladies, carry pepper spray if you're traveling alone. 

The one thing I like about Circus Circus is the price and the cheap eats compared to the strip. Although the casino is not as fancy as the newer hotels, I love playing the clown slots and some of the staff was ok in terms of customer service. The clientele reflects the condition and price of the hotel. Entertainment options like the infamous, Free Circus Acts, the huge arcade, and the Adventure Dome (Formally the Grand Slam Canyon) are what draws me back to Circus Circus.",12,8,5

NOTE!  Every time we went to and prom our room, we had to walk through the entire casino and then though the gift shops to get to the elevators to our room!  I've been to Vegas over 16 times, always a different hotel, and never saw this CRAP.  It's not the walking, it's the walking through crowded passages, dodging vendors and solicitors, and smelling the old-stink.  It takes over 5 minutes to get from our room to the strip.  That was 20 minutes per day for seven days, a total of 140 minutes just getting OUT OF THE PLACE!  (Treasure Island elevators are just on the back side of the width of the casino, 20 paces).

FOOD: Service in the Garden Grill by wait staff was trash. Bartender had some professionalism, but hostess and waitresses simply not professional.  (Everywhere else was better)  

FACILITIES: Rooms were Motel 6 standard, pool was small but clean, casino floor had ""old"" smell.  Several gift shops with mostly same dollar-store quality crap.  No idea why the have duplicate items in all their shops!  (Treasure Island was clean, fresh, and nice gift shop).

VENDORS: Can't walk through the casino to the hotel elevators without being badgered by vendors.  Literally over 7 different vendors heckle you EVERY time you walk to or from the hotel elevators EVERY time!  And we stayed for a week!  So that was at least 4 x 7 = 28 times!  One of these clowns even said ""There you are!  I was looking for you!"" GO F YOURSELF!  I hate that BS! (Never experienced this at any other casino)

BUFFET: Get this!  They ARE NOT OPEN from morning opening to evening closing!  THEY ARE CLOSED between meals!  So UNLIKE every other buffet I have been to (ALL the major ones in Vegas), if you show up in between scheduled meals, you can't get it!  STUPID!  So we went elsewhere.

ROCK PUB: They have a rock pub there.  Fun, but beer pong events just icky!  Check this out, it is the number one way herpes is spread.  When we walked in, it looked like a frat party of folks well past college age.  THAT is simply sad.  (Go to the Flamingo Piano bar)

If you're 21+, this is definitely not a good place to stay in Vegas.
It's on the outskirts of The Strip, so it's not easy to get anywhere - the Wynn\/Encore is a couple blocks away but you are still far from everything else. 
The food in the hotel is very mediocre.
The gambling in the hotel also really sucks - the blackjack tables have a $5 minimum, which is lower than most places in Vegas, BUT they only deal 1 deck, so it's almost always in the dealer's favor. You can lose a lot of money that way. People also don't really seem to come here for anything other than slots, because even the poker room only had 1 full table when I came, compared to the Venetian or even Encore, which had hella. 

Good thing my friends and I weren't staying here during our trip!",0,0,0

When we walked up to the Hotel from the parking lot there was an overwhelming smell of garbage. Inside the lobby we checked in, gotten our rooms keys and we went up. My father in-law however, chose to get us up on the wrong floor and we got a bit lost, not knowing where our rooms were. He decided to get some help and we were helped by a staffmember of the hotel. It was all friendly and professional. 
The Rooms:
Me and my husband went into our rooms and I thought it was going to be a bit of a run down room, but it was not! It was pleasant, good in size and neat. Instantly I felt more relieved, that was until we wanted to put some cash and jewelry in our safebox, which did not work. I alerted my father in law and he contacted front desk. They said that someone might come to our rooms tomorrow between 12:00 AM and 4 PM. Uhm, we're supposed to be in our rooms the whole day? We didn't do that and used the safebox from my father inlaw. But it was a bit frustrating that they could not send someone straight up. 
Even though the rooms we had were fairly modern and pretty, some parts of the hotel it self were a bit run down. When me and my husband walked towards the pool we peeked into some other rooms that were being cleaned and we were shocked (and happy) to see how the quality was in there. 
The Buffet: 
A no go... It was disgusting, and very unsatisfying... Everything I ate there tasted like plastic. That was not even the worst part, when I went to grab food I noticed chicken bones on the carpet, lying between tables, anyone could have spotted it. When I went back to my seat it was still there, and when we left it was still there. We had been sitting there for quite a while and it seemed to me it was ridiculous that none of the waiters had picked it up. So I got a napkin, picked it up and dumped it on a not yet cleaned table.
We did go into the Adventuredome, but we didn't go on any of the rides. It does seem like a fun time for kids, but I got no clue why anyone would take their kids to Vegas to be honest...",3,0,0

Upon arrival, I didn't think it was all that bad! The decor was a little tacky and it isn't half as glamorous as some of the big name hotels but it is great for the price if you're not planning to spend most of your time in your hotel room! 

Our room # is 24838, it was CLEAN and tidy, and that was really all we could hope for. The bonus was the view and the helpful staff. Wi-fi was great in the room. The gym was quite small with only approximately 7-10 machines, 4 treadmills, and no free weights over 20 lbs. Couldn't find the pool, not sure if they even have one.

The only downside to this hotel in my experience is the fact that it is indeed a little far from the main part of the strip =( The closest two hotels are Encore and Wynn and they were about a 10-12 minute walk. We ended up cabbing to most of our outings since it was also very cold to go around this time of the year. It was mostly 15-18C and even colder at night (bring lots of sweaters and warm pants)

There's also a tix 4 tonight booth downstairs to the west tower and it's a great spot to get discounted last minute tickets to shows! As for food, there is a Krispy Kreme donuts, Auntie Annie, and McDonald's right inside the hotel. There is also a buffet and steakhouse for those looking for finer fare. The steakhouse was pretty pricey from what I could see in the digital menu outside, approximately $50-$70 for steaks. The buffet at Circus Circus was very disappointing. Good variety of food but quality wasn't up to par. It was only $20 for the dinner buffet but not worth it for what you were getting. They had a pretty good salad bar, only 2 choices of soup (chicken noodle or minestrone), pogo sticks, fried chicken, pasta station, make your own taco\/fajita area, ham, turkey, and roast beef, clams, baked tilapia. These were just some of the things I remember from the buffet. May as well just go to McDonald's and get 20 nuggets for $6.

Overall, I kind of like the tacky circus theme and considering the price we were paying, I am very satisfied with my first Vegas experience at Circus Circus.",0,0,0

We planned to stay here during the pigskin youth football tournament for five days. This being my first time in Vegas I didn't know better.

After waiting about an hour to check in to my supposedly renovated room I got off the elevator and walked down the hallway past a sopping wet ceiling panel above a garbage can in the middle of the floor surrounded by caution tape. I was shocked to say the least but kept walking to my room anyway.

The room smelled like urinal cakes and the sheets and drapes were stained. I couldn't bare to spend a night there and left immediately. 

The worst thing about this whole experience is that I came to find out that this hotel is owned by MGM resorts international which owns about 12 hotels on the strip including Aria and the Bellagio for crying out loud! People bring their kids to stay here and this is how they are treated. Whether you're a billionaire or just the average joe you ought to be treated with respect and dignity wherever you spend your money and Circus Circus does neither.

1. Only 5 minutes of (free) circus performers every 45 minutes. (Dangerously over crowded at each show)
2. Small overpriced rooms
3. Noisy pipes (?) at night
4. Big pink light (my room faced the pink adventure dome) coming in the window
5. North end of the strip, far from the cool part of LV. 
6. Expensive restaurants (even the cheap buffet was still $20 a person)
7. Far from the monorail
8. $4.00 for a bottle of water
9. No fridge, no microwave in room
10. My kid who was two inches too tall at age 8, for the kid rate, had to pay the adult rate of $29 for an all day pass on the kiddie rides. 
11. Wifi was non-functional
12. ""Closet"" cubby, (no door) was too low to hang my long coat without dragging it on the floor.

Generally, the casino and the Midway reeks of trash and smoke, which can become unbearable especially when it becomes extremely crowded later in the day. 

The Adventuredome is crowded with kids running around and teens in herds, but it definitely seems like a good time for those interested in theme parks. The free and continuous circus acts are also great entertainment. 

Even though it is located on the strip, it is so far away from all the real excitement and you would have to drive to other parking lots if you want to experience the full strip because walking would take a while. If you're looking for the glitz of Las Vegas, stay at the Bellagio or other similar hotels because what you'll get at Circus Circus are touristy souvenir shops, unclean areas, and outdated rooms.

The ""Manors"" at Circus Circus are absolutely terrible and they charged us almost $160\/night when their normal pricing is $20-$30.

-wasn't expensive
-we got to the hotel before our check in time, but this was ok since the hotel had a service that held our bag for us until our check in time arrived
-souvenir shops within the hotel
-right by a walgreens 
-the hotel is surrounded by many food establishments

I got my stay here through another website i think it was hotels.com (not sure though) it was a good deal. 6 nights\/7days king size bed with air conditioning and a fridge. Turned out it was at the manors not even connected to the hotel. I decided to upgrade when checking in. The lady was real nice about it and got us the upgrade real easy. Had to wait around about an hour or two because there card system was down.

From first glance, the hotel looks grimy, old, and wore out.  Same is said of the inside. It's stuffy everywhere and smells of smoke (which isn't to big of an issue for me)

 I went and got my key and went to pick up my luggage because I didn't want to carry it around with me, so I left it at the luggage hold area. No one was at the desk! and their were 4 other people waiting by the time I got there. 20 minutes passed before a lady showed up and started getting people their luggage. smallest quantity at a time. I had 5 so I had to wait until she got through all 4 other people. (she looked super annoyed with her job and looked like she didn't want to be here at all. no care about the customers\/clients\/guests)

Get up to my room on 6th floor. My room is small with a small bathroom and a door to the adjacent room?? (Security risk any?) air conditioning didn't work, fan had mold on it, of course I didn't realize that until I started to get sick a day later from having it run. No fridge in my room like the deal said. Oh did I say I was put in a smoking room on a nonsmoking floor? because it was the only one available for upgrade. Well after a terrible night's rest, and getting sick from the mold they moved me down the hall to a new room.

Looks Identical. only they gave me a fridge and a working air conditioner and no door to the adjacent room. Yet the room is placed in a similar location where my last room was, so whats up with that? the view from both rooms is terrible. You mostly look at a building in front of you and the roof of the main building area below you.

The Buffet Review: 1\/5

Over Priced, terrible selection of foods, and even worse in the taste department.  After waiting in line for about 10 minutes which isn't to bad for lunch time. I got seated and went to look at the foods.  Wide selection of choices they do have.

My first plate consisted of Mashed potatoes w\/ gravy, fried chicken wings, mac & cheese, x2 sausage links, and toast.  The wings, M&C, and potatoes were yucky. tasted like 3 day old KFC, because 2 day old KFC tastes better! The sausage links were cold in the center and under cooked, and the toast was just plain cold.

2nd plate was a salad with olives, cheddar cheese, and ranch. Because the rest of the salad makings either don't belong on a salad or belong to a separate salad group. the dressings were miss labeled ( I don't think rang is supposed to be orange?) or they weren't labeled at all. The lettuce was dry and warm which salads aren't supposed to be warm.  I also grabbed a plate of sliced cherry pie, my thought was how can you screw up pie?...Circus Circus did! it tasted like that fake pie you make when your to lazy to make your own or to cheap to buy the good stuff for an extra 2 bucks. Plus it was cold. If anything positive came out of the buffet it was the water. Because at least that they got right. Cold and wet!

I'm almost done.  Most of the people here are nice. The room keepers if your lucky enough to get English speakers are pretty nice. Unless they don't understand the word go away, or can't read the do not disturb sign. I was interrupted by several room cleaners on several occasions. They just barge right in without saying anything. I don't think they care to read the do not disturb sign clearly placed on the outside door handle. One of them came in while I was undressing ( which I wouldn't mind if she was attractive, which He wasn't) 

The casino area. It clearly states no minors under the age of 21 allowed in or to loiter in the gaming area. I must have seen several kids sitting on the gambling games next to their parents which is illegal.  I even saw a kid sitting at a black jack table, clearly under the age of 15. The waitress\/servers in the casino area are not attractive but instead look like 40 year old ladies in terrible shape who shouldn't be wearing said outfits. Plus their service is terrible, they walk around saying ""drinks? Drinks"" and they walk so fast you have to yell at them to get there attention. Then you don't see one for at least 20 minutes. cheaper to just sit at the bar. Plus I saw several of these servers just coughing on the drinks they were serving, made me sick knowing they coughed on people's drinks.

Overall a bad stay here. Recommend if your looking for a cheap stay. better staying at a motel or something. Plus some health concerns here!",0,0,0

So hey if you're here and you need a place to hang or a home base then definitely go for it.  Otherwise...damn....the casino is like ghetto plus twelve.  There were kids literally EVERYWHERE and I *LOVE* kids.  I was just appalled that people would want or be encouraged to bring their kids to a place that was SO filled with smoke and ilk just so their parents can get their gamble on.  I heard that ALL THREE pools were closed..that's just trifling.  The games on the midway did not seem to be outrageously priced at all but I was just taken aback by the need for this sort of 'baby sitting' service.

To begin with, there are different classes of rooms which they do not delineate emphatically enough (if at all on the site) so that you realize you're staying in a toilet rather than the nice main building.

When we got to the room, the lock was broken so we called the front desk to have someone bring me tools to fix it. Although this is supposed to be a non-smoking room, it definitely has been smoked in. There is no question. We complained about that also. They said they would make a note. Part of the reason for this review is self-defense. I don't trust this place. Therefore, I expect them to charge me for smoking in this room although I quit smoking years ago.

The only place i saw more worn, threadbare bedding was at my grandmother's house. At least you expect the bedding there to be decades old. 

There is hardly any way to get front desk assistance unless you wait on the phone for 10 to 15 minutes that's just what it is. Another little item, I went to check in, but my wife's name was on the reservation. That meant I had to go back out get her so she could get the room. Of course, l had all the personal information on her and the reservation. I've seen less nonrepudiation measures at nuclear plants.

I will not stay here again and let my friends know to avoid this place. Why 2 stars instead of 1? I've stayed in third world countries. This place sux slightly less than that. You get an extra surprise charge for a resort fee, even if you are staying in the subpar rooms. This means you get NO bargain or price break. You're better off staying in a room that locks. 45 minutes later and I am still on door guard.

I expect we will ditch this hole tomorrow. Seeing all the other negative reviews sans remediation, I'd bet nothing is done.",4,1,0

My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night as we passed through the city on our way to Death Valley.  We reserved our room online several weeks in advance. However, when we checked in, we were told all online reservations were first come first serve and that they weren't able to give us the non-smoking room like we requested weeks earlier.  We were also charged a $25 fee for booking online.  I wish that was communicated to us before we made the reservation.

We were given a room in the Manor Lodge, which was news to us as we booked our room in one of the towers.  We had no clue there was even a Manor Lodge! On our way to the Manor Lodge, which is quite far from the main hotel and casino, we witnessed a drug deal in the parking lot, a family almost get hit by a speeding car, piles of dried puke, countless cigarette butts, and a needle.  The parking lot and garage area is quite a scary place and I don't recommend walking alone there at night.  I wish there was a security presence. 

Upon entering our room, we were hit with an extremely musty smell, like dirty wet laundry.  The edge of the carpets were wet and stained, the walls had stains on them that looked like bodily fluids, none of the outlets worked, the air conditioner was falling out of the window, the sheets had cigarette burns on them, and the shower was riddled with mold.  The room was so dirty that we didn't feel comfortable taking off our shoes.

On the door there is a large sign that urges guests to use the deadbolt, however, our deadbolt didn't work.  We heard awkward sounds from a nearby room that would be extremely inappropriate, and quite scary, for a family with children to hear.

I've stayed in my fair share of Travelodges and Comfort Inns and this dump is not even up to their standards.

I'm awarding a second star just for the old arcade games, and because the video poker and table games have better odds and lower minimums than most on the strip. The reason for that is it's the only way they can operate without bulldozing this charmless monstrosity.

===== THE HOTEL
I have now stayed there twice, and YES, I stayed there again on purpose.  There is one very important thing to note:

********** YOU MUST STAY IN THE WEST TOWER! **********

The west tower was recently upgraded, and it is wonderful.  The rooms still smell like new carpet, which is so much better than the other plethora of smells you can get in a hotel.  The rooms are reminiscent of Signature at MGM, but slightly smaller.  For this very nice room with one king, we paid $43.05 per night.

********** I REPEAT, WE PAID $43.05\/NIGHT FOR 3 NIGHTS! **********

You can't stay that cheap almost anywhere, much less in Vegas, much less in a NICE room.  Granted, we did get a ""Buy 2 get 1 Free"" deal, though the 3rd night would have only been $29 more...not bad.

On our most recent stay, we were given the room that is built for challenged people, and thus it had a different bathroom.  Normally, this is considered an upgrade, but I would definitely disagree in this case.  The show had height adjustable head, though it wouldn't move.  There was also a platform for a person to sit on while they bathe, but it just took up space.  There was much less counter space than the normal room we had stayed in previously, and the mirror was much smaller as well (my girlfriend didn't care for that).

===== FOOD
Inside the hotel are about 5 different eateries.  Its to their advantage that you go in not expecting very much, as you come away very pleasantly surprised.  The Garden Grill had really great food...the caesar salad was delicious as were the filet minon sliders.  The service was good but maybe a bit slow.  Don't hesitate to go here!

The Casino Cafe had the best eggs benedict I've ever eaten, and that is the only breakfast item I ever order.  I have been craving it since I ate there!  The service here is worse than Garden Grill, but the waiters do mean well.  Our waiter was an older asian gentleman with a strong accent, and stronger sense of humor.  A few times I wasn't sure what he said and he said ""sorry sorry, I know I talk funny"".  He had a lot of endearing qualities  and we tipped him very well for his good-hearted nature.  

I suppose I should review Krispy Kreme too since I had a doughnut there.  Service is horrible, but its Krispy Kreme within 50 ft. of the roulette tables...nuf' said.  

===== THE CASINO
Honestly, I like the casino.  Maybe its because I generally do very well on their tables.  Without being able to put a finger on it, I like the casino for its table games (specifically, roulette).  It can get crowded sometimes, but otherwise the dealers are cool (Jorge and Rodriguez are a couple funny ones).  For roulette fans, they also have 6 video roulette machines that are hard to find elsewhere. 

===== THE PLAY AREA
If you like to act like a kid and can put up with real kids for awhile, the big top is fun.  Its deceivingly large... there are 2 full-size rollercoasters and a mountain inside.  Theres a ton of games that you don't see every day, and my girlfriend and I enjoy going in there for maybe 30 minutes at a time...then getting the hell out of there.  It smells just like The Log Jammer at Six Flags Magic Mountain inside the dome (in case anyone knows that musty, water and oil smell), and I get nostalgic when I smell it.



===== Location: Its not very close to anything, so -1 here.
===== The Goods:  The room was great, as was the food.  
===== Ambiance:  There are definitely more kids than other hotels, but in the casino you don't see them, so -1 out of 10 for that.
===== Overall:  I won't hesitate to stay there for the 3rd time, but ONLY if we can stay in one of the West Tower rooms.",3,1,2

We moved to Circus Circus for only one night do to no availability where we were to save some money!  This place is the equivalency to a low budget $40 a night room for $200!  The halls carpet are dirty. The elevator smelled like piss!  Bed was so worn out we about disappeared when we laid down.  The furniture looked like hand me down. I was told it was the worn out furniture from another big name casino hotel!  It looked like it!  Smoke in the casino was terrible.

Thus, the booking screen presents what turns out to be a base rate, plus local tax that is specified in terms of a percentage.  Separate from these pricing elements, and in small print, is an indicate one's credit card will be charged an unspecified ""resort fee"" which is not listed in the amounts specified as part of the cost of lodging.  Hence, I conclude that Circus Circus essentially induces the lodger to think the cost of lodging will be only the base rate, plus the local taxes.  Only at check in is the lodger confronted with the additional ""resort fee"".

I am told that the resort fee is standard on the strip.  Perhaps so.  But if other hotels also essentially hide the amount of this fee at the time of booking as I believe Circus Circus intends to do, multiple wrongs in the form of deceptive booking mechanisms do not justify Circus Circus in use of the same method.  When I purchase a service or product, I wish to know the full cost involved.  I feel deceived by Circus Circus and will think twice before returning.",0,0,0

I'll just tell you my experience. I went with my 6 year old and my husband from Sunday to Wednesday. This hotel with flight included cost under $400 each. Not only was it affordable (one reason to not compare it to other hotels on the strip DUH #1) but it also gave us spending money to go visit the Adventuredome which was SOOOOO MUCH fun! That costed $25 each and we went and came back later after taking a stroll down the strip. There are a lot of families which equates to LOTS of kids, cousins, grandmas, and uncles around because it is family friendly (another reason to not compare it to other hotels on the strip DUH #2). We also went to eat at THE STEAK HOUSE and OMG, I had the best filet mignon I had ever eaten and I have been to a lot of fancy steak houses. It did cost $52 but it included a delish salad which included beets and orange tomatoes. Along with two sides. We also ate at some of the more affordable places such as the Blue Iguana and the Pizzaria. I just would NOT go to Vince Neil's spot. The margaritas were horrible along with the service and the chicken fingers my husband threw up after 30 minutes of eating them. Either way, I appreciate the affordability and quality of food for the other spots. My husband also gambled at the $3 Blackjack table! He had so much fun because once again...this place is affordable. (DUH #3). I did not give it five stars because the pool is lacking some updating but it was still a decent pool, however remodeling it in the near future may help with the visual aspect of Circus Circus.

I was assured the room was non-smoking, and that all rooms were non-smoking.  The room was hot and smelled of smoke.

There were no convenient outlets, and the ones that were there could not hold plugs.  they simply fell out.

All the flashy lights, cigarette smoke, alcohol, raucous, and funky smells of the casino can be intimidating for a kid and I remember wishing we'd stayed at Days Inn, where it was quiet, more manageable, and more holy. This was the city my mother warned me about, where alcoholics and hookers ran rampant in the streets and fathers gambled away their mortgages, and I wasn't about to have any part of it. I had stuffed animals back home that needed me. But then I finally loosened up and mustered up the courage to venture out of the hotel room and gamble away my college trust fund while I sipped on a vodka cranberry.

Ok maybe not. 

But I did sip on some apple juice and played skee ball until my ten bucks ran dry. I scored a yellow M&M doll and a blue monkey that night and it was the proudest moment of my life. =) Then I got REALLY brave and snuck into the slot machine area with my bro (who was 18 at the time, before they increased the minimum gambling age to 21) and witnessed him hit the jackpot and return home with a large souvenir cup full of quarters (this is when Vegas slots discharged actual coins instead of vouchers).

I chose Circus Circus Hotel because I didn't have alot of money and had to be there for a conference for a week. I didn't really care about the children being everywhere because I didn't intend on staying at the hotel except for sleeping. I wasnt really expecting much because the reviews for this place were crap.

When I got there I was like a child again. I felt like I was in heaven. There were so many things to do and a wonderful kids casino that I ran around in for hours. I won more in the Kids casino than I would have won in the regular casinos. :D

Okay, so I stayed in one of the Manor Rooms. Creepy at first site. Kinda dirty and lost looking. But my room was clean, the bathroom was nice, and the room service was reliable. If you want perfection then cough up the money for it but I personally had no complaints for the hotel room or the service especially since I payed nickles and dimes for it. Surprisingly, I didn't really hear any kids while in my room. Sure, they littered the halls of the casino but it didn't bother me.

I really enjoyed Circus Circus, I didn't expect alot but I enjoyed what I got and made the best out of everything.

Oh, How could I forget?
They have Circus shows every few hours. Among all the children and their parents, I, a 21 year old, clapped and screamed like a 7 year old. The performers were too exciting and you cant help feeling like a kid when you are there.

Of course, it's just a brilliant way to get your kid hooked on gambling and spending money at a young age, but hey! TURN UP kiddie style!

Grown ups who are kids on the inside: Reference above comment.

People on a budget: I mean, if you can't afford this, the Travel Lodge, or off strip, is your only other bet...or maybe you should save up a little more before visiting? The Stratosphere and Downtown hotels are within the same range options.

Location:  Welcome to the North strip! Just know, after the Wynn, it gets a tad shady. Just stay within the hotel's vicinities. This hotel isn't really near anything important. The Riviera use to be across the street but was closed.

Casino: Cheaper prices compared to many casinos on the strip.

Rooms: You kinda get what you paid for, but it's a great place for quick trips. I think they're clean and livable.  If you like luxury, though, this place isn't for you!

Food: McDonalds (which seems to be then landlord of Vegas) and Subway are the cheapest options.

I booked a room at the west tower, and being a fight night i paid $144.28 for one night.  The price was a bit high but i saved a few bucks compared to other hotels at the strip. I checked in and the lady who helped me out said to just get in any elevator and it will take me to the 22nd floor where my room was.  I got in one elevator and realized it had no 22nd floor, and i had to go all the way down and catch another elevator that would take me up there.  I didn't give it too much thought and figured the lady could have forgot. My lady and i dropped off our bags and headed down to the casino and returned about 1am. One of the lamps on the side of the bed wasn't working and i had to move the furniture as it wasn't plugged in.  Then when my lady and were ready to sleep and got in the bed we found a couple hairs and stains in both the sheets and the blanket.  I called housekeeping and requested my sheets to be changed and i was promised they would take care of it quick. 20 minutes later i called to check up on the sheets and another lady told me she didn't know anything about it and she would send someone right away.  Another 20 minutes later i called again and the lady said she already sent someone but there was only one lady doing housekeeping so it would be a while.  The housekeeper arrived at my room and rudely began throwing the sheets and kicking them out of the room and I'm guessing she assumed i didn't speak  Spanish and began mumbling about my lady and i being too cocky and that it was a hassle to come up and change the sheets.  She was almost done but forgot the blanket and had to go back down to get one meanwhile my lady and i were waiting to be able to rest. She returned and swapped blankets and walked away.  It took close to an hour to get my sheets changed, not the service I was expecting from circus. Next morning i wanted to make myself a cup of coffee and my coffee maker was not plugged in either.  I expected better service from this hotel.  I've been yo the circus in Reno and it is nothing like the one in Vegas.  I will not return and will warn friends and relatives about this place.  At the price i paid I could have gotten excellent service from Paris or Ceasars which i staid at the previous nights.

I Feel Horrible to have to even want to put a review on here. I have been to Vegas plenty of times and before my last trip i have always loved going to Circus Circus and enjoying the atmosphere that makes me feel like a kid again.. But while visiting this hotel I came upon such a poor security protection experience, especially right after the horrific Las Vegas Tragedy that happened just recently completely discussed me. Upon my recent visit here I was not only stalked by a man but I was also poked by a needle from this man.  After I was stuck with this needle and I went to Circus Circus security to report this the man was still right there.  I stated to security look at the cameras, and was told ""We Only Check Cameras For Emergencies"".  HMMMM   What is CIRCUS CIRCUS's definition of an ""EMERGENCY""  Security asked me if I would like to press charges.  OF COURSE I DO!!!!!    During this time my boyfriend showed up and called the REAL POLICE!!!!!!!!!!!!   Come to find out the security walked the gentlemen out and let him go to do this to HIS next poor victim... Stating I said ""I DID NOT WANT TO PRESS CHARGES.""  ARE YOU KIDDING!!!!  WHY WOULD I EVEN ATTEMPT TO TELL YOU IF I DON'T WANT TO PRESS CHARGES.  DO I GET POKED WITH A NEEDLE BY A STRANGER EVERYDAY?""  ""COMMON SENSE""  OMG.  Police authorized me to seek medical attention.  I went to the hospital but now I have to wait for all the results why I worry about what was this man's sole intention.   Circus Circus should do the right thing.....  Look at the cameras and attempt to save the next poor sole.

I arrived on Tuesday night for a 3 night stay.  It was late (approx. 11pm) and there was a long line to check in...and only 3 people working the desk.  It went VERY slow...at least 20 minutes until I reached an agent.  The agent happened to be the hotel manager (Johnny) who was very nice and apologetic about the wait.  I requested the highest floor possible and he told me there was only 3 floors.  He said HOTELS.COM booked me in the ""Manor"" building but he would move me to the highrise the following night.  I paid approx. $270 per night (FYI).  It was late, I was tired and I just wanted to get to the room so I said fine.  He told me it was about a 4 minute walk...huh???  He gave me a map so I was off lugging my three bags out of the building...across the street...until I thought I found it.  After opening the door to what seemed like a dilapidated, I thought...no...this can't be it (and it wasn't).  It was the ""A"" building and I was in the ""E"" building.  So I walked around (now it was around 11:30pm) dragging my suitcases until I saw a guy on a bike wearing a security uniform.  He pointed me to the ""E"" building...all the way at the end.  After several more minutes of walking, I entered the shit-hole.  I can't even begin to describe it.  I thought it was a joke.  Appears to be where prostitutes can take ""Johns"" by the hour.  It was disgusting...gross.  It smelled...it was dark...the walls were damaged...the doors looked like they were repaired and painted over a hundred times.  I entered my room and was even more grossed out.  It was dirty...the sheets were stained...the wallpaper was pealing...the carpet looked like it was from the 70's...I could hear EVERYTHING...a guy snoring down the hall...kids watching cartoons on one side of me and a few other TV's down the hall.  I didn't unpack...slept in my clothes...and couldn't wait to get out of there the next morning. For this dump I paid $270 a night???  It wasn't worth $20\/night!!!

The next morning, I again had to wait 20+ minutes in the check-in line.  Johnny wasn't there so I told the agent I was supposed to have a room in the high rise.  She typed in my name...said, ""Oh yes...however the room isn't ready quite yet"".  She said to leave my bags at the bell desk and no matter what time I returned (it was a convention), my room would be waiting.  So that's what I did.

I returned at around 7pm...once again had to wait 20+ minutes in the check-in line.  I told the agent I needed the keys to my new room...she typed in a bunch of stuff into the computer and said, ""Sorry...we are completely booked...there's nothing I can do for you.""  I was pissed and demanded to see the manager (again Johnny wasn't working).  I told the manager how gross the room was last night...how I wouldn't let my dog stay there...and within 2 minutes he found me a room on the 26th floor.  

My new room was just ok...clean and much quieter...but still not remodeled in many years.  Just seems like the whole property needs to be leveled and rebuilt for today's standards.  The lobby...the casino...it was all tired and sad looking.

The one positive was the deli store near the lobby.  Food was excellent.

LAYOUT: horrible. Who puts the hotel lobby in the back of the building when the main entrance is on the Strip? So basically, you must walk the entire length of the main floor to even get checked in (God forbid you have a lot of luggage). There are no direct elevators to the rooms, so have your walking shoes ready. If you're staying in Manor or Skyrise Tower, you have to get off at the Promenade level and then take another elevator to your room (and the wait is horrible). In general, give yourself 20 minutes early to get down to the lobby if you're meeting someone.

AMBIANCE: this hotel appears severely outdated, sad and depressing. It hasn't been updated since disco was still in vogue. The main floor is a labyrinth of gambling tables and slots, in addition to various sleazy merchants selling sundries and other garbage that nobody wants or needs. The rooms in the Skyrise Tower have been updated, but I still saw peeling wallpaper and there were no coffee machines, fridges or microwaves. So basically, they make you uncomfortable if you want outside food. If you want cold drinks, get ice from the machine in the hallway, fill up the bucket and put your drink on that. Don't bring any food that's quickly perishable because you have nothing to keep it cold with or heat it up anyway!

This is a great kid-friendly hotel, but I don't want to be around kids when I come to Vegas. The staff looks like they want to be anywhere BUT there, and I would, too, if I had to wear an outdated purple jacket as my uniform.

So I traveled to Vegas as a tag-a-long. I'm always up for a good time so I adapt and I go with the flow. 

Over the years I would have NEVER picked to stay here.  Even when I took my kid nieces to Vegas for the summer we didn't stay here for the kid appeal. I saw the pictures and frankly it looked like a clown threw up in the room.  Weellllllllll HELLO Circus Circus! The tower I stayed in was lovely!  The decor upgraded and the regular room was large.  Now keep in mind you can normally find me at the high end contemporary hotels so my standards are high but I really felt comfortable here.  

The bathroom was small and a normal bath shower combo with a curtain (I think NO place should use a curtain.  Get a door!) But clean and updated.  

No great amenities in the room and no views.  I'm curious to see the high floor views.  Not much on that end of the strip to look at.  The suite was large however,  size of bathroom did not increase.  

The casino yes it's small and more kids than the other hotel's. The adventurdome is a great place for kids however, it does get pricey.  

The Buffett...by far I've had better in Vegas. 

The Wifi...more like no fi..totally slow. 

The gym, almost non existent.  BUT are you really going to workout on vacay?  (I did that's how I know the gym isn't super great)

So you have to ask yourself,  why did I come to Vegas?

Room - we stayed in the recently remodeled West Tower. It was quiet and clean. Although it is starting to show poor upkeep with cigarette burns in the chair and marks on the wall paper.

Internet - you get free wi-fi with the resort fee. It went down a few times - you have to pay to use the business center ($10 for 20 min but we had a $5 off coupon, printing costs 2 minutes per page)
You can get your boarding passes printed for free at the mail\/information desk but prepare for a line.

Check In\/Out - I wanted to see if the room was ready around 11am and she informed me that their computers had been down since the previous night, yikes, but when I came back at 4pm they were working and it only took a few minutes for check in\/out

Hotel - there are tons of people at night and it is kind of a maze, gaudy feeling but other hotels have that gaudy feeling as well. If you are walking, you have to walk thru the casino to get to the room elevators from Las Vegas Blvd

Food - all food in Vegas is way overpriced. We ate breakfast at the Westside Deli which was fine

Transportation - free parking - the walkway from the garage is on level 3 which is odd. You can get a bus right across from the Riviera to the strip.

Midway - went to use our 2 free games, friend won a stuffed banana by popping a balloon. Many arcade games, McDonald's. Didn't go to the Adventuredome as it seemed overpriced.

Staff - everyone that I met was friendly

Other - check out the Tix4Tonight booth to get discount ticket vouchers (must exchange them at the theater for your actual tickets)

I reserved a room with two queens and got two fulls. The room was a step up from a  motel. I booked for Circus Circus and was told to go outside to another building for my stay.  I'm assuming a add on to the hotel which was not my idea. Had to pay extra $20 to stay in the actual casino. Overall never again. Plus the sink got clogged. I thought they renovated?,0,0,0

For the price staying in the main Tower is fine. It is not that great, but it is cheap (book correctly). If you end up in the motel type rooms which are other buildings altogether you will be disappointed, unless you don't mind being in a room that looks exactly like a Motel 6, only not as clean.
The Tower room are just fine considering the price. They are clean but well used. The other rooms, as far as I am concerned, are terrible and I would sleep in my car first. 
The hotel and property around it is just huge, it has an RV park as well. I know nothing about that so I will not comment.
There are several nice pools and the food is only satisfactory. There are many bars and the casino is nice, but also in need of a refresh.
What is nice about Circus Circus is that it has circus type acts throughout the day for kids and it has an amusement park right on the property with about 18-20 fun rides. It is pricey and the wait is long, but not unbearable. Call and check with the desk to see the closing times of the theme park because they change often.
The service is very nice. 
If you can afford better, do it. If not, Circus Circus is fine as long as you navigate your way to the better rooms.
The Strip is right out front and very nice to walk. Have fun.",3,2,0

my fam stays here for because its like $60 a night, but its that much for a reason - it sucks! its def one of the old casinos now w\/ its fellow senior citizen, the Riviera, across the street. The location of the hotel is very far from the parts of the strip that you actually want to visit. and the food: GOD! why did i eat here?! i settled for their buffet because i had post flight hunger, but if i had known, i would've settled for McDonalds upstairs. And i wouldnt exactly call this place family friendly w\/ all the $$$ theyre robbing from kids at the Midway.

So, if you have a car (to drive to the better parts of LV) and all you want is a room to bunk, this could be a good place for you. But if you like walking\/dining in your own hotel, choose elsewhere. 

i think i'll study harder in school so i don't have to stay here when i grow up.",1,1,1

What did I find at this lit up, over sized circus? 

At hotel registration, the guy helping us had to spend TOO long explaining how to get to the room. They don't ask you if you need help, they just kind of assume you want to drag your bags all the way over to the west tower on your own. But it's Circus Circus, what did I expect? So he had to give us a map and draw lines that led us to the other side of the casino. Then a confusing elevator set up. If it wasn't for this cute old filipino couple, we probably would have been wandering around forever. 

When we get up to the room, the room is nothing wonderful. All I want to do is shower. There are stains all over the curtain on the inside so you feel dirtier coming out than you did going in. Go to lay down, and the beds are awkwardly smelling and the texture feels weird. A very starchy feel. And they are so uncomfortable. Even after sitting in the same position for 11 hours, almost being side swiped by many semi's, that shit was nearly intolerable. We had to sleep so we figured, fuck it? 

Went downstairs in the morning to find out that there is something more aggravating than their rooms and weird set up and confusing maps. The people. Because it's not just the guests, it's the millions of unattended children running around, making you nearly drop everything you're holding. Parents with strollers totally oblivious to the world as their child stands in the middle of the walk way. I have never been more appalled by the lack of parental supervision as I did in Circus Circus. It truly ruined my first two nights in Las Vegas.

So if you don't have children, please consider staying somewhere else. I would have given this place no stars had it not been so cheap. I only went here because weekend rates are ridiculous. 

And if you do have children, why the fuck are you in Vegas??

No offense, but that shit drives me nuts. It's smoky, there's a LOT of drinking, and you have to go through all the casinos just to get to the Midway. What's the fucking point?

So try Disneyland, parents. And watch your fucking kids.",13,15,10
