But when I saw an order of Carne Asada Fries pass by me, I changed course. I got the small order and glad I did because the large would have been way too much.

Let me tell you, TEG is some straight up Mexican food goodness! I love this place. The lines were crazy, it was hot in there, families squished in together at the small tables, people hollering across each other - I loved it! And I will be back now that I know where it is. For the past three trips to Vegas, I would make the effort to get to TEG, but could never ""see"" it.  It is in a sort of strip mall with a small parking lot.  This time, I rode around twice before I spotted it.  And I was rewarded with some really good eats.  (This review was from my July 2013 trip)",2,2,2

It makes me seem like a super fatty, but I don't care. Damn, these are good tacos. Admittedly, I had them for the first time, exactly 13 hours ago. I fell in love with these tacos. Hard and quick. I'm pretty sure I fell in love with it even before I ate. Probably fell in love when I got our of my car, and could already smell the food. 

The adobada tacos were amazing. We also ordered the carne asada fries, bu half carne asada & half adobada. The carne asada had good flavor, but was burnt. I don't know if I would order the carne asada again. 

The line on the right is to order pork, the line on the left is to order everything else. 

I'm not a big fan of corn tortillas, but Tacos El Gordo has changed my mind about it. Definitely get the pineapple on your tacos. I'm not a big fan of fruit on my food, but i just adds another great element to these tacos. It also has this green sauce on it, of which I am not sure what it is, but it's good. Each taco has plenty of meat, so be prepared to get full. 

Just a tip - grab plenty of napkins. As good as the tacos are, it gets very messy when you eat them. Plenty of oil and sauce will be dripping down your hand, and probably down your arm as well - so be sure to roll up your sleeves.",3,2,2

Easily one of the most amazing words in the world to say when drunk, it turns out it may also be the single most delicious thing one can eat while drunk, though there is competition*

Additionally, while my bubby would be heartbroken to hear this, I have to say that this place serves what is hands-down the best tongue I've ever had in my life. Ever. Though you'd better not be shy about what you're ordering, because saying ""lengua"" to the counterman means he's about to pull out the entire grass-licker of a cow and chop it apart in front of you.

If you've ever wondered what it would be like to be Hannibal Lecter's sous chef, now you'll know.

It took me a few minutes to figure out the system of waiting in line according to what meat you want, and then paying for your meal at a separate counter. I was not daring enough to try some of the more exotic meats, so I went for the adobada (spiced pork). Waiting for my turn I got to watch several orders of these tacos get made. They have layers of marinated pork turning on a vertical rotisserie that is first skewered with whole pineapples. As the meat turns and heats, all that juice saturates the pork. The guy making the tacos would take a long knife and just carve down the face of the turning meat, getting enough shavings for one taco. Really fun to watch. I got two and found a place to sit in their outside tent. They were the best tacos I have ever tasted.

I ate in stunned silence soaking in the mix of favors, aromas, sights and sounds.  This is yet another example of the inescapable rule - if you see all of God's children flocking into a restaurant indifferent of race or socioeconomic class - go in, take it in and EAT WITH THEM - the world would be a better place!  This place is incredible... The taco standard hence forth!

The only thing that would make this more authentic would be to move all to Cabo and put in on wagon behind a truck!  

Ok... So down to the glorious details...

When you first walk in you see that you can order various item at different stations from around counter, but if you're a newbie have no fear, just ask someone and they'll be super happy to yell to the right part of the kitchen with what you want.  After your attention is averted from the large menu (not that there's a lot on it... It's just huge!), you notice 2 massive rotisseries with layer upon layer seasoned pork, Al Pastor topped with a signature pineapple.  Much like Gyros or Shawarma, Al Pastor, the Mexican version of the same is serious indicator of being in place that cherishes flavor and authenticity.  Unlike the other two meats, how Al Pastor is seasoned varies widely based on he tradition and locality of those making it... Which always makes it somewhat of an anticipated reveal!  This al pastor was highlighted with a very mild version of its common seasoning namely Guajillo, ancho, cumin, garlic onion, and pineapple allowing the charred meat shine through a bit more on its own.  Seared in the traditional manner with cilantro and onions on soft FRESHLY MADE corn tortilla only made it that much better!  The carne asada tacos were even better which was honestly hard to believe even possible!  The lightly seasoned and thinly sliced steaks are flash grilled over a fire that defies the term HOT to be then placed in a warming container next to the girl where magic clearly happens here.  The steaks, being close to the grill, continue to slow cook and steep in the smoky sooty goodness from the grill making hands down THE BEST CARNE ASADA I HAVE EVER EATEN!

Check out my pics ...  The tacos are generous and juicy.  Tortillas are all freshly made.

That's was  until my hotel recommended Tacos El Gordo. Tacos El Gordo is located on the no so nice end of the strip, near Circus Circus and the Riviera. Don't expect anything that you might typical find at your average sit down Mexican restaurant. Here you'll find street food, tacos, tostadas, etc. Couple that with a very nice covered outdoor seating area and somewhat limited indoor seating giving you the best of both worlds, street food with a place to sit down and eat. Here will find a very basic menu of inexpensive fare.

I can highly recommend the spicy pork and steak tacos, the pork being something special which is sliced off a rotating spit as you order. Tacos while small come over stuffed and sloppy with meat, cilantro, onions, guacamole and sour cream. For sure nothing comes out of a can. If you feel adventurous among other things you have a choice of tripe or beef brain tacos. Just keep in mind the menu is very basic, all items in Spanish with most having English translation. Taco's run $2 each. 

Service is very friendly and helpful if you have a question. Lines can be long, but move quickly. Here you'll find locals, not tourists. Long lines of locals are always a good sign, and it holds true here. The place is very clean.

The lengua is tasty, moist, and super tender. The al pastor is well seasoned and not too dry. The cabeza is delicious as well, give it a try. 

The carne asada is really where it's at though. Unlike most taquerias, they actually grill the carne asada here. It has char!  It's not just steak on a hot top here.  It makes a huge difference.  Want to kick up the carne asada? Get the carne asada fries.  The fries are crisp and are the perfect complement to the savory goodness of the carne asada.

2 a.m., I drunk, walking down the street - just about the only tacos I was going to get to eat at that time was a real one - and I wasn't going to complain.

Stepping into Tacos El Gordo is to be transformed from Las Vegas to Tijuana - in fact, the owner says they are formerly from Tijuana, which I often visited as a kid. Dirty, scuzzy, and authentic - that's about the only things I can use to describe this place. 

Although there are about eight different types of tacos - each costing about $2.50, I opted for the stomach and tongue tacos - both culinary delights I'd learned to eat having grown up in Southern California.

In my best Spanish, which I failed both in college and high school, I ordered two of each, and an Horchata (a milky, cinnamon drink). The guy behind the counter looked at me with amusement, and in lightning speed, whipped up two of each. After paying for it all and putting a few bucks in the tip jar, I went to my seat only to be summoned back and given an extra side of meat. 

""Shoulders,"" he said. ""Try it.""

I tried it and instantly fell in love (the next day I came back and ordered more) - it was not only flavorful and full of spices, one could almost taste the nutty, meaty taste of the cow cheeks. I was in taco heaven.

Onto the tongue and stomach, however: stomach tastes exactly the way you'd expect it to - a bit slimy, but flavorful with a hint of bitterness. No worries - a bit of lime and salt takes away the flavor that you might not be used to. I quickly wolfed it down and then tried the tongue.

Subtly beefy - that's the only way I can describe it. Tender, moist, and full of flavors, it also packed a beefy flavor that no way in hell Taco Bell could deliver - new 100 percent meat be damned. It's also a light meat - that is, it's beef, but doesn't come with the heaviness that beef often is known for. It is, in a sense, as soft and gentle as a baby's sigh - heavenly goodness.

I washed it all down with the drink I mentioned - the sweetness cleaning my palate with each swallow, allowing me to go back to the tacos and tasting everything packed in it each time.

The next day, I went back for more. In fact, during my eight-day stay, I ate at Tacos El Gordo five times - each time leaving me satisfied, but also longing for more.

If you do go there, I recommend the tongue and the shoulder tacos. I also recommend the Horchata. What's more - get the little vegetables that are left to be eaten over a bed of ice. They are meant to cleanse your palate. Take a bite of it after each bite of the tacos (or if you're like me you shove the entire taco in your mouth), and I promise you'll be ranting and raving about this place, too.

Another note: do leave a tip. These people work really hard, and they do a good job serving. You're in Vegas - you're going to splurge anyway. Might as well make someone's day.",5,2,1

I got to try the Vegas location a few weeks ago and I was pretty disappointed. I came out of the restaurant thinking, ""so what is supposed to be so great about this place...?""
I was pretty bummed out because I came in thinking I would have the best tacos in my life that day, but it didn't even do half as good as the taco trucks I've been to. Oh and random, but they make their own tortilla!

Most tacos are $2.10. The ones I got were $2.10 each. 

1. Carne asada - it was too hard and cooked too much. It was not worth waiting 45 minutes for just the asada.

2. Al pastor - DO NOT GET. It was super salty, wayyyyy too salty. Pretty sweet too. I was shocked. Even with the pineapple, it was pretty bad. 

The tacos have too many things going on with it. They put a bit too much guac that I barley tasted the meat. I'm not sure if they just put really little of the other hot sauces, but I barely tasted those. They scooped way too much guac. It was too much.

I am happy to say that it did! I was a little taken back when I walked into the building, but quickly figured out how to order food. You figure out what taco meat you want, then goto the area that happens to prepare that meat. After collecting all the tacos you want, you then go to the register and pay. It wasn't that crowded when I went in there at 8pm, but I could see how this structure could move people through the lines at a faster pace than a standard 1 counter set up.
What I really like bout the place, is the selection of meats. I got a cabeza (beef head), lengua (beef tongue), and Tripa (beef guts) Tacos. They were very, very tasty! At $2.25+ a taco, the price is a little high, but being on the strip, it's still a lot lower than most restaurants in the area.",0,0,0

My friend told me to order some adobada tacos. The line was fairly long but after 30 minutes I was finally able to place my order. I ordered four adobada (marinated pork) tacos. The guy sliced up the juicy meat right in front of me. Once you receive your food, you pay for the food at the cashier on the side.

The tacos were juicy and tasty. When you see meat on a spit, you know the meat is fresh and cooked well. Don't forget to ask for the hot sauce! 

Overall, this place is great. The only down side is the wait. This place is walking distance from Wynn, so expect the place to be packed late night. At two dollars a taco, I couldn't ask for more.

Then to our dismay, we opened the door to find the line up to the door, almost out the door. Darn! So we got in the line that looked shortest and waited. And waited more. As we got closer, our hearts sank.  We noticed that there were separate lines depending on types of meat.  I wanted asada and adobada, which meant I had to stand in line twice! Then if you want a drink, it's a separate line. Fries? Separate line. LAME! I don't remember San Diego locations being so asinine!

But I have never been to one like this. The moment my boyfriend and I walked in the door we knew we were in for something unique.

We open the door and the first thing to hit us is the smoke. Immediately following was the smell. When you walk inside it's like you are walking into the grill itself. If they have a ventilation system you'd never know it. So be prepared, you will smell like meat when you leave.

The first thing you need to figure out is which line to stand in. If you want more than one kind of taco be prepared to stand in two lines because you can't stand in the carne asada line and order the al pastor tacos. I recommend you divide and conquer. I waited for the asada and my boyfriend went for the al pastor. But mind you, these lines are long and slow so even if you split up you'll both be waiting a while. 

Luckily, the wait is worth it. After we acquired our tacos, we paid, and went outside to find a table. Fortunately, someone was getting up to leave so we snagged a spot. (oh yeah, the tables are as hard to get as the tacos) We quickly devoured everything. The tortillas are fresh, the meat is seasoned and prepared perfectly and the salsa is a great complement.

I've been eating at Tacos el Gordo in Chula Vista for over 10 years and I'm ashamed this place is here.

People eating here must be DRUNK or something.

You guys don't even get a star. You guys get a FART from me. You get a star because yelp made me do it. I give it to........ THE HORCHATA.

I understand this is Vegas, on the strip, so it was packed. Understandable. I love this place so much I chose to wait the 35 min for my tacos... TWICE!!

One of the things that baffled me was how the ADOBADA HANDLER was slicing the meat, and instead of this delicious meat going on the taco as he's slicing it, HE LET IT FALL ONTO THIS TRAY WITH THE REST OF THE MEAT THAT HAD BEEN SITTING THERE FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG. And this meat kept cooking on this tray. -____-

WHYYY??? please tell me why you would do that??? 

The right way? from the rotisserie into the taco

ROTISSERIE INTO THE TACO !!! not rotisserie to heat griddle... all the juices...GONE!!! 

The cheese on my MULA was burnt -_______-

Is it because they're busy??? No that makes no sense!! People are already waiting anyways !!

The other thing that almost made me cry was the ONIONS... They mass cook the onions so when you ask for them they are already soggy and taste more of oil than anything else :_( 

Chula Vista location cooks the onions to order so they're fresh, delicious, and tasty.

I wondered once again if this was because they were extra busy but... NO because people wait either way!! So why not serve quality over you guys being lazy and mass cooking onions in quantity??

The only thing I had from here was ADOBADA... which made me sick and I had such a bad stomach ache last night I cried.

Discovered with the aid of Yelp,  I arrived for meal #1 around midnight after an evening of hotel pregaming before beginning my walk down the strip. Not having eaten since the Grand Canyon 12 hours ago, my dire need of sustinence was cloaked until arriving by the alcohol previously ingested.  As soon as I read the menu, my jaw dropped in wonder how such a popular spot could crank out the oddities offered.  Well, when in vegas...

There was no written indication as to which lines were for each cut (pork, beef, or specialty cuts), so I stood in line for abodaba for 10 minutes before speaking with a rep.  *Left is beef, middle is pork, and right is specialty cuts.* When relocated to the correct line, the chef would reach under a steaming towel to select and cut each cut of meat made to order.  This line isn't the fastest, but totally worth it.  Out of the corner of my eye there was an older woman hand packing corn tortillas out of fresh corn meal.  Talk about made to order.

The first night I got the cabeza, sesos, and beef shoulder.  I'm not gonna pretend to be qualified to judge these cuts, but I found the cabeza to be flavorful with a very soft texture, and the sesos were creamier than I have had in the past.  The beef shoulder alone merited my return the next night!  All of these tacos on corn tortillas were served with light lettuce, onion, and salsa verde relishes.  This surprise of an experience lured us back for a quick dinner the next evening when I chowed on more shoulder, abodaba, and tripe.  

For being on the strip, this place is a hidden gem.  Good, cheap food on the strip is hard to come by, and authentic $2 tacos are tough to beat anywere.

First of all, the lines are so confusing. They divided up into what type of meat you want to order I.e if you want Asada and Al Pastor, you have to wait in one line and then get into another line. So come with your friends if you want different types of meat. In addition, you have to go to the further right line to pick up your fries (if you order fries).
I'm glad we beat the rush (we got there around 1pm on a Saturday). When I got to the line it was just outside the doors. After 30minutes to just order and pay for the food, the line was buff.

I was pleasantly surprised! I come from Los Angeles, and know all about ""King Taco"" and ""El Taurino"" and been to taco places in Mexico itself. I would say this place is in the same category as ""El Taurino"" if not better. 

Their Adobada (spicy pork different from Al Pastor style) with everything on it, is my favorite! I can eat 6 of these easily lol. I tried the ""Taco el Lengua"" (cow tongue) and was thrown off a bit. (I love cow tongue in Japanese and Korean BBQ) but the taco version is a little... well tastes like a mushy tongue lol. I wouldn't order that again.

Avoid this place on Friday nights and Saturday nights unless you want to deal with dozens if not a hundred drunk loud clubbers who are literally throwing up outside in the parking lot... :( 

Also their ""Horchata"" and other mexican drinks are not made fresh or from scratch.  (kind of a bummer really), they use the mixed syrup machine dispensers. I guess I'm spoiled because where I come from the Horchata is always made fresh daily.

To the point where I've started calling myself a ""tacotarian."" (And yes, I know they make fish tacos, I just don't care.)

So on my latest trip to Tacos El Gordo, I decided to branch out and try their vegetarian option - to see if I could keep visiting my favorite Vegas taco joint even in the absence of meat.

The taco azteca (nopales asado) is strips of grilled cactus served on your choice of corn or flour tortilla with salsa and guacamole. The cactus really had a nice snap when you bite into it and a bit of a peppery flavor. A lot of times with vegetarian options for Mexican it feels like you're ""missing"" something. A vegetarian burrito from Chipotle feels like a magic trick sometimes. And not in a good way.

But this was legit. If I ever pull the trigger and go full-on vegetarian, this will be a staple of my diet.

The minute you walk into this place you will notice it is insanely BUSY, and that most people are on the pork line-- because it is the best item on be menu. Don't get me wrong, steak is also tasty, but the pork is excellent on any menu item. Here is what I normally order.

Campechana fries, half order. These fries are smothered in steak or pork, cheese, cheese sauce, guacamole, sour cream and their special sauce... Virtually a food group of its own. Beware you can probably share your fries with three of your friends and still eat plenty.

Pork tacos: I get them with everything and a bit extra of their green sauce--a cilantro based sauce.

Mulitas on flour tortillas: there are topped with the same ingredients as the tacos but the ingredients are sandwiched between two flour tortillas with grilled, melted cheese on them. Amazing.

You can have a filling lunch for no more than $10 bucks. If show up during the lunch hour be ready to wait for about 15 minutes before getting your food.",0,0,0

 I also order a Vampiro, its like a quesadilla stuffed with carne asada, highly recommendable. They offer free grilled onions and chilli peppers. I also get

The place is located next to the wynn, and parking is never hard to find as they most of the customers that come walk in from the strip. The interior of the place is surprising clean. The place also offers inside and outside seating, more than likely you'll eat inside cause it's either boiling hot or goosebumps cold outside.

Ordering the food was confusing at first only because you're greeted by the register as you come in. But just go up to any of the workers, order, go back to the cashier, and feast on your food. The prep time for food is miniscule only time you would have to wait is if you order fries.

From your first bite you can tell the quality of the food is far beyond any regular ole taco place. The sauce & adobado just go so damn well together. But to me the main star of this place are their adobado fries. THAT THING IS SERIOUSLY PACKED. Guac overload!!!!! The fries crispy, the cheese cheesy, the sour cream & guac perfect amount, and the avocado on top? Equivalent to a cherry on a ice cream. 

Personally the price of the taco's a ripoff. But the price for the fries a steal.

PRO TIP! You can call ahead of time and order so you don't have to wait in the long lines!

If anything could change in this place, it'd be for them to add heaters in their outside seating, it's just too cold out to eat outside.",2,0,3

Well, this is not a place I would visit again. 

The line was out the door, there was about 15 people in front of me and It took about 45 mins  to make it in the door. Once inside there were about 6 lines more so Im standing there puzzled and I ask the lady in front of me how does this place work. 

So, I need to stand in line for the type of meat tacos I want. Well I wanted 2 of each so that means I have to stand in each line to get my tacos and each line has about 15 people waiting. So, I decide to stand in the shortest line and get whatever they have. That took about 1 hr 15 mins. 

Once I had my tacos I had to stand in another line to pay. 

Total time to get soggy, cold and expensive tacos 2hrs. Never again. For $50 next time I'll eat at a casino buffet.

It's across the street from Encore and it gets a little sketchy but totally worth it! I came Wednesday over winter break, a little before midnight, and I was very surprised that there was minimal waiting. They have different lines so be prepared to split your group up to try all the meats. And don't be conservative with the amount of food you order here because the tacos are on the smaller side and you won't want to wait again in the line!

The guys that make your tacos are so quick and they cut the meat on the spot when you order. El Pastor is always my favorite and don't forget to order it with the pineapples and Carne Asada would come up us as a close second. My least favorite was the Chorizo because it was a little overdone and dry. I got a chance to try a couple Mulas but it does take awhile for them to make. I was too lazy to wait in the line again so next time, I'm going to try their Carne Asada fries. After you're done ordering, you go to the counter by the exit to pay.

This spot is a transplant from Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.  
I had something that is called a ""Vampiro"" from a street vendor in East LA a few years back and was never the same.  They were some of the most amazing secrets of Mexican food I had never discovered up till then.  Sadly the vendor was robbed at gunpoint, not having enough money to buy new equipment.  

It can never be as good as those original Vampiros to me, but thank god I have come across somewhere I can find them now this side of the border.  Just order them, don't even worry about what they are.  I am sure many have given the description in their review.  

Also, the al pastor vampiro which are also called adobado.

I was so happy to discover that this place was walking distance from where I was staying.  There was a long line, but we knew it was going to be so. worth. it. 

Upon reaching the entrance, you'll find that there are three lines inside for different tacos.  
     1. Carne Asada and Chorizo 
     2. Adobada
     3. All the other stuff
This can get kind of problematic if you want a few tacos from each of the lines, but I'm guessing that this was the most efficient way to move things along.  Try to get your friends in the other lines to order the tacos for you!

I tried the Lengua ($2.25), Tripa ($2.00), and Adobada ($2.00) tacos.  The lengua taco (aka tongue for you gringos) was SO tender and juicy.  Tripa (tripe) was kind of a  weird texture for me.  I don't think that crunchy goes well in tacos, but some might say otherwise! Adobada was my personal favorite.  That green sauce they put on it is delicious.  

If you want the best cheap eats on the strip, I don't think you have to look much further than Tacos El Gordo.

Food looks promising when there's a huge slab of pork rotating on a vertical spit, with a pineapple above it (to tenderize the meat).  It's almost as beautiful as one of the girls working the pole down at Sapphire, but I digress.

$2 a taco made me grimace a little, but a smile broke out after I devoured that spicy pork, with its creamy sauce... what was it, pineapple based?  Idk, but I'm coming back.

The guy working the spit was surprisingly welcoming, and patiently answered my noob questions (""what's the vampiro?"" ""the 'vam-pee-roh,'"" he corrected) despite the line forming behind me.  The lady working the register, unfortunately, seemed annoyed at my very presence.  I suspect the guy gets paid more, and is happy the business seems to be flourishing.

There's a\/c inside, so you can escape the Vegas heat.  But if you enjoy the desert climate, then you can also sit on the covered patio.

The asada tacos were pretty good too; the chorizo decent.  Nothing beat the flavor of that spicy pork, so I don't bother wasting precious stomach space with less than the best at that location.  Give this place a shot if you're staying on the strip, it's on the right hand side as you drive down Las Vegas Blvd, right around the time you hit Circus Circus.

Now I've been to the other location on a taco crawl I knew what to expect when our friends asked us to come grab tacos here. 

We go in line for the al pastor as that was the majority of what we needed, then tipped out the station for them to get the other stations to make our other tacos simultaneously and tip out those stations as well. Or if you are in a group of friends, have someone in each line ordering for the group and split the cost among yourselves. We were here at 11ish and the line took 25 minutes. 

I had - 

Al pastor - this pastor was decent. Not too fatty, the seasonings were good. I like the avocado sauce they put on it, as well as the salsa on it. Ask for pineapple too! I think if I go here, I will probably just get this meat in various vessels (tacos, vampiros, fries, etc). 

Cabeza - there was crispy edges to this which was different. The flavor of it was just OK though and there are cabezas I far prefer around town. I noticed they dip the tortillas at this station in the grease for flavor, but that made my taco also a bit soggy. It was better the last time I had them. 

I got a plate of the green onions and peppers as well (these are free) and the green onions is probably my favorite thing about this place. 

I don't want to do this very often as I absolutely hate the cattle line system. Maybe I'm coming off like a brat, but I've stood in lines for many of foods with zero complaints as there are some things worth the inconvenience and time spent.

We were covered in dust and looked like desert rats, but the mixture of clientele at Tacos El Gordo was less than judgmental and I felt quite welcome.

The restaurant (on a Saturday night around 8ish) was brightly lit and chaotic with patrons.  The long lines meant a long wait, especially for adobada, which is much, much better than the carne asada, which is good but not great.  

The homemade tortillas are about the size of your palm.  A taco with everything comes with meat, onions, cilantro, lime, salsa and a smooth avocado sauce that wasn't exactly guacamole.  I also had a quesadilla, which is the same thing as a taco but with good white cheese stuck to the tortilla and a fried tortilla on top.  

Order your tacos first, then go pay at the cashier to get your cups for drinks.  There's a soda machine and an horchata machine, the kind with the happy face logo that says ""Ole!""

The fries with meat (carne asada, adobada, or a mixture of the two which is called campechana, I think) is a three-pound box filled with everything your cardiologist doesn't want you to eat.  Cheese, fries, crema, meat.  You can share this among four people and you will probably still not finish it.

Tacos are two dollars each.  A meal with a drink will be about $10-12 dollars, which is a lot for a taco joint.

However, the people watching is first-rate.  Besides Mexican families and the occasional adventurous Midwesterner, customers include hotel workers, drunken frat boys, and honest-to-goodness prostitutes.  At the table next to ours, there was a lively and profanity-spangled discussion in Spanish about the true definition of a chilango.  On the patio, a group of young men in their early-twenties with matching vests and threaded eyebrows fortified themselves before a night of what would no doubt be the liberal distribution of rohypnol.  All of these people and more you will find at the Las Vegas Strip Tacos El Gordo.  All united in taco solidarity.  This is a good place.",4,10,3

We ended up getting 4 Adobada tacos and 4 beef shoulder tacos.  I was extremely skeptical because I just didn't think it was worth the wait and being from LA, I've had what I considered great tacos before.  Well, this place topped them all by a large margin.  I would recommend both tacos that we got.  The beef shoulder was slow cooked and cut fresh, and the Adobada was cooking on the vertical spit.  The Adobada was perfectly cooked with a smoky flavor that I don't think is reproducible.  The beef shoulder was slow cooked and tender and would take too much time to do.

I was really unsatisfied by the food I was eating at the hotels and on the Strip and this place is just down the street from where I was staying.  

I've been to the Tacos El Gordo in SD and wanted to see what the LV branch tasted like. 

I came at around 11am in the morning and there was no line and ample indoor seating. Ordered my tacos and bit into the asada taco to find cold meat. I was really surprised. I know that the meat is cooked in a batch and used to make tacos and then another batch is cooked, but still - no reheating the asada on the grill? To top that off, the meat was a little tough so I was a bit displeased. 

The savior of the bunch was the lengua tacos. I could just gobble down lengua tacos all day because the meat is so soft and juicy. Juice literally sputters out at every bite!  I immediately regret getting the asada taco. 

Ordering is fast and efficient when there isn't a line. This establishment is spotlessly clean (well at least it was in the morning). Stainless steel tables and walls - and even the bathroom was spotless. Whaaaaaat. 

So even if my asada was cold, I was a happy camper. Later on while driving home I could still smell the tacos on my fingers and my mouth would water. A sign of REAL food.

I guess there were certain lines for each type of meat, but it really doesn't matter because the cooks all communicate with each other anyway.

So I had their lengua tacos, buche tacos, and their campechana (half carne asada\/half lengua) fries and it was just heaven on a platter! Probably the priciest hole in the wall mexican joint I've been to, but the quality is there!

Don't forget to ask for the sauces at the checkout counter. I found that the fries were on the dry side and the sauces made a huge difference in the taste.

They only have one line at this location, which is nice because you can try the different tacos easier. I love the adobada (remember to add pineapple). The carne asada is good too. Their tacos are still extremely cheap even though they're on the strip. Also, the drinks are cheap. I had to get some horchata. But, they don't have any orange bang.

The also have fries at this location. 

Overall, this is very similar to the Tacos El Gordo locations in San Diego. However, they are a bit more sloppy with the taco construction and they only gave me one small slice of pineapple on my adobada tacos when they usually give me an entire plate of pineapple in San Diego.

If there was a space capacity, there must be some sort of fire ordinance because you are unable to walk through the lobbies without dodging families who have too many children to keep track of, underage girls who are trying to grow up too quickly, and vendors who are trying to sell you belts and accessories made in Vietnam.  2nd hand smoke and dirty money was my perfume of the day.

So maybe you can understand my frustration about my predicament.  So when I yelped a nearby place to escape to, I settled on Tacos El Gordo.  This placed changed my entire perspective on the trip.


ADOBADA  ALL DAY ERR' DAY

Holy-- I got Adobada Tacos, Adobada Quesadilla, and ordered some Carne Asada fries for the table. 

The staff runs a jovial assembly line, where you order your items and they each take an assignment.  It comes with grilled veggies (especially the green onions) which were so bomb I was eating them long after my stomach was maxxed out.

The tacos had it RIGHT.  Perfect blend of all textures-- meat was savory, vegetables crisp, and tortilla fresh.  Quesadilla followed suit, and then topped off with my fries.  Best carne fries I have ever had.  Price was way too fair!  I tipped them 5 dollars in the jar because I was so impressed with everything.

The workers were experiencing a mid-day lull in traffic, and each of them began cleaning everything-- I saw one of the ladies even get on a ladder and clean the ceiling. They were jamming out on their radio music, and singing loudly.  I loved the warmth!

I walked out feeling like this trip could be good!  Staying at awful Circus Circus brought me within walking distance to this place, and I was instilled with hope.  If you are in town, you HAVE to go here.",0,4,0

This is the dish that I always order. The tripe is crunchy, yet chewy.  It may be a bit oily but that's what happens when it's deep-fried before it's minced and served. If you decide to get this or any other taco, tostada, burrito, or nachos, just make sure to get everything on it, else it just won't taste right.  You can also ask for some free sauteed scallions and peppers, which are actually quite good as a side with your dish.  Their horchata is pretty damn good, too - none of that powderiness that lingers in others's mix. 

This place gets pretty packed, espcially on weekends and nights.  I couldn't imagine it any other way, though.

Ordering System: after waiting in line to get into the place, you wait in the line of the meat you want. So al pastor has their own line and the other meats are in another. After ordering, you go to the register and pay. 

Food: GET THE AL PASTOR!!! It's what they're known for. They top it off with a red salsa, a creamy green salsa (they call it 'guacamole'), and onions and cilantro. FYI the salsas have a kick! Luckily I didn't get any asada. It looked dry and my friend said it wasn't that good. They also have meat and fries, quesadillas, and I think mulitas. 

Price: each taco is $2.95 which is kinda pricey for a small taco, buy hey it's Vegas and it tastes really good. A regular drink is $1.75 and that's including horchata and jamaica (it comes from a soda machine, but still good) and unlimited refills.

There were numerous employees, all very friendly and helpful. Since it was our first time there, one of the guys let us try a little bit of every meat (more like he handed it to us without question).

I tried five different tacos - the spicy pork (adobada), steak (asada), tripe, beef shoulder (suadero), and beef tongue (lengua). The tacos also came with nice portion of cooked green onion and jalapeno! Every taco was great and had the perfect portion of meat, sauce, and vegetables (which is something you will rarely hear me say). My favorites were the adobada and tripe. 

I also got horchata, which turned out to have INFINITE REFILLS. My good friend and I were ecstatic over that for quite a while.

Two stars, bc all the tacos my friends and I got were already premade and looked dry. If I was more determined, I would've requested a fresh taco, but I was hungry.

What I need to emphasize is that this location gets BUSY. They open at 10am with a line already, and by 11:30am, the line is out the door. It seems like there's a perpetual line! Let me clarify-- there is a line outside that you wait in just to get inside to wait into another line to order your food. If you can deal with this, you truly will be awarded.

My favorite meat to get here is hands down the Adobada. There's just something about charred, spicy pork that is just downright delicious. Their tacos come loaded with onions, cilantro, salsa and an avocado\/sour cream sauce. You really can't go wrong, and I'm always good for 5-6 tacos.

If you're courageous, I'd also recommend their fries. The fries are topped with your choice of meat, cheese, sour cream, and guacamole. They keep it super simple, which I appreciate.

They used to have 2 kitchens in the restaurant so there would be 2 lines. However they have recently expanded the seating area inside and minimized it down to 1 kitchen. They did also shut down for a few months a few years ago. It may have some reason to do with why they took out their seating in front of the store and removed the kitchen. But now they are up and running again and giving the people of Las Vegas more delicious tacos.

There are multiple lines that once you get inside depending on what type of meat you are craving. I always end up in the adobada line.

When you exit the day club, head down the stairs on the right on to the strip and go north (yes, north - away from all the hotels) for a block.  This will be located in a strip mall on your right!

Here's how it works: there are different ""stations"" for different meats.  You stand in line for the meat that you want to order (asada and adobada are at different stations), you order, they make it for you on the spot, and then you take it to the cashier to pay.  

I usually order a mix of 3-4 tacos and tostadas.  The fries are tempting but I haven't tried them yet.  The asada tostada is my favorite - I like that the tostada gives it a crunch vs. the corn taco shell.  The adobada is pretty fricking good too, with the cilantro cream sauce and some diced pineapples.  YUM!  I've heard the lengua is good but I have never tried it.

BTW, if you don't make it out here in Vegas, the original (?) is in Chula Vista in San Diego.  If you're in the area, it's definitely worth the drive down to almost the border for it!",0,0,0

Best TACO EVER. I am a native Texan and I haven't ever had a taco as good as El Gordo. Honestly I wasn't even drunk when I ate here.

The meat is roasted on a spit and carved off with a huge knife. It is served on two small corn tortillas, topped with onions, cilantro and an avocado cream sauce. I also ordered the asada which was good too, but not amazing like the pork. 

So yeah, I came here twice in one day. Both times got tacos and the 2nd time got tacos and  tostada. NOT EVEN SORRY. At $2 a pop El Gordo won't break the bank and will fill you up and leave you wanting more. Just remember they are smallish so don't feel bad if you have 6. lol.

Well you are at the right place! Tacos El Gordo is supposedly a highly rated and preferred restaurant from what I've heard. This past visit would make number two for me and again I'm left with too much more to desire. I arrived with already have anticipating a long wait, that's a given! Day before a holiday(Thanksgiving) on the Las Vegas strip? Yeah you'd think everybody would be home that night preparing some Thanksgiving dinner but nope! 

Organization is something that could've possibly earned this place another star from me but the jury is still out on that. This location unlike the other one I have visited in town didn't seem to have a very good process in place for the crazy line. For starters, those of you who've never been there is about 4 different lines that they normally offer, depending on what kind of meat you want on your order decides on what line you should be standing. That wasn't the case this weekend. Upon arrival I noticed there was a security guard outside which I didn't think too much of because in my mind I thought he just patrolled the entire parking lot. No.. He is designated specifically just for Tacos El Gordo and manning the traffic that goes in and out? Seriously? What the hell goes on here that they need security at a Mexican fast food joint? Inquiring minds would really like to know... Once inside there was a ""snake line"" meaning that there wasn't no lining up according to the meat you want. Complete chaos! The capacity of the place easily fills up and so the security guard at some points of the wait had to stand in front of the door and make sure that it never exceeds I guess the capacity of what's allowed. Oh okay is this what he is here for? Yikes!

Hungry as I was I just couldn't have an order of a couple tacos. I thought I would treat myself to some campechana fries which is a mixture of the ""Al Pastor"" and ""Carne Asada"" meats. Large order will run you $13! Once I was to the ordering station I clearly stated that my choice of order was campechana! The man taking the order and also making the food was an excellent multi-tasker and I really have to commend him on his fast skills! 5 minutes later my order was being prepared and I noticed that the fries were being made without the ""Al Pastor"" I politely brought this to their attention. Fixed! When my order was being handed to be I guess there was another customer who ordered the same that didn't get his, by the time I took a few steps my order was snatched lol yes.. snatched from another guy. The worker saw this apologized and made me another! Security?! Umm yeah we have a campechana fry snatcher on the loose! On to the next line.. To pay.. I waited another 5 minutes so now we are talking a whole hour and fifteen minutes for some damn fries! Geezee! $14 and some change later I was on my way. Will I be back? Honestly no time soon. I just can't cope with paying $14 for some fries that weren't that spectacular.

I'm way too much of a sauce snob and I admit it. I was very disappointed that there was no salsa bar or sauce for that matter. The tacos could of used a nice dollop of moist and flavorful salsa.

Granted the carne asada (beef) and the adobada (pork) were marinated well and very tender, I needed a spicy kick in my life! Even the grilled jalapeño pepper they offered us wasn't spicy. 

I favored the adobada over the carne asada, it seemed more tender. Also, the taco de cabeza (head) was really oily, we took a bite and couldn't eat the rest.

The vampiro, had a sopes masa cake bottom and a crispy fried tortilla tostada-like top. It was filled with carne asada (or any meat you choose), a dense piece of rubber-like cheese, and topped with lots of their guacamole sauce and cilantro and onions. It was tasty, hard to eat, and extremely filling! 

Their avocado sauce that they put on everything tasted good, but it was very thick and filling. It's not made of 100% avocados and they may of added some type of filler in it. 

Make sure to ask for a complimentary plate of grilled green onion and peppers, they don't offer it unless you ask for it.

When you get in, there are multiple lines depending on what type of meat you want to order. The lines get long especially at night. The best part about this place is the fresh tortilla. You see the cook prepare them right in front you. The tortilla feels fresh and warm. It isn't thick so you don't feel overloaded with carbs. The combination of meat and tortilla is pretty well done. As for the meat, I feel the best meat is the pork. It was splendid, flavorful, juicy and totally fatty. This is a perfect item when you have been drinking for hours. Unfortunately, I can't say this about the asada and chorizo. The asada was very disappointing. It was flavorless and slightly dry. The chorizo was somewhat better than the asada but similarly it is also dry. Another weird thing in my opinion is that depending on what type of meat you want to order you might have to get back in another line since each line has a different type of meat. Now the price is kind of expensive for the amount of food you get. Each taco is around $2.25 and it is not worth $2.25. I say at max this should be around $1.75. Overall, I would say come back when you want some good street tacos at night but don't bother during the day because for the price you are kind of getting ripped off.",0,0,0

Yes - it is a cheap eat in Vegas.
Yes - there are great tacos here.
Yes - there is quite an assortment of meats here.
Yes - they're pretty quick
Yes - everyone and their moms eat here because of everything that everybody raves about.

But.. I just didn't think it was THAT great. My wife loved it - in fact, we ate here twice during the 2-day stay we had in Vegas. I guess I've just been spoiled with the availability of great tacos at a cheaper price in LA, that I didn't see what the hoopla of Tacos El Gordo is\/was.

It's a solid option, especially if you're up drinking, partying, clubbing, or doing whatever else Vegas has to offer, and it's late, and you want something to eat. They're great at what they do, I just didn't think it was as amazing as it was overhyped to be.

I got the buche, the cabeza, and the lengua tacos. Each taco had a lot of meat. The lady had an asada vampiro. She was satisfied with her choice. 

She did make the remark that everything about Tacos el Gordo was legitimately Mexican i.e. the layout, staff, products, and even the patrons [all walks of life] - just that the price wasn't quite Mexican, meaning, you're paying more for the same product. I guess the price was the biggest turn off for me, since there are $1 taco places near my childhood home that offer the same quality goodness that is a taco.

Was it good? Yes. Great? Mmmmm.....",2,1,1

Despite the number of time I've been to Vegas, I wouldn't consider myself a ""Vegas person."" I dunno, everything on the strip seems to run together after a while, and you can't really tell the difference between this place and that. Enter Tacos El Gordo! You have to walk a bit away from the action to get to it - just north of the Wynn and Encore, Tacos El Gordo is located in a weird little strip mall next to a souvenir shop. They have seating indoor and out.

When I walked in, I was faced with a food station directly in front of me and a cashier to my right, horchata\/bang\/soda machine on the left. I was totally confused as to where to order and how to pay. It must have showed on my face because one of the guys behind the counter where the cooks were smiled and called to me. He took my order, barked it at the cooks and told me to wait there, then pay when I got my food. I was totally surprised at how cheerful all the employees where. Great customer service is definitely not something I seek out when I'm eating at hole in the walls, but every employee greeted me with a smile and was happy to serve me. When the cook handed over my food, he asked to make sure the order was right, gave me a big smile and told me to enjoy. I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.

I had the carne asada fries, an asada taco, chicken quesadilla, and an a pork taco (I was sharing with a friend OKAY?). Everything was perfectly delicious. The carne asada fries were huge, enough to feed 2 to 3, possibly 4 people. The tacos come overflowing with meat, and the horchatas and bang juices are refillable. Woohoo! I felt like I struck gold with this place. And our whole bill was only $20. I think it was the least amount of money I had spent on a meal that satisfying in Vegas.

Upon arriving, I was surprised at how many people were there, standing in line at 11 pm. Despite the long lines, the service was quick, prompt, and ran in a very strategic way.

My first visit there, I decided to try 2 adobada tacos with everything on them. Upon eating my first taco, I couldn't stop myself from shoving the second one in my mouth and getting back in line for more tacos. It was so tasty and flavorful! The sauces mixed so well with the juicy meat, and complemented each other perfectly. My second round I decided to try the carne asada tacos which also drove my taste buds wild. Everything tasted and actually was fresh! The meat and tortillas are made right in front of you, how can it get any better than that?

We arrived at about 2:30pm and the lines were out the door. There were multiple lines: one for carne asada (beef), one for adobada (spicy pork) and one for lengua (beef tongue) + everything else. My friends and I all split into different lines. The adobada and carne asada line took ~45 mintues to order, whereas the lengua line didn't even take 15.

I ended up asking my friends to get me something from each line.

Carne Asada Fries ($10): The beef itself was really good. Super tender and just absolutely melts in your mouth. The fries, on the other hand, were nothing special. The fries comes with cheese, sour cream and guacamole (although I don't think we got the guac.)

Adobada Taco ($2) and Quesadilla ($4): Easily my favorite. Definitely worth the wait for this. The spicy pork was probably the best I've ever tasted at any Mexican restaurant. It was the right amount of spicy and OMG was it juicy.

Lengua Taco ($2.25): The lengua here is a really close second to the adobada. The meat is super juicy (like all the others lol) and there is a lot of flavor.

Pork Shoulder Taco ($2): My least favorite out of all the meats, but still really good. It's basically like pulled pork, I would say. There isn't as much flavor in this compared to the other meats, but still, the meat melts in your mouth.

Even though waits can be long, I would absolutely come back here. It's SO cheap for the amount that they give you.

Notes:
- They give a lot of toppings on EVERYTHING.
- You order the food at the counter and then pay at the registers by the door. Kinda awkward when there's hella people in line and you're just trying to get through to pay.

Finally, on our last day in Vegas, we decided to eat at this spot. Looking at the menu, I had decided that I wanted the al pastor tacos, my friend went with it and wanted the same. The kids got quesadillas and french fries. While trying to figure out what I wanted to eat, I realized that you have to stand in the the right line for the type of meat you want. I was able to order the quesadillas and french fries with the guy once I got there. 

It's pretty good food, I enjoyed the tacos I had. My kids were satisfied with their food too. I mean, you can't really complain, $30 for six people's lunches...one of the better deals on the strip. I'd visit here again, these tacos sure beat Jack In the Box tacos after you've partied a little too hard, haha.",5,6,2

the lines move fast, and when i say lines it is because one line kind of diverges into two, the first counter allows you to order certain meats and plates, the counter around the corner has difference options then a separate line to pay for the meal

everything looked so damn good i couldn't decide so i ordered:
2 tacos de al pastor
2 tacos de Buche
1 Sope de asada
1 Horchata
all came to about $15 

and holy shit from the first bite of each taco and sope, this was instantly the best mexican food i have ever had!! 
the al pastor was to die for! each and every piece cut from the al pastor tower was crispy with the flavorful and broiled bark, so juicy and a little kick oh just wonderful
the buche was  tender, so juicy and greasy, amazing porky flavor
the sope oh man, nice size, crispy from the flat top, cheese guac veggies and the asada was bbq galore
literally every bite had me shaking my head, wanting more, and experiencing a flavor and taco and plate that i had never had before from los angeles! 
the horchata was a nice refresher too, especially from the machine

this place is a definite new spot to visit every damn trip! DO NOT GO TO VEGAS WITHOUT STOPPING HERE!",2,2,3

My wife and I shared a quartet of adobada street tacos, but the norm this day seemed to be 6 per person.

The store is located in a strip mall that is kind of sketchy.

Also, when you come in there are various lines for different types of meat, but if you just talk with the cooks they'll help you out and get you what you want to order. You don't have to go to the right line.

Also, they offer free cebolitas, including grilled green onions and a jalapeno pepper, and also free pineapple with the spicy pork\/adobada\/al pastor (these are all the same thing here). You have to ask :)

Personal faves - Adobada and Carne Asada tacos and tostadas. The tostadas are a little different here, not what you're used to if you're an El Taurino fan. But the flavors are so intense and rich it is the perfect meal intoxicated or sober. Ask for the side of peppers and green onions as well! And don't forget that orange bang!

He made sure he got my full order without having to stand in the other lines.  My friend took advantage of this and made me get his order to.

I am really picky when it comes to eating lengua (tongue), but it was so juicy and delicious I had to go back in and order some more.  Although I had to wait a bit, the adobada guy chatted me up and remarked about how the tacos would taste just that much better after my wait.  

Asada fries delicious...they have this really tasty creamy green salsa.  Tacos OUTSTANDING! oh and they have grilled green onions, jalapenos and chile güeritos...not the pickled variety but the yellow ones.  No one ever has those and those are my favorite.

Tacos El Gordo has some of the best tacos I've had here in the states. First off, their meat is fresh, some places use cheap meat and they try to mask it with good salsa. I get my tacos with salsa on the side, drenched meat is not appealing to my taste buds. I went to Tacos El Gordo and I tried a vampiro which is a toasted tortilla with melted cheese and carne asada on top. Similar to a quesadilla but the tortilla is toasted instead. I also got a carne asada taco and hubby got lengua (beef tacos) the meat was tender, the salsa was spot on and the place was clean. The reason I gave it one star is because people have to make line according to the type of taco they want, so if I want three diff kinds of meat I have to make line 3 times.

Carne asada was smoky and had a delicious charred flavor. Came with some guac too, which I love on tacos. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Sesos was off, texture wise.

Thanks so much to my homie, Ruben for showing me the epicness that is Tacos El Gordo. Luckily, the first time I entered with the homie, there was no line so ordering and getting the food was almost instant. However, when I came EDC weekend, the lines were out the door! Nonetheless, this food is totally worth waiting for. The stuff that I have tried here include: Al pastor tacos, al pastor quesadilla, and a half order of carne asada fries.

The al pastor meat is seriously the best al pastor I've ever indulged in. The meat is super tender, juicy, well marinated, and overall awesome. I love the nice little crunch the outside of the meat has from the rotisserie cooking process. The al pastor tacos also get some toppings such as cilantro, onion, and a creamy sauce. As for the carne asada fries, the portions are huge. A regular order can feed about 4-5 people and a half order can take care of 2-3 people. The fries are perfectly crisp and are covered with delicious carne asada, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and some other sauce...drool worthy deliciousness. Not only do they have epic food, but their drink machine options are unique and refreshing. I absolutely am in love with their Orange Bahng drink. Overall, this taqueria is the seriously the best ever.",6,4,4

We stopped in during lunch on a Saturday, and it wasn't busy at all. We ordered the campechana fries - comes with both carne asada and spicy pork. 

It is a bit confusing about how\/where to order, seems like that problem could be solved with just a couple signs over the ordering lines?? We must have looked confused cause one of the employees came over and told us what each line is for, and when we told her we were just wanting the fries she stepped up and ordered for us. They then told us to go have a seat and they would bring our order out since it would take a few minutes. 5 stars for the great service!

We only tried the fries, and you definitely get a lot. I would say they are worth the $10 price. Not the best ones we've ever had, but still really good. They top them with cheese, sour cream, what looked like an avocado sauce as well as guacamole. I think they would have been really great though  if they had a selection of salas to top them with, it seemed odd to us that a taco shop wouldn't have that, and honestly the fries were missing it.

DH's favorite was the spicy pork, which wasn't actually that spicy. You can get it with a little pineapple. They shave it off a pineapple impaled on the top of the vertical spit. All of our tacos were yummy. Spicy pork, though, was the best!

The tacos are small. DH is a light eater & he killed 4 without difficulty. So, not that cheap, but still a good deal by Vegas standards.

The place is crowded with locals, but turnover is quick so you can grab a table after you pay. Dinged them one star because their drink machines ran out of flavor syrup. We waited a long time, but they didn't refill it. First time around, the horchata & tamarind drinks were excellent.",2,1,3

The burrito wasn't a ""burrito"" I am used to eating. So I was a little confused. And I thought the portion was so small. Once again, not what I am used to. So sadness came over me. I sat down to eat my meal. OMG, these people know how to make tasty Mexican food! Pure joy and happiness began to take over any past emotions. The food was very tasty. And it turned out the portion wasn't small at all. I got full on just those two orders. The point is, this place is awesome!

And unlimited horchata refills for a little over $1.50? Yes please! I was really looking forward to the grilled green onions, but they looked and tasted more like they were steamed.

We probably waited a good 40-45 minutes and they ran out of spicy pork by the time we ordered :( The tacos are around $2-2.50 and topped with guac and salsa and a generous portion of meat on each. Each order is made on the spot and it's pretty crazy how fast the workers make the tacos we ordered like 10 tacos and it took him less than a 1 min!

We also ordered carne asada fries (LARGE! $13) which for the price, probably isn't as worth it as ordering more tacos but it was still soooo good as drunchies the next morning hehe. 

Definitely try the beef tongue tacos they were juicier than the carne asada. We also got the chorizo tacos which were good, but not at the same level as the others. Next time, we'll be back just for the spicy pork!

I will tell you about my tastes for one second. I am a minimalist. I usually order things on the side or plain, especially with Mexican food. I do this because my tongue can't handle much heat despite the fact that I am 1\/2 Mex. So, my honey and I met at The District to take our son to My Gym on V-Day, and he brought along tacos from El Gordo to surprise me. I had never had their food before this. I opened up the plate, and was thrown off because the pork looked like the sweet pork from Chinese places. You know how it is slightly reddish on the outside? Okay, mine was meat and tortilla only and his had a mix of cilantro\/onion plus a few pieces of pinapple on top. To be honest here....I totally lifted my nose to the idea of fruit with my taco. When we were done there happened to be one taco left. I just couldn't let it go to waste! I took a bite with everything on it and.....IT WAS SO GOOD!

Now I wish my other tacos were like that. The lesson to my story is this:

If you don't step outside your comfort zone once in a while, you will let all the joys of life pass you by!

These delicious tacos from heaven only cost $2 each. No rice and beans available here, but I don't give a damn. Who wants to stuff yourself with fillers? The crowds are huge at lunchtime but it's only because these little yummies are a force to be reckoned with. By far, they are the best Las Vegas has to offer.",2,3,1

Came on a Friday night and all 5 of the lines were coming our of the doors. We left. I didn't want tacos THAT badly. We hit up the Indian kabob place a few doors down instead, but I was determined to come back and try these tacos. Saturday around noon we returned, and while the lines were sill long, they weren't as bad as they were the night before. 

TIP: There are five lines total, the first one is Adobada and Al Pastor (for non Latin people, these are pork options). The second line is for Asada (marinated chopped beef), Mulas, Sopes, and Chorizo (sausage). The next two lines are duplicates of the first two lines. The fifth line is along the side and serves the more exotic meats, Cabeza, Lengua, Sesos (it doesn't specify on the menu, but this is brain, and yes, it can be delicious if made correctly), Buche, Tripa (this is the small intestine), and Suadero (thinly cut beef belly or leg meat). I believe the Vampiro (made with tortillas that are grilled to the point of being dried out) can be ordered in any of the lines, but make sure you order in the correct meat line.

Even for lunch, it was still too crowded to eat there, so we took our tacos to go and ate them in the car... but, OH MY GAWD... these tacos were GOOD! The freshly made tortillas are what I think really make these tacos so delicious. Combined with the flavorful meat (a recent reviewer wrote they were full of fat, I don't know what he experienced, because ours were GREAT - not one fatty or gristle bite), salsa that isn't too spicy, and perfectly made guacamole they add on top, these are hard to beat, taste wise! We ordered all asada tacos for the Mister and me because were were not going to stand in TWO long lines! Because of the salsa, the tortillas do tend to get a bit soggy before you can finish one and get to the next, so if you're eating 3 or 4 of them like we were, your 3rd or 4th tacos will likely be ready to fall apart - this could be a problem if you like to take your time and savor your food, like I do; not so much if you just wolf it down, like the Mister. Even a little soggy, these are damn good tacos! So much so, that we came back again that Monday before we left Vegas to grab some more. This time the Mister got sesos and lengua (which he raved about) and I stuck to more asada. We tried the horchata and it was amazingly good! Not too sweet or thick like some places, it was a perfect balance of flavors. 

TIP: Because there is such limited seating, they have the rule that you must already have your order and paid for it before you sit at a table. It's a good rule, to keep things fair and so that people who are ready to eat can sit and enjoy their food while those still in line don't need to waste space; but like most rules, there are always people who don't know how to follow it - so good luck on going to what looks like an empty table only for some douche to say, ""Oh these seats are taken."" Me, I would have sat anyway, the Mister is far nicer than I am, though, and found us seats a couple tables down. Not before the broads in line who were the ""seats taken"" heard me saying, ""If their asses aren't in the seats then they're not taken."" 

Still, we were able to enjoy another round of delicious tacos and left Vegas happy! Definitely will be a regular spot whenever we hit up this town!!!",2,2,1

I'm all about the carne asada, but don't bother with that stuff at Tacos El Gordo. Go with the adobada, hands down. The meat is tender and juicy, the avocado sauce is creamy and full of flavor, and the salsa has a decent kick.

I've been here twice and I'm only giving it 4 stars because the food didn't seem as fresh the second time around for whatever reason. The meat was a little cold and the fries were a bit undercooked. Also, they were a bit stingy with the meat on the adobada fries and they went overboard on the cheese and sour cream. Regardless, if you visit Las Vegas, try to make time to hit this place up.

Only to be pleasant to the whole staff including the security guard, Miguel with a badge & gun, which made my guests feel uncomfortable.

She had the nerve to try to skip me to place an order & call me a white faggot in espanol after I tipped everyone after putting in my order. We didn't want make a scene but she did. She refused to offer me any of the cooked onions or peppers. The staff has changed for the worse. I used to be greeted on a  nice professional basis.

My Dad and I even stopped in once, but the place was packed and there were several lines arching throughout the restaurant, so we walked out in favor of the Riviera food court, which is NEVER busy.

This time around, the joint was practically dead. I quickly found out that you don't go to the desk with the cash register first, but straight up to the counter in front of the kitchen. I ended up ordering the Taco El Adodaba (Spicy Pork), the Taco Asada (Steak) and a Asade Quesadilla. With a bottle of water, the bill roughly came out to $11 or so.

I am a VERY plain eater when it comes to Mexican restaurants. I usually am the person who will order a burrito with only meat, cheese, rice and maybe potatoes inside. These tacos were slathered with guacamole, onions and salsa. I did remove the copious amounts of guacamole, but I actually thought the combination of all of the toppings and the meat tasted pretty good! That's saying something when a plain person like myself can enjoy such loaded food.

This joint is a little bit different in the fare you would expect from a Mexican place as well. They don't have rice, beans or chips...and the quesadilla is definitely different than ANY other place I've had one before. I can only describe it as a small tortilla with meat and cheese in the middle with a corn chip on top of it. It was different, but not bad at all.",1,0,1

I frequent Tijuana Mexico and I've eaten at their location in Tijuana near the border and they taste EXACTLY the same at this location as they do in Tijuana!! They only have locations in San Diego, Las Vegas, and Tijuana. There are others that try to take the name but it isn't the same. 

You start by standing in line for the meat you want. Different lines serve different meat so it's best to come with a few people so each of you can stand in a different line and order each other's food. Then you take your tacos to the cashier where you order your drink and pay. 

This place has always been crowded each time I've been here. Even with short lines, I had a hard time finding seating. Be in your competitive mode when hunting down seats or take it to go. 

I love their horchata and get that each time I come. It's nothing fancy but it isn't the standard one either. It's just good, cinnamon-y, and just a little thicker than water. It has a nice consistently that is perfectly sweet. 

Soooo...the al pastor meat...mmmmmm...ok, I'm back from day dreaming about it. It is my ultimate favorite. I just love the light sweetness of it. There are two usual al Pastor flavors that alive tastes from top tacos spots and this one is the sweeter flavor and my fav by far. The meat is a beautiful bright red from the seasoning and juicy. I love the crusty burnt pieces that adds a crunch because it was cooked on the turny thing (lol, I don't know what it's called, I'll google it after this review). 

The steak tacos are really good but I've had better in Tijuana Mexico. Maybe because I like for my meat to have flavor and this carne asada taste like straight up meat. It's good quality and not fatty (I don't like when I bit into more fat than meat).

Tacos El Gordo has been one of my bookmarks for a long time, yet somehow it wasn't until I was literally half a mile away that I decided it was worth the trip. I'm really glad I made that oh-so dreadful drive...

Even though I've been to similar places, it took me a while to order. I wasn't sure why everybody was piled up on one side of the ordering area. And then there was the empty ordering station on the right edge, which threw me off further. Eventually, I did find my way to the open al pastor station and the open assorted cuts station, and I got my tacos.

After paying (cash only, $2+tax per taco), snapping photos, and finding a seat (outside the off-peak yet still packed restaurant in this awesome tent with two heavy-duty fans and real tables), I dug in and enjoyed delicious bite after delicious bite. And yes, I can review meat by meat because I asked the guy in the kitchen to point out which was which. And I may have eaten some of these before.

- Sesos: braaaaains. You, too, can be a zombie! This is pretty creamy. Makes sense, because it's cow brains. (Not sure I can compare the flavor to anything, just try if it you haven't and aren't squeamish. And no, i don't have mad cow disease yet.)
- Cabeza: tender head meat. From a cow. You can taste salt but it's not salty. Came with a green salsa, same one as on the cesos taco, and diced onions and cilantro, same mix as they provide on all tacos.
- Al pastor (adobada): I've had the unfortunate experience of overcooked, dry, salty pork at other places. Not here. I actually saw the meat bubbling on the vertical spit, and it tasted delicious. They actually have a medium spiciness red salsa under the almost neon green, sweet sauce.

(Funny story with that al pastor. There weren't pineapples, so I asked if it came with them. Al pastor guy goes to the fridge and unwraps the foil from a large piece of pineapple, then sticks the pineapple on top of the vertical spit, and carves off a nice hunk from it. Just throws it on the taco, which I didn't mind since I can portion control with my incisors. A minute later, as I'm ordering at the adjacent station, the pineapple somehow comes flying into the boiling tray of meats and splashes liquid all over the sneeze guard. Dude didn't know where it went and looked around for a while until he finally saw it. Boiling tray station employee grabbed it for him and returned it.

Anyway, back to the rundown.)

- Tripas: pretty salty, not as intestinal as you might expect, crunchy from being fried, comes with that red salsa from above. I'd get it again, probably.
- Suadero: beef shoulder. Best purely savory thing that I tried here. It's beef, and you can feel the meat fibers, but it's still quite tender.
- Buche: chewy, visible stomach lining. Little salty and perhaps acidic, which isn't that surprising since it's, well, a pig stomach. Don't confuse it with pork belly, because that's something else entirely.

Huge credit to Tacos El Gordo for offering a quality, cheap product, especially on the Strip.

The way to order is really confusing.  There are five seperate lines that lead to a counter where different workers are making food with different types of meat.  The lines are usually out the door so you have to try and stand in the line with the type of meat you plan on ordering and then when you actually get to the front to order you can ask the worker to get you food from the other workers with the different meats down the line.  It gets really hectic because the restaurant gets so packed that there is literally 40 people in a very small space in front of the food counter.  If you are claustrophobic this place will freak you out.  You pretty much feel like a sardine in a can.  

The best meat that Tacos El Gordo has available is the ADOBADA (spicy marinated pork meat) that cooked rotating on a spit.  The worker will slice the meat directly into the taco tortilla and add on all the toppings you desire.  The Adobada is a little spicy so if you cannot handle a little heat this might not be for you.

Perhaps even the best tacos in the west. There are other locations, like the one in San Diego, but there is something special about this place.

If you love going to Tijuana for tacos, but hate the crossing the border for two hours plus... then this is the place to go. Just like TJ, but no need to wait to come back. 

Only issue is the line \/ crowd control... there are two lines, one for asada, one for everything else... and the line for asada is usually about 20 - 30 minute wait to order, while the other is very small usually under 10 minutes... but you don't know about the two lines until you've waited in them for a while.

I first got hooked to El Gordo in San Diego, near the border to Mexico. At that time, I was not a big tacos fan like now, but I remembered I really enjoyed the lengua tacos and the adobada (spicy pork) tacos. Ever since then, I always reserved some time to go to El Gordo every time I visited San Diego.

I discovered that El Gordo has 2 locations in Vegas just recently. In Vegas, I found a new love for the carne asada fries. They give you a whole bunch of asada (steak) on top of a bed of fried smothered with their heavenly white and green sauce. BOMB!!!

The line can get really long, I once came on a Saturday night and we waited in line for around 40 mins. Side note, once you're inside you have to line up based on the meat you want to get. So split up your crew so the ordering will be faster.

One more tip, do not, I repeat, do not take the tacos home. You have to eat them right away because everything is made fresh, even the tortillas so they will get soggy once you take them home. So, wait in line, order your heart out, pay, and devour immediately.",2,2,1

I think we came on a Friday at bout 7 and this place was slammed with a lot of authentic looking people so I'm guessing it was legit. There are various ordering lines that my group was clueless too even though they had signs. They had both English and Spanish but still confusing. We definitely ordered in the wrong line and the employee was annoyed with us. 

On to the food, we got a couple carne tacos and I think accidentally got shoulder or tongue. The texture was weird on that one, but the flavors were great. Tacos are about $2.5 each or so and guys you'll prolly need 3 at least.

Ok on to my favorite part of the meal, the carne asada fries (forget what they are called on the menu, but doesn't say fries I don't think). Also, on the menu board I think it says $13, but I don't think it's clear because we were giving a 1\/2 order but it was $8 I think. The 1\/2 order can be shared by two people, it's a lot of food. Tons of cheese, guacamole, and sour cream or something gooey. Plenty of meat on it as well.

Maybe it's because my family is from a different mexican state, but the quesadillas were pretty small and simple. And the tacos were Ok. I was really hoping for a ""Wow"" experience.

For 7 tacos, 2 quesadillas and 3 drinks we paid $40. I feel like we got a ripped off. I've gotten better tacos for way less.

- Adobada taco (spicy pork): Yum! This was the best one. Spicy flavor is there but not too strong, and meat is so juicy. 
- Asada tacos (beef): Pretty good - slightly smokey but still tasty. 
- Lengua tacos (tongue): OK, not the biggest fan since it tasted a little too soft\/mushy and the sauce was on the weaker side.

Overall...
Obviously the Tacos El Gordo in San Diego is the big winner (and original), but Las Vegas has upped its game in terms of taste & quality.

Food: I had ordered the abodaba tacos and asada tacos. They were $2.50 each, which is a bit pricey for tacos, but we know this place is known for great quality so that was fine. I wish I got some more abodaba tacos because they were amazing and my friends were raving about chorizo tacos! Honestly, the asada tacos were really good but I think I can get that kind of taste at any taco stands. Nonetheless, they were all yummy! I only ordered 3 tacos and I was still hungry lol. My friends and I decided to split the carne asada fries, which was the best decision I made during my Vegas trip. It was SO good, and nothing back home will beat the taste. 
P.S. Get the horchata, you won't regret it. 

Seating: The place has lots of places to sit, except there are so many people there. We had to often tell people that seats were taken while my friends went to go use the restroom or wait in line for some more food.

Service: it was okay. The people who work there are not nice, but they're not rude either. They do look like they don't want to be there. Also, the workers take your trays and trash for you, which is really nice, but they do it in a way so that you'll leave and make room for other people.

Surprised that al pastor does beat carne asada though. Ordering is also super simple and makes a ton of sense once you go. I was there when there was no line and thought damn I've got no chance. The guys behind the counter made it super easy - what do you want, how many and what on it? Since they are doing the cooking and serving, the ""line per"" makes total sense. Pickup, go to next line and order there, take tray to get limes\/radishes, pay, get drink and eat. Simple. 

Unlike most places though there doesn't seem to be a variety of different salsas that you can get and put on the tacos. I got ""everything"" on mine and would say the salsa provided was very mild. Not sure if there is a way to get spicy and there is no self service option for the salsas. No chips, cilantro, pickled carrots or other condiments which make me rate this four stars.

I was able to get a chimichanga and a chicken quesadilla to my liking there was two times where I saw that it was busy it's busy because everyone Vegas loves it especially locals this is in a place where someone good girl that's a tourist
This place is basically a staple in Vegas because of word-of-mouth and I heard from the best
I recommended this place to many
But everyone in Las Vegas has already been there 

If you are a tourist it is worth an Uber to try this place out especially if you are not from California or Nevada or Arizona where you can easily access Mexican food where it authentic and delicious and very cheap I would recommend this to people that live on the east coast the north or the midwest",2,1,4

First off, they have a terrible system for ordering your tacos and getting customers out the door. Each customer has to wait in line based on which type of meat they want in their tacos. If you want fries, you have to wait in an additional line. On top of those lines, you then have to wait in another line to pay. It took at least 45 minutes to get tacos. 

They cook with charcoal which sounds great, until all you can breath is charcoal smoke. Your eyes start to burn and clothes stink like you've been at a campfire for weeks. It's a miracle no one has passed out with it being so hot in there, extremely smokey, and minimal ventilation. Honestly, it becomes hard to breath 

Do not give in to the hype, this is not worth it! Should have just paid for a $25 quesadilla at the hotel.",1,0,0

The place was packed with people so there is a little of a wait for the tacos. There are multiple lines that you order from and only make a specific taco (ie: one line for carne asada tacos, one line for lengua and cabeza tacos, another line for adobado tacos, another for chorizo, etc). So if you want to try different types of tacos you pretty much have to stand in 3-4 different lines. The best way to get a variety of tacos to try here at an efficient rate is to come in a group of 5 and divide and conquer. I spent most of the time standing in line and trying to figure out a more efficient way of running the place instead of standing in multiple lines. You pay afterwards at the two different cash registers when you've picked up all of your food.

The best taco was the Adobado (sp?) - spicy pork. Loved it. So tasty and the sauce goes really well with it. The adobado quesadilla was great too. 

Carne asada was okay but a little tough. I had it with some fries which made it pretty good.

The lengua was okay and it was all right with the fries we ordered. 

The pork shoulder was dry and tough. I would pass on it the next time.

So all in all, the spicy pork is the one meat that I would come back here to eat. Props to the place for  having orange bang and all of the other fresca flavors. Free refills too! Great to have on a hot day in Vegas.

Seating is limited because there are only so many tables. If you're willing to sit outside in the heat, there is a tented area that has some additional seating.",0,0,0

PROS: the tacos are absolutely incredible and the reason for the 5-star review. They are also cheap! 

CONS: the ordering system can be flawed, especially if you go alone. The line to order is generally out the door, and you are separated into different lines as you get closer depending on the meat you want. If you want two different types of meat, you must line up TWICE at different stations to get your tacos. Then you line up again to pay.

What's wrong with me! I'm usually on top of these things, and I've been missing out this entire time. During my trips to Vegas, I spend most of my time at Encore and for the longest time I did not know about Tacos El Gordo. The boyfriend heard from a friend about this place, because it was one of his favorite places in Vegas in terms of food. 

ARE WE AT THE ZOO?
The boyfriend and I came during lunch, and the place was a zoo!!! Where to order your food may be quite confusing at first, but if you look there are signs at each station that tell you what they're making. So, you just go to the correct station and tell them what you want, and they'll make it for you. 

While we were waiting for our tacos, I noticed an employee wiping the stainless steel walls by the grill stations down with a towel. Then my eyes started to wander around the entire kitchen, and I noticed that the ENTIRE KITCHEN WAS SPOTLESS! Holy crap!! This place was clean as hell, which means NO DIARRHEA. YES!!!

After we were given all the food we ordered, we walked over to one of the two cashier stations to pay for the food. Yes, so you get your food first and then bring your tray to a cashier where they will ring you up. This is where you can order your drinks. 

OUTDOOR SEATING
With the number of people inside, I was surprised that there was a good number of tables available. I was expecting the table and seats to be filled with leftover food from the people who previously sat there, BUT there was nothing. Again, spotless! The tables are sitting under a big tent, so don't worry about birds crapping on your head or trying to steal your food. 

LUNCH IS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE DAY
Between the boyfriend and I, we had one spicy pork taco, 3 carne asada tacos and one half order of their carne asada fries. I've been to so many taco trucks and taquerias in San Francisco, and usually the dirtier the place the better it tastes. But Tacos El Gordo was clean, and it tasted even better than most of the taco trucks and taquerias I've been to in SF!! =X 

CONCLUSION
Like I said many times in this review, and I'll say it again, this place is very clean. Even their stainless steel garbage cans sitting outside are clean, not a spot to be found! With that being said, if you're afraid of getting mud butt, Hersey squirts, bubble guts, the runs or whatever else you want to call it, because you've eaten dirty tacos from a dirty taco truck or taqueria, you won't have to worry here! You can get the same delicious tacos without worrying about having the run to the bathroom later. Haha, that sounded like a commercial. 

Anyways, I'll definitely be coming back for more tacos in the future. I love tacos, and I love that there is a legit place on The Strip I can go to, to get it! :) I want a taco now.",9,6,8

The Asada is much saltier than I would prefer but adding lime helps cut through it. 

El Gordo reminds me of getting street tacos in TJ or Baja when I was in high school. It's authentic and a couple years ago it would be a 4 star but the novelty of remembering my many trips to Mexico is starting to depreciate and the meat is tasting saltier than I remember.

It was crowded for the wee morning.. but this is on the Strip. So no surprise there.

I had the Spicy Pork and it came with this liquid green sauce that I wasn't so sure what it was... It already had the guac... so was this liquid quac? Not sure but I think this is what makes El Gordo special. The pork was season great and it's always nice to see a traditional taco place with their pork rotating on its skewer in front of the fire.

I don't see what's so special about Tacos El Gordo. The presentation of the taco was not so nice. and it was really difficult to eat because everything was just thrown on top for me.

- Street tacos
- cheap price ($2 - $5 a taco)
- fantastic ""toppings""
- variety of meats from beef tongue to pastor, chorizo, asada, etc
- prompt and polite service
- on the strip, just a block down from Encore

The tacos here are delicious, miles better than anything I've had back in the Midwest or anywhere else for that matter, and considering El Gordo is only in a few cities it's worth the pilgrimage just for these alone.  My favorite is the El Pastor tacos, with the meat shaved off fresh right in front of you, and some mixture of green toppings that sends the senses into a warm embrace.

Warning - this place gets busy at night, so be ready for lines if that's when you arrive.  But they're open late (we've been at 3am before and during the day), so added bonus if you're having a night out on the town and need an after party spot.

Con:
-Lines are long.

Seems to me like the pros outweigh the con! This place is best approached with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Since there are different lines for different food items (one for asada, a different one for adobada, yet another for carne asada fries, etc.), you'll probably want to bring some friends, or stick to just one kind of food.

Everything is delicious! And it's cheap, so you might as well just try one of everything. They have nopales (the quesadilla is my favorite), so there are options for vegetarians, too (although if you're very uptight about it, this is not the place for you...your nopales will probably touch a whole lot of meat before ending up on your plate).

Ask for some grilled peppers and green onions to complete your meal, and stop by the condiment bar for extra hot sauce, radishes, and limes.

For a treat. And what cemented that fact was that there were 90 percent Mexicans eating there too.

 As for the food, after reading some reviews, I heard the Adobado Tacos were the one to get so I got two. I had them put everything on it and let's just say these were one of the best Tacos I have ever eaten. Make sure you ask for the Chiles that they cook behind the counter as well.

 I also had a half order of the Carne Asada Fries. Warning even a half order of these fries are enough for four people. Once again, they were delicious but I could barely put a dent in it.

Here, you are delighted to tacos of all kinds of meat from asada to lengua. So you won't be limited to only one particular kind of meat.

The tacos are seriously STUFFED with meat, onions, cilantro, and sometimes mild sauce or guacamole depending on what kind of taco you order. Just a tip for preferential purposes, you can even order corn tortillas which are somewhat bigger than the standard size tacos. Remember, you have to ask for all the sauces when you pay for your food.

On the other hand, they serve fries! Be mightily warned that the full size rack of fries is HUGE. So unless you have a somewhat normal appetite and stomach, feel free to order the full size, otherwise, I highly recommend the half rack so you can get some tacos. They have carne asada fries, but my favorite is the campechana fries. The campechana fries consist of asada and adobada(similar\/identical to pastor).

Oh and they close at 3 AM and will not let you in after that time. :( make sure you get there before then so you don't have to resort to Denny's.",5,3,5

Their al pastor was one of the best things I've had in LV and seeing the Yelp pics of Tacos El Gordo's adobada on the spit posted had me salivating in front of my laptop.  Must. Go. ASAP!

We ordered 4 adobada, 1 carne asada and 1 beef tongue.  We really liked everything except the tongue.  Maybe it was just our mood that day?  I was freaking starving so I was ready for more.  As soon as I'm about to speak to the guy manning the adobada, he grins and asks ""How many more do you want?"".  I'm sure this happens every 10 minutes there.

I got 2 more adobada along with a brain taco.  The guy automatically perked up when I ordered brain.  The person in charge of the internal organ taco dept went to work digging out some to chop up and put in a corn tortilla.  They also assumed it was my first time trying it.  They assumed right!

It wasn't bad although I didn't love it either.  It was like a beef pate with a lobstery taste to it.  Not ready to order another the next day but we're glad we tried one.     

I might be in the minority of reviewers eating here while sober.  I definitely see how this place would be even better when you're loaded like a freight train at 5am.  Certainly look forward to when I am here in that condition.",19,13,16

Too crowded
The place is too small, I ran into several people and there is no room to walk even outside in seating area. We went there at 5:00 so only waited for 1 customer in front of me.
No air condition swamp coolers instead
Rabid flies especially outside
Seriously smokey from the cooking
Very unhealthy, greasy, and the pork was red
When grabbing a tray to place food on it my hand came in contact with something sticky
There was so much going on in the kitchen I'm not sure what I saw but there was blood. I'm pretty sure on the floor.

With that said, be ready for long lines, total chaos, utter frustration, and complete anger as to how this company runs its business operations and treats their customers.  Though the food that we ate I would rate 3.5 stars. I'd say they charge higher than the average mini taco and have less meat. The corn tortillas were freshly made and spot on. CThe asada was good but not worth the wait. Lengua was okay which I wasn't a big fan of to begin with. Didn't try the adobado cause they wouldn't let me order in the same line as asada and told me to go wait in another line which would take another 20 min on a busy night. But I give this place two star rating based on my experience and lack of proper customer service and organization. 

First off if you see the line out the door and around the fenced-in outdoor patio then I highly recommend skipping this location and opting for the downtown location in hopes of a much shorter line. Though we were told that the half hour line would go fast, what they don't tell you is another half hour to order your food once inside.  While waiting in line, I even witness some regular customers cutting ahead of line by entering the exit outdoor patio then entering the exit door and blend in to the different lines inside. They even have two security guards that are suppose to monitor the one entry and other exit door to keep people from cutting but they could care less and better occupied their time by either eating or chatting with next door employees. 

Now if you want different kinds of taco meat and you alone then it would be an additional wait. That's because some executive genius thought it would be more efficient for them to have separate lines for certain kinds of taco meat. You want taco de asada then you wait in the center area lines for just beef tacos except beef tongue. You want taco de adobado, then you wait in different line, only one on each end for taco pork adobado. You want taco de lengua (beef tongue), then its the only one line all the way on the right around the counter. But wait, what if you want both and your by yourself?!?  Then they lecture you like a child that you must go wait in another line for that $2.25 mini taco! No ifs ands or butts. Then after waiting in multiple lines for your food, guess what? You get to wait in another line to pay for your food! Oh you want extra condiments like hot sauce, onions, or cilantro? Nope just limes and sliced radish at the condiment bar. You have to re-approach the counter to ask for condiments which your lucky if they serve you but most of time they'll say their out of hot sauce if their to lazy to go out of their way cause of the chaos that goes on. So make sure you ask for all your condiments up front as you place your order. So if you plan on eating a variety of different meat tacos then go with couple different friends or guests so you can each wait in all the different lines to order your food at same time then pay all together at the register.  I noticed that majority of the customers that eat at this establishment seem like hispanics that were born and raised in Mexico and seem to accept this kind of business operation and would never complain. But if your a newcomer or tourist, you'll be completely puzzled as to how this operation makes any sense. Otherwise wouldn't other Mexican fastfood establishments be incorporating this kind business model which they don't.

I found myself having dinner out last night and spending this day fox-holed in a bunker because I'm in a town where there's a large... element of celebration whose highlights are at 11:00, our version of L.A. Lite after the Lakers win the Championship.

So, I wasn't able to go to Taco El Gordo, but it certainly was foremost on my mind. I felt like I was cheating on my date by dreaming of the accommodating, doting and comforting restaurant I made hot monkey dinner with weeks ago. 

Admittedly, the first time I went PAST?? Gordo was with trepidation. The place where the now legend resides is a place where a couple of businesses ago, I got to go out with the first (of 4, so far) Vegas bartenders I had gone out with. The location tanked after construction halted on Echel-outofluck. (Construction workers also gott busted for drinking during lunch). So businesses got a rep of not lasting long near the intersection.

Nearby, if you can't stay in business selling espresso & cwof-fee in lingerie, that's tough times depression. Even the jewel of Baker, Ca. The Mad Greek couldn't survive at this very location. (They did better at a couple of off strip locations).

But this last time I was near, there were lines OUT the door. And this was not one line but 6 wide in the building. And there wasn't 1 pissed off person in the place, we were all salivating over the smells of the grill like zombies surrounding a chess competition (BRAAIINS). 

The tacos looked great, but honestly, I've had those before at other places. When I find a special restaurant, I want the big sampler for variety. There wasn't really one, so I decided to get the largest thing on the menu, the carne asada fries. And normally the few times I eat meat, I get chicken. But since the beef wasn't ground, I got that. As delicious as the spicy pork looked being sliced off the gorgeous hunk of rotating abodada, pork always celebrates a little too much and pisses off my stomach's downstairs neighbors.

And then, AND THEN, as if that weren't enough, I got something to drink and not only found horchataaaaaah, which I love, but also a long lost friend beckoned from the past that I had not seen in decades: ORANGE BANG, the bastard cousin of the Orange Whip, also on the endangered list. Give to World Wildlife Fund generously to save or stun, tag and monitor the mating habits of these beautiful beasts.

So I got carne asada fries. As much as I would love yelp to have a MotherF'er button I know it would get abused, but here it's quite applicable. The benches outside were rightfully packed, so I plopped unceremoniously on the astroturf putting green they had nearby. I positioned myself as to where I could see the most women standing in limos hollering WOOOO as I could see. 

There I was sitting, looking at my dinner, actually star struck. I think pictures of food are helpful on yelp, but the actual process of taking pics of your food is odd and strange. Take pics of your food like no one's watching? And yet there I was taking pics, reciting ""this is my carne asada fries. There are many others like it, but this one is mine to devour until I am picking bits of it out of my eyebrows.""

I took before and aftermath pics of the carnage of disheveled paper and styro goods. I was full 2\/3's of the way, so I sat for awhile and then resumed until I finished every rigoddamn delicious fry and bit of veg there was. 

There are 4 other mexican food places I love in all of Vegas. But this one had the best first impression of them all! Enjoy it now before a corporation buys them out and homogenizes them!

I didn't feel competent enough to tackle the Campechana, largely because I didn't see anyone else get it, out of all those people? But someday I will get down on that. Someday..",4,7,2

They hand make the corn tortillas in front of you, carve the meat from huge skewers for each taco, and you can customize it however you like.  They offer unique ingredients like shoulder and others.  A side dish of grilled peppers and onions are provided for every order as well.  I only wish they offered salsas because I absolutely love salsas.

The staff is always working hard in the back and sweating there butts off because it's always so busy in there. 

The place smells so good while you wait and it teases your senses making you anxious while you get closer to the counter and then BAM!! There it is. The delicious adobada! It is absolutely delicious. It is right there in front of you spinning on a steak while the chef cuts it off fresh for every order. Try the adobada (marinated pork) on anything. It is the best pork I've ever had in my life! Like this is better than bacon and they carve it off of the roast right in front of you. The tacos are so good and fresh!

Anything on the menu you're going to like. They have a large menu and anything you can think of, they have it on their menu. Make sure you know what you want to order though, and quickly because you have to go stand in the meat line of your choice. If you stand in the wrong line, you have to get out of line and go stand in the right line. That is a huge bummer.

This place is wonderful! It's the Mexican food you've always dreamed of but have never obtained. If you're in Vegas, leave the strip and head down to this place for some good grub.

I was inspired to go here by the great reviews but we have had much better here in Atlanta.  The ordering process was so disorganized.  You go in and the cooks ask you what you want.  Then, you have to go to the cashier in a separate area and tell her what you ordered.  The people behind the counter forgot a couple of things we asked for. We ordered steak quesadillas and an assortment of tacos. The meat itself was good.  However, I could not taste any cheese in the quesadillas.  Also, you have to ask for salsa instead of it being included in the salsa bar most mexican fast food places have.  The salsas also were not very good.  No heat and lacked flavor.  Almost any mexican will tell you that it's the salsas that make or break a taco. Also, the cooks were openly cursing which is not good when you have kids with you.",2,0,0

The number of Tacos El Gordo shops in Vegas continue to grow and that should be a sign on how successful their shop is. The shop is on the far north end of the strip, it's in an awkward location that either forces you to work hard for your meal (it's a loooooong walk from most of the casinos) or forces you to drive. The lot is pretty big and parking has never been an issue for me. The line during the day is either non-existent or extremely short. Come here at night when all the post-clubbing munchers come in and you'll have a line out the door. 
There are multiple lines based on what type of meat you're ordering. The 4 lines facing you at the main entrance are where you'll probably want to be at (unless you plan on ordering tongue or intestines- the line for that is on the other side). 
AL PASTOR. AL PASTOR. AL PASTOR. It's the line at the far right. Start there, order 3 tacos and if you're still hungry order more AL PASTOR. The meat is so soft and flavored perfectly. If you're feeling to try something else, go for the asada. 
The tongue and intestines were both extremely soft and juicy. I loved the tongue, didn't like the intestines.

The place is right next to Encore. Towards the end of the strip. There is a red rent outside for outside seating. When you walk in there are several lines. There's a line for asada and adobada fries. A line for carne asada tacos and Mulitas and a line for adobada and al pastor Mulitas and tacos. Then a seperate line for anything with buche, suadero, and tripa, lengua. This was the reason why I didn't give it 5 stars. I would rather just order my food and have them call out my number when it's ready. But in a way if works for Vegas craziness. 

The prices for the tacos are a bit higher than usual. Tacos are about $2. Mulitas $4, fries $10. 

I tried the adobada fries and these were delicious with a decent amount of meat topped with sour cream and guacamole and cheese.

2 al pastor tacos. Topped with onion, cilantro and guacamole. So delicious. Perfect size too. 

I also had a Mulita with tripas. So delicious. The Mulitas are small but since I had tacos tok I was satisfied.

You see that long line up and you're thinking, do I want to stand in that just for some tacos? Well, ask yourself a few questions. Do you have to be somewhere? Do you mind standing in whatever weather it is at that moment? Do you have patience? Are you drunk, hungry, and just don't care but wanting to get down on some greasy yet yummy food? Do you come from a place that has plenty of mean street tacos available?

I've come to known Tacos El Gordo from their San Diego, Cali locations. From Tijuana, Mexico, to California, and now Nevada. These guys are definitely making a name for themselves across the border. We rolled up on a Friday evening, probably around 7:30-8pm. That was our mistake. It's as if we were waiting in line for the new roller coaster at an amusement park. My buddy who went to the store next door around 6pm said there was practically no line around that time. About an hour ish later, the hungry mob decided to pounce on the scene for dinner. We should've came earlier...

The ratchet crew of 9 homies were hungry and wanted some good ol' tacos. Good thing was that we had some rooms at Encore, which is literally right across the street. For those of you staying in Encore, Wynn, even Palazzo, or Venetian, this place is a short walk. For you inebriated post-club folks who just partied at one of Steve Wynn's venues, Tacos El Gordo is within stumbling\/crawling distance. On Fridays and Saturdays, they close up shop around 4am. Keep that in mind just in case you get carried away, falling in love in the club and time is just whizzing by. Other nights, I believe they close their doors around 2am.

The lineup situation is a little weird. It's not difficult to figure out, but is it efficient? When you get passed the front glass doors, look for the signs above each station. Depending on the kind of meat\/cuts, that is what will be available at that particular station. For example, the far left station had pork cuts. To the right were the beef options. There's another station around the corner too. If you want pork, then figure out what form you want it in and how many of it you want. Send someone else to another line to get the beef. You can cross order from the same station. Sorry, there's no chicken or vegetarian options here. It's all pork or beef. If you're getting quite the number of items, make sure to grab an orange tray. Sometimes there's plenty of it and sometimes their rare as $h!t to find. If you're by yourself and you want everything on the darn menu, you're practically screwed and will have a joyful time lining up in every single line they got. So don't come solo when it's busy!

After you finally get all the food you want, you walk to the other side of the glass doors to pay. There you can order any non-alcoholic drinks. Practically only fountain drinks and some of the known aqua frescas stuff. For horchata lovers like myself, it's available and it's all self-served, refills A-OKAY all day. Being that it was a full house and I decided to get into two separate lines for food plus paying and getting my drink. I think the entire process took well over an hour by the time I was able to finally consume my tacos. As much as I love tacos, it's quite a long time for just tacos. Sure, the food here is enjoyable. However, if you have to wait that long for everything, besides trying to find a table and if you're rolling deep or kind of drunk, it can get old real fast. 

The carne was probably my favorite while the boys loved the pork options. I waited extra in the around the corner line for some suadero and that was kind of a letdown. Besides tacos, you can get quesadillas, fries, sopes, mulas, and tostadas with the same available meat options. If you have the patience or if there's no line, then definitely give this infamous taco spot a shot. There's no hurt in trying it out. It's double the price of the street tacos I'm use to in LA, but it's definitely cheaper than many of the dining options in the fancy hotels that are located nearby. Personally, I'll only cruise through when the lines aren't so long or when I'm hammered and don't have any concept of time.",2,2,2

The line was long, as expected, but just barely out the door so it was doable. I'll give them this -- they really do try to organize folks in there. It's kind of a free-for-all where you line up and tell the folks cooking the food what you want, which is really neat (and it definitely gets warm in there). They have four separate lines: 2 for adobado & something else on either end, and then two in the middle for sopes, chorizo, and a few more things. So, they really try to parse folks out based on what they're ordering. I wouldn't say all of the clientele was great at organizing themselves, but I gotta give it to Tacos El Gordo for trying.

There's a decent seating area, but not huge, and definitely not enough to support how busy they are, so we ended up eating on a curb in the parking lot, but it was just as well because it was gorgeous outside, and it felt more like eating street tacos, haha. 

I got a chorizo taco and a carne asada taco, and my girlfriend got a carne asada sope and a quesadilla. We ate the sope and had the quesadilla later, so maybe my memory is slipping me, but they seemed exactly the same. Regardless, they were the bee's knees. The tacos were delicious, and I liked their carne asada more than their chorizo (which was good, but nothing to write home about), but the carne asada sope took the cake. So, give this place a try if you're on the strip and looking for legit street tacos...but go for the sopes.",1,1,1

During a spur-of-the-moment 3 day trip to Las Vegas, we went to Tacos El Gordo a total of 5 times, sometimes more than once a day -- Yes, that's how much we love this place. This place is so authentic that they don't even give you the option of ordering a burrito! (So if that's what you're craving, you're not going to find one here.) The meats on the tacos were cooked well and the combination of everything they put on it was perfect. They are generous with the guacamole and everything else, but... half the time when I get my tacos they are cold. This is because sometimes they will cook the meat in advance and store it in a nearby metal can and continue to cook more meat. This is effective when there is a lot of customers but cold tacos aren't as good as fresh, warm tacos! 

With that said, leftover tacos still tastes amazing so no worries, but warm tacos are still better.

PROS:
- Generous guacamole & everything else on the taco
- Delicious
- Great hours
- Fair prices
- Fast taco making

CONS: 
- Half the time I saw my asada come from a metal can and not the grill",5,0,2

Tacos El Gordo doesn't make any sense. Delicious, nearly flawless, incredibly cheap tacos served almost in the shadow of Wynncore. Things on the strip shouldn't be so delicious while being so cheap because it feels like there's a scam somewhere.

I had never been before, therefore I do what I do when I'm somewhere new... Yelp places to eat! It was lunch time and we always agree on taqueria's...
Tacos El Gordo caught our attention immediately. The pictures and videos of the Abodaba, the grilled veggies and nopales (a personal fav. of mine...) beckoned us down the strip. We just couldn't pass it up and I'm so glad we didn't! 
I've never had Abodaba, or meat prepared like this for Tacos...the closest is Mediterranean shawarma....when it's vertically standing and spinning!
As they cut the meat down into the hand made tortillas I couldn't help but smile ear to ear! They probably thought I was insane! Maybe just crazy for these tacos!!!
My husband got Carne Asada tacos as did I, however I also ordered the Abodaba's tacos which there was NO WAY I was passing up! We also ordered the Nopales.
The tacos were amazing. The meat was in huge chunks, the tortillas were so flavorful... You can't beat watching a woman kneading dough and making tortillas right in front of you, only to be passed off and have a man slice huge chunks of pork off this thing, and make you the best damn tacos you've ever had!!!

Albeit in LV, I was quite excited to try this popular taco spot. We came on a Wednesday around 2:00ish. There's a parking lot. Not big, but we were able to get a spot.

There was a line, but not bad as this place usually gets. You need to get in line according to the meat you're ordering. I got in the Abodaba\/El Pastor line. I ordered 7 adobada tacos for three ppl, but the guy accidentally gave me 8. No problem! I asked for everything with pineapples. If you want pineapples, you need to ask for it. He chucks a thin piece off the whole pineapple that's roasting on top of the spit. 

I was watching the man make the tacos. It was a thing of beauty. He first grabs about 20 tortillas and lathers the sides of it in the drippings of the pork fat. (Heart-eyed smiley face emoticon inserted here.) After heating up the tortillas, he masterfully slices off slices of the unctuous marinated pork, tops it with onion, cilantro, salsa, and their famous green sauce. Using his long knife, he clips the pineapple and tosses it onto the taco for a perfect finale.

My sister was in the beef line and got an order of carne asada fries. You take all your food to the cashier where you pay. We also got an horchata. There's also fresh radishes and limes to help yourself to.

Upon my first bite, I knew why this place was so popular. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was everything I wanted in a taco and much more. The pork was flavorful and perfectly cooked. I loved the green creamy sauce. The pineapple offset the spiciness from the onions and sauce. Squeeze some lime on it. Take turn eating the radishes in between bites of the taco. Taco heaven. It was so good that I ordered an extra one to the two I ate. 

Also, FYI, you need to ask for grilled peppers and green onions as well. I forgot with my first order, but remembered to get it for my second.

The fries were okay. I found the asada a bit dry. I think the adobada fries would taste better. The horchata was very delicious too. Creamy and cinnamony.

Plenty of seating. People eat quite fast and clear the tables quickly.

I was standing in the same spot for the longest time and it didn't look like anyone's order was coming up. Usually, they can get people their food pretty quickly but not this night. Some people were complaining because each line was for different kinds of meat and so groups had to split up into the different lines so they could get carne asada, adobada, etc. and waste time going on every line. There needs to be a better system for that because if someone is by themselves on busy nights and they want different kinds of tacos, are they supposed to wait in every single line and let their food get cold?

Tacos El Gordo is a must visit place for my buddy and I when we're in Vegas.  It really is that good.  

All the tacos are great, but the spicy pork is something special, which likely explains why the lines for pork are ALWAYS longer than the lines for beef.  Each line serves pork or beef, but not both, so you need to pay attention to what line you're in.  

This place pulls a crowd more or less ALL THE TIME, so be prepared.  But, they are set up for a crowd, and the lines move pretty quick.

The assembly line moves fairly quickly and each taco is made, sliced, and chopped to order. I went with the spicy pork and tripe tacos. These little guys are surprisingly filling; don't let their size deceive you. The pork tacos were tender and juicy, with just stumble hints of sweetness and spice. Excellent. The tripe tacos are a little chewy, a little crispy, and a little funky. If you like funkiness and organ meat, this is for you.

Well, let's start with: This place rocks. 

Let's get into it. You need some greasy food after an epic night, and sometimes Tacos are the cure-all. Do not miss the opportunity to eat here. It's located on the northern end of the strip just passed Encore & Wynn. 

There is usually a line, but it moves quick. 

You have plenty of meat options for your tacos (hey now). I prefer the more adventerous stuff like lengua, cabeza & tripa. Totally worth it because everything is seasoned to perfection and greasy enough to be amazing.

If you are on vacation and have no regard for your arteries (aka if you are like me), then try the carne asada fries. It's massive and something that can easily be shared amongst 3-4 people. Or just split it with someone if you are both cool with a challenge.

Read some of the other reviews now. Then grab some tacos.

We were stuck in 1 line only to realize when we got to the counter that we could only order Al Pastor and Adobada in that line.  If you wanted anything else from their menu like Chorizo, lengua, quesadillas or carne asada fries, you had to line up at 1 of the 3 other lines!!!  Ridiculous!!!  It took me 20mins to get my order of 2 Al Pastor vampiros in my line and as much as I wanted to try the other stuff, I didn't wanna line up again, especially since I arrived the lines were even longer!  After you got your oders, you had to pay at the cashier, then squeeze to the beverage counters.  Dear Tacos El Gordo owners, obviously your stuff is good and people are willing to line up for it, but I really wish you would care more about customer service!  I wish you would implement an effective process where it's first come, first served, order what you want, get it then pay!  We are not herds of cows wanting to eat, we are PEOPLE folks!

Moral of the story, come at an odd hour or come prepared... in a group of 5 people - 1 to save a table, 4 to order at each line\/counter so all of yous can get what you want.  Or you can check out their other outlet at E Charleston Rd which may be less crowded.  

All we had was the Al Pastor vampiros and the flan.  The flan was good, but I have a personal preference of the Philippine leche flan over the Mexican version.  This version is more dense, but still yummy and creamy.  For those who haven't tried Vampiros, try it!  It's a taco meets grilled cheese sandwich.  It's all your taco fillings sandwiched between tortillas and grilled so that the cheese melts and packs all the goodness inside.  The Al Pastor meat was exceptional, one of, if not the best I've tried in Vegas.  Very tender and tasty, the right amount of sweet and spices.  The cheese was melted and yummy but the tortilla they used was so thin that most of it was pretty burnt.  I preferred the tortilla they use in Taco y Taco vampiros.  We definitely have to go back for the other items on the menu!

When I say these are the best tacos I've had in my life, I seriously mean it. 

The lines are ridiculously long, and that's the only slight complaint I have....but being that it's a hit, it's expected. 

Make sure you order the al pastor with a slice of pineapple. Also order a side of nopales (grilled cactus) and don't forget the salsa and Coca Cola. 

To whoever wrote a bad review about this place- go back to Taco Bell.",1,1,1

Lines can get long. Place can get pretty packed - dependent on when you visit, but the lines move relatively fast (and tbh, if you're not fully there sometimes life can move by so quickly if you're lucky haha)!

Now personal preference time! I love getting lengua (beef tongue) with all the fixins! If you're about that lengua life, look no further. Tacos El Gordo will hook you up with the noms, but even if you're not and you want carne asada or their other proteins, do you and you won't regret it. & If you have more dolla dolla bills to spare, get yourself an horchata. Go ahead treat yourself! Just don't be like me and get super excited in a drunken stupor and get horchata on your phone.....

Overall? I dig you, Tacos El Gordo. You're the answer to my taco prayers and even though I never got to pay your San Diego location a visit (which some say is incomparable and that SD is better....but that's all personal preference) I know I'd probably love that location as well.

This is the place to be for your taco craving in the City of Sin.  Finally, I found a place in Vegas who serves street tacos and is open after a night of drunken bliss.  We stumbled into there about 4 AM and saw the line pouring outside the door on a Saturday night\/Sunday morning.  A crowd mainly comprised of Latin descent and a good mixture of other cultures was a clear indication that this was the place to be for authentic street tacos.  

READ THIS PORTION CAREFULLY!!!!!

Okay so when you make your approach to the restaurant you need to determine what kind of tacos you want.  From what I remember (I was pretty inebriated), there were three UNIDENTIFIED lines.  Starting from the left as you face the kitchen, line #1 consisted of the carne asada line.  You tell your order to the taco chef but be aware that the designated lines represent the specific type of meat you want on your food.  Line #2 is the adobada line, and #3 is the tripas and cabeza line.  There were other types of meats but I can't remember which line you can get them at.

So if you are a taco eating machine like myself, you want to try all the meats strictly for the purposes of providing fellow yelpers a true, well educated opinion on the good and the bad of services provided to the general public, more specifically an educated opinion from me regarding street tacos.  Not to nurse your future hangover in Vegas, because hangovers NEVER happen in the City of Sin.  

Unless you only want one type of meat on your tacos, be sure to tacticallly plan your approach to the taco masters and be sure you are in the right line.  Unfortunately we learned the hard way and did not split our resources to different lines.  We ordered the asada tacos and had to fall in the tripas line to score my tripas, cabeza, and adobada  taco fix.  I wasn't  going to fall in the herrendous adobada line, so I worked smarter not harder and had someone much better looking than me who wore heels and had bigger and better goods for these taco guys to look at than my taco eating mug place the adobada taco order even though she was in the tripas line.  Apparently it worked because we scored what we wanted.  Till next time Tacos El Gordo.....We shall meet again and hopefully I won't have to resort to the egotistical motto that women always get what they want and how men use them.",3,1,0

The opportunity came when Hubby & I were shamelessly Pokemon hunting on Las Vegas Blvd. We just so happened to drive by when I immediately began craving tacos. I even made Hubby stand in the long line with me as we waited to order. There are different lines for each type of meat they sell. Since we aren't adventurous enough for cow tongue or intestines, we stood in line for some good ole steak tacos.

Since Hubby does not share my love for Mexican food, I didn't expect him to enjoy his carne asada tacos. Turns out, he loved them just as much as I did! We each got two tacos and both ended up joining the line again for a third since they were so delicious. The steak was so tender and flavorful, it didn't even need hot sauce. I still poured some on though because my motto is the spicier, the better. ;-)

I do have to comment on the whole ordering process since it's very inefficient. It's probably the only complaint I have (asides from the poor ventilation that keeps your clothes smelling like tacos for days!). You receive your food and have to stand in another line to pay for it. Not only do your tacos get a little cold, it is very easy for dishonest customers to sit down without paying.

Thanks to Tacos el Gordo, I can finally take Hubby to a Mexican joint he will enjoy too! What's really awesome about this particular one is their handmade corn tortillas and fresh salsas & guacamole, all prepared daily.

The insatiable appetite for indulgence, the unrelenting yet ever flowing booze from all corners of the town. With the infamous Tijuana chain Tacos El Gordo in the mix, the game has now changed ... for the better. 

Located inside of a strip mall just around the corner of Wynn\/Encore, this spot is the perfect alternative to the spendy options of late night spots mid-strip. Folks who are familiar with the Cali locations should notice the mini-spike in prices here from .15-45 cents per item. It's still a inexpensive deal on the Strip and an even cheaper \/ tastier option that most tacos in NYC. I digress.

The late night hours from Thursday-Sunday is often their busiest times here. Lines from post-XS \/ Tryst crowds of drunken club goers crowd up this small spot. No sense in sprinting to Earl of Sandwich (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas#hrid:rCEJrFmkm-Y5nNg1MhO7VQ) when the $10 for a sandwich translates to 4 tacos and a drink here.

A true San Diegan Mexican treat - the carne asada fries ($10) are the real deal. A mile high mountain of carne asada beef, salsa, cheese, and crema over fries is terrible for anyone's diet but delicious nonetheless. Tacos of all kinds - adobados, carnitas, de cabeza, orejas, lenguas - are superb in every sense. Vegans ought to look the other way but carnivores of the Mexican loving kind will be delighted with most everything on the menu. There is no words to describe the joy of fresh, shaved, carnitas on a perfectly grilled corn tortilla with a little salsa verde, cilantro and bits of cebolla, all folded to make for a juicy, super sabrosa bite.

So supposedly this spot shut down for about a YEAR... & it was ALWAYS a place to get your grub on because it was 24 hours & this is where you go after dancing up an appetite at Encore or XS. So i dunno if this location is a bit bigger... but definitely a bonus that the tables & chairs move unlike the Charleston location where the booths are bolted down ahahahaha

The staff is just as quick & efficient i would have to say when it comes down to getting the tables cleaned & showing up out of nowhere w\/ foil to wrap up my leftovers! =]

I thought that the food would be the same as the Charleston location... but it was different =[  I will unfortunately have to say it was not as good as the Charleston location.

1\/2 AL PASTOR FRIES $6.00 - I wouldn't say i would order this again.... but it wasn't bad to try. I thought it was a bit dry... just not enough of everything for each bite of fries.

FLOUR MULA AL PASTOR $4.25 - this is my go-to when i eat at tacos el gordo, but i was bit disappointed w\/ the flour tortilla because it wasn't as GREASY as i would typically expect it to be... me & the hubby assume maybe the flat-top needs a little more ""dirtiness"" breaking into. 

AL PASTOR TACO $2.10 - ALL-in-ALL i think the Al PASTOR needs a little more seasoning to it in general. I don't know why it would be so different from the Charleston location, but the flavor is just not as BOLD.",8,4,4

Tips: 
+Don't waste your time and money ordering Asada! They don't season their meat as well as they should and the taco ends up tasting bland. 

+Make sure you stand in the proper line for the tacos you want. Each line has a sign above it indicating which tacos they make. If you're with multiple people, split up and order your tacos because the food gets cold quick.

+The al pastor is a must, it's pretty much their best tasting meat option.

+If you're here as a group, have someone save your group a table because this place is always busy and by the time you get your food and sit down, your tacos are cold.


I definitely think they need to change the way they order food here. They go by this whole ""honor system"" where you order your tacos and then you stand in line to pay for your tacos. The lady at the cash register counts your tacos and items and then gives you a grand total. Imagine if I ate a few in line? I'm sure they lose out on a lot of $$ here. 

And what is up with their Quesadilla?? I thought I was going to get two hand made tortillas with a fresh piece of melted cheese in between and of course my meat in the middle. Instead I received this twist on a quesadilla which turned out to be ONE tortilla, meat and cheese and a tortilla chip on top. The round tortilla chip was almost about the size of the hand made tortilla (meaning it was tiny). Common man, how can you mess up on a quesadilla??! 

Overall, please be patient when coming here and don't be alarmed when you see a line out the door for tacos. Order the al pastor and you won't be too disappointed.",2,0,0

There is a salsa bar and previously I never had to use any salsa because the great Mexican flavors spoke for themselves without any help from the salsa bar, but now there just isn't that flavorful seasoning that kept me coming back nearly once every week.
The one noticeable improvement is the carne asada taco in which the quality of the meat is much I improved over the previous fatty version.
The price per taco is now $2.10 so they increased the price by 10 cents, but who cares?
A feature that is no longer there is the huge red tent where you could dine outside and enjoy your food on the Law Vegas strip.
Also new is the armed guard that is protecting diners from attacking taco thieves and it's a comforting feeling to know my tacos are safe.
Who knows? one night there could be quite a show in addition to your meal, yay!

Taco de Adobada aka Spicy Pork with everything was amazing! The meat is shaved off a sharwarma grill & assembled right in front of you. Was disappointed I ordered only 2 tacos (they were pretty small like the Mexican street tacos)
The Tamarind Horchata drink was sweet and tangy in just the right amount. The Cinnamon Horchata tasted like a iced apple cider with a twist.

They should have a system in place to bring order to the madness whenever the place gets so freakin crowded!!  I enjoyed watching the disorganization for awhile, but after 10 minutes I had enough.  So we joined other people and simply left.

Steak taco was the least good. Topped with guac and salsa, interestingly the steak was somehow very smokey tasting despite them grilling it before my eyes. Had the flavor you'd get if you threw a steak into a barbeque with wood chips. The flavor was good, but seemed out of place in a taco.

Spicy pork suffers from false advertising. Not at all spicy. The pork inhabits a vertical spinning spit usually seen at your favorite Gyro spot. It's basically a take on Chinese Char Siu (Roast Pork). They've even colored it red and have a pineapple at the top of the spit which they give a squeeze to every once in a while to keep the sweet glaze going. Quite interesting, although not as juicy as I'd like since they seem to have kept mostly lean pieces.  A shame.

The chorizo is their masterpiece. you order it and they cut a link loose and burst the insides out of the casing onto the grill followed by some sauce. I'm at a loss for words, but not appetite.

Hence, you gotta plan ahead and think about who will go in which line.  Honestly, it's pretty inconvenient imo because some lines are longer than others.

We ordered a wide variety of tacos (adobada, carne asada, and lengua), adobada fries, and carne asada fries (I know I know...I judge me too).

It's a long story on how I found this place, but it involves a rental car, spending $5 on a bottle of water and the Hoover Dam.  Anyway, this place is pretty awesome.  They have a Carne Asada Fries plate that is as big as your head (you can get a smaller version for half the price, but why do that to yourself? they're that good.).  The tacos and quesadillas are also really good.  My friend said the spicy pork tastes like chinese bbq pork and the quesadillas are not the ones that most people are used to.  It's more like a flat taco with a fried tortilla on top.  

The staff here is really friendly too.  The guy making the tacos and cutting pork from the meat slab was having a conversation with almost everyone that came in.

The verdict:
Good, but WAY overrated. Some of the al pastor meat was crunchy...why did they give me the burnt ends? Also, one taco had more pineapple than meat. Thanks.

The carne asada was tasty, probably better than most...salty, but not too salty, on point...so props to that.

I admit the meat is good but there were a lot of other things I didn't like. Through our experience, it was packed, hectic, and wasn't as great as we thought it would be. When you go in there will be lines based on meats. Everyone talks about the carne asada fries so I decided to go in the asada line. The asada line usually goes out the door. Someone was telling me to either stay outside or go in and I wanted to go in but there was no room. So by the time I ordered I wasn't sure if the guy who was making the food heard me or not. I also ordered the tacos which came immediately. So I assumed he didn't hear me and my friends were in a different line and we wanted the same thing so I decided to join them in the last line furthest to the right. My friends said they were in line for the carne asada line, but they were actually in line for the lengua line which didn't show the asada. The line for the lengua goes to a side so you can't see what the line is for until you get about half way through. Someone in line told us that we are in the wrong line. So I wanted to make sure I wasn't in the wrong line. I asked the cashier which line is for the carne asada and she didn't speak English but she understood me and pointed at the line, the line I got the tacos in. Turns out the guy did hear me and got mad at me for stepping out of line. But he was already taking other people's orders so I got confused. I felt like the whole experience was confusing.
When I finally got my food, I needed napkins and had to ask where they have the napkins. Apparently they don't give you napkins you have to ask for it.  I felt like this place has poor customer service. The first cashier that helped me was ok but the second one seemed so grumpy. They are not friendly to first comers either. They just assumed that everyone knows what they are doing. 
Anyway, the food ended up being just ok. The fries were soggy but the meat is pretty good.  The food was pretty salty in general and made me super thirsty.
As for coming back here, I don't think I would come back unless there was nothing else opened. But it's Vegas, so probably not. It's the city that never sleeps. Maybe the grumpy cashiers just needed to sleep?",6,3,1

Okay, it's past def past bedtime and silly me couldn't even read the menu. Yup, the struggle is real.

Make sure you get into the correct line. Go to the right for adobada, and the left for everything else. Some chica cut in front of me only to be told to move over (that's what you get, HA).

I grew up eating Mexican food (I was the token Asian in my neighborhood), so I spent many days eating all the good stuff from my friends' abuelitas.  Menudo, pozole, chilequilas - I might as well consider myself half Mexican!

I had to yelp a Mexican food place in Vegas, and this one was the first to pop up.  It's just past the main strip in between Caesar's Palace and Circus Circus, and the place reeks of Taqueria (in a good way).  It's not dirty, and the employees are incredibly friendly and helpful.  Btw, no burritos here.  Tacos are mostly two dollars each and you can try the standard meats like carne asada and chicken or you could get down to the nitty gritty and go for the lengua (tongue), suadero (fatty pork shoulder), and cabeza (brain).  What's also beautifully prepared is their spicy pork on a spit.  The process ensures a tasty crisp meat contrasting the tenderness of the pork.

Everything (with the exception of the tortillas) is prepared fresh.  Tons of cilantro, diced onions, and salsa verde (or salsa roja) top off the tacos, and, man are they delicious.  My brothers were looking forward to the buffets of Las Vegas, but when I took them here on our first night, the kept suggesting we come back here.

Every. Single. Time. I've never missed a chance and I probably never will. 

Tip 1: Be prepared to wait. The lines are long, and they have a system where you stand in different lines for different meats. There's only one way in and one way out, and there's a security guard monitoring the doors (That's when you know it's serious). 

Tip 2: The asada and al pastor lines are the longest, but the al pastor is also REALLY, REALLY good. It's what they're most known for and they take the meat straight off the skewer and chop it up in front of you. For some reason these lines are also the ones that move the slowest, which is why I'm giving 4 stars because the wait can be brutal especially if you're hungry and you have a tray of uneaten tacos that you got from a different line. 

Tip 3: There is another line off to the side that people tend to forget about!! It's on the right side around the corner and that is where you can order meats such as cabeza, lengua, and buche. These are my favorite meats so I'm always happy this line is the shortest. 

If you don't want tacos they also have other options such as sopes, tostadas, quesadillas, etc. with your choice of meat. All reasonably priced! Oh, and if you have read my other reviews about my favorite food ever (tacos) you know that I love my homemade corn tortillas! That's the only tortilla option they have here; it's oily, soft, and de-li-cious. Come here for lunch, dinner, or drunchies - you won't regret it.",10,6,5

- The employees just ignore you if you don't speak Spanish.

You stand in line for the type of tacos that you want and then pay at the cashier after you get them. My favorite are the tacos Adobada (Baja style spicy pork tacos with salsa, cream guacamole, onions and cilantro).

The Vegas location was a nightmare; After waiting in line for 15 minutes, it became apparent that they were not going to serve any more tacos because their equipment malfunctioned. They did not close the line or notify us, they just let everyone stand there until we figured it out on our own.

I went to the other side where there was another adoba line, and waited for 15 more minutes. One guy was ordering like 30 tacos, and then other people kept coming up to the people ahead of me and asking them to get them some more tacos so the line seem to get longer as I waited.  When I was about third back, the taco maker said something in Spanish to the person ahead of me who said ""there are no more tacos you have to get in another line"".

I didn't want to get in another line after waiting in wto fruitlessly, so I walked up to the front and talked to one of the girls making tortillas. She said something to the guy in the Adobada area who then made me three tacos, which he had enough meat for after all.

I then got in line to pay and get a drink. There were two cashiers but they were not very efficient so this took a long time as well. Finally, I got my cup and got to go get a drink. Well, they were out of ice and co2 as well because the drink was flat and warm.

I sat down and ate the tacos, which were pretty good (although not as good as the ones in San Diego). Overall this took an hour and a half of my life, not including the time it took to find a parking place on such a busy street. The quality of the food is the only reason I gave them any stars at all.

So when I stumbled upon this place in Vegas, I was like oh, let's try it. And next thing you know, I was in the zone...In...The...ZONE! This girl was like ""Leena, I can tell when you really like your food...you're really into it and it looks like your really like it!"" Uhhh...yea! That was this moment. 

There are a bunch of lines so just go to the shortest one...I went to the older man because he looked like he knew what to do with a giant cow and a grill. Then you can speak to him in your broken Spanish and ask for errrything. I notice that the non-traditional folks ask for cheese and all but if you want it really legit, then all you need is their special salsas and cilantro. 

OH and I forgot about the spicy pork! So good, so good so good! I do like the fancy pants restaurants. But it's places like this where I'm like, why did I just drop all them dimes on that meal when i just enjoyed these tacos and they were just as delicious...if not more! ::sigh:: #foodieproblems

Oh...but the drinks...I would suggest either BYOB OR a bottled beverage that they have....I would like to go back though and try their homemade beverages but as you can see, with 2 different animals and 5 different parts inside me, I was a bit occupied ;)",0,2,0

Their spicy pork tacos are to die for! And if you order peppers and onions, beware! They are super tasty, but way spicy (and I can handle a lot of spice)!

A bit confusing with different lines you have to stand in base on what you want. 
We asked the cashier and she explained it well. 
You can pay ahead of time or pay after you order and get your food. It's $2 a taco. 

We got the beef tacos (Carne Asada)- It was okay. Maybe overly cooked, kind of chewy.  Not memorable.  3\/5 stars.

We also tried the park tacos (Adobada)- mmm... taco heaven. Tender. They refer to it as spicy pork but it's not spicy. The taco tasted amazing. You can have pineapple on the side or on it. Same for the cilantro.  Throw some lime on it and boom ...5\/5 stars! 

We didn't try the other items. 
We highly recommend the pork tacos. Went back again just for them on Sunday sept7 evening.  The second time we went, they were cooking the pork at both stations and had to wait 10mins. This was around 6:30pm. Both evenings the line up wasn't too long. 

Negative- Most of the cooks were wearing hats. One was wearing a hair net.  It can get pretty hot and they were working hard. Lots of sweat. With the cook sweating that much on his face, it was not appealing to fear lots of the sweat dropping on to the meat as he was chopping it up.  Our cook wiped the sweat off his face twice when it looked like it was going to drip on to the food. Luckily none did. But a bit hunger killing seeing that.

Basically, there are 3 lines: 1 for carne asada, one for adobada (spicy pork, but it wasn't spicy at all) and another line for the other meats (tongue & I forgot what else).  No chicken!

YOU ORDER FIRST & THEN PAY.

The carne asada line was the longest (out the door practically), so we went for the adobada line.  I was able to order my tongue (lengua) tacos here too and 1\/2 order of campechana fries (half carne asada & half adobada).  The adobada meat was the best--not spicy at all.  Sometimes this meat, also known as ""al pastor"" is spicy or flavorless.  The fries were really good, but we got full from the tacos---reheated this the next day & it was still good (just took off the guacamole & sour cream before taking it w\/me).

It was a little over $20 for 6 tacos, 1\/2 order of fries\/ & a drink.  My husbad said that I know how to pick the best places to eat!!!  This place gives King Taco a run for their money.  I love the green salsa from King Taco & give the salsa 5 stars, but the meat from El Gordo has more flavor & the portions are larger.  Lots of Mexican people eating here, so you know it's good when a food place is packed with it's own people. The customer serivce here is superb---really friendly & helpful.

The parking lot sucks to get to and is jam packed.

There are separate lines here depending on which meat you want to eat.  Look for the signs at the front of the line.  When we came in the whole inside of this place was packed.  It was very confusing for me in the beginning, but K.O. helped me navigate through the madness.

We stood in the Adobado line and got us 2 tacos and 1 mula to share.  Remember to ask for hot sauce when you get your food.

Adobado Taco - the meat was cooked well and on a spit. When you see meat on a spit you know its going to be cooked well, charred slightly on the outside and moist in the inside.  All the trimmings were delicious and that green sauce was really creamy and helped elevate the flavors.

Adobado Mula - First time trying it and its basically 2 tortillas with meat, cheese, and other things inside.  This was delicious and wish I had found out about this sooner.

After you get your food, you have to find the cashier line and pay. When we were here the horchata tasted really watered down and not good. The orange bang on the other hand was delicious.

Seating may be hard to find, but we found one outside fairly easily.

The place could be a little cleaner and less hectic.  The inside is crammed with ppl and hard to get refills on drinks.

Then I would like to thank Mr. Gordo for perfecting the craft. Tacos el Gordo is HANDS and FEET DOWN and BY FAR the best tacos ever! If anyone knows something better, please don't hide it from me.

Spending 4 years in San Diego, I had the honor and privilege of experiencing these mouth watering tacos in Chula Vista. Now that they have location in Las Vegas too, it gives me another excuse of visit the sin city more often! 

The location located right next to Wynn and isn't too big. Sometimes it may be hard to get seats, but there's a big area outdoors where you can enjoy them standing up. Depending on the meat you're craving for, you lineup at different stations designated for different meats. Once you accumulated all the tacos, then you pay at the cashier. 

LENGUA tacos (cow tongue) are a must get here! The lengua pieces are bigger than normal, but it has just the perfect combination of chewiness that a lengua is supposed to have. You can get this in taco form or on top of fries as well. They give you two layers of tortilla, but I would recommend just eating one as it could get filling. Ihave never been so happy to French kiss a cow before! 

The pork adobada is another must have as they carve it right off the rotisserie and onto your tacos! You can even ask them to carve off some chunks of the pineapple to your taco to add the extra ZING! Please note, this station is labeled ""adobada & el pastor"" but they are the same thing! Don't be THAT person that asks for one adobada AND a pastor, it's embarrassing. I would know...

After a day spent strolling around aimlessly, it was time. Time to eat. It's been a bookmark for a while now and decided we'd make a stop this time through town. We were passing right by it - so why not?

The lines were kinda hectic, at first I wasn't sure what to make of it, but after a minute, I saw that there were about 8 lines for ordering your food; direct from the kitchen staff. Watch them cook up your order, then take it to the register to pay. Pretty simple once you realize how it works. Finding a place to sit and eat on the other hand, was a challenge. Five minutes of hovering around the tables, and a spot finally opened up - this place is packed with customers enjoying their meals.

The Carne Asada tacos were excellent, but the disappointer here were the Adobada (spicy pork) fries. Usually a fan of pulled or shredded pork dishes, the Carne Asada would have likely been the better choice to top that huge mound of (half sized) fries; I certainly am glad the lady and I didn't order the large. The pork was good, just not awesome or over the top delicious - I'll plan to stick to the Carne Asada if I stop in again.

With four tacos, a (half) order of fries, and a coke our bill came to about $15 - I dare you to try and find that anywhere else on the strip for less than $30. If you do, please let me know - I'm always down for some tasty tacos.

I'm pretty adventurous with food, so my party ordered: Carne Asada Fries, Taco de Lengua (beef tongue), Taco de Cabeza (beef head), Lengua Fries, Taco de Adobada (spicy pork), & Adobada fries.

[FOOD]
* All were really really good! The lengua was my fav, and cabeza has a bit of a gamy taste. 

* Their fries were also really good... And HUGE portions. They're apparently known for their Adobada fries, but I wasn't a fan for some reason. I preferred the other 2 fries over this.

* They also have my favorite drink: Jamaica Tea (hibiscus tea) & it's perfectly sweetened, and free refills! Score!!!

* I believe corn tortilla is the default for their tacos. I prefer flour tortilla & they're able to provide that instead... And it's a little bigger too!

* They have this green sauce they put on their fries (cilantro aioli type) and it's soo good! I asked for extra sauce to add to my tacos
 
* They provide a pretty generous amount of guacamole on their fries

[PRICE]
* Reasonable & similar to Robertos & other fast food style Mexican restaurants. Although their fries are a little more expensive ($12 for a full size, $7 for half), their portion sizes make up for it. 

[ORDERING]
* This can be a little confusing; You order first at 1 window, wait for your food, then walk over to the other side of the room to pay.

* They keep their hot sauce with the cashier. It's free, but they keep it refrigerated. I'm not sure why they don't display them together with the veggies.

[Restaurant]
* It's more fast food\/to-go style: you order, receive your food, and pay at different counters. 

* There are people cleaning the tables & removing empty containers while you're still at the tables, but no ones serving you.

* It's actually pretty clean for a restaurant on the Strip. Most fast food joints on the Strip are a bit janky. But, this isn't too bad!


It's a bummer the closest location to me is this one (on the Strip) & I wish they had one on the west side so I could eat here more often.",1,1,1

It was easy to find and everything was easy about this place. We walked in and there are menus in front of you before you walk in and when you walk in. 
Here's how you do it. You walk up to the counter, I'd go to the left counter because everyone goes to the first counter they see when they walk in (creates a cluster-f*ck). Once you see the Al Pastor (spicy pork) spinning with that chunk of pineapple on the top and bottom, your mouth should start watering. I ordered 2 carne asada (steak) tacos, hubby ordered 1 carne asada taco and one Al Pastor tostada. They put all the condiments on for you so if you are a condiment nazi (like one of my friends) make sure you ask for it on the side. I wanted it the way it came, with everything on it. As soon as you get your food take it to the cashier, order any drinks you may want, and pay. I couldn't resist the orange and pineapple bang!! As soon as we sat down I scarfed down my tacos like nothing, they were pretty good, Zeke loved the Al Pastor, it's his favorite and he said it was really good. Be sure to ask for napkins from the cashier because that is the only place you'll find them. There are no napkins to grab anywhere else, just from the cashier. Also, if you need to use the restroom you have to ask for the key from the cashier. I stood by the restroom waiting for someone to come out like a geek for a while until an employee told me to get the key. Doh! 
Anyways, if you're looking for some good street tacos to satisfy your late night munchies, to sober up, or cuz you're hungry for some... I'd say come to this place.",2,0,0

The reality is don't bother.  It is bland and doesn't do anything for the plates being served.
Adobada was a little on sweet side.  Carne Asada had a nice grilled smell and taste.  Lengua and Cabeza were spot on.  Sesos were a first for me and were quite delicious.

They have separate lines for different meats.  All the tacos are good but their best is the Al Pastor or Adobada. It's a  thinly sliced marinated pork on a rotating spit. Make sure to order plenty of tacos and ask for the green salsa and cebollitas (onions) and chiles.  I also highly recommend the Adobada quesadilla and Adobada fries which is French fries with a ton of Adobada meat. This place is heaven for any taco loving glutton. I've had tacos all over Mexico and can honestly say these are the best tacos you will find in the United States.

Whether you're a tourist, drunk late at night, a poor college student, or just simply looking for a quick and affordable meal. Actually if you're staying at a casino on Tropicana and walking is your means of transportation then.. sorry, sucks to be you, but at least you have Earl of Sandwich at the Planet Hollywood. HOWEVERRR if you're a beast and can walk 4 blocks or so in triple digit heat then you indulge yourself by all means.

Why I love Tacos El Gordo:

1. Corn tortillas that are slightly fried before you get them
2. The asada is cooked when you order it (or at least in my experiences). That deserves a high five.
3. ALL-YOU-CAN-DRINK HORCHATA for $1.40? Don't mind if I do.
4. The spicy pork shawarma (adobada) looking thing, most definitely the star of the establishment. There is a slice of pineapple sitting on top of it, leaking all of its delicious juices into the delicious spicy pork. Plus you get a slice on pineapple added to the taco. 
5. Plenty of meat is given, along with the onions, peppers, and green sauce (I'm not sure if its guacamole or not). 
6. The bathroom is CLEAN! Be honest, you know how most cheap eats don't have the cleanest bathroom.

They also have beef head (Cabeza), beef tongue (lengua), and tripe I believe. No chicken just in case you're wondering. Lastly aside from the tacos they have asada or adobada fries ($10), tortas ($4), and quesadillas ($4). All the essentials to a drunk meal.

Random note: 3 tacos @ $2.00 each plus one drink comes out to be $7.99 after tax",9,4,7

There is no questioning that the tacos here are some of the most delicious outside of Mexico and CA.

However, their ordering system and the the drunk, rude, and obnoxious patrons that they allow in here sometimes prevent El Gordo from a 5 star. If you are a big fan of different types of tacos you'll have to wait in multiple lines. The most efficient solution to that is to have one friend stand in each line and order up enough tacos for your whole group. But if you're a couple visiting Vegas and want to try everything from asada, al pastor, lengua, intestines, or brain, then good luck with that on a busy weekend night.",0,0,0

I was happy to learn about the 2 separate lines since I would be wanting both asada and adobada and thanks to Nelson Q's picture that I can add pineapple to my taco.

The seating inside this location is limited. They have 2 tent type things outside were you can eat. If my memory isn't too foggy this location used to be a taco bell when I was a teenager. The car clubs would hang out in this parking lot and drink etc. Well, the parking lot being ghetto fabulous hasn't changed a bit. Maybe more ghetto then anything. The inside was kinda chaotic. I know it is on the strip so a lot of tourists especially drunk ones are going to want some of these $2.00 crack tacos. They are addicting and delicious! I like that I can get adobada tacos on either side. They have more then one line for the same thing since they get so busy at times.

Came  here to eat tacos before heading back home to AZ. There was a long line for starters so took roughly 40  min to get the food and start eating. The MAJOR down side to this place is once u get inside the building(because the line does stretch to the outside), there are about 6 lines inside for each type if meat u want to eat. So if u want tacos de Asada and carnitas, there are 2 separate lines for that, not to mention, once u get ur food on one line, you'll have to wait approx another 10 min Or so to get ur other tacos from the other line. Then, there is another line to pay once u get ur food. The food by this time is already getting cold so you won't enjoy eating it fresh and also not to mention good luck finding somewhere to sit and eat. Best practice would be to come with several people obviously so they can all get in different lines and get your order from them. Overall, the Asada taco was a bit dry, but the Al Pastor was great. I won't be coming back to this place because it is not worth the long waiting especially if you want to get different kinds of tacos from different lines major major downside to this place.",0,0,0

So far most of what we have done has been great. We had to try Tacos El Gordo since we are mexican =). Well, I have to agree with most of the reviews. The way to order tacos is a mess. 
I can see why they do it the way they do. Sopes are made a certain way, Tacos al Pastor come from a certain grill, Lengua, cesos from a certain bash and so on..... 

With that said the lines are horrible. This place is in such high demand that they need to put up more of these in Las Vegas Strip area. We were in line for tacos about 30 minutes, and it was only one line. 
Me and my wife had 4 Suadero, 2 Cesos, 1 Lengua, and 1 Cabeza. They were DELICIOUS!. The meat was cooked to perfection.......

I cannot say the staff was at fault because all of them from the servers behind the line to the ladies cleaning tables (well... cleaning as best they could because tables were never empty more than 1 minute) were working their a$$3s off. 

I would have easily rated this 5 stars but the wait to get tacos and the wait to pay was a real inconvenience. 

TIP: as soon as you are next to order tacos and your party is more than one, send another member to the pay line to save you time. If more than two, have another save you a table!!!

When I first entered the place with my brother, I was confused when looking at the multiple lines in a busy crowd.  There were signs that labeled specifically for different meats.  For instance, one line was for lengua and tripe, another line was for asada, and another for al pastor and so forth. So if you want to get different types of meats without wasting time, it is best to bring in a group of people and have them order from different lines while you order from another line. Teamwork is crucial here.  By the way, there is a cashier line near the exit, which is separated from the rest of the multiple lines. 

I ordered 2 lengua tacos and 1 tripe taco from the same line.  I also ordered the horchata drink when I went to the cashier line but was disappointed that the horchata was watery and bland.  The tacos, however, were amazing and delicious.  I loved the texture and moisture of the lengua tacos and was intrigued to order the tripe (intestine) from someone who told me about it while I was waiting in line. I liked the texture of the tripe taco but wasn't a fan of the grimy taste.  

The tacos were affordable and service was okay at best. I ended up getting these to-go so I can meet up with my group of relatives in another place. 

Overall, I am glad that authentic tacos such as these from Tacos El Gordo exist in Las Vegas.",4,4,3

The lines are very very long(goes around the restaurant) and you can only order certain meats at each window.  For example. If you wanted a certain number of Al Pastor and a certain number of Asada tacos than you'd have to get in line at separate windows to order.  So if you and your group wanted different meats you'd have to know in advance how many of ""these"" and how many of ""those"" and how many of  ""that"" tacos in total that you want, than split up and order separately.  It's really really hectic inside so our order actually came incorrect but we just let it go since it would have taken just as long to get it fixed.  It took maybe 10 minutes standing near the window just to ask for some red sauce.  After you get your food you actually get in another line to pay, kinda like cafeteria style.  Here's the problem.  By the time you pay for your food and find a place to sit, your foods cold.  Tacos don't stay hot for long.  Again, the place is packed so there's a good chance you won't find a place to sit either.  


Again, the food is okay(albeit under seasoned) but I just don't get the hype and lines.  It wouldn't be as bad if they had a better ordering\/paying system in place.  I know I'm not the only CA native that's been here but I still see high-marks from my fellow CAlifornians.   I'm thinking this place is either the only taco place in town or because everyone's just drunk from a night on the Strip(I get that) or you're from a place where the only existing ""Taco"" is followed by a ""Bell""(or preceded by a Del, but I do love Del Taco though).

The small and unassuming taco stand is on the side of a small shopping center tucked away in a corner off the strip within sight of The Wynn. And for about 1\/10th of the price of meals on The Strip, you'll probably get your best meal on or around The Strip. The Abodaba is spicy pork that is cooked on a rotisserie like gyro meat would be, and is then sliced to order. Amazing. And if you like the jiggly pieces, they've got Beef Head, Beef Brains, Beef Tongue, Pork Stomach, and Tripe. 

Not being much for the jiggly parts - except for beef tongue, that is - I ordered the lengua, adobada, and asada.

I told her I was still waiting for my order and she said "" yes, I know but you still have to go and pay at front"" anyways, we got our carne asada fries wrong!

I didn't even looked at her but I told her that we already did, she demanded the receipt and I told her that I didn't have it because my boyfriend paid for them, and she asked me where he was!!!! So I told her, I was very uncomfortable and I didn't enjoyed my food at all. I left the place and while my boyfriend was looking for me he heard the cashier talking to the security about me! That I left without paying, until my boyfriend told her that I was with him. She didn't even apologize, she just said that is because a lot of people leave without paying.

The lengua is amazing. I don't care how you feel about eating another animal's tongue, it's delicious- especially here, and particularly in the fries. Lengua quesadilla is also tasty, but the bottom tortilla is flour and the top is a tostada... so it's a little odd. Eat it anyway.

Best tacos were the spicy pork and the beef shoulder, honorable mention to the super-crispy tripas. Ordered all as-is with the salsas and sauces. These people know what they're doing.

Now for the lengua fries- a half order will run you $6, pricey for fries. But worth it. It's a giant portion of salty, crispy fries, topped with a healthy (NOT!) portion of lengua meat, sour cream, guac, and cheese. It sounds revolting but it's amazing, and it doesn't taste as heavy as it sounds, either- which is a bad thing because I could put away a lot of this dish.

Overall, the food is great! however, the lines can be ridiculous. They have different lines for different meats. So, if you want to have different types meats for your food, you should bring a friend of two so they can each stand in a separate line to order all the meats at once.

Here is a tip for all future visitors!  Don't just have your heart set on tacos!  From my personal experience, if you get just tacos you get smaller portions of meat!  Try the other varieties as meat portions are much much more than just simple tacos!

They've got free refills on drinks!  Including Horchatas!

You want sauces to go with your meal?  Ask for it as you are paying the cashier!  He\/she's got it in a small fridge behind her!

Again, all sorts of meat options for you to choose from, and when it's real busy, they got both sides going at one time so it help speeds up the process!

To me... it's not the best tacos I've had, but the lengua was delicious!

Maybe the perfect after clubbing snack?  It's for you to find out!  Try Tacos El Gordo next time you are near!",4,1,3

Thankfully, it was right beside our hotel at Encore. It basically is the last stop before you hit crappy old town Vegas and sorry if you are a resident of old town Vegas, I mean ""crappy"" in the nicest way possible.

The line was ridiculous, it was a like a Mexican ride at Disneyland, throngs of people clamoring to get a taste of the goodness. Delicious meat-scented smoke was wafting from the interior beckoning us in.

We were lucky enough to nab a table and the line moved surprisingly quick. Simply put, get the spicy pork and lengua tacos. The carne asada was pretty wack but the aforementioned spicy pork and tongue was ahhhh-mazing. Oh and be sure to ask for the grilled onions and peppers, it really puts the experience over the top.

Whether you decide to have this before your evening of binge-drinking or after to mitigate the monstrous hangover you will surely have, I highly recommend it.",0,1,0

I've been to 4 different Gordos el taco stops now (2 in SD, 2 in Vegas). Honestly, they all taste the same to me. What never changes is the length of the line, because it's always going to feel too long especially when you've been saving your appetite just for this moment.

When you are done ordering you head over to the cashier and you pay there for your food and drink (if you get one). I loved that they had the lime and radish for you to get as much as you wanted.

The meat is on point, juicy and flavorful. The tortillas were little warm circles of deliciousness. I also got a quesadilla where they toast one tortilla and put some Oaxaca cheese in there. Weirdest quesadilla I'd ever seen but it was damn good though. 

The challenge is to get a seat really.

That, my friends, is the throng of people waiting to get their hands on some authentic Mexican tacos. Tacos El Gordo doesn't have much competition in the area so it is natural to see hordes of people crowding their 3 Vegas locations.

TIP: There are separate lines for tacos. There is normally someone standing at the door to direct people to the appropriate lines but if you're like me and tend to order the unique meats e.g. Cabezza, Buche, Lengua, make sure to go inside and go to the line on the furthest right (closest to the bathroom). It's always the shorter line. If you're looking to order a bit of everything, those lines will typically be the longest. There are also 2 lines if you're looking to order the Adobada, which is El Gordo's version of the al pastor. 

Their meats are some of the most tender I've ever had but when it lacks flavor, you're just eating flavorless chewy meat. I had to pack on the onions and sauces to give it some life. They're supposed to be known for the Adobada but I found it to lack any sort of spice. They top it off with a small slice of pineapple but I was looking more for spice than sweet. 

Cabeza -- Probably my favorite which I'd probably stick to if I come back. Tender juicy cuts of beef head with a distinct smokiness that gives it just enough flavor. Of course, I still had to pack on the hot sauce and onions to give it some fire and texture. 

Stop by at this foodie attraction when you're in town. If you're going with a group of people (which is probably the best strategy), come up with a game plan so you can get by with the least amount of time wasted.

I wrote a review for the one in SD and this one is just as good as might even be better because of their excellent service. The service was super friendly and always had a smile on. I was really REALLY impressed with the way they treated us. 

I personally recommend Adobado because it is simply the best. Watching the guy knife off from the pork that is spinning and then grilling it on the grill until there is some crisp to it with their own made tortilla(which is awesome) and their home made guacomole sauce is simply AMAZING. I'm not even exaggerating how amazing it is but if you're not too into pork then....

I really love their Cabeza(which I tried to go to other places) and other places really suck and I thought it was disgusting. Simply they make the best cabeza which I never thought I would like, but it is just so good and drolling here. OF course, the other thing I absolutely love is Lengua. I don't think I had any lengua from other tacos joints to be this good. I just feel like you have the 3 choices which you simply can't forget to get and it's just so amazing.

I'm simply drooling from thinking about it right now but I'm just so far away. Oh El Gordo how i miss you so.

=========
LOCATION
=========

It's located at ""the edge"" of the heart of the Vegas strip in my opinion. I consider everything from like Excalibur to the end of Wynn the HEART of the strip. Sure you've got the Stratosphere etc. if you go down farther but with Sahara being remodeled, there's a deadspot past the Wynn.

Anyway this place is RIGHT past the Wynn\/Encore, on the Strip, headlining a little mini-mall. Seating is limited inside, BRUTAL due to the Vegas summer heat... and there's a ton of seating outside. Unfortunately the inside is pretty small and the lines tend to make things chaotic.

Also adding to the chaos is there's 2 separate PAY AREAS inside, both on opposite ends of the place. They hand you the food cafeteria style BEFORE you pay, which is cool. What I hated was there's 4 stations and depending on WHAT TYPE of taco you want you have to go to the different stations\/lines. One for Abogado (spicy pork), one for Carne Asada and Chorizo. Finally a third one for all other things (tongue, shoulder, brain).


=========
THE FOOD
=========

~ CARNE ASADA TACO - The steak was seasoned amazingly. It came with an avocado mash and some other great toppings. (5\/5)

~ ADOBADA (spicy pork) TACO - This was interesting. The meat looked delicious, nice seductive red glaze to the meat. It was pretty good, not amazing. However the green avocado sauce they put on it bumped it up a bit. I recommend adding that sauce on ALL your tacos. (4\/5)

http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=oCNAyy80KNhlFskH_cio4A&userid=1pgT-Eeh-GIOlhOgHMMRZA


~ MULAS - I ""think"" this was a giant taco with an additional tortilla atop it. (4\/5)

~ CHORIZO TACO - It was pretty good as well. Torn between giving it a 3 or a 4. They chop up the tasty looking sausage in front of you... and the grounded meat streams out. (3\/5)

~ QUESADILLAS - These aren't your normal ""quesadillas."" They are a large taco w\/some cheese burned into the tortilla, filled with meat \/ toppings with a HARD-AS-ROCK CRACKER thing put atop kind've like a hat. It's really terrible. (1\/5)


=========
AND SO.....
=========

It was a good spot. 
Definitely a good place to go if you're balling on a budget. Can't beat $2.00 tacos and $4.00 MEAT quesadillas. I think there was a lot of locals here. I'm curious what the VAMPIRO was. My friend MIGUEL Z. thought these were the best tacos he'd ever had. 

As a tip, ask the person who makes your food for some peppers... they're free and they'll only give em out if you ask. You get a big plate of like 3-4 types of grilled peppers and grilled onions.

I will be back...",3,2,2

They have their lines divided, starting from left to right: adobado\/pastor meat, asada was the next line (they longest waiting line), then all other meat: tripa, tongue. After getting your food, you have to walk to the cashier table near the exit to pay for your food and then sit down. This place is very busy and gets really pack so seats are minimal for big groups. My group and I was lucky to find enough seats for 10ppl. Service was ok, food was flavorful and tasty. Also they had fountain drinks available and I thought their horchata was freshly made thinking that this is from Tijuana Mexico, but it was not so this was the only disappointment. In addition, their quesadilla is NOT like the American quesadilla so don't expect it that way- its more like a large taco. Overall, this was a great experience and good was great with lots of meat!

First of all, it's ABSOLUTELY STUPID to order first and pay after. You get your food, you have to wait in ANOTHER line AGAIN to pay. They count the food on the plate and give you the total. By the time you pay, the food is already COLD.

Who in their right mind thinks ordering, then paying while your food gets cold is a good idea?!

Not to mention that there's too many lines and it's just.. ugh, completely ridiculous and this place needs some serious organization. 

Food was alright. It was good, but nothing to go crazy for, really. 

Not sure if I'll stop by again in the future.",0,0,0

 First of all the wait was ridiculous. Having to wait in each separate line for a meat is just crazy..who wants to wait in one line for over 30 minutes to get one type of taco and then go wait in another line for a different meat taco..no one! It was extremely hot and felt like no air conditioning was being ran. Service was terrible and very very slow. My wife and I were thinking if the line is so long it must be good..we couldn't have been more wrong. Tacos were soggy, meat was fatty (al pastor\/adobago) and overly seasoned and I usually like al pastor back home. I honestly have made better tacos at home and I'm far from Mexican. Having to wait in a huge line to get the tacos and then wait in another line to buy a drink and pay is not efficient. 

Very little amount of tables and people were rude stealing tables\/chairs from other people who waited in line. I felt like I was in prison having to sweat and fight for a table and protect it from getting stolen when my wife went to get a drink. With the amount of customers they should have an attendant to making sure tables were cleaned and given to the next paying customer. 

This place was the worst place my wife and I have eaten at in vegas and disappointing considering Yelp has rarely if ever lead me astray. You couldn't pay us to go back. Do yourself a favor and avoid this joint at all cost. Maybe it's better if there was no line, but in reading reviews that'd doesn't happen often.",4,0,0

Anyone who could compare this to Taco Bell is either loco or was born without taste buds. This is literally better than anything I ate at Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal, and for a fraction of the cost (and, tbh, ambiance).

Now I'm not that knowledgeable about Mexican food, and it's not one of my top 5 favorite cuisines. That said, this is the one of the few places I ever actively want to go for Mexican. In fact, I hardly eat tacos anywhere else anymore, just to save up my taco stomach for whenever we come to Vegas. (My other favorites we go to far less frequently, as they're in Santa Barbara and New Paltz, NY.) I also appreciate that this is one of the few more authentic places that offer flour tortillas to gringas like me.

My favorite tacos here are the lengua (tongue), cabeza (face\/cheek), buche (pork), and al pastor with raw onions and no cilantro. I can't rank them in finer detail than that -- my favorite is whichever one is currently in my mouth (phrasing)! They each come with a different sauce they put on for you, and all of them are distinct and delicious.

I also like the queso asada with salsa and guacamole, though the asada is a bit too salty for my tastes (the salsa and guac balances out the salt a bit). I usually don't get this.

The vampiro is not for me because it's made with corn tortillas, but lucky for me the queso asada has all the same fillings. Normally I like brain (give me a Midwestern brain sandwich or Indian lamb brain curry any day) but the sesos taste kinda off to me here.

Fries (campechana fries $13; lengua fries - full order $15, half order $7.50) aren't anything special, but are huge and great for sharing.

I haven't tried the quesadillas ($4.50 with any meat except lengua or $4.75 with lengua), sopes ($4.50 with any meat except lengua or $4.75 with lengua), tostadas ($2.25 with any meat except lengua or $2.40 with lengua), or mulas ($4.50 with any meat except lengua or $4.75 with lengua).

My husband likes that you can get pretty much whole raw radishes at the condiment bar.

Drinks are the self-serve fountain variety, mostly Coke brand. I'm not a huge fan of horchata but it's of note that they have lots of flavors you don't see everywhere.

Others have explained the multi-line system so I won't go into detail, only to echo that when it's busy (in other words all the time), having to get in line multiple times to order different food and then pay for it causes your food to end up lukewarm by the time you get to eat it. My trick is to order only 2 tacos at a time, from only 1 window at a time, get into the pay line, sit and eat, and then get back up and go to the next window you wanted and repeat the process. Then simply lather, rinse, and repeat until full (5-6 trips for the two of us, but we're total pigs - YMMV). Keep in mind though that the traditional-sized tortillas used here are on the small side - no Taco Bell size tortillas here that fill you up with the carby part, and they don't put 2-3 tortillas per taco like they do at taco trucks.

Ordering them a few at a time gets you way too many napkins. We try to be considerate and stack up the clean ones and put them back so we don't waste too many.

The only downsides are the crazy multi-line ordering system, and they don't have tortas or corn smut.",0,0,0

It was more colored pink as an illusion to spicyness I guess. Kinda bland in flavor. Im starting to think that this place isnt as good as my friends said.

Its the Pork Taco so I thought. It was fatty, smelt weird and had greyish chunks in it. the texture looked like some kind of sea creature. I asked an employee is this pork? Not pork tonuge or kidney or some strange animal part, just is this PORK? She said yes. I took a piece of the so called pork and took a small bite. THATS NOT PORK!!

The lines when we got there on Sunday at 1 was crazy but by the time we got our food and finished eating at 2:15 the line was just at the door. 

The restaurant has a interesting setup in that different lines serve only certain types of meat.  So the spicy pork is in a different line from the carne asada.  The tacos are typical small sized and most guys in our group had about 6-7 and I had 9. 

My Favs:
Spicy Pork
Lengua - tender but still has that tongue texture

Decent:
Carne Asada - a bit dry and not as much flavor
Cabeza - slightly on the fatty side imo
Tripe
Suadero - too salty

Didn't like:
Pork Shoulder - I thought it was too salty and the meat was dry

Went here around 9:30pm on a Thursday night and it was effing packed.  I knew it was a good sign when I saw a ton of Mexicans and a security guard packing a real gun.  Tacos are serious business!

I ordered 3 tacos.  I got the Adobada (spicy pork), lengua (tongue) and carne asada tacos.  All 3 tacos were very good, though I was probably the most disappointed with the adobada.  It wasn't that it wasn't good, but there just wasn't a lot of meat in the taco.  The meat that was in there was good, but that particular taco looked a little sad.  I did enjoy the free guac topping on the carne asada taco.  The lengua was cooked very well done and I thoroughly enjoyed that taco as well.  

All in all, I'd give this place a solid 4.5 stars.  If there was more adobada in my taco I would definitely give this place 5 stars.  It could've just been bad luck with that particular taco.

It's not far from the main part of the strip, just a few minutes past the Wynn in this janky strip mall area, but you can't miss it since there is a big sign at the front of the building.  

You walk in and order right from the guy making your taco\/burrito\/nachos\/fries\/meat, and you can watch them making everything fresh.  I was especially excited that they were pressing and cooking their own tortillas on the grill right in front of me.  The way they cook their meat reminded me of a churrascaria, including the pineapple heads on the ends.  You could see the juice dripping allllll the way down the meat as it cooked on the spit...oh man. *drool*

There are at least two in Las Vegas, and god knows how many elsewhere. The one on the Strip is on the same side of the street as Wynn and Encore, and a little further north.

***The Menu***
You can order quesadillas, tostadas and such, but most of the menu is tacos: taco de asada (steak), adobada (spicy pork), tripa (tripe) and a host of others. Tacos are small (around 3 to 4 inches in diameter), with a heaping tablespoonful of meat, cilantro and other spices in the center. Two tacos make for a modest lunch; four would be a hearty dinner.

***The Atmosphere***
Pretty much like any other fast food restaurant. There are a few tables inside, and many more outside.

***My Meal***
I've only eaten one lunch here, so I can't comment on much of the menu. However, I am hopeful. I tried two tacos: taco de cabeza (beef head); taco de buche (pork stomach). The taco de cabeza wasn't as unusual as it sounds. In taste and texture it was pretty much like minced steak. I liked it, and think it would please most people. The taco de buche was by far my favorite: lots of flavor and good texture. To wash it down, I had a bright red, strawberry soda.

***Summary***
After one meal, I want to go back. The tortillas are good, the fillings are good, and there are lots more to try.

***The Bill***
The meal was $5.72, for two tacos, a soda, and tax.",1,0,0

But my BF got the spicy pork tacos and he said they were the best tacos he's ever had. This place is authentic and the long lines and people show that it is really good. He gives 5 stars for that.

However, one has to ask whether it's worth the 50+ minute wait. The lines bring down the rating from 5 stars to 3 stars. The queuing system was really confusing. As others have mentioned, there are separate lines for everything. There are six lines, two sets of three lines. The three lines are for pork (abodaba), offal (brains, tongue, stomach, tripe, intestines, etc), and beef (asada, etc). The line didn't actually look that long so it was ridiculous how it took so long. 

As we got closer, we found out why. It's because there was one guy doing the job of two people. He makes the tacos really fast but he would have to make like at least 5 for each customer. Also, he made like 50+ tacos while we were in line that looked like it was for to-go orders (paper plates wrapped in foil). So the amount of time per person and the amount of extra work the taco maker is doing for people not in line contributes to long wait times.

The tacos were decent, but not great, and certainly not worth a 30 minute wait, let alone an hour! Each kind of taco has its own line, so if you want different meats and are by yourself, you're screwed, or even if you have 1 other person with you and want several different meats, you're still screwed.

Also, they put guacamole on the tacos, which drowns out the taste of the tacos. I've been to Mexico many times and they don't do that there. California also has a large Mexican population and they don't do that at most places. Some places put chunks of avocados, but not guacamole.

Maybe these are 4 or 5 star tacos for Nevada, but these are jus average for me. In the SF Bay area tacos are much better, as we are highly populated with Mexican immigrants who make good tacos.",0,0,0

Typically $2 tacos for a variety of meats: cabeza, lengua, adobada, and many more incarnations. Sad thing is I've waited so long to have amazing, real tacos until I've been introduced. Been here many times since then. 

WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN YOU'RE A TACOS EL GORDO VIRGIN\/TOURIST: Standing around awkwardly trying to figure out where to order. 

HOW TO ORDER: It's simple: one line for all other meat (cabeza, lengua etc.). One line for adobada (at least at this location). I believe they have more lines open to order, but I've come here a few times when it was just two lines. To those griping about the format of the lines, get over it. It's understandable that you want instant gratification and to get all your tacos at once, but the food comes out quick enough. If anything it's a bit more efficient. 

If you come with at least one other person (and chances are you're here with someone else) here's an idea: have one person stay in one line for a type of taco, and another person in another line waiting for the other tacos. Simple. Meet up at the register to pay for your tray. For $2 tacos and this delicious AND on the STRIP (lots of overpriced food places on the strip), it's not all that bad. You're free to try swankier places on the strip if you're that peeved. 

PERFECT FOR: Drunk people! Tipsy people! People-watchers! Night owls! Broke people! You might get a heart-attack if you ate here everyday, but you cannot beat the prices and the prime location. It does get super busy, but luckily, it's got late-night hours for that after-club\/after-party bite. 

FOOD: The adobada tacos are deliciously marinated. It's fun watch it turn spit-style on a pineapple as it's being sliced for you. Flavorful, fattening, quick, and cheap. They don't skimp on the tacos either. Loaded with marinated meat, lettuce, tomatoes..my mouth is watering just remembering it. 

Carne asada fries are disappointing, yet still tasty for me. Crackly, torn adobada instead of soft mixed with guacamole and green sauce loaded (key word: LOADED) with cheese, sour cream, and fries. Nothing too special, but very filling and good for sharing. Wished it had more guacamole and green sauce. Might be a miss for some people. 

VERDICT: For the price you can't beat it. For the flavor, it's some of the best tacos in town. Overrated? Yeah. Best tacos ever? No, but it's better than Roberto's or a taco bell. This place has performed consistently for me that it's always perfectly moist, flavorful, rich meat. For others, the rush hour and lines might throw some off. Not a bad place for tourists and locals alike to try out for late night eats.",10,9,5

We didn't want to spend $50+ on overpriced, average food (if you haven't noticed the prices on food in restaurants in Vegas has gotten outrageous).   So I checked out yelp for some good cheap eats. Tacos El Gordo pops up as the #1 or #2 spot. We decide what the hell, let's go check it out. 

Verdict: not only is their Adobada pork taco the best taco I've ever had, their Adobada pork sope was even more ridiculous. Look, i eat Mexican a lot. My wife is Mexican and I know authentic Mexican food. This place shits on every taco you've ever had. It's that good. The carne asada was above average but in hindsight I wish I would have skipped it and gotten more Adobada tacos or sopes. If you don't know what a sope is, try one. It's basically a soft, fat corn tortilla. It's like a gordita (and no, not like a taco bell gordita; those don't remotely resemble a real gordita). 

If you want to eat for under $25 for two, eat the best taco or sope you'll ever have, and impress your friends with some real local knowledge... Eat at Tacos El Gordo. And after you eat and hit the casinos\/clubs and you're sloppy drunk, go back and eat more. That's what I did. If there were one of these where I live I'd eat there 365 days a year and that's no bullshit. It's that good people. I think the meat is roasted by a crack pipe. It's seriously addicting.  I would consider giving up sex and becoming a priest to eat it daily.  If I were on death row I'd ask for Tacos El Gordo for my last meal.

I was on the strip over the weekend and figured it was the perfect time. When I walked in I was completely overwhelmed with the various lines of people waiting for tacos. It took me a few minutes of looking around to figure out that there were separate lines for different cuts of meat and that there were 2 counters on either side of the restaurant with the same lines and menu. You're supposed to order your food at the counters and then pay for it at either of the 2 register areas at the front (1 by each door).

After looking at the menu for quite some time I decided to go with 2 al pastor tacos, because you can't go wrong with those, and 1 tripa or tripe taco. The al pastor was tasty, well seasoned and cooked, which made me glad that I got more than 1. The tripa was ok, not what I thought it was and it had an interesting taste to it that I wasn't used to. I also wanted to try the asada fries or adobada fries but will wait until next time because I'm sure it's a humongous portion judging by the price.

Not sure why they have separate lines because the guy that was serving the al pastor told me that I could order everything at 1 station when he saw me standing in another line after getting my tacos from him. How nice of him for worrying about my tacos getting cold while standing in line :)

Seating is difficult if you come during lunch, just don't forget about the outside seating like I did. It was hard to find a spot that wasn't dirty or taken so had to sit at the table by the bathroom. Needless to say, I ate my tacos and was out of there!",3,3,3

Late night on the strip, after a long day of walking, partying, and gambling, this place hits the spot like no other. 

The variety of meats are great, more than the typical carne asada or carnitas option. Suadero, tripas, or buche are something worth trying along with cabeza and  lengua.  

Due to the variety, there are 3 lines to choose from and during peak times, which is all the time I've gone with a line out the door and a security guard controlling entry due to fire code, you cannot order from another line without getting in it at the end. Meaning, if I order adobada and want asada I have to get in that line then get in the suadero line if I feel like trying those, in the meantime and 45 min later my tray with tacos is getting cold. 

The 3 lines are the carne asada & chorizo line, the adobada line, and the everything else or sweetbread line.  The security guard is also well versed on all the meat options and she will point you in the right direction. 

My gripe is that due to the same variety, the system of ordering from possibly 3 different lines then paying at a different line before you sit and eat is archaic. With so many people crowding to order and being limited to order from a single variety is not a good business model. It's a simple fix from my p.o.v. - order and pay at a counter, then pick up when ready. Or, do the Subway\/Chipotle\/Pieology method and just move on down the line and order any cut of meat you'd like and skip the ones you don't. There just has to be a better way is all I'm saying and with that many people paying, the resources should be there to give the customers better service. 

I try and get here every time I come to Vegas, and I'm sure under normal circumstances you would be able to order anything you'd like. But since this place is so good and so crowded, ordering from the 3 lines of meats is not practical, hampering the experience.",0,0,0

As someone who hasn't tried their SD location, I relied heavily on my friends who have. We waited around 40min in line for the food. 

It's a bit confusing in the beginning because the line out is singular, but once you step inside, you'll only be able to wait in ""meat-specific"" lines. For example, a line for lengua & cabeza, a line for asada, and a line for el pastor. I think you're able to request a different meat in line, but it just makes waiting longer for you and everyone else in line.

Theyre pretty quick once you place your order because they only work on one order at a time. After you get your food, you'll have to pay for it and then go find a table. 

My friends told me that this location was pretty salty and not as great as SD. You gotta factor in that this is Vegas and the lines get really long in the evenings so that might be the contributing factor for long lines, and bulk production of food (over-seasoning).

The food is good but not worth the insane wait. However, it IS a great addition to cheaper alternative food options in vegas besides china town. Both the adobada and carne asada are good. The adobada line is much shorter and had died down even while we were waiting for carne asada. We coulda stood in the adobada line 3 times in the time it took to even get a carne asada taco. My suggestion if you dont have time you can totally skip the carne asada and just get adobada.

I got a carne asada Mula, which is like a quesadilla cept its not sealed in? You can also think of it as a taco sandwich if one taco is an open-faced sandwich with one slice of bread then the mula is like having two slices of bread and more cheese in between.

 Right now they have two lines for carne asada and two lines for adobada. Due to the popularity of carne asada, they should totally just have 3 lines for that and 1 line for adobada.",0,0,0

""I dragged my 60 year old mother in our rental car from the Strip to eat here one afternoon. She kept saying things like, ""Adrienne, are you SURE it's THIS FAR??"" I just knew it was going to be THAT good. You can't imagine how delicious the adobada was when we ate tourist food for 3 days.""

So at the 3rd location I tried, I was confident they would be amazing. And the were, no doubt. Most of the customers in line were spanish-speaking and locals, so I took this as a good sign Consistent products state to state keep customer's from coming back right? The adobada here was juicy, flavorful and filled with pineapple and tangy salsa. My friend had a veggie quesadilla and ""veggie tacos"" which were kind of an odd assortment of toppings wrap up in tortillas...but still good and decent enough to eat. 

I'm sure the chaotic nature of the ordering has been hashed out a million times over in the other reviews, but be warned- stand in line in front of what you want to eat.

Seriously, what I did was practically a crime against humanity.  Because as I mentioned in that review, you're not going to get better tacos anywhere other than Mexico itself.  So when I realized the Gordo opened in Vegas...of course I didn't bother going here either until now LOL.  Yeah, I should just quit on life.

Same deal as the original.  Different meats at different stations, line up and go get some.  If you come here and don't get the adobada, you might as well just get back in your car and drive away.  This adobada is easily some of the best in the world and is the #1 reason to even come here.  Carne asada was just ok in my book, but at least it was prepared with the proper ingredients (aka HELLA GUACAMOLE), so it gets a passing grade in my book.

And since I figured I needed to make up for not coming here who knows how many times, I came for the tacos before going to XS and came for the super fries after going to XS.  Because quite frankly, nothing beats drunk food like drunk Mexican food.  And nothing beats drunk Mexican food like super fries topped with carne asada, adobada, cheese, and guacamole!

Came on a Saturday and there's a line out the door, which is fine I understand it has a lot of popularity. They have this system where they have about 4 lines. Each consisted of the different types of meats depending on what you wanted. You got your most popular which is asada, al pastor and others which include cabeza, tripas, Lengua, etc. 
don't really understand this I think it creates a lot of confusion and with not let you get the food you really want. Example, if I want asada and al pastor I have to get in line twice!  So aside from waiting 45 minutes in line to even get inside of the establishment, I have to wait another 30 minutes before I even order my asada tacos, then move over to the next line to get my al pastor which would be at least another 15 minutes. 

Why not create another system where it is easy to order and get all of the tacos you desire instead of waiting an hour and half to get your food?

The tacos are the perfect size and usually 2-3 at 2 bucks a pop will do the trick.  I recommend getting into the shorter line of the two since you can still place one order. To receive both.

You may or may not pass it the first time but once you pass Wynn, and the little overpass (desert inn), there is a parking lot that leads to a Church . You can either park here (before Tacos el Gordo) or park in the lot after passing the restaurant. The restaurant itself faces Las Vegas Blvd, so not hard to spot it if you are looking for it.

Unlike the Charleston location, this location also has outdoor seating. Something different from the other location as well, they have double the amount of lines, but as you can probably guess.... this location can be MUCH MUCH busier. But if you want tongue\/stomach, i think there is only ONE line for that (far right off to the side). 

First time i came here, mid day, not really busy at all. Later few times, were in the evening, SUPER PACKED ! ! You'd think there was some sale or something ! 

Some people say the quality of their stuff is less than of the Charleston location. Meat quality, i think is the same. If you were to order fries, i've had varying experiences with that. Sometimes fresh out of the fryer, sometimes not. 

My favorites to get is beef tongue, pork stomach. Super flavorful and something you usually dont get at your chain store Taco Bell (rarely go fast food anyway, esp not Taco Bell)

Good idea, if you are going with other people... is if you want different meats, have each person be in different lines and get the order. Otherwise, you'll be in line for a long long time... 

Surprisingly, even the outdoor seating, there is always someone cleaning up. Great service ! Not like that was something i was looking for anyway, but it was a plus ! A lot of times, while sitting there after eating, and just talking, they'd come up and help us take our trays and trash away.

got 3 x carne asada and 3 x adobaba tacos. hecka good!! felt like i was in sf or san jose. i think the alibabas were better than the carne asadas

a plus: didn't feel any gassiness or stomach upset-ness later at the club like i sometimes do from taquerias, phew

Order from the station that is serving what you want, there are several stations and there is some overlap of what you can get from each one.  The guy who greeted us who was working behind the counter was really helpful.  He was also patient, b\/c it took us a while to figure things out and to order.  Lucky for us there was no line (we also lucked out with parking).

We ate here sober fyi, I can only imagine that this place would be even better if you were drunk.

I really like the tortillas and the sauce and you can ask for grilled green onions and peppers for free.

Also if you want to be fancy and also enjoy your taco more, ask for some pineapple on top.  It is such a tasty bonus!

The dining area was clean and they did a great job wiping down tables, taking trays etc.  They had a good system going.  They also had a bathroom and the sink was outside the bathroom which was helpful.  After eating, I had to wash my hands and was glad I didn't have to wait in line for the bathroom just to do that.

We ordered asada tacos and my cousin ordered the al pastor and lengua. The asada tacos were soo good and the toppings that they put really just top it off.

2. Buche tacos - pork stomach that has been simmered for HOURS until tender and highly seasoned. 

3. Spicy pork taco - cut right off the spit fresh for you.They also add grilled pineapple at your request. Excellent

4. Tongue taco - seasoned and tender.

Stumbling down the boulevard, you squint and make out a sign over a busy store front. Tacos El Gordo appears. It's chaos inside with a security guard out front. Hmm, why do they need a uniformed security guard for the entrance? Which line do you get in? No one's saying where to go and the alcohol causes some indecision. You read a sign for the adobada (al pastor) line. Lucky choice but you've been winning at blackjack lately and your streak continues with food. While waiting in line, you ponder what the old mafiosos would think about their little playground in the desert, if they saw and smelled the tasty meats.

The price is right for the little flavorful tacos. If it were Mexico, they'd be super cheap, like $0.50, but it's Vegas at 3am. There are different lines for different taco meats. Adobada  (al pastor) tacos and fries are the best. I tried the others (asada, cabeza, chorizo, buche, sesos, tripa, and lengua). All are good. But the adobada stands out. They slice off pieces of seasoned goodness, like those middle eastern shish kabob\/gyro places, into a couple of small steamed corn tortilla soft shells. The tacos are around $2.20 a piece. They are about 3 savory bites full and well worth the money, considering I was staying at the Palazzo, $25 minimum for something decent to eat at this time of night at the Grand Luxe Cafe (also very good). The setup inside is strange and a bit of an honor system for payment. It's cheap, busy, tasty, and a great value with guacamole and salsa. Grab it to go. It's great to prevent a hangover.

There's about half a dozen different meat stations, which you line up at and order, then you pay at the register.

The Adobada (Spicy Pork) was so good that as soon as I finished, I lined up  and ordered some more.  At the Adobada station, you'll see stacks and stacks of marinated spicy pork roastin on a spit, with a pineapple at the top.  The pork is shaved off the spit to order 

My next favorite was the Suadero (Beef Shoulder), which you'll find at the station with the big pot of beef stewing away.  This results in fall apart tender chunks of beef, packed with flavor.

I don't know why but somehow I seem to always find myself coming here once in awhile; people do flock over to this location because its on the Strip.  Go to the Charleston location if it's busy here it's not that far away.  Honestly I like their food only when I'm either drunk or recovering  but I could probably get the same effect from a Roberto's which is probably more convenient. Any other time I just can't enjoy them.

When it's slow, which is when they're usually still busy but manageable, you can find a parking spot easily, you walk into the building, open the door and shut the door, you wait in a decent line, and you can enjoy your meal maybe on a table inside or outside.  However when it's busy, mainly weekend, forget about coming here, unless you're willing to wait. The line usually spills out the door and it's hard to find a seat.  You'll likely find yourself joining others eating their food on the curb or at your car. 

Food-wise it's alright 3 star maybe 3.5 tops which isn't that bad.  You probably heard about their carne asada and adobada fries, and their various street tacos they are a must if you never had it but personally I don't think they have enough flavor to my liking and seemed a little pricey, especially for the fries. I think I only liked them the first time I've had street tacos.  It kind of has phased out of my system, I do prefer a few other businesses more. 

Overall they are probably a 2 star maybe 3  mainly because of the inconvenience and madness that goes on. Yea it's busy because a lot of people want them but they could do something better to manage the crowd besides making the food faster, I don't know maybe it's just me being picky but definitely not a fan of the atmosphere. You can say it lacks good customer service but they do make things fast.

Most recently I brought some out of state family here it lasted only a few mins. We ended up going to a pretty good regular Mexican restaurant where it was fast, excellent customer service, served good food, and accomedating for a large group wiith kids, Taco Bell joking.",2,1,1

These tacos are so good, fresh, and cheap...max value for $2 each! You can definitely leave here full and satisfied for under $10. 

I've had the Spicy Pork and Steak Tacos. The fries are awesome as well. 

TIP: Make sure you ask for the freshly cut pineapple if you get Spicy Pork! 

The chefs are pretty friendly as well. I love that you can watch them cut the meat from the rack and prepare your order. 

I even overheard some guy at the Bellagio say ""Tacos El Gordo."" The word is out. Just about everyone will love this place!

You can make about anything with the different types of meat. I tried the Carne Asada fries, carne asada taco, mula con adobado, tongue mula and adobado fries.

Probably my most BIG GIRL night in a long time. 

They also speak Spanish to you like you know Spanish. So brush up on your Spanish or get lost in translation. Drinks are $1.40 and there's only one size...BUT you get unlimited Ole drinks (mmmmz Orange Bang....). Indoor seating is scarce because they get filled up so quickly.

To order you have to queue in different lines according to which tacos you want: one line for spicy pork, one for tongue, etc. and then bring your tray to the cash, pay and hope for a table to be available (or take your order to go). 
Crowded at all hours so be patient! no alcoholic beverages, just sodas and ""aguas frescas"" (horchata is my favorite).

The set up at this facility is different from other Taco Restaurants. The customers get in the 1st lines (depending on what type of meat you want for your tacos) order and pick up the food, then get in a different line if you want another type of meat and so on for the 3rd group of meats. Basically Asada and chorizo cooked on a fire grill is one line, Asada and adobada, and tripas another line, and the meats cooked and kept hot with steam like lengua, cabeza, buche is at a 3rd line.

This is the perfect meal for any occasion even after a night of drinking. We also ordered their orchata which was very refreshing. Perfect touch of cinnamon and not too heavy.

After a loooong night at XS,  we were too hungry to even think about sleep.  Generally, we'd hit up Earl's, Grand Lux, Ellis Island, or any other 24\/7 places around the strip.  This time around, a friend from UNLV told us we gotta try this tacos place out.  There was no way I could've refused since tacos are one of my favorites and we figured... gotta trust the locals!

After a short drive, and it really is a short drive from Wynn properties, we were there and it was still packed at 5am.  Two lines, one for adobado and one for everything else.  The reason there's a line for the adobado is that the spicy pork is cooked on a vertical rotating spit, just like how it would be in Mexico!  The pork is shaved directly onto fresh warm tortilla, then they add all the toppings for the tacos: lime green cream sauce, salsa, onions & cilantro.

The spicy pork has a ton of flavor and the cream sauce just works so well with the salsa and the pork.  Oh!  Also, if you look closely you'll see a chunk of pineapple at the top of the vertical spit.  You can actually request to have pina in your taco!  Definitely wouldn't have known if it wasn't for our friend and that sweet warm pineapple in the taco was definitely what makes this taco one of the best I've ever had! 

We also shared some carne asada fries.  I've lived in San Diego for a few years and I have yet to find carne asada fries comparable to the ones I've had in SD.  Tacos El Gordo's fries do come close though!  Fries are covered with carne asada, shredded cheese, and the same lime green sauce with a few dollops of guac!  Heavy, yes, but very much needed after 6+ hours at XS :P

You have to scramble to get a seat anywhere, and you will be sitting next to strangers. You pay after you get your order but before you eat. They do take credit cards. The people at the register will give you free hot sauce if you ask for it. Now to the important stuff, the tacos. They're small, street taco size, so get 3-5 per person depending on your appetite. They're served on two thin corn tortillas which do not taste freshly made unfortunately. I only tasted the al pastor tacos (spicy pork). The meat was ok, a bit on the dry side perhaps, depending on where it was cut from. They're dressed with cilantro, onions, salsa and a light green sauce (not sure if it was avocado based). They'll add pineapple if you ask for it. Overall, it was an interesting experience but I wouldn't say they're the best tacos I've had.",0,0,0

- because when with Mexicans, we go Mexican

THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE):
- you know it's real when the line be poppin' and stretching well through the front entrance
- gated outdoor seating

THE LOOK (FROM THE INSIDE):
- beyond the multiple lines there is indoor seating to the right

THE MENU:
- tacos
- vampiro
- quesadillas
- sopes
- tostadas
- mulas
- [insert meat choice here] fries
- drinks
- meat choices: cabeza (beef head), lengua (beef tongue), tripa (tripe; stomach\/intestines), suadero (thin cut of beef from the intermediate part of the cow between the belly and the leg), sesos (beef), buche (pork cheek), carne asada (grilled beef), chorizo, adobada (spicy marinated pork), al pastor (pork); NOTE THERE IS NO POLLO (CHICKEN) OPTIONS SERVED HERE

WHAT WE ORDER:
- tacos (adobada, al pastor, asada, buche, cabeza, lengua, tripa)
- fries (lengua)
- horchata (cinnamon rice water; liquid Cinnamon Toast Crunch for those unfamiliar with this)

HOW IT WORKS:
- depending on the menu item\/meat choice you're going for, you have to go into separate lines accordingly; if you're in a group and you're smart about it just have different people in your group go into the different lines and then Venmo amount owed to one another
- after ordering your food, your food is given to you on the spot, and then you go to ANOTHER line in the far right corner in between the indoor seating and the outdoor seating to the cash register to pay for your food
NOTE: yes of course the workers here speak English, but I personally feel if you're with a Spanish speaker, AND you're nice, then the workers will try their best to help you get the other meat choices you're trying to order without having to go in the separate lines

THE TASTE:
- LENGUA IS MY LIFE! especially when it's made WELL; when we go here we usually will get lengua fries (because carne asada fries are basic) and lengua tacos
- I'm a BIG fan of their tacos here, but I will have to say that generally speaking I'm just not a fan of cabeza or buche, but hey, at least I can say I've tried it

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
- the servers have always been pretty efficient and super nice
- security guard(s) onsite are nice too, unlike bouncers at clubs sometimes
- the cashiers can be pretty curt, but that's OK",4,3,2

I was in Vegas solo this time around, so I took a buddy out to taste this place, as he as a local had never been. I ordered 11 Adobada tacos and that alone LOL. 6 for me, 5 for my buddy. The line took forever and a half to get to the front, but was well worth it. TIP: If you speak Spanish, the folks that make your tacos at the front of the line, can be nicely asked if they don't mind getting you some tacos from another line, so you don't have to make line for a different meat. Had to get some to-go tacos for another friend who wasn't able to meet up with us to dine, and they wanted tacos de lengua, but that was a different line. So I kindly asked the gentleman at the Adobada line if he could get me a few lengua tacos. He said they can, but has to be aa couple max, so I asked for 4 lengua tacos and he obliged nicely. Tipped him for it on the jar in front, and on our way we went.

The thing I love about this place is that regardless of when you come, the quality of the food, the texture, and the sauces... it all remains constant. That is why I believe so many people flock to TEG on their Vegas trips. Needless to say, I shall be back next month when I'm in town for the Mayweather\/McGregor fight!!",0,0,0

It's effectively the same tacos that you get from a taco truck, in a restaurant. However, taco trucks tend to be a bit cheaper by a few cents per taco. For a grown adult, roughly 4 tacos can fill you up, which is about $8 without drinks. 

I do not recommend the Taco De Sesos! Thats beef brain tacos. And it smells funny, and tastes like... unflavored tofu or something. And I hate tofu. 

But everything else is great! I don't know what that green sauce is, but I see little onion bits in it. Whenever possible, request more green stuff on your tacos!

The neighborhood around is sort of shady, the shopping center where this one is located is surrounded by liquor stores and smoke shops. However! It is a better spot than the 2nd location on Charleston, which is surrounded by bail bonds and pawn shops.

The place was already packed and the security guard lady was already giving people directions on how to order their tacos (unheard of if you go to the Tijuana location). The lines were not very clear and the menu was hard to see because of the décor hanging from the ceiling.

I had my usual, tacos de carne asada. They looked and tasted legit! So the wait was worth it. Corn tortillas were handmade, salsa and guacamole on point and asada cooking over fire. I truly enjoyed my tacos and wished I had order 6 instead of just 4. I was very disappointed that they didn't have Mexican Coca-Cola or Fanta. They only have canned sodas and a fountain drink machine. Tacos were $2.25 each and the fountain drink was $2.00 (cheapest meal on the strip I tell you).

***

Decided to come back on Sunday before heading back home. Well, they say they open at 9 AM, but in reality they didn't start serving people until 9:30 Am ( I waited about 45 minutes outside...the smell of the asada I tell you). When we finally got to order I ordered 5 asada tacos, well I noticed that the guacamole was missing, so I asked where is the guac? The taco man replied ""we don't have any until the evening."" I was VERY DISAPPOINTED that they did not have an essential ingredient on their tacos yet again they still charged me full price. 

After a mixed experience, here is a rundown of my review and suggestions for the owner:

- Food: Come over in the evening for tacos. I will never come at opening time, they were not ready to serve their clients. The wait is worth it later in the day when the tacos will be served with all the ingredients. Owner: Make sure you got EVERYTHING ready for your customers at opening time.

- Service: The women who work behind the cash register and the cleaning ladies, they were pretty cold, no smile, no ""how you doing?"" The taquero, no smile, but hey, thanks for making me some delish tacos.

- Location: Not enough area to sit inside\/outside. I understand that it gets super crowded inside, therefore, have something like a long bar table area outside. I don't mind eating tacos standing up, but at least have a surface where I can put my plate and drink while I eat.

The way they separate the ordering areas by meat...please get rid of this. It causes confusion and unnecessary extra long lines for one type of taco. Instead, open at least three stations that serve all type of tacos, mulitas, etc. Also, don't have the security lady directing people where to go. I witnessed her running people out of the place by telling them that the line for asada was too long. Instead, have her do her job of making sure people don't steal tacos or get into a fight only. Also, clear the menu view...we get it, we love Mexico, but having ""banderitas"" hanging all over the place? obstructing the menu? not cool.

Overall, I will return next time I visit Las Vegas.",0,0,0

--PARKING-- there is a parking lot, but try walking there if you can. I walked from Palazzo.

--MENU-- tacos, tortas, quesadillas, fries, etc. NO BURRITOS. Each taco is either $2.40 or $2.25 depending on which meat you get. Each taco comes with cilantro, green sauce (i think it was guac..), and diced onion. They will cut up the meat and prepare your orders right in front of you. 

There's a radish (whole and sliced) and lime bar

I ordered 6 carne asada tacos and 8 lengua tacos. Total~ $36

--ORDER-- Each line is a meat station. You line up and order based off of what meat you want to get. I went alone and it took me 45 min-60 min from start to finish. I wanted to get the spicy pork, but I gave up and just got extra lengua.

I SUGGEST GOING WITH A GROUP TO SPLIT UP AND ORDER TO BE MORE EFFICIENT WITH TIME. 

Pay at cashier once you got your orders. 

--SEATING-- There are a lot of tables, but you may not be able to sit down because of how popular and crowded it gets. 

--SERVICE-- They move very fast and very slowly. The lines took foreverrrrr to move. But when I was finally in front, it looked like the meat station guys moved very quickly. My carne asada guy did disappear mid-order though...

--OVERALL-- very stressful experience. I was also soooo disappointed that my lengua tacos were pretty skinny. The carne asada tacos were filled to a decent amount. Some of my tacos really didn't have enough toppings, either. The meat themselves were juicy, but I admit I've had better in LA.

I wish they had pico de gallo or spicy sauces or jalapenos at the radish\/lime bar. But in a way I'm glad they don't because I know that would just cause more lines and more waiting and more chaos.

Wait in line for few minutes, order tacos as one order, pay at the cashier, and enjoy delicious tacos.

So much for the ideal world ...

Once you walk in, you will see separate lines for different types of taco (two lines for adobada, two lines for asada, one line for fries, and ..... ONE line for beef tongue \/ tripe \/ beef shoulder). 

So I lined up and waited to get one beef tongue taco and one beef shoulder. So I waited ... and waited ... and waited ...

Why did it take so long? Oh I see, everyone was ordering at least 10+ tacos for each order. Taco El Gordo, how can you only have one line for beef tongue \/ should line? Anyhow, and so I waited for 30+ minutes ... 

Finally it got to my turn! And guess what? THEY RAN OUT OF BEEF SHOULDER -_-! Dude, not cool at all. I only ordered beef tongue and beef tripe tacos. 

In the end, I basically did not want to wait in another line and I just simply overpaid for a $10 carne asada fries because there was no line. Oh, did I also mention it took them another 10 minutes just to get the fries out?  

Well, these tacos better be amazing right?

tacos de lengua (beef tongue - $2.25 each) and tacos de tripa (beef tripe - $2 each): For $2 tacos, they tasted okay. Is it worth 30 minutes wait? Hell no!  

Taco de adobada (spicy pork - $2): Probably the best taco out of all three that I've ordered, but it wasn't crazily good. 

Carne asada fries ($10): Not like it was awful, just not at the price that I paid for. I still can't believe I paid $10 for somewhat average fries ($5 would be a better price).

It's just not being run properly. KAIZEN! The manager of this place needs to be visited by Toyota to learn how to run their outfit efficiently. They need a person to take orders and ring people up. They need an POS system and electronic ordering screens going to people making the food in the back, who then prepare and organize the food for pick-up. What's going on here is a horribly inefficient, infuriating joke. You have to make a night out just to eat at this place, and believe me, it's not worth it. Wouldn't be worth it if every Food Network celebrity chef was working in the kitchen. If I were a local, I'd never be back, but hey, this is working for them now, milk it for all its worth, I guess.

The good part was that we highly enjoyed our meal. I had a tongue, head, shoulder and asada.  I liked the asada and shoulder best out of those. I also tasted the adoboda and chorizo. All three of us were pretty happy with our tacos.

Consider I eat asada fries a lot. This are by far the worst. The meat has no flavor, and put big chunks of meat. The carne asada fries were $14. That's absurd. They should be more like $7 if anything. So I order my fries, & the cook says they'll give them to you on the other side after waiting there for 5 min. So I went to the other side to wait. I was waiting for 10 min when he says your fries are up there. He put the fries in the middle of a busy line. How was I supposed to go through the middle of the people. He could've hand them to me where I was. It was super hot inside and the ordering and paying

The asada tacos were chewy and full of gristle, the spicy pork tacos were really fatty and rubbery but had a good green sauce on top. They make the tortillas fresh on the spot which was a plus.

The flan tasted pretty old even though the expiration date wasn't for a few more days. The horchata came out of a soda fountain machine and overly sweet and not creamy.

I honestly don't get all of the hype of this place? They aren't as good as the tacos here in Utah and we aren't known for the best Mexican food in the west coast. Definitely not as good as the taco's in Cancun or Tijuana.

First, what is the reason for having multiple lines for different kinds of meat? It makes zero sense to me. The lines are slow and you can forget about getting multiple meats if you come alone. Luckily, I was able to try several meats because we got in different lines. We waited over an hour at the two popular lines but there were other lines that had much less people. Why don't they make things more efficient and let people order any meat at any of the stations?

The adobada, which is the meat they're known here wasn't all that interesting to me. I don't understand why everyone is crazy about this red pork. Don't forget to ask for the slices of pineapple off the top of their spit. You can also ask for the grilled veggies and peppers with your tacos. Out of adobada, asada, cabeza, and lengua, I liked their lengua the most. It was probably one of the best lengua tacos I've had, actually. Unfortunately, I didn't think much of their sauces.

Even though the tacos weren't bad or anything, the whole waiting in line forever and having different lines for different types of meat marred the overall experience here. It was very difficult finding a table to eat at as well. Hopefully some of these issues were particular to this location. I'm hopeful that I'll have a better experience at one of their other locations.",15,12,13

Avoid going here at all cost to save yourself from inconveniences. Here's what happened to us. (8 people total)

After a fun night in Vegas, we decided  to get some tacos. When we entered the place, we noticed there were different lines for the different types of meats. Meaning, you can only buy tacos of adobada\/pastor OR asada, not both unless you and your friends divide into the different lines. The waiting time was about an hour. It's a struggle to find a table.

The cashier is separate from the ordering area. They make you get into a different line to pay while you hold your food. This can cause your tacos to get cold. One of my friends decided to place the tacos on the table and then went to get in line to pay. He was told that he needed to show them the tacos and couldn't pay causing him to go back and getring in line all over again. 

Then, we were eating and one of the ladies that cleans the tables, came behind me, to tell me that my asada mulita and asada tacos were not paid by my friend. My other friend jumped in and said she paid for them and asked if they wanted to see the receipt. The rude lady took the receipt not believing us and consulted with cashier to make sure it was legit. This was offensive, later the lady came to return the receipt and didn't apologize for her mistake. We will never come back to this place.

ABOUT
======
Family owned and operated company, opening their first business in 1972. In 1998, Tacos El Gordo opened its first location in San Diego, California, and in 2010 opened its first location in Las Vegas.

PARKING
========
Strip mall.

AMBIANCE
=========
Crowded, noisy, and somewhat small.
Grab a table inside or outside.

NOTES: 
#1 - There are different lines to order for different things. Be sure to designate and assign your party members to get in a specific line to order specific items. 

#2 - You order FIRST in line and then you go to ANOTHER line (the cashier) to pay. Not very convenient, especially during busy hours.

FOOD
=====
CARNE ASADA FRIES - $10
I like perfect fries with meat and toppings. So, these were OK. The fries could have been a bit more crispy. I like the version in San Diego better.
RATING: 3\/5

ADOBADA TACOS - $2
My favorite.  Pork marinated in a ""red"" chilli sauce with vinegar and oregano was perfect.
RATING: 5\/5

PASTOR TACOS - $2
Pork is marinated in a combination of dried chiles, spices and pineapple. Ask for pieces of the pineapple off the spit.
RATING: 5\/5

CEBOLLINES (GRILLED GREEN ONIONS) - PRICE N\/A
Nothing special, not much flavor. A bit oily.
RATING: 3\/5

BEVERAGES
==========
HORCHATA
Not the best I've had. Too mild. I want more cinnamon.
RATING: 3\/5

SERVICE
=======
They are efficient, but not exactly smiley friendly.

The location is in a strip mall in one of the ""dodgier"" sections of vegas. There was lots of families eating there, so i felt safe. However, I did feel like I had to order all my food in spanish, because everyone there spoke spanish! Unfortunately at the time, I was getting my spanish and german confused.... so that was difficult.

I got two adobada tacos and two asada tacos. I also got a can of fanta. It was about $10 for all this food. It was all incredibly delicious. Someone had commented that it tasted packaged- well, all guacamole consists of is mashed avocados with some other stuff like peppers and garlic, so most guacamole is pretty much the same.

I definitely preferred the adobada tacos. I felt like they were more flavorful. Plus, the first thing you see when you walk in is a thousand layers of pork, on a spit. It sort of calls out to you ; ) Oh, and I""m pretty sure their tortillas are homemade. no store bought stale tortillas here : )

really delicious, very authentic, I think most people will enjoy this place, unless you're used to your mexican food being somewhat fancier and covered in cheese and sauces.

Found this place mentioned as a top choice on several websites, especially when researching the best cheap eats in Vegas.  Granted, they are not necessarily cheap for street tacos ($2 to $3), but compared to prices in Vegas as a whole, Tacos el Gordo is a bargain!  During a lunch break during a business conference at the LV Convention Center, my friend and I came here.  Expecting huge lines, we prepared for a long wait, but it turned out that lunch time is a pretty good time to visit.  According to my friend, the lines are absolutely huge during the late night hours, after the clubs get out.  Anyway, I ordered two of their famous spicy pork tacos, one beef shoulder taco, and, because I wanted to be adventurous, one beef brain taco.  I had each one ""with everything"" and all of them were delicious!  Without a doubt, the two pork tacos were the absolute best...sweet, savory, spicy...full of flavor!  The beef shoulder was excellent to, a bit stringy, but overall very tasty.  The brain taco was...interesting.  With all of the accompanying toppings, it was very tasty, but it was the texture that was the most different.  Creamy is probably the best word to describe it.  Would I order one again?  Probably not, but I am very glad that I tried it.  Was it filling?  After eating my four tacos, I felt thoroughly satisfied.  I was by no means full, but happily fed (for about $10 mind you) and looking forward to a future visit.

Tell them what you want for that meat (taco, mulas, quesadilla, etc). Grab your order and go to the register to the right and pay for what you ordered.

Thankfully I came with two people who had already been here and showed us the ropes! I ordered the adobada (spicy pork) quesadilla ($4). I'm pretty sure what I got was not a quesadilla. Not sure if the guy knew what he was doing? It was a taco with a small piece of crispy circular tortilla on top.. not pressed together or anything just thrown on top. We asked him what that was and he had to tell us it was the quesadilla. Very confused.. The flavors were good though. Ask for grilled onions (they give you green onions) and chili.

It's a different way to order your meal than I am used to, but it's pretty efficient. You line up according to which ever part of meat you want on your Taco or fries and order when it's your turn.

The food does not look anything like the pictures. The food is made way too fast, it lacks in ingredients and flavor. If you want a cheap version of Mexican food that is affordable, sure... try it if you must, but personally I would not recommend. This place is in walking distance of many hotels & clubs since it is on ""the strip"" hence explaining how busy it gets. The lines are incredibly long and move way to slow since people get multiple items. They should hire more help. They only have 1 restroom which is absurd. Not a lot of space when it comes to tables. Be prepared to eat outside, standing up. Ordering your food and then paying (in separate lines) is chaotic. Don't know how they make it work. This place also lacks in customer service. Staff could be a little friendlier. 

I really wish they had chicken as an option. The adobada had a strong red color to it... I've never seen it that color, so I stayed away. I had the carne Asada fries. As soon as I opened the box, I was upset. It looked nothing like the picture that made me crave them in the first place. The meat was not well seasoned or cooked to my liking. Some meat was darker than the rest. There was not enough cream or guacamole salsa. I thought it came with pico de gallo as well, I guess I was wrong. The salsa wasn't as hot as I expected.

There is a friendly black female security guard who explains the ""system"" to you.  There are several lines depending on what meat you want.  The more exotic meats are quicker, so FYI.  The meat is shave, grilled on the flat-top grill, & tortillas are made right in front of you.  Then after you get your order, you walk up to the cashier to pay. 

I've been to a taco place with a ""system"" like this, but not nearly half as busy as El Gordos.  So needless to say, this place needs a new system!

Tacos El Gordo has to be where real Las Vegans come for authentic Tijuana tacos.

It's in the strip mall on a corner just north of Encore\/Wynn.  But do *not* try to walk here, even from those hotels.  Too much on a typical Vegas weather day, and the traffic signal at that T-intersection is a joke.  NOT pedestrian friendly.

Yes, es stupido mucho.  Si, laugh at my decisione no bueno.

Staggering in, barely avoiding heat stroke... well at least the soft drink machine was working.  What timing.  One of the ice dispensers was broken.

Still, the soda was fine, and the food was relatively worth the scorching trek.

There are only two sizes for Carne Asada fries:  large and massively large.  Either one is more than enough for a couple of average appetites.

Tacos are on the small side, but they're filling and full of great flavour.  The tortillas are doused in oil, quite heavy.

Watching the guy use a macheté, slicing at the rotating hulk of Adobado pork, is kind of fun.

It's also rather sweet seeing families having a meal at Tacos El Gordo, little boys play-fighting their brothers.

Speaking Spanish (which I don't ;\/ waah ) is an advantage.  They seem to hook you up with extra good stuff, if you can hold a convo with them.

Once you are all buffet'd out and are looking to save money without sacrificing quality, then this is your spot! It's perfect walking distance from the Riviera and the Wynn. These guys are open late into the early hours especially on fridays and saturdays. 

They have some booths inside but most of the seating is located outside in two decent sized tents which you cant miss if you're driving by on the street. On cold nights they have those gas powered heating elements for those of you that think Vegas doesnt get that cold.

The parking is decent and on some nights you have street racers meeting up here just to hang out. Im suprised this location doesnt have an armed security guard like the Charleston location.

As for the food, the three most popular items that I usually get here are the El Pastor tacos, Carne Asada tacos, and the Adobado Fries. The tacos are 2 bucks a pop and the Adobado Fries are 5 bucks for the half order and 10 bucks for a large order (the half order is virtually a meal in itself!). You have the option of having everything on your tacos and fries at no extra charge. These are the guacomole sauce, onions, and cilantro for your tacos. For the fries you can get sour cream, guacomole, and extra cheese. You can even ask for grilled green onions and jalapenos on the side. Also you can have them put grilled pineapple bits as well, BUT YOU HAVE TO SPECIFICALLY ASK FOR THESE so if you dont than they will not give it to you. That's why I love these guys, no extra charge for all those mentioned above.

I also like this place better simply because of the fact that they have TWO service stations meaning they have twice the amount of food servers and cashiers (yes they take cards and there is no minimum) which equals faster service although on really busy nights you cant tell. Plus, it seems that they speak better english here than the other location. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/tacos-el-gordo-las-vegas

If you are up for it, there is another place that serves an even better El Pastor. They are a couple miles away on Charleston just down the street from the other Tacos El Gordo. They are called Taqueria El Pastorcito. When you go East on Charleston, look for the trailer with the bright lights on the left side of the street just right before Los Tacos on the right side.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/taqueria-el-pastorcito-las-vegas#query:Tacos%20El%20Pastorcito",8,4,7

You start by getting in line for whatever meat you want. They have a long list of options. You say which meat then you can either get everything on it (sour cream, salsa, cilantro, guacamole, and onions) or just what you want on it. Each taco was under 3$.

The second time we went I got carne asada fries. AMAZING! There were so much flavor and so much on them. I only ordered the small for about 8$ and I couldn't finish it. It's basically a taco on fries. The fries are topped with meat, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. You can choice to put salsa, cilantro or onions on it.

Quite possibly the worst taco place I have ever eaten. First of all, you have to stand in a specific line depending on what kind of meat you want. So if I stand in the Carne Asada line for ten minutes then have to stand in the Adobada line for another ten minutes, my Carne tacos are now twenty minutes cold. God forbid if I want lengua. That's thirty minutes. Then I have to stand in line to pay. Wtf. Who the hell thought of this stupid idea?

Now for the food. Eew. The cook put the non-marinaded Carne Asada on the grill with wood charcoal as the heating source. Not even salted or seasoned. And who cooks Carne Asada over a wood burning grill? This meat had more smoke flavor then a bbq joint. And I love wood smoked  bbq. I have never in my life had street tacos with this flavor. So gross we couldn't finish our food. 

The Adobada (their version of Pastor) was flavorless as well. They don't even have a salsa bar. I asked for red salsa on the side and the lady, who was standing less than two feet from the container of red salsa said I had to ask the guy making the Adobada tacos. I stood there for a few minutes as he was too busy and decided F this place.

All I could hear from my friends is them talk about this place n San Diego.  How good the tacos are and what not.  They found a Las Vegas location and insisted we go when we got there on our Vegas trip this past weekend.

Arriving at the restaurant, the employees wanted us to make two lines ( for the beef and the pork meat ).  My gf said lets split up in the lines so we could get our orders.  We decided to order:

1 taco of shoulder meat
1 taco of stomach meat
1 taco of carne asada
1 taco of adobada meat
1 order of adobada fries

The employees gave me a bit of an attitude until they forced me to speak Spanish.  They gave me my orders and went to the GF to check on the fries.  She was still waiting for the order and said they were taking a bit long.  I talked to the cook there and he was like she didn't order anything and putting her down.  I switched back to Spanish mode and told him to make the order ( with an attitude ). If that wasn't enough, the cashier girls were giving my gf attitude when she was paying because they couldn't understand that she was paying for the fries and I was paying for the tacos.  Back to Spanish mode, put them down, explained to them in a way you explain a 5 year old how to do things because obviously these people came from Tijuana yesterday and think they can give customers attitude when they themselves can't understand English in the US.  Really pissed me off that these immigrants like to talk smack in Spanish when you don't speak Spanish.

Going back to the food, I had my eyes set on the carne asada tacos and adobada ( since everyone is ranting about them). I couldn't be more disappointed in the flavor of the meat.  The asada taco's meat was tender, but really bland.  I guess cause its so bland, they smacked so much guacamole on the taco to make up for the flavor ( which made it worst).  The adobada taco meat was really dry and no flavor either!  What was the hype about??  Surprisingly when we were tasting the stomach and shoulder tacos, we were like OK that's pretty good.  The shoulder taco was kinda like carnitas style with some of the broth it was cooked in.  The stomach taco was not all chewy and nasty texture.  Had some of the broth that it was cooked in as well.  These two tacos were the best ones out of the others, how ironic ha ha.  I think the brain, stomach, head and shoulder meat is all cooked in the same broth.  The fries were pretty good too.  They were thin, crispy fries smothered in some salsa they make there.  Personally me, that salsa was OK but too much on it.  Again, the adobada meat did not help the fries.  You might want to eat the fries as soon as you can or else they will become soggy from the overload of salsa they put in.

This place really did not live up to the hype.  Rude employees, flavorless meat and expensive tacos.  I would have given this place a 1 star, but the shoulder and stomach tacos managed to change my mind.  I would like to try the head tacos,brain tacos, tostadas and quesadillas next time, but I feel like it wont be for awhile since it would have to be because friends wanna go and has to be the San Diego location.  If the San Diego location is just as bad with the immigrant workers and attitudes they give, I will gladly say I'm done with this restaurant. Never again....",3,4,3

Be prepared to wait in line and make sure you educate yourself before standing in line. They have a great system which separates the customers based on which types of tacos \/ food you want. At the store near the Wynn on the strip, tacos de pastor only goes to the left, all other meats are to the right. Stand in the proper line and you'll get served pretty quick. Once you order and get your food, you find a spot to sit and then go pay. It's kind of like an honor system to letting the cashier know what you have ordered, so don't try to jip them!! 

The tacos de pastor are my favorite as are the Vampiros. The corn tortillas are hand made for all tacos so get ready for that!! The vampiro is sort of like a taco sandwich. The tortillas are over cooked and turned into a tostada, then the meats are piled on the bottom one, melted cheese follows, then salsa and onions and cilantro. Topped off with another crispy tortilla and there you have it.. vampiro awesomeness!!

For the uninitiated, it is absolutely worth visiting if you are a fan of authentic Mexican food.  Just beware of the ridiculous lines during lunch and the silly ordering system that works in theory but fails miserably in execution.

When you get there, you'll see that there are multiple lines for each of the meat stations.  Each station is supposed to be dedicated only to a particular type of meat or meats, but the lines aren't labeled and it's more of a free-for-all to get to the front than anything else.  To further cause problems, people will wait in one line (carnitas for example), but when they get to the front they order something that's supposed to be from another station (asada for example).  This causes delays because the guy at the carnitas station will have to ask the guy at the asada station to make something for the guy who stood in the wrong line in the first place, which causes both lines to get further backed up.  Confused yet?  Yeah, it's a big mess.

But let me save you the trouble of having to wait in multiples lines.  I've tried pretty much all the meats, and I can confidently say the only meat that really makes this place unique\/special is the adobada (spicy pork aka al pastor).  It's frickin' delicious!  The meat has a perfect balance of crispiness and juiciness, and is packed with salty sweet flavor.  Whether you get it in a taco, tostada, quesadilla or whatever, I guarantee it will be good.

After getting seated, I realized that had happened. I quickly went back to the cashier to let her know so I can get a free soda since I didn't want to wait in line for a taco.  Due to the language barrier, a coworker of hers explained the situation. The cashier refused to admit she overcharged me and did not do a single thing to make matters better, even after I did the math and showed her the amount I was charged in my credit card. If it were an accident, that's totally understandable. I think it was intentional. On the flip side, I really enjoyed the tacos despite the ordeal. Anyhow, just watch out for this kind of thing. I know it seems silly to trip about $2, but it is the way the situation was handled that can make any meal turn sour. Luckily, there is a Tacos El Gordo in San Diego.",0,1,1

This awesome place was recommended by a friend in the group. As soon as I walked in, I noticed lots of people wolfing down tacos. Long lines were forming. Each window had a different type of meat from which to order at. 

My first time here, so of course I had to follow my friend. He got the tacos de al pastore. Okay that's what I'm getting too! ""Four tacos de al pastore, please!"" He's getting a free side order of the chili and scallion. ""I like a side of cooked chili and scallion too!"" 

""Ok. 
This is cool. 
Where do I pay? 
Oh, over there? 
Ok. I can do that.""

Walked my way to the cash register. Payed for my hot tacos and purchased a cup for drinks. Filled my cup with horchata. Gulped down some of it (oh yeah, it was a really hot day) and filled it up some more. 

""Damn no seats available!

Tacos el Gordo definitely has the right idea about tacos. Unfortunately, having had some great tacos in LA and south of the border, I can say they aren't quite top tier. That being said, they are one of the best taquerias in Las Vegas. I would come back, but if a King Taco ever opens in the city, there would be no contest. 

Pros:
-Good price, open late
-Lengua and cabeza held their own; both were cooked well, moist, and flavorful, if a bit under-spiced
-Their red sauce\/salsa was great
-""insert meat choice"" fries

Cons
-The adobada, which they are apparently known for, was chewy, dry, and pretty lacking in any flavor whatsoever (resembling styrofoam perhaps)
-The ordering situation is, well, a situation. Be prepared to wait three times as long if you happen to want meets from three different stations.",1,1,1

Came here when we arrived around 1am.  Our hotel was right around the corner of the strip mall Tacos El Gordo is located in.  We were worried about the late night crowd, but were hoping they wouldn't be showing up until later.

We get there and there were 4 short lines.  The lines on the right side were shorter than the left.  There are separate lines depending which type of meat you want.  Since there were 3 of us, we split up to get our tacos faster.  Unfortunately, they ran out of the beef tongue :(.

The Al Pastor - spicy pork tacos were my favorite, and not far behind them were the chorizo.  The Asada tacos were delicious, but the beef was too overcooked for me.  I was in the Asada line, so I saw the guy assembling all of our tacos.  He was speedy and made no mistakes.  It was quite impressive.  My biggest concern was if he was going to change his gloves when he threw raw meat on the grill, and HE DID! Thank goodness.

The corn tortillas are phenomenal and so fresh.  You can see the woman tossing them on the griddle as the cook is making your tacos.

The tacos are small in size, but are packed with so many amazing flavors.  The price is good, it just keeps you wanting more.  I could probably eat these every day.  I wanted to have them again in the morning, but had to save room for the buffet we were headed to :(. Oh well, next time. I'll definitely be coming back just for these tacos.",2,0,0

 If you love tacos, then this place is for you.  A little confusing at first, there were snaking lines of Mexicans and Haole all queued up inside the door, for different ordering stations, where incredibly speedy preparers hammer out the variety meats for the tacos and tostadas. After you pick up your order, you take your tray, pay the cashier lady at the front door, and then take your tray outside to a canvas & mylar tent, and grab a seat on a picnic-style bench.  I skipped the more authentic organ-based lines (tripas, cabezas, sesas, etc.) and  just went for an assortment of tacos in my comfort zone: carne asada; lengua; chorizo; adobada.   All were hot, a little greasy, and served on these great little thick, 4"" diameter Masa tortillas, with lime wedges, and nice crunchy radishes.  Delicioso!   I'd probably give the place  5 ***** -- if they could only serve a nice, cold beer ( I settled for an icy can of Coke, which was a good choice for the chiles!)

These aren't just *any* run of the mill chicken\/steak\/carnitas tacos but the REAL ones where they use certain... innards of the animal. Although I've lived in Chula Vista for so long I hadn't visited one (shame on me), so not only am I able to complete a pilgrimage to such a well-known taco establishment before I move to the Bay Area, I also got to introduce the No1DP to REAL tacos. It's a step up from the ""Mexican"" food he's been used to eating on his business trips but he says it was way too late to try brain and stomach tacos :\/

This is one of the few places in Vegas that are open quite late on a weekday (3am) and even more late on weekends (5am). Frankly there's not much that's open for late night eating afterwards unless you are willing to go off-strip and even then you have to know what you are looking for. This area is also short walking distance from the Wynn\/Encore hotel group so this would be a perfect late-night spot for people getting out of XS\/Surrender\/Tryst and needing to sober up.

There's indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor seating is covered. No1DP says that outside is a good place to go people-watching as it overlooks Las Vegas Blvd.

Inside the taco shop there are various counters. Each counter you can order specific items. Place your order then fall in line at cashier towards the door to pay.

All tacos use two flour tortillas to soak up the fat\/give stability to the taco plus each taco has a generous portion of salsa verde. There's no cheese or sour cream on the taco (which is a sign of a true Mexican taco joint). Each taco is between $2-$3.

Asada: Typical beef carne asada taco. Tastes like any other carne asada taco. If you live in SoCal and are lucky enough to have taco shops within reasonable driving distance, just do yourself a favor, be more adventurous and try a taco that you'll only find here.
Suadero (shoulder): One of the best cuts of meat for a taco I've ever had. Shoulder seems like it was braised as the meat was quite soft and juicy without it being too greasy.
Cabeza (head): For this taco I think they grind up the head so that the end result texture is similar to a pate. The taste was a bit weird and didn't have much flavor as a meat; it absorbed more of the oil and the salsa verde. 

I can definitely justify the hype regarding this place and this taco joint, along with TJ's Oyster Bar for tacos from the sea, are my two recommended taco joints for REAL street tacos. Now if I can find someone to drag along who is willing to try beef brain, tripe and pork stomach before I leave...",3,2,3

I heard about this from my good friend who told me this place was the shiz in Mexico and San Diego. Now I've been with my friend to Mexico to visit family so I trust his tastes. And man wow, amazing! 

-Adobada was flavorful and moist.  If you love creamy green sauce you'll like this taco. I thought it was a little too much and took away from the flavor of the meat but the sis loved it.
-Lengua (mind you I don't eat Lengua - tho I'll eat Yakitori tongue) was so tender and just melted in my mouth.
-Suadero, I've had before at El Taurino in LA but man, the Suadero here is delicious.  

The Mulas is quite greasy, I mean HELLA greasy so I'm not sure if that's your thing. I would just stick to the tacos to appreciate the meat. I didn't really see much of a difference between that and a quesadilla.

I highly recommend the Pork Quesadilla, a little pricier than the $2 tacos at $4, but twice the size and twice the meat, well worth it. Not traditional though, it comes with cheese, grilled green onions (yum!), salsa (fresh and spicy, so gooooood), and  some sort of sour cream-ish type sauce (also awesome), and topped with a tostada shell (small, but a little extra crunchiness never hurt anyone).

This past weekend we went to Vegas to celebrate my cousins 25th birthday, and all weekend I was really craving tacos. Finally, before leaving I told them lets go and they agreed. For once the lines weren't out the door like they normally are which made me really excited. I was a bit overwhelmed as to what to get but finally decided on 2 tacos and a mulita de asada.

The tacos are Ok and have hand made tortillas. They are not stingy with their meat, sauce or guacamole which is a plus. The mulitas were made the same way and had sooooo much cheese in which I love. The downside to the food was the Carne Asada was wayyyyyyy too salty. 

I'm giving it 3 stars because I feel like it's just all hype. I've had better tacos in LA. Also the fact the meat was really salty. Maybe next time it'll be better.",0,0,0

This place is unforgettable; from the long lines to cooking in front of customers, they are as good as it gets! I've eaten numerous Mexican Foods in Arizona; but to me, nothing is ever comparable to them. Every time I go back to Vegas, I have to at least get a horchata there.  Okay, that's a lie!

I totally recommend the Adobada (spicy pork) Fries because not only is the line shorter, but....it is roasted on a metal rod!! All their meets are cooked to perfection in front of everyone; that way, they have to stay even if it's a long line. 
Their workers are pretty nice; I've heard they are actually from main Mexico so their techniques are directly from there. This explains why they are so authentic, at least in my opinion.

3 lengua tacos
3 spicy pork tacos
1 campachana fries
2 coke zeros--you know, cuz we're trying to watch our figures.

I loves me some pork so of course I ordered the adobado (sp) tacos for myself. I thought they were really good, however I don't think they are as good as the al pastor from Tacos Mexico. The ones there come very greasy and seemed to be slow cooked amongst ingredients such as onions that you can clearly see on the taco (aside from the toppings). I love the greasy, juiciness of that type of marinated pork. It seems I've only been able to find them at Tacos Mexico.

Anyhow, my sister and I swapped a taco and that lengua taco on MY lengua blew my mind! So tender and juicy! I already thought I discovered the best lengua tacos in town (Super B Burrito) over by Eastern and St Rose so I didn't have high expectations. God, I love it when I'm proven wrong in that sense.

The campachana fries were delish with half of it topped with carne asada and the other with the spicy pork. All in all, great food especially after sitting under the sun getting drunk.

Last time I came, however, half of their kitchen had been closed down for some reason and the wait time was ridiculous (close to an hour around lunch time).  On previous visits, my wait has always been around 20 minutes long around the same time (we have a habit of going right after hotel check-out, before driving back to socal!)

and then.... the adobada happened, and my mouth was way too full of deliciousness to whine any more.

there are 4 lines you can order from.  each line is designated for specific items, so if you want the adobada and you're standing in the carne asada line, you're shit out of luck.  better go to the back of the line, pronto!

we ordered 4 adobada tacos, 4 carne asada tacos, 1 carne asada sope, and a bowl full of chilis and all that jazz.  for all 9 items and a horchata (self serve) our bill was 23 bucks.  upon receiving all our food i really thought we were in over our heads and had ordered way too much... but we finished every single bite... and was left wanting more.

the carne asada was nothing special.  in fact, i've had better.  king taco's asada trumps el gordo any day.  but man, oh man, the adobada... the green sauce.  mind blown.  was so delicious.  

they have another tacos el gordo in chula vista, but none close enough to OC.  definitely will be going out of my way to get more hopefully soon..",4,3,3

After a great concert my hunger was high, and a yelp search happen to come across a taco spot on the strip that seemed letigimate and authentic.....  Grab a taxi and request Tacos El Gordo. Right at the tip end of the strip on this strip mall location (across from a walgreens) we reached our destination I open the door and the whiff Mexico tacos! You know the ones you would smell when you'd go across the border before all the violence?! Yes! Those! 

The BF and I ordered:
      -a carne asada Mulita (it's like two tortilla's with melted cheese, guacamole, steak pieces, cilantro, onions, hot sauce)
     -Two carne asada tacos (beef steak tacos)
     -Two lengua tacos (tongue): super good, just the way lengua should be, be cautious of the green hot sauce which is flavorful but spicy! 
     -El Vampiro (this was similar to the ""mulita"" but the tortilla crispy\/burnt like and I don't think it had melted cheese)


The tortillas are freshly made so the taste is delicious. Warm, not tough, soft tortillas.... Also note the tortillas are small.

It is very small on the inside but have more seating available on the outside. 

You come out with a happy filled belly and your long locks smelling like tacos.... Oh yeah and its extremely affordable.

One thing to keep in mind, which can be a major annoyance if you want different items is that you can only order certain meats in certain lines. So if you want Carne Asada and Al Pastor, you have to get in one line for the Asada, and then another line for the Al pastor. If you're with someone, then split up and have everyone order something different. The line was long, moved slow, but overall the food was great.

If you want carne asada\/steak there are several lines, then lines for other types of meat. It was confusing at first but then we got the concept. Personally, I thought the concept was a bit weird because if you want a carne asada taco and a lengua taco you need to stand in 2 separate lines. Probably not to cross contaminate the meat but it was kind of lame. The line I stood in took like what it seemed forever and a day. When you finally make it to the front you need to shout out your order. It took us 20 minutes to get to the front of our line and another 5 to prepare the food. The cooks are pretty good about getting everything but they will more than likely ask you again. It is very hot inside so be ready for that. 

Once you get your food make your way over to the register and pray there is a seat available. We got lucky and scored a couple. We ordered a total of 6 tacos and 2 fountain drinks for $18. One of the least expensive meals I have ever had on the strip in Vegas.  

Tortillas are freshly made. The portions are generous. At $2.25\/taco you are getting a good deal. Mainly because the guacamole is not an additional charge and you get a huge portion on top.

Tacos El Gordo gets 5 stars from me. cleanliness, location, price, quality, flavor and free drink refills and I'm taking horchata on tap!

first, walking in you would be skeptic. they have most of the meat on a turning spit like gyros or shawarma meat holders. but rest assured it's all delicious.

I've had almost all of the meat offered there. some of it I'm not touching because I could be insecure when it comes to questionable titles on food names, so I'll stock with the usual meats.

the spicy pork meat is amazing. the beef is right behind it as far as flavor goes. carne asada is yummy. I like to get a assortment of tacos when I go...like a mix of donuts mmmmm.

the quesadilla is not what you think. it's a small tortilla with the cheese cooked on the grill, then placed on the tortillas and topped with a crunchy shell. it is not big at all, but very delicious. I'm not sure why it's so expensive, but I pay it (maybe that's why)

the food always taste consistent, fresh. quality is perfect.

guacamole is made fresh and the spread is great. the toppings are just all around good.

A place that stays open into the wee morning hours located on ""The Strip"" along the Riviera Resort and Wynn Resort side of the street. Security guards are a common sight, for added feeling of secureness while you eat. Sit out in the outdoor canopied patio on chairs or on the cushioned seating. It sure will satisfy your stomach's need for Mexican cuisine of tacos. At a price of two dollars, five bucks to ten bucks a meal, fill up with all the fixings that goes with the taco you order which is best but, u must ask for it (at no extra charge) are: onions, spicy pepper, guacomole sauce, cilantro, sour cream, cheese, jalapeno, grilled scallion\/onion, guacomole (mashed avocado), and even pineapple chunks. The food servers will add it to your order. After receiving your order, you should go to the side dish server and add up with the salsa (green or red pepper sauce), chopped horseradish, chopped onions, slices of lime as you please for yourself.  
My Favorite meals is: Taco Al Pastor (""Al Pastor"" in Spanish means, in the style of the shepherd. It is a dish of Central Mexico in an adoption of the spit-grilled meat or pork marinated over one or two days with dried chiles, and pineapple as meat tenderizer, thus cooked slowly with gas flame on a vertical rotisserie called a ""trompo"" which is literally, a spinning top). The vertical rotisserie of pork is an obvious sight and to see the server take cuts or slices of pork from the spit griller. 
My favorite is the Vampiro (means vampire). This succulent super taco of chile quesadilla wrapped around juicy grilled carne asada (steak) fabulously good meal sounds like an immortality. My vision of it is a steak through its heart; as in a stick through a vampire's heart. Okay, this brings a smile to heart (love) a vampire. 
Other favorites: Taco de Adobada (spicy pork), Taco de Carne Asada (steak), Taco de Suadero (beef shoulder), Tacos de Lengua (beef tongue), Adobada (red chili-garlic) Fries. But you must try the Taco de Tripa (tripe), Taco de Lengua (tongue), Tacos de Cabeza (beef head), Tacos de Sesos (beef brain), Tacos de Buche (pork stomach) which are exotic fare to munch on. For first-timers, dare it, is delicious! One bebida or drink favorite is the Horchata (a Mexican rice and cinnamon milk-like drink). Other dish on the menu are Quesadilla (a flour tortilla or a corn tortilla filled with a savory mixture containing cheese, other ingredients, and\/or vegetables, then folded in half to form a half-moon shape) with meat, Sopes (soup) with meat, Tostadas (meaning ""toasted"" is a Mexican fried tortilla), Mulas (shredded beef on tortilla with cheese and salad), Carne Asada (steak) Fries, Campechana (seafood) Fries, Taco Azteca (or Nopal Asado, is grilled cactus).

Just have patience as you wait in line to get the servers to take your order. With a price and generous portion like it is, you are not the only one lining up for these eats. The strong scent of food that permeates the air is enough to keep you staying in line. Betcha some of the people in line are in it for more.

I've been back twice since  the Al Pastor is to-die-for. This huge slab of meat, get this - crowned with a pineapple -, is on a vertical spit being continuously roasted and sliced from. The result is juicy, flavorful, and seared perfection. The cilantro sauce is a great compliment, although you can opt out of you want to taste the meat more clearly.

8 tacos and 2 drinks ran us under $20, which is a steal in my opinion. I ate 5 and she had 3. We were both sufficiently stuffed. The carne asada didn't wow me as much, but I think it may have just been overshadowed by the Al Pastor

Tex mex is so popular, and luckily for us Tacos El Gordo serves up truly legit Mexican.  Outdoor and indoor seating is available, but when you are from Canada and you have the opportunity to dine outdoors in March, you take it.  The ordering process is slightly confusing.  Upon walking in to the restaurants, there is a cashier, and you would think that you pay first and then order, wrong.  Instead you go in the designated line, for steak, pork, etc, order, and then you pay.  It is amazing to watch the food be completely prepared for you form scratch in minutes.  On your way to pay, their is an additional toppings bar that was stocked with limes, radish, etc.  We ordered 6 tacos and paid $12 for two people, where most of the fancy restaurants on the strip that is the price one cocktail.  I am a self admitted taco snob, just because i have had so many legit tacos.  These tacos rate up their with some of the best.  They come on corn or flour, but for me their is only one option, corn is a must.  For the carne asada, the meat was tender, and they chop and cook it on the flat top seconds before putting it on a tortilla with onions, herbs, and guacamole.  It had so much flavour without being too hot, it was extremely fresh, my one complaint was that there was too much guacamole.  The pork taco again had so much flavour  from the cilantro, it tasted so bright, and with a squeeze of lime i was totally satisfied.  Both tacos had a good base of extremely flavourful meat, they didnt need to be topped with a million ingredients to make them taste great, they were simple, authentic, and boasting with flavour.

Overall i loved Tacos El Gordo, they make a lot of las vegas residents and tourists happy with an amazing product that they dish out hundreds of times daily.  My only complaint was the whole ordering process, the cashier was helpful, but i am sure she tires of telling people where to line up.  One suggestion would be more signage.  I cannot wait for my next visit, i might be more adventurous next time.",1,0,1

I've had really amazing tacos when I travelled throughout D.F. and other parts of Mexico. Probably 9\/10 street vendors were bomb, 5 stars, best tacos I've ever had to date. And I've luckily managed to find tacos almost as good in Los Angeles and in vegas (very recently). 

I've given tacos el gordo on Charleston a chance about a year ago, but didn't post my review as I didn't want to get stoned to death. 
I chose to give this new location a second shot for the tacos el gordo experience. 

Carne asada- 2 stars. I prefer some parts of my carne asada to have a char and prefer to have the meat more marinated or seasoned. This place is not my favorite. 

Al pastor- 2 stars. Pretty much for the same reasons, I did not enjoy it much. 

The plain fries for $2.25 were the highlight of my night, though it's probably frozen stuff.

The salsa bar doesn't have green and red sauce, so make sure to ask for it while getting the tacos. 

For those who are big fan of Tacos el Gordo, you will love this place. I had no lining up to do around 10pm on a Monday night. Wooooooo!!!!!

In a way, I took it for granted.  The Bay Area has some of the best food spots around, but in terms of Mexican food, I'm sorry, it just doesn't cut it.  Every time I go back to San Diego, I always make 1 or 2 (or 3) stops at Tacos El Gordo.  While I don't go to Vegas too often, it's good to know that I can do the same there, as well.

When it comes to Tacos El Gordo, the 1 thing you have to get is the Adobada taco.  It's spicy pork (although, not very spicy at all) it comes with a green sauce that complements it perfectly.  When you see the pork being shaved off the spit rod, your mouth will start to water.  Also good is the SD-staple, carne asada.  The meat is perfectly seasoned and cooked and is served with the freshest guacamole.  Not the watered down stuff you will find at the taquerias here in Northern California.  If I go with a group of friends, we will almost always share an order of the Campechana fries.  It is similar to carne asada fries you will find throughout San Diego, but is made with Adobada meat, as well, and is served with that same green sauce that is served on the tacos.

If you like some of the other cuts of meat that usually go with tacos, then they probably have those here, too.  I'm talking about Lengua (Tongue), Buche (Pork Stomach), Cabeza (Beef head), or Tripa (Beef Guts).  They also have different vehicles for all their meats, like Mulas, Tostadas, Suadero, or Sopes.  They also have quesadillas, in which you can add meat, if you want.  They are pretty small though, so if you're hungry, get a few.

One last thing to mention is expect to wait in line.  Don't think you can go at 10am, when they open, and beat the crowd.  Or, go at midnight thinking everyone's in the club or asleep.  Nope.  There will be a line.  Guaranteed.  But, they do have several lines when you actually get in.  One or two lines will have adobada, and other ones will have the other meats.  I want to say they go fast, but they don't.  They are fast making the food, but I think people order so much that it takes time.  The Adobada line does go fast though, for whatever reason.

P.S.  Don't forget the Horchata!!!",35,32,35

I could honestly just say...try these damn tacos, but that's no fun.

Tacos El Gordo has only a select few locations, which are Vegas, San Diego and Tijuana (might have missed some but these are the main locations everyone talks about). It's nice that this place stays open pretty late so the late night munchies is a must here. 

We arrived around 4:30pm and the line was ridiculous. They have a weird ordering system here where you have to get in line for each individual taco meat that you want. For example, if you want Asada you'll to wait in the Asada line. After receiving those tacos you'll have to get in another line for any other meats you want. If you're with a group of people, it's easy to split up and have one person order a few tacos in each line to share with everyone. 

El Gordo's has a wide range of meats from Al Pastor, Asada, Abodaba (spicy pork), Lengua (beef tongue), and etc. We ordered 10 tacos between my bf and I. We decided on pastor and Asada. Sitting there watching them cut the pastor on the skewer was mesmerizing. 

Taste test time. We both agreed that the asada was one of the best we've ever had. Everything from the home made tortilla to the guacamole was amazing and fresh.

We got the beef (I forget which one, there are several), the tongue and spicy pork. They were all frickin' broke da mout!

It is a weird system though. You stand in line for your tacos and then take your order up to the register to pay, then find a seat and eat.

Yes, it's crazy-mad mayhem, dirty, & a pain in the ass to get a table... but it's a meal\/experience you won't forget! 
Definitely go in with more than 1 person, because you have to wait in separate lines for different menu items!

You HAVE to order the Adobada (spicy pork) tacos! They were the best thing we ate~ we tried all the different tacos and the Carne Asada fries. I don't know if it's cuz we were staving or if it's really that good,  but we all agreed that the food was awesome (2 friends with us that night we from Mexico, & they confirmed that those Adobada tacos were BOMB!!!)!

THE FOOD -- the two absolute must is the lengua (beef tongue) and the adobada (spicy pork).
Lengua - for some of you who gets intimidated of eating something like tongue... Well, don't be. I'm not one who ever likes to eat tongue or those sort of things besides two exception.. Now 3 (Blue Ribbon, Tacos El Bronco, now hello Tacos El Gordo). It literally just looks like ordinary chunks of beef... And it totally blows my usual NYC's fave taco spot's lengua taco. It's not as mushy but yet it's still tender.
Adobada - the spicy pork was flavorful along with the fresh topping and verde sauce. It wasn't too spicy too which is a plus for me since I'm a baby when it comes to spice.

The reason for the low score is the service. There are 5 lines, ONE LINE FOR EACH MEAT option, that upset me big time. We were in a line expecting to be able to order any meat, but were sorely mistaken. After waiting 20 minutes to get to the front of the line, we asked for 4 asada tacos. The attendant said ""sorry. The line for asada is 2 lines down"". We were like WTF!!! He then said ""you are in the adobada line"". ***how does that make any sense????***  therefore you need to get in one line for asada and then let those tacos get cold as you get into another line for adobada and then let those tacos get cold as you get into another line for tripas. WTF!!!  How does this make any sense?  Oh and did I mention it took us 20 minutes to get to the front of the adobada line (which was the shortest of all 5). 

If you want to go to this place you need to take the amount of people with you with the amount of different meats that you want. Example: you want two meats take 2 people. One person stands in asada line and the other in adobada line and you order each other's tacos. Do not take kids because it is packed and it is a true cluster. You can't expect kids to be patient as you try to stand in each line to order a different meat.

Like I said. Food is good, but honestly not soooo good that it is worth dealing with the crouds and multiple lines and confusion.

That is just my opinion but I always recommend you find out your own experiences. Good luck.

This taco shop is a decent sized place that is almost always packed full of people. It is located by the Wynn hotel and there is a parking lot for those that don't want to walk or want to be dropped off there. But be warned, like many places on the Strip there will be a long line (although it is definitely worth it). And there is also security monitoring the doors to make sure people don't cut and that the whole process is more ""organized"". 

How it works- there are multiple lines you can go in depending on what kind of meat you want. So if you are coming in a group I would recommend each of you to tackle a different line and order for one another. For example, if my friends and I want Asada and Adobada, one of my friends would stand in the Asada line and I would stand in the Adobada line. After getting the tacos we would split them up on our trays and then go pay at the registers.  

There are two different lines for the most popular meats, the Asada & the Adobada (4 in total), and 1 line off to the side for the less popular (but still amazing) meats like Cabeza, Lengua, and Buche. Each taco is about $2.25-$2.50 each, and they also have grilled onions and peppers if you ask for it. What's amazing is that you can have your tacos on either a homemade corn 
tortilla or a homemade flour tortilla. I'm a sucker for a fresh tortilla! They also have sopes, quesadillas, and tostadas too but they don't have burritos. My favorite meat hands down is the Adobada (spicy pork), definitely give it a try! 

Honestly I think the biggest struggle isn't even the wait- it's to get a table. Because the place is always packed with people I literally feel like I have to fight someone to get a table. Every time I have been here I literally had to watch the tables like a hawk for someone to get up to leave, but there's always other customers trying to do the same thing. I would honestly recommend just taking it to go if you don't have the energy for that. Also, if you come during the summer expect to sweat. The AC is just not strong enough to accommodate all the customers, and workers behind the counter. The last time I visited, I was hit by a cloud of smoke coming from the stoves after walking in.  

The reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because sometimes I get a little hangry waiting for so long for some tacos, (even if it's worth it), and the fact that finding a table is struggle. Other than that, amazing tacos at a decent price- so definitely try it out if you are in Vegas!",3,0,2

I only ordered Al Pastor tacos due to the advice of the surrounding customers. The meat is sliced off in front of you and prepared with incredible speed. I don't mind the price because compared to the fine dining of most places in Vegas, it was incredibly cheap. I snagged horchata as my drink, and my coworker got this dried pumpkin snack thing (I think), and I loved it. I didn't even know I liked pumpkin.

Cheap prices = check
Delicious food = check
Good service = check
Open 24 \/ 7 = check
Authentic = check
Cleanliness = check
Strip convenience without strip prices = check

This is not your average taco stand.  The staff all dons branded company T-shirts, the service is friendly, and it's not a hole-in-the-wall.  It also feels to commercialized to be authentic with it's stainless steel walls and fixed furniture.  Nonetheless, they've taken a simple concept and have executed it very well.  

My sister and I came here around midnight.  We ordered two taco's each and one quesadilla to share.  Each taco (steak and pork) was succulent and full of flavor.  The quesadilla was the best I've ever had (full of steak with some excellent cheese).  Every order also comes along with grilled green onions and grilled whole jalapeño's... which were delicious as well.  You also get your choice of green and red salsa and accompaniments such as limes and radishes.  The food was so good that I could have had probably had eight tacos to myself.  Unfortunately, my stomach told me I was full after two tacos and half a quesadilla.  The total price of our meal for two?  Under $13 including tax.  This is how you win in Vegas.

Walked in after the first day of the League Championship Series Spring Finals with my friend Akinola and got into one of the empty lines -- which was the al pastor line. Why aren't people in this line? Y'all tripping. We got a bunch of tacos, a pair of aguas frescas and some paletas.

The tacos did not disappoint. They never do. I was insanely sad when this location closed down and I couldn't make it last year. Maybe I overrate this place because it's the closest thing to eating tacos like I used to have back home. There's nothing like this in Miami, unfortunately. This is a pilgrimage I will always make every year, every time I am in Vegas.

This location being open again was one of the happiest things I'd heard in a while. I am always effusive in my praise about this place.

I am biased. Stick me on a trompo spit and roast me al pastor, for all I care. These are the best tacos I can think of that you can get in Las Vegas, bar none. These are some of the best tacos I can think of that you can find anywhere in the US, for that matter.

Although it's a pretty unassuming location, rest assured you are in the right place.

Although we drove here from our hotel, I was able to find parking pretty easy. Your mileage may vary of course (we arrived around 9:00 PM)

For new patrons of Tacos El Gordo, things can be a bit confusing. There are actually three (3) different lines going. Two feeding into the restaurant from the outside and one on the inside which is closer to the restroom.

The two lines outside serve:

1) Carne Asada\/Chorizo
2) Adobada (marinated pork)

The line inside serves:

3) Everything else

One of the staff members does come out from time to time to remind people which line to get in - if you are here for the carne asada, it's the line all the way to the left of the restaurant (typically the longest line)

After waiting about 40 minutes, I ordered 12 Carne Asada Tacos to share with my group which came with onion and cilantro, non-spicy red sauce, and a generous helping of carne asada and guacomole. I only decided on 12 because if they were really that good and I was still hungry, I did NOT want to get back into that crazy line.

Refills are free with purchase of a soda! A definite plus for me.

Tacos El Gordo also takes credit cards, another plus!

The Carne Asada tacos were truly amazing. Featuring flame grilled steak and fresh ingredients, this is the perfect food to have anytime or right after a night of dancing and drinking. I think I ate at least 10 of these tacos.

Tacos El Gordo is definitely popular for good reason. Whenever you see long lines it's one of two things:

1) It's awesome

or

2) It's overrated

I'm happy to report that Tacos El Gordo is awesome and then some. Cheap and delicious food, free soda refills, and takes credit cards? This place is easily a winner.",1,1,1

After you order and get your tacos you go to a cash register to pay and get drinks (fountain, bottle, or can). If you are lucky to get a seat without waiting for others to finish, you can eat there.

My wife and I visit Las Vegas quite frequently and had decided to try a new place to eat that was recommended to her by a work colleague. However, she could not remember the name...only the general location. While walking on the strip looking for this particular eatery (which turned out to be the Peppermill that was a block up), we stumbled across Tacos El Gordo. A small hole in the wall place in front of a strip mall. The aroma of carne that filled the air and the amount of people that were going in and coming out immediately caught our attention. Since we were unable to find our original destination, we contemplated whether or not we should try this place. We were a little skeptical at first, not knowing what to expect since its surroundings were a far cry from the Wynn\/Encore where we had just come from. But my wife had checked on Yelp and surprisingly it got great reviews, so we figured what the heck! And boy, did it not disappoint!! My wife had gotten the soft tacos and I had the sopes. I could not believe my taste buds after the first bite! Amazing!! Mind you, I know Mexican food from my background and where I live, and this is the real deal. This is authentic, not gringo Mexican that you would think would be on the Las Vegas strip. Plus they have a variety of taco meats to choose from. And the prices? Extremely reasonable...a couple of bucks each. It was so good and inexpensive, we took my parents and and their local friends days later and they also agreed...delicious cheap eats!

This is definitely one of our new ""go-to"" places when in Vegas.",1,0,1

Food: Al pastor. Sliced off a huge spit of dripping marinated pork. Absolutely the crowd favorite. Warning, it is pretty spicey may not be sutable for young mouths. I tried all the meats because they all smelled so good! The second winner, the Lengua was nice and juicy and they give you a plentiful amount. Sadly the most disappointing meat was the Asada, it was the saltiest taco I've ever had. Maybe the cook had a bad day or an oopsie, but super sad because I knew the meat is tender and would have been delicious if I tasted more than just NaCl.
Ambience: Great drunchie meal, after a night at Surrender. Also great for families, in fact most of the patrons were families.
Price: Not as cheap as 1.50 a taco( they raised their prices) Still pretty cheap meal though! Around 10 for 3 tacos and a drink.

They have separate lines for different cuts of meat, so you might want to have someone else in your group stand in another line to get it all at the same time.

However, when you run out of your famous spicy pork\/al pastor before midnight, with 2 more hours of operation, it's hard not to be disappointed. It's even more disappointing when you dole out your last portion of spicy pork to one dude, who realized that he should order 20 tacos instead of the 4 he was originally going to get, because he can (though I guess I can't exactly fault the establishment for that).

So we decided to deal with it. While the tripa tacos I got were just as good (super delicious for those curious), they got my friend's order wrong (they gave him the asada instead of the tripa)... twice...

The food here is really good, but the restaurant itself leaves a lot to be desired.  First off, they have a chaotic system of ordering food on one side, then paying on the other side of the room.  It's not a common setup, and it seems you have to be a bit pushy to order your food.  People here seem to ignore you, or people cut in front of you.  It seems either people have bad manners or this restaurant has employees who only respond positively to other spanish speakers.  It could also be that my friend isn't the pushy rude type, but the people taking orders wouldn't acknowledge him.  

I think it's tragic that even though the food is pretty good, but the organization really sucks!  If you want one type of meat, you stand in one line, if you want another, then you have to stand in a different line.  They had 4 different lines!  I wish they would just handle orders in the back.  It's as if they think their employees are too dumb to handle orders of different types of meat.  He might mix up the carne asada with the adobada!  They look totally different, but who cares, my employees are too stupid to tell the difference!

 I really don't get it.  I might expect this sort of chaos at a food truck or an outdoor swap meet, but in a restaurant there's a much better way of running things.  It's not like the way they have things setup makes things faster or easier.  In fact, I could see someone easily ordering food and just walking out without paying because it would be impossible to tell who's paid and who hasn't especially when it is busy which it seems to be  during lunch and dinner hours.

I also found the prices to be a bit high in light of how terrible the service runs.  I'd understand paying more for food in a restaurant that is organized and nice, but with all the chaos and terrible service, I don't know why I""d pay any more than any taco truck.  Overall I'd say stay away unless you find the place mostly empty, then it wouldn't take you forever to order your food.

They shave the spicy pork straight from this tower of meat (imagine shawarma style) and every bite is juicy and delectable. The beef tongue is surprisingly soft. They also put a salsa that gives it a real kick on the tacos, so be prepared for that! To top it all off, this place is also crazily cheap.

My gf mentioned this place so we decided to check it out on Sunday before we headed back to LA. Parking is pretty big and the line was even bigger. Menu is pretty simple. Interesting was that the line forms in 4- 5 different sections. If you want pork then there's a line section just for pork, And same for beef and so on. It can get a little hectic and kind of sucks because you have to keep getting in different lines just to get a  few things. The pork line was pretty fast, my gf waited in the beef line for at least 30 min or more. 

_Taco de Adobadas (spicy pork taco $2.00) the most popular and the BEST! They slice the pork real thin right in front of you. The pork isn't too spicy but just enough flavor. The green sauce gives it a nice little kick and sweetness. Add some lime on top and it's the perfect bite. I could have had 3 of these.. oops already happened!
_Taco de Asada. (steak taco $2.00) I'm never a huge fan of beef taco because normally the beef comes out dry, But I thought this place may be different. Turns out I was right. The beef was a bit dry and after eating the pork taco the beef just did not cut it for me. I wish they added more guacamole sauce.
_Taco de Suadero (beef shoulder $2.00) The beef shoulder was a bit juicier than the steak taco.  I would pick this over the Asada but still the Pork is the best!
_Carne Asada fries ($10) huge portion. We shared this with myself and 3 other girls. It can get quite heavy and rich but so hard to put the fork down. I would do the Adobadas fries instead. 
_Adobadas Tostada. ($2.00) This was pretty good. The crunch factor from the tortilla was nice and the pork was again amazing!

I have been to the other Tacos El Gordo and we decided to try this one out since it is fairly closer to home.  The place is busy since it is on the strip.  

I actually took some time to look at the menu this time and noticed some interesting tacos such as beef tongue and beef brain.  I didn't think they would be appealing to me so I stuck with my usual; carne asada fries.  Full Size please..  Order first, pay after.  Seat yourself.  Also do remember to ask for hot sauce and mild sauce.  The other place I went to offered, but she could have just forgotten.  My carne asada fries looked wonderful as it usually does, layered with cheeses and two scoops of guacamole.  Obviously delicious since I ate it all.  Tender meat and skinny fries.  Not salted.. Fries a little crisp.. 

Now, I did reach over and picked a piece of brain from my friend's taco.. That was very interesting.. mushy and no flavor.. I was definitely better off with fries.  I guess you have to acquire a taste or demand for it.  But the tacos looked excellent from my view of the booth.

I am looking forward to the new expansion, so I don't have to stand in line as long. 

Not that I mind waiting, its worth it.",1,0,0

the bad:
#1 - they are expensive for being tacos
#2 - you have to stand in multiple lines depending on the type of tacos you want
#3 - you have to stand in line again to pay before you can eat.
the good:
#1 - tacos are good.
Tacos get 4 stars. place gets 3 stars at best.
You should be able to order your tacos at one time and pay there. it would cut down the time in line significantly so you don't have to eat cold tacos. or pay and then give the tacos person your receipt. I'm a genius, I know.",1,0,1

They have the best carne & pastor tacos here!!!! let me not forget to mention their carne asada fries!!!! My best friend & I ALWAYS order the carne fries and tacos with carne & pastor. The lines look long as they go out the doors but it goes buy very quickly! Word on the street is that this place is so good\/famous because they use pineapple slices in their pastor tacos and the juices from the fruit come dripping down from the top. The carne tacos are loaded with meat, cilantro, onions, and guac. The pastor is loaded with cilantro, onions, pineapple, and this yummy green sauce they have. 
THIS IS A MUST STOP FOR FOODIES, YELPERS, ANYONE WHO ENJOYS FOOD WHILE YOUR OUT IN VEGAS!!! COME & GET YOUR GRUB ON!!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SPOT!!!! KEEP UP THE GREAT HOSPITALITY & KEEP THE FOOD COMING! def a fan & will be continuing to return to this great spot for your delish food!",2,0,1

I'll say this, even a mediocre Tacos el Gordo taco bests 99% of another taco.  They're my favorite taco, and I'm nearly sure they'll be yours.  I honestly wouldn't miss the chance to eat here.  It's an authentic taste of real Tijuana tacos, without the fuss (or beheading) of a boarder crossing. 

I highly recommend you hit them up, for what's likely to be the best taco you've ever had.  Start with 4... but be ready for 6+... bring your stretchy pants people.",1,1,0

I had my boyfriend stand in line while I found a seat to rest my feet and apparently there are different sets of lines, I wanted pastor and he wanted asada, he came back with asada and had to go back in lkne and wait in other 30 minute line. I finally told him forget it and for him to come and eat his Tacos before they got cold. I was so mad that night i could cry I didn't end up eating.",0,0,0

The sauce and toppings really complete the perfect package.  Love the crispy tostadas as alternative to tacos.  Asada is fair.  I've been to all 3 locations in Vegas many times.  Sometimes the cashiers make the process too long esp on Las Vegas Blvd.  I've had experiences of rude cashiers.,0,0,0

We actually came for dinner before the club. There was a hugeass line. Each line serves a different kinda meat. I enjoyed the tripas and the spicy pork! Very tasty tacos but......... I ended up having food poisoning afterwards and yacking everything out. =( The tacos did tasted good though so I will return next time to give it another chance.,0,1,0

I've had tacos from all over LA and I can only compare this place to what I had before. This place is decent. It's nice that it opens until 4:00am on the weekends so you can go clubbing and then grub afterwards. Try going late at night and you'll be in line for 45+ minutes. 

There's also a sign that says you can't order if you don't have a shirt on. I was at night swim and ended up losing my shirt so I had to sit outside while my friends ordered for me. I look pretty fit and athletic with my shirt off, but they still said no. I hope management changes that rule soon...",0,1,0

The spicy pork taco was our absolute favorite, and when I say favorite, I mean we stayed in Vegas for four full days and went to this hole in the wall place four separate times for their tacos. We had dinner at really nice places and paid $200 for our meal, and this place outshines all other food on the strip at $2 a taco. I mean it. Go here. I am never going to be happy with another taco once I leave here. Absolutely amazing.",0,0,0

Luckily we went off peak hours.  But they were still so busy that my large order for the group couldn't be filled completely.  They were in such a rush that they handed me over to another cook and the order wasn't transferred fully.  

The meat was tender but the tortilla was bland and didn't hold the tacos together at all.  The sauce wasn't special.  Really disappointed about that.  Have eaten at many great taco places in and around Los Angeles.  This place doesn't stand out.  Would eat it again if someone had brought take out but will not stand in line for it.",0,0,0

Do yourself a favor and take an uber when you're in Vegas, you won't regret it. I can easily eat 6 to 7 of these whenever I get to go.

These are by far the best al pastor (adobada) tacos I've ever had period.
