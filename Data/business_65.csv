First off, the beer is fantastic. I love several of their brews, specifically the Peach Ale and Hop Knot. If there's a seasonal out at the time, try it. Even if it's not your style, you will appreciate how well crafted it is. 

The food is never bad. Never. I've had pizza, beer bread, burgers, appetizers, and wings and they have never let me down. It's probably some of the best pub food I've ever had. The fries are to die for. If you want a great appetizer for a group, go for the spinach dip. I swear the dish it comes in never goes empty and I'm not really joking. I once ordered one as my dinner, quickly became full and offered some to about 12 friends and we only were able to finish half. 

The place is insanely huge too. Lots of different areas to sit depending on your mood and all of them are great spots. I prefer the little covered patio area off to the side the best. 

It's true the Four Peaks is always busy, but I've never waited more than 5-10 minutes to be seated, even with a group of 7. Their service has never suffered with a crowded house.",1,0,2

True west coast style with huge wrap around patio surrounding a red brick compound.  Like literally, is this a micro brewery?

This original spot has the longest bar in the southwest.  So many famous brews I usually do the sun brew and miss the hefeweizen.

The food is off the chain, hot and flavorful! Homemade dressings, fresh fries, and beer bread please any picky brat.

I suggest the poutine- a newer item with fried cheese curds atop homemade fries with green chili pork!  It's almost too spicy!  I love it so much!

The chicken beer bread with the side salad and honey mustard dressing is my typical go to.  The fish & chips are decent but you know my French fry love.

Finally the ice cream cake!!!  Do it up and share a slice for $5 especially if it has anything pistachio or cherry.",2,2,3

Then, a waiter came to our table and said he was taking over for our waitress and all the guys were so disappointed.  When I asked what the big deal was, one guy said men don't take care of people like women.  I thought okay, maybe he has a point.

Well, he definitely did have a point.  The waiter was HORRIBLE.  Not attentive, we sat with empty glasses for at least 10 minutes before he noticed, and several times we had to flag him down for more drinks and napkins and our check.

I have had my share of four peaks beer and have always liked it, so had high expectations last night when I visited the actual Four Peaks Brewery for the first time.  My first stop was the seasonal beer, the Pumpkin Porter.  It was the perfect beer to kick off the fall season with.
Trouble came a little further down the line when I got my burger, which I ordered medium, and it was completely well done.  I got fries with it, which were average.  
I don't like to hate on servers because I am in the food industry, but our server seemed like she was having a really shitty night or something, which happens to everybody, I know, but part of your job as a server is to pretend you don't hate being a server.  
To sum it all up, I'd go back to Four Peaks for beer.  And maybe a plate of nachos or something, but I found the food to be overwhelmingly average.  Maybe my expecations were too high.  I'll probably just take a growler to go.",2,2,0

It's so hard in today's generic corporate driven society to find a place that takes pride in their product like you do, brewing eight varieties of beer on a regular basis and creating new and exciting seasonal brews with the tender loving intimacy that only a small business can provide. You deserve an incredible amount of credit for that. 

My question for you is: do they all have to taste assy?

I mean, I know some people like the taste of your Arizona Peach ale, but the last time I tried it I did something uncharacteristic. I didn't even finish the whole thing. It smelled like country time heaven, but it tasted like fetid peach bile. Your IPA, Hop Knot, and Oatmeal Stout give me bitter beer face, but since they're supposed to have strong character and flavor, I accept this inevitability and leave them to someone who will love them with all the passion they deserve. And it seems like your Kiltlifter exists only to get me plowed in record time, at about 6% alcohol by volume, so that's a good thing and means it's bound to be strong like a bull, so I can accept the ass factor. 

When it boils down to it, the only beers you have on tap that seem fit for my consumption are the 8th Street Ale and the Hefewiezen. But even those leave me with a hang over the next morning. 

Did I do something wrong? Is that why you don't like me? Is that why you feel it necessary to have your beer drill its way into my skull and leave me with a headache the morning after, regardless of the fact that the fancy imports and run of the mill domestic beers I consume at other bars don't even cause me to blink an eye? I thought we had a pretty solid relationship, but since I haven't been visiting you that often, I guess you've had a change of heart.

So I'll make a concerted effort to swing by for happy hour every now and then to share a pitcher between 3 and 7, but only when somebody else suggests we visit. You just seem to slip through the cracks whenever my little barfly mind starts thinking up fun places to enjoy a couple brews after work. (Luckily that isn't the case when my grumbling stomach does the talking, because your food is delicious and would be a terrible thing to miss out on!)

I think it may also have something to do with your patio, which is unwelcoming and a freakin' madhouse at all times of the day. Provided I can get one, those gigantic square tables only let me chat with the people to either side of me. And I'm practically sitting in the lap of the people behind me, causing me to maneuver like a slinky snake just to get out of my chair and weasel my way to the restroom. Doesn't this piss off your servers? Because I'd be pissed off if my job was to pick my way through that maze on a regular basis. Maybe that's why sometimes I get poor service on the patio, because your indoor and side car dining areas have always had the most attentive ladies waiting on me. I guess I have a serious love hate thing going on with your patio, Peaks.

Granted, the food you offer is phenomenal, especially for a place that calls itself a brewery. You have gone above and beyond the basic need for chex mix and peanuts on the bar, or fried greasy food that's on par with bowling alley eats. You offer some amazing and delicious dishes. 

One of my favorites is your Southwest Burger with pepper jack cheese and green chili that is positively rockin' with flavor, but the sweet jalapeno dressing tastes a little meh, so I get it on the side when I'm a little iffy about the funk factor of my burger. 

You do have one stand out menu item that everyone should bow down to though, and that is the Grilled Chicken Beer Bread. It is a soft pillowy tribute to chickens everywhere. If they could speak...well they'd berate you for eating them, so we'll consider it a posthumous tribute. Or perhaps it's a tribute to the amazing artichokes and peppers. And the sauce drizzled in this dish is the perfect accompaniment.

Also, your beer battered fries are off the hook good.

So at least you've got that going for you. 

I'll be seeing you around Peaks. I just won't be singing your praises on a regular basis.

Cheers!
Erica",6,11,8

We got a pitcher of the white ale for $16 - easy to drink and fantastic by the way.

We had the veggie pizza $12.50 and a bowl of fries $6. The pizza was full of pesto goodness and the French fries were perfectly crisp! I remember coming her a few months ago and we had the spinach artichoke dip. It was good, however just a little bit too much in terms of heaviness.

Four Peaks and I have had the most amazing relationship over the past four years. We were first introduced back in 2007. It was the summer before my senior year of college and I was barely 21. It was not love at first sight. Oh, no no. I was new to the world of beer and it wasn't my beverage of choice (though a Peach Ale on a hot night was always delicious).

But this isn't a place you go to solely for the beer.  Good food was nothing new to me, and this is where Four Peaks really shines. My friends would get together and drink, and I would eat. And eat. And eat. Hummus, pizza, bruchetta (you have to get the shrimp and goat cheese!), burgers, fries. My heart flutters for their Salmon BLT.

And then I got into beer. This is when Four Peaks and I began our unstoppable love. I'm truly lucky to live close enough to stop by regularly, but far enough away to not become a fat alcoholic. All of the beers are perfect in their own way, my choice always depends on my mood and what I'm eating. And don't miss the cask conditioned selections! Always interesting.

The atmosphere completes the trifecta of awesomeness, with the indoor\/outdoor feel and giant brewery equipment looming in the background.

Atmosphere:  Warm, cozy, relaxing, casual, down-to-earth.  Good, fun loving vibes for ALL ages.  This is a true diamond in the rough among a landscape of corporate fugazis. Music choices are great but speaker system needs an upgrade in clarity.

Staff:  Friendly, professional, efficient, abundant, ubiquitous.

Appetizers:  Favorite:  Arizona Chicken Rolls.  Noteworthy:  Thai Hummus, 5 Layer Nacho Dip, Panko Crusted Calamari.

Food:  Consistently great!  Diverse, upper scale comfort\/bar food in ample portions. The fantastic daily specials keep this regular coming back obsessively.  Favorites: Carne Adovada, Southwest Burger, Salmon BLT, Italian Beef Beer Bread, Reuben.

Drink:  Various micro-brews of delightful, world-class quality.  Favorite beer:  Hop Knot IPA.  Noteworthy beers: Arizona Peach, Oatmeal Stout, Pumpkin Porter (autumn only).  

Other:  Parking is abundant.  However, unless you're lucky, you'll have to park about 60 yards down the road or down the back alley ;)  It's worth the walk.

When to go:  Weekend lunch on the patio; especially in spring and fall.

Four Peaks is everything a Brewery and Restaurant should be!

I came here for a late lunch before the ASU football game this past saturday. Yes, the place was packed, but we were luckily seated within ten minutes.

As far as beer goes, this place can do no wrong. Everything I sampled was very well balanced and had a great flavor. I highly recommend the pumpkin porter for a unique beer that is very fitting for the Fall season. Both IPA's are also top notch.

We were rather hungry so we started with the nachos and the chicken rolls.

The rolls were extremely rich and had great flavor. The jalapeno dressing gave the dish a nice spice. Be careful to not fill up on these because they are rather large and quite filling, but DAMN good.

The nachos were huge! Chips, cheese, beans, tomato and jalapenos. The chips were extra cheesy and everything worked well. Needed avocado though..

For my entree I decided on the southwest burger. The burger consisted of 1\/2 pound beef patty cooked to a perfect medium rare. The usual lettuce and tomato. A green chili with that same sweet jalapeno dressing I had with my rolls. I also added my friends chipotle ranch which went beautifully with the rest of the accompaniments.

 Overall the burger was pretty darn good. Granted it wasn't the best burger I have ever had or a taste revelation, but pretty great for bar food.

Overall I was very pleased with four peaks. My friends hyped up the place like crazy and I was not disappointed. The food was certainly a step above regular bar food, but not quite as unique or adventurous as some of the gastropubs I have sampled in California in Chicago. If you are in the mood for even just a beer or some delicious and unique bar food, do not hesitate one bit to check this place out.",0,0,1

Full disclosure: I'm not a fan of beer.  That fact will not affect my opinion of the establishment!  

The food really is good.  I've never been disappointed, and there are items on the menu I haven't had a chance to try that I think I'll enjoy.

Service has been so-so.  Regardless of the level of busy-ness, I've seen a mixed bag of friendly, polite, personable servers, and stressed out, slow moving servers.  Bathroom cleanliness is iffy, if you consider that sort of thing. 

My beer-loving friends and boyfriend love Four Peaks for the local beer, and new seasonal options that always live up to the micro-brew reputation.  It is cool how knowledgeable all the staff are as to their beers and pairings, and several of them have even tried to recommend something new to me, hoping to convert me to beer-ism.  

I don't think I've ever been here when it wasn't crowded.  I'd say that speaks equally to the quality of the beer and food, and to the susceptibleness of ASU students who ""have to go"" to Four Peaks.  Although, if I lived at ASU or close by and could ride a bike or something, that would improve my opinion slightly as I could avoid fighting the good parking fight.  A little walking never killed anyone, but the parking situation here is a little out of control.  

Walk or carpool, try a new beer, pair it with an appetizer, and enjoy yourself.  I'll pop in once in a while :)",2,2,2

If you are familiar with Arizona, you'll know that being outdoors is either the best idea or the worst idea based on the time of day. Four Peaks offers you convenience of indoor or outdoor seating and plenty of room for you and your friends.

I have to rant about their food. All of their appetizers are delicious. I haven't had a drink I didn't enjoy. Their hamburgers are out of this world. Their fried foods are excellent. Their salads are so big and filling. You can't go wrong.

There are two sets of restrooms. Service can be flaky. On Fri\/Sat, show up 30 minutes before you want to be seated, and enjoy a drink at the bar. Make sure you bring your ID as you will be carded. They are not afraid to destroy the iffy fake ID cards. The atmosphere is excellent because it is near the college but draws adults of all ages. It's a fantastic place to relax. EXTREMELY good for groups! Just be sure to show up early.

I had a delicious chef salad and a side of their beer bread.  I'm not kidding - it was one of my favorite lunches I've had EVER!  The salad was fresh and the sweet jalapeno dressing combined with the turkey, hard boiled egg, tomato, cucumber, greens, bleu cheese, and candied walnuts made every bite delicious!

I tried a couple of their beers and enjoyed them all but the Pumpkin Porter probably stood out.  It was nice malty beer that really worked with the earthy-ness of the pumpkin.  The ESB as described was unique as it was a hoppy beer but had a good malty background and a nice color.  The peach ale was a good sweet fruity beer not too light as some can be.  Their famous Kilt Lifter was a good representation of the standard red ale.

The food was good on two visits I tried the Beer bread italian beef sandwich with a side salad and their blue cheese burger.  The flat bread sandwich was full of meat and cheese and the side salad was.HUGE (though with that they told me I was lucky as they are not normally that big).

They do a really delicious vegetarian wrap-type of sandwich but I forget what it's called. However, what I REALLY want to highlight is that they have the MOST AMAZING Fish n Chips that I've had anywhere in Arizona so far! the batter is nice and crunchy but not too thick and it comes with fries\/British style ""chips"" (not like Dave'n'Busters version of Fish n Chips where they actually give you chips) and tartar sauce...mmmmmmmmm! that's the way it should be!

The Bleu Light Special Burger is my favorite burger on the menu. Get it with the beer battered fries; they're to die for.

I also love the Five Layer Nacho Dip with Chicken. Just make sure you bring an Army with you (four or more of your buds), because the portion size is ginormous. 

The Brickhouse Wings are just OK. 

Still need to try the legendary Salmon BLT!

Bring your growler - Trust me, you'll want to bring some beer home. 

The only downside is, they can't fill growlers with Oatmeal Stout (love this one the most out of all their beers ) - something about it not keeping fresh. :(

It was not that quick, because even on Tuesday the place was packed, but as all the reviews state, the food was good and my family members enjoyed the beer.  I never acquired the taste for beer so I tried one of their ""craft cocktails"" per the waitress' suggestion.  This particular craft cocktail added muddled blueberries, blueberry vodka, and sweet and sour to the beer.  It ended up tasting like carbonated sweet and sour blueberry candy, and there is nothing wrong with that.

The waitress also helped my nephew (a food engineer) choose a hamburger.  He agreed with her, in front of his empty plate, that it was a good burger.  It was very tall.

There was one moment when my half-full craft cocktail and nearly full water cup sat in front of me. Across the table, a half-full beer and a half-full water cup sat across from my nephew.  Without any sudden movements, wild gesturing, movement of the table, person passing by, gust of wind, or flying bird - an almost filled cup fell on the floor. We were all startled by the loud sound of the glass breaking. The staff didn't miss a beat; seconds later, the glass and ice cubes were swept up and the floor was being mopped.  But, it begged the question, where did this random falling glass come from?  No one was missing a water cup or drink.  Nor did anyone see or feel the glass fall off the table.  Less than one minute later, the exact same thing happened at a few tables behind us!  Rumor is that the old building, which used to be a creamery, is haunted.

Great chicken strips, fish and chips, French dip sandwich, and burgers are all fantastic. You WILL be full after eating a main course here, so don't bother getting the pricey appetizers.

The beer is top-notch, being brewed literally in the back of the restaurant where you can see. Some of the best beer I've ever had is at four peaks. No crappy beers here at all. The beer tastes available here are vast (even though there are only about 10 choices), so find a beer that suites your tastes. For example, lots of people don't like the Hop Knot because it's too hoppy, but I think it's wonderful. 

PRICE: My bill at Four Peaks piles up pretty quick if I'm not careful. Main courses are around $8-10, beers are $3.75 ($3 at happy hour). Beer prices are great relative to other bars, but for a college student on a limited budget, Four Peaks prices can be a little high especially if you frequent the place. 

SERVICE: Has its ups and downs. For the vast majority of the time, waiters and bartenders are nice and helpful, and you get your food in about 15 min, so get a beer to pass the time. When in groups, I recommend paying with cash to makes things easier. Don't give some cash and some cards, it has confused them a couple times. 

SKINNY: I love this place!!! Lively, warm atmosphere, great food and beer. I don't understand why more college students don't flood this place, it's right next to ASU. I go to Four Peaks several times a month to hang out with friends over a beer or two. Truly one of Tempe's gems.",2,2,2

I happened across Four Peaks and made the comment to my colleagues that if I lived in Phoenix - and I would love to - this would be my hangout. 

Plenty of outdoor seating and lots of indoor seating. Fast, friendly service and lots of good vibes in the air. But the main attraction and star of the show is of course, the beer. 

I had a blonde ale and honestly could have drank about 10 of those suckers. But I was driving so alas, I had to be constrained. As it was, I knocked back 3 of those along with some wings and some beer bread appetizer that they make 2x a month. 

The wings were zingy and delicious. I got half with the peanut Thai sauce and the other with the hot buffalo sauce and blue cheese dressing. And since I hate celery, got a double helping of carrots. I was not a fan of the Thai sauce at first. But once I went back to it, I loved it. I especially loved rolling the carrots in the Thai sauce. Don't know why. I just did. And the blue cheese dressing had to be homemade. Lots of blue cheese in there and nice and rich. 

And it all went with the beer sooooo well. And man, that beer was perfectly chilled and so damn fresh I felt as if the beer meister (is that the word?) just got through brewing it up. 

On the menu were about 10 or 12 types of beer but since it was hot and I wanted wings, I wanted a blonde ale. It went perfectly with the wings. 

One more thing. I would prefer a little more sauce on those wings but I'm sure I could have asked for some. I just loved the beer so much that I didn't really give a damn about the sauce.

Aside from the beer the food is AMAZING.  I love the brunch they have every weekend.  Enchilada and eggs are my fav so far.

The service here is exceptional. Our waitress was very prompt with bringing our drinks and food, and even with clearing our table. We enjoyed the peach ale and the Mexican coffee stout. We also tried the hefe. We enjoyed them all. The  peach ale was very peachy. The stout was chocolate and coffee flavored. The hefe tasted as described, with a strong banana aroma and flavor. We kinda felt that the same yeast was used on the hefe and the stout, as the stout had clover and banana flavors as well. Never the less, both were quite enjoyable. The fries are amazing, thick and flaky. We had the southwest burger and the chicken beer bread. The chicken beer bread is listed under sandwiches, but is much closer to a wrap. Instead of a tortilla, it is wrapped in a thick fluffy gordita style wrap. The southwest burger was not too spicy with a jalapeño aloli, and we liked pouring chipotle ranch over it. The burger was a little dry, even though we ordered it medium rare. Over all, we enjoyed the food, drinks, and service. Wish we would have happened to come for happy hour!

This place started in 1996 as a craft brewery when it wasn't cool to be into craft beer. Check this out, my dad have been coming here since then. Great place and I can't say much about the food but it's been good but as far as the beer: awesome! 

Arizona is just starting to tap the keg as far as getting respect in beer and this is place is the one to start at. Their go to is the kilt lifter which is a good start if your not into craft beer.  We got into some other stuff, namely the Raj: an IPA, which lives up to its name, puts you in a hoptastic trance on the get go before you get into their other journeys. Try the Tandoori Raj, you'll want to eat some chicken tandoori with this one with hints of saffron on this one. Amazing


We were then instructed to try the oatmeal stout on cask, yep awesome. Go for it, it's not a meal it's a journey in toasted hops, best stout in Arizona. There was the same version with chai accents which in my opinion was better than the cask. 

They had the next tasting room, and it's a new fresh breath from the traditional brewery food and brew standard. We got hooked up with a flavor of a few brews, and we were grateful.

My friend, and Airline Transport Pilot was eager to try Four Peaks per my recommendation.  My friend and I had an appetizer, two entrees, and one Kilt-Lifter beer each.  The problem was the service.

-  I asked bartender for the check after dinner.
-  Bartender leaves check. 
-  I pay the check and leave a cash 20% tip.  
-  We are stopped by the large bouncer at the door and the bartender yelling we didn't pay our checks.

At this point, I have never been so embarrassed.  There must have been a mistake.  I have an 840 credit score - I pay my bills; my friends is arguably higher than mine.  My friend an I walk back to the bar to find out where the wheels fell off.  I pull out my receipt to show where I had paid.  The bartender produces a second tab that is unpaid; the first my friend and I had seen of this.  We paid the second tab and left.  

Here's what went sideways from my perspective:

1.  The bartender mixed the tabs all up; I had paid for my friends tab, appetizer, and two beers thinking this was the whole tab.
2.  The bartender never produced a second bill until he had the bouncer yell to stop us.
3.  The bartender ignored us upon return, and our attempts to resolve the issue.  
4.  The bartender's only comment was, ""You asked for separate checks"".  I did not ask for separate checks.

Here's what actually transpired from bartender's perspective:

1. Bartender mistakenly thinks I asked for two checks
2. Bartender delivers one check that is wrong with most of the stuff on it.
3. Bartender gets busy in cross tasks and forgets to deliver second check. 
4. Bartender realizes his mistake, has bouncer stop us, but does not admit to what actually happened for fear of reprisal hoping we will not notice.  We noticed.   

Here's how the situation could have been completely avoided:

1.  Bartender stops us and admits mistake.  Stops us when we are obviously struggling to figure out what he did.  We pay.  We leave happy. 

Summary:
Four Peaks, you wasted 10 minutes of my time with a good friend to figure out where you went wrong to cover your mistake - never admitting fault, treating us like we did this on purpose.  For that, you get a bad review.  I hope this review is helpful to the general manager.",3,1,0

I visited your Tempe location with my girlfriend (an avid Four Peaks fan) and a friend.  I can honestly say I may never return - reason being how your bouncer treated me upon entering. I understand I look young (I'm 24 years old with a baby face) - that plus my height (I'm short) makes many bouncers look at my ID twice. What bouncers have never done, until my visit to Four Peaks, is treat me with intense suspicion and contempt while parading my ID around to five other employees (and a manager) loudly asking ""does this look real?!"" Yes, guy (who looked YOUNGER than me), it is real. It's a California ID, as I literally just moved here with my girlfriend two weeks ago, but it is definitely real.

Not that that fact mattered - I was treated rudely and with suspicion and made to feel like a criminal just for trying to come get a beer and chat with a friend. I was made to sign a form, like a criminal, without being told what it was or why I had to sign it. By the end of this incompetent parade I was embarrassed and ready to just walk out and go somewhere else - the only reason I didn't was because the rest of my group wanted to stay.

California ID's are easy to validate. Just carry a black light. The treatment I endured (for almost 10 minutes) just to enter was unacceptable. Either let me in or don't let me in. Since I don't feel like enduring that treatment a second time, I don't think I'll be back any time soon (if ever) but consider retraining your bouncers and coming up with a much better method for finding fake ID's so you don't embarrass others like you embarrassed me. California borders Arizona - one can assume you see quite a few CA ID's every week. Why mine was treated differently than my girlfriend's (also a CA ID) I'll never know. 

But buy a damn blacklight flashlight. It's an easy, quick way to validate a CA ID WITHOUT completely embarrassing your (legal, of age) patron in the process.

The fact that I have to be be one to suggest that is asinine. You're the bar. You should know that already.",1,0,1

With that said, the beer (yes, I got a seasonal craft) was good. Not much to not like about a Pumpkin Porter. The food was good as well.

Three things were odd. The servers in our area kept going over to a particular table and eating off their plates. Friends I guess? Regulars? Guys hitting on them? Famished? No idea... but it came off as odd. Secondly, in the evening they pull the sun shades down and the place almost looks closed. Parking is kind of odd too - had to park in the ""back"" and walk around.

The patio is where I prefer to sit, when it's available.   Inside at the bar can be pretty loud during peak hours, making conversation with the person next to you difficult.   The factory industrial setting is nice, not something you get a lot of in Phoenix.  Kinda reminds me of how the Bridgeport Brewery in Portland used to be, before they remodeled and made it all fancy-pants.  Bridgeport, if you're reading this, why didn't you just keep the vestigial loading dock on the building, why??

Anyhow, seeing as how the Valley of the Sun\/Phoenix megametropolitan\/whatever the hell you want to call it area, has a total of something like four locally owned brewpubs, and I love brewpubs, this place rates high on my list.

Finally my husband and I visited a couple of times on off peak hours, and it was totally worth it.

I don't think I've ever tried a Four Peaks beer I didn't like, but I particularly recommend the Raj IPA and Kiltlifter.

As for the food, I really loved the Southwest burger I got on the first visit. Nothing makes me feel like I've wasted a huge chunk of my daily caloric intake more than a burger with a sad unseasoned patty, but the patty here was cooked perfectly medium on the inside with a delicious char on the outside. The jalapeno dressing was tasty as well. The fries were also excellent. I don't think I've ever had beer-battered fries before, but if I were on a stranded island with Four Peaks beer-battered fries trees, I think I could live with that.

And although I typically love burgers more than life itself, on the second visit I got a Salmon BLT. I'm probably never going to get a burger again because this BLT was so good. I love salmon anyway, but it still had a balanced amount of B, L, and T, which I can barely ever find on a BLT that doesn't have salmon on it.

This place is huge and literally astounding to look at. The building is over a hundred years old and has so much history and culture. The second you walk in you can smell the sweet aromas of the beers brewing; it's an actual brewery. The open seating area is surrounded by these huge brass kettles which are super cool to look at. We were approached by the waitress quickly after being seated and she took our order: spinach artichoke dip and the pub parmesan. 

The spinach artichoke dip was served with both pita chips and corn chips. The dish was a traditional mix of spinach, artichoke hearts, cream cheese, sour cream, possibly mayo and parmesan, of course. The dip was super creamy and rich; definitely a good item to share because it was a pretty large portion. I would re-order without a doubt. 

The chicken parm sandwich was breaded chicken breast topped with pesto aioli, house marinara, and a three cheese blend in between a toasted baguette. I was craving something cheesy and saucy and this was the one that stood out to me. The sandwich itself was okay, not the best chicken parm I've tasted but not the worst either. Somewhere in between delicous and meh. The sandwich came with a huge pile of fries, which I asked for extra crispy. The fries were tasty, but it takes a lot to mess up fries.

Four Peaks Brewing is a place to visit if you're into beer and even if you're not into beer and would like a chance to hang in a historic brewery. Again, the ambiance was unbeatable. It was pretty packed for a Thursday afternoon so I can imagine how busy this place gets on weekends. The service and food were decent, the ambiance was awesome but the parking tough!

I had a stout, and I can't remember the name but it was really good.  Our server was very patient and sweet while all eight of us ordered different stuff, wanting to add\/leave out the mushrooms, etc.  She got everything right and came to check on us multiple times.  We made sure to give her a very generous tip.

My fiance and I had the garlic cheesey bread as an appetizer and split a vegetarian pizza for our meal (and I also ordered a side salad- I was starving!)

The cheesey bread was loaded with garlic- so beware.  I'm a huge fan so I was loving the huge chunks of fresh garlic mixed with delicious cheese, but if you were expecting garlic ""flavor"", it might be a bit strong.

The pizza had a great variety of vegetables, and a pesto sauce which was great.  The only drawback is that it was incredibly salty, and I think that was a result of the sodium in the pesyo and the artichoke hearts on the pizza.

I don't like beer (even though I keep trying to convince myself), but will never stop me from coming here! The food is absolutely delish! My go-to is the chicken beer bread sandwich.

They have enormous hearty salads and other really good dishes too, but I still can't veer from that sandwich- which is easily big enough for 2 to share.

Oh, and how could I forget about dessert? There is an oatmeal stout milkshake that is different, yet oh-so-good, even for those that despise beer (this has been tested out).

I specifically asked for no mushroom, and the server double checked right after I said it, so I know he heard me, but the food I received had mushroom in it. Not only that, when I was eating the leftovers at home, I bit down on something that was unchewable--turned out to be an entire edamame pod.

Although it has become more of a restaurant than brewpub when they removed the pool table\/relaxing area and made more seating; it's still a great place to sit and talk, catch up with old(or make new) friends, or watch the game. 
The Raj IPA is my personal favorite but Kiltlifer and HopKnot are other local favorites. First time there? Get their sampler and decide for yourself, their seasonals are also excellent! Happy hour (regular and reverse) are definitely the time to go for $ deals, but be warned this is a popular hangout for regulars. 
Four Peaks food was a lot better a couple of years ago, but their flavors are still well done. My fav starter or small bite is their spinach-artichoke dip that comes with beer bread (small pita bites made with beer) and tortilla chips. Perfect to share with one or two people. My favorite main dish is the salmon BLT but check out their specials online ahead of time before heading in, these are usually delicious things you can't find on the menu. 
Another thing that's not on their menu is grilled cheese. I know, as simple as it may seem theirs is delicious and goes great with their soup of the day for something a little less filling. Don't forget to add avacado and tomoato! 
Also, they do brunch on the weekends. Used to just be for holidays that fell on those days but now it seems to be a usual thing. Haven't been in awhile but from what I remember it's special dishes or buffett style. You chose.

She practically threw the food onto the table and gave us attitude whenever we ask for more water or napkins. She was horrible! I can say the same for the guy who went around refilling water.

Their food is on par with most brew pubs... delicious.  I usually go with the beer bread chicken sandwich or with a daily special.  Every now and then they have an espresso bbq sauce that is amazing.  Oh, get the sweet jalepeno sauce to dip your fries into.

Reason to take away 1 star?  Their servers.  Every now and then you will get a good server, but there are some bad ones.  Please, if you are server at a brewery, know what the seasonal is, know what you have on cask, and don't argue with the customer.  I've had to convince the server that they had hopsquatch before.  

The time a server really pissed me off is when I went with a big group.  The barley wine had just come out and a couple people ordered some glasses.  Others were intrigued so I ordered them samples of it.  Well, the server got confused and brought another full glass of one.  I informed him right then and there that we just wanted a sample.  His response was ""oh, someone will drink it, don't worry about it"".  Well, it sat at the table, got sipped on till 1\/2 was gone (this beer is served in small glass).   When the check came, it had the price of the barley wine.  I told him that we didnt order that, and didnt even drink it all.  He got extremely defensive and said that if we didnt want to pay for it, then we should of let it sit at the table and not touch it... whaaaaaa?  Are you serious?

Update -
Since the last time I reviewed Four Peaks was in 2011, I better revamp my review. Four Peaks Peach Ale is my FAVORITE beer. The brewery has a few new menu items - the Happy Hour Charred Brussels Sprouts are a good start. I now order the Chicken Beer Bread or Kale Salad. My hubby's only menu item he gets is STILL the Salmon B.L.T. after 5 years he hasn't found one that is close to it.

Best comedy or musical. Best director. Well, if ""best local brewery"" were a category, I think Four Peaks would win, hands down. Of course, I haven't been to every single brewery here in Phoenix, but I have been to enough bars to know that there's something endearing and cool about Four Peaks. Perhaps as a stand-alone bar, it would be mediocre. The fact that it's a local brew house makes it even cooler. It's like the average guy getting a thousand dollar make over. He just looks fabulous, doesn't he? 

Gotta love the exposed brick walls, the open yet enclosed feeling of the layout with tables surrounding the bar area, which is in the center. The ceilings are high. The TVs are dedicated to sports. The huge chalk board boasts a diverse menu. There's also a pretty big patio out front. The doorman was nice - even humorous. I was instantly ""in like"" with this place. 

Four Peaks has quite the crowd of fans, too. Be weary if you plan to hit this place up on a Friday around 8. You'll bump head-first into the ""happy hour meets dinner crowd."" No bueno if you're looking for a seat at the bar. Good luck finding a table, too. You might as well just order yourself a beer and find somewhere to stand out of the way of the bus boys and friend clans. Interestingly enough, as dinner time expires, the crowd thins. Finding a seat at the bar around 9 and 9:30 at night becomes less of a challenge. Did you take note of that? You should. I'm sayin' this: don't be afraid to mosey up to Four Peaks around 10 o'clock. It's less crowded than if you came two hours earlier. Trust me on this one. 

Also, bring all the good karma you can find. You'll need it to find a parking spot on the street that's a short walk to the front door. Otherwise, you may have to put your peds to good work. Not that it's a big deal, unless it's a frosty January night or muggy\/bright\/furiously hot summer day. 

Beer's are cheap, too. Under $3 for their Oatmeal Stout, which is my brew of choice. Sure, I bet the others are worth their weight, but once I find what works for me, I stick with it. So, if you go and you find something worth drinking, let me know.

Two complaints. 

1. When I entered, the bouncer was at the front gate as usual, but I didn't realize because he made no attempt to ID me when I started entering. Halfway to the table he grabbed my arm and asked me for my ID. I didn't realize we needed ID's for 12:30 on a Sunday when there were about 15 screaming children running around the place, but I digress. The bouncer grabbed my arm, he didn't say anything to me, he didn't even notice I was being seated because he was looking the opposite direction not paying attention. Being forcefully touched by someone you don't know is jarring. I was PISSED. Here's some other tactics to ask for my ID that would have been more appreciated: asking me nicely, smoke signals, getting my waiter to ID me, saying ""excuse me"", paying attention and doing it when I was standing next to you, carrier pigeons. Really anything but grabbing my arm and making me want to deck you in the face.

I had no idea what the beer batter bread was, but I saw a lot of good reviews about it so I went for it.

I paid for my food, and put my food in a take out box. Then I left for the bathroom. When I returned, my table had been busted, and my food was gone and tossed. Feels so wasteful...

Chicken Rolls (5+ stars): Unbelievable.  Like an amazing spring roll with warm spiced finely shredded chicken and cream cheese on the interior, served with a sweet jalapeño cream dipping sauce.  I could feel the dopamine surging in my happy brain with every bite.

Nachos (5 star): Also awesome, these nachos have been ranked as among the ""Top 20"" Nachos in the United States.  They are made by the blackened chicken they put all over them.

Came in and it was pretty packed already, with the sun going down after a huge Laker victory (that's right I said it :D) I'm sure the people in there were drinking away their sorrows as yet again the Suns fail to proceed to the Finals. But enough NBA drama, we were seated towards the back where it literally resembled a warehouse. We're talking about pallets with hops, and giant steel brewing machines brewing up the house beers. 

Our friends recommended the Peach Brew Beer which had a very strong peach taste to it but still a pretty interesting taste. A buddy and I split of pitcher of it before placing our orders. I decided to go with the French Dip tonight with fries. The sandwich came out split perfectly in half with cheese laced throughout the tender meat, I was salivating at this point. 

The Au Jus was hot and salty, very good, I took my first bite and literally a scream of joy exited my mouth as I was trying to chew. One of THE best French Dip's I've had in a long long time. I made sure all of my friends took a bite to confirm my theory.

All of their beers are worth trying, since they brew them there you're not going to get them anywhere outside of AZ, as far as I'm aware.  If you don't know where to start, for $9 you can order the sampler, and get a tiny glass of each kind of beer they brew, then decide for yourself.

Quite the impressive-looking establishment, and as other reviews have stated, very busy. 

Sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and let me sample both the regular Kilt Lifter and the seasonal Bonehead Red. Both tasted very good and confirmed that they indeed still make very legit beer, and maybe the 6-pack I bought just went sour. It's traveling from 2-hours away after all. I also ordered some happy hour rib tips w\/slaw. Both the BBQ glaze and slaw were very sweet, and I forgot how much more boney rib tips are.

Beer - You can see it being brewed. Pretty cool thing to have. Their classic 8 are always good and I have never had a bad seasonal. 

Service - Great with smaller groups of like 6 or less. Most of the waitstaff are friendly and approachable. Most of them have great suggestions when you ask and give fun, light conversation. I personally have not had the best luck when in a bigger group of say 8 or more. 

Atmosphere - It has this crazy way of being a crowded sports bar and restaurant at the same time. I personally love it. Now, I PERSONALLY would not bring kids into this place but people still do it all the time.

Service was great, as always!  Food was delicious! I had the breakfast Brickhouse burger, perfect for when you can't decide between breakfast or lunch.  The beers were tasty and refreshing as well.  Four Peaks is probably one of my favorite places to go in the valley!

If you are visiting the Phoenix area or haven't been to Four Peaks yet, just go.

I will caution that there can be a wait, especially when the weather is good. Parking can be a challenge, but if you are willing to persevere, get that parking space and possibly wait a bit to be seated, you will be handsomely rewarded!
If you love patios, the wait will likely be longer, but the inside seating area is quite expansive if you don't care where you sit.
Lastly, if beers like Miller lite and Bud are in your wheelhouse, then I would suggest this may not be the place for you, unless you're open to trying new things.

The burger: great fries, enjoyed the onion strings. The jalapenos bit. The cream cheese was ok and had an unusual texture. The burger itself didn't stand out.

The beer: I had asked for the Scottish and the Hop Knot. The waitress wasn't sure what the second one was, so she gave a third. That was also good, though all three seemed light weight on the tongue.

Sadly they no longer have the ""kilt lifter filet"" we saw here on yelp - which is surprising considering how highly it was rated. So, we ordered the wings (which they let us do with all three sauces), and the nachos with the added blackened chicken. Someone on here said they were a ""top 10"" nacho in the USA, but I'd challenge that. Sure, they were good and a great size (huge), but top 10, I think not! The chips were all super super oily and there was a crazy amount of cheese - though I'm not complaining, I know that's how most people like them... The chicken on it was good. Under the chips, the tray (entire tray) had a THICK sheet of oil. Like I could drag my finger through it and where my finger ran would have immediately filled back up with oil. So, super super oily overall. They serve the sour cream, salsa, and ""layer"" dip was served in a bowl on the side (beans, jalapeños, olives and tomatoes) which helps keep it from getting soggy. 

The Thai peanut wing sauce at first taste was spicy and very interesting. I wasn't sure at first, but it grew on me and I really liked it in the end - and I don't usually do well with spicy. The barbecue sauce was just thick and sweet BBQ sauce, and the buffalo had medium spice and was really tasty. They also let us order a ""half order"" of fries which were delicious and plentiful.

For desert we tried the ""Stoutimisu"" which was like a HUGE towering price of chocolate cake with layers including oatmeal stout soaked ladyfingers, rich chocolate mouse or ganache, a mild and pleasant layer of espresso soaked cake and chocolate icing with shavings. It's served with dollops of whipped cream, chocolate sauce and some chocolate shavings. Very very rich! It was fantastic and with the $6 price point, it's a great value. Now, if they served it a la mode, that would absolutely send it over the top!!!!

Overall, it's a GREAT place to come and everything we tried was good or great. I wish they still had that filet medallion entree, and felt the reviews on ""the best nachos"" to be very misleading. The beers were of course great and the venue and patio were very cool. 

Our server, Angie, was amazing as well!!! Another observation I want to point out was what I saw in the bathroom... I've never seen this before but wish I did - they had these things on the bathroom door where you put your foot to open the door so you're hands stay clean and germ free after washing and drying them.

The food here is amazing. Filling and messy, the perfect kind of bar food. I've tried probably half the menu by now and I have enjoyed it all, but I have a weak spot for the popper burger. A juicy burger topped with cream cheese, jalapenos, and onion straws - it's to die for. 

The irony for me is I actually don't like beer. But my boyfriend is a beer lover, so we come here a lot, and I really don't mind. I just get a soda and enjoy the food while he indulges in beer. I have tried some of the beer though, and the peach ale is the closest I've come to actually enjoying a beer.

The service is great. Every waiter or waitress I've ever had here has been super friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. I always eat outside whenever possible, as the inside can get a bit crowded and noisy (especially when there is some sort of popular sporting event on the tvs), but the tables outside are always great, no matter the time of the year. In the winter, they have heaters, and in the summer they have misters and an outdoor cooler. It's comfortable, and easy to talk to whomever you're with.

My husband and i brought our six month old there recently and when they brought us our childs chair it was covered in food, a rather large piece of pretzel was laying right in it.

After a  switch of seats at the gigantic bar, I ordered the Blue Light Special burger cooked well done and loaded with blue cheese crumbles and average bacon.

Yea, I know its in Tempe, but after some ten years of higher education, there are times I'd love to go get a good local brew and a good burger without having to deal with the local brain trust at ASU.

Again, I know its Tempe.
But sometimes I'd rather the little bastards went somewhere else.

We went on Saturday night (again, I know, Saturday in Tempe) and there was a half hour wait to get a table for two. This was largely due to the number of quasi-hipsters, dudes with beards way too industrial for an AZ summer, and the obligatory drunken college girls who wouldn't leave. Maybe Four Peaks needs to think about how to manage diners and drinkers in separate ways. 

I'll go back, because I'm not that smart and I like abuse. My inner masochist loves the burgers and pitchers, they make me happy.

I could tell, this was a happening place - but then again, it caters to nearby ASU. From what I gather, Friday and Saturday nights are SRO. The crowd is lively, the music thumping, servers are bustling.

I had no problems finding a table and the server was prompt in presenting the menu to me. I ordered the Italian Beef Beer Bread (say that three times fast after having a couple of beers!) sandwich and a pint of the oatmeal stout - oh yummmmm!

1) The beer is delicious. If it's in season, try the Pumpkin Porter.
2) I've yet to try one bad appetizer or entree. The oatmeal stout shake is bomb diggity.

If you are from out of town or have never been.....there's really nowhere else better on the east side, or in Phoenix for that matter, to get delicious beer and yummy food.

I asked for a table inside but I didn't know that they have a section that looks like a pizza parlor in the middle of Idaho. I was expecting to be seated in the main room but that didn't happened. So we moved to the patio. The weather was hot and I didn't notice anything that could help (idk if there were misters but it wasn't that great).

I had a heffeweizer and it got warm pretty quick, but oh well.

The edamame was good, crispy and tasteful (I always order edamame without salt).

But the spinach salad was bad. Lack of taste, the spinach was flavorless, the dressing was boring, all in all a bad salad.

My friend ordered enchiladas that were ok if you overlooked the presentation (it looks gross, pools of grease, it could look like dog food and the metal dish doesn't help at all).

Anyways, bad salad, bad experience and kind of price for what I got.",2,1,1

I wish I were my dad right now (that's creepy, I know) because his cabinet shop is literally right next door and he frequents this joint at least once a week. He has probably tried every beer and item on the menu over the past few years. 

I have been to this Four Peaks probably four times now, and I have been really happy with everything I have eaten. The 5-Layer Nachos (sofaking gooooodddd!!), Spinach Dip, Pizza, Hummus and even the Veggie Burger. They pour a healthy vodka soda and the prices are reasonable. Service is a tiny bit slow, but it is Tempe.

One of my favorite things about this location is that it is hidden from the world. If you didn't know it was there, you wouldn't know it was there (I swear that makes sense in MY head). I just wish they would allow you to bring dogs on the patio!

If you ever get a spare moment, find Dallas G and ask him to tell you his story about Nachos. It's quite a tale told with so much fervor that you yourself might start believing in their power...

No other beer is served besides what is brewed at the location. Asking for a non-Four Peaks beer will most likely be met with a roll of the eyes. (standard brewery stuff here folks)

Happy hour is 4pm-7pm with a reverse happy hour from 10pm-close. Beers are $3 during happy hour with pitchers running $11.

After 11pm there is only a ""late night"" menu which consists of most appetizers and a few simple pizzas, kitchen closes at 1am. I personally like the pretzels which are large and come with tasty brown mustard for dipping.

The ""bar food"" is above average as stated in many reviews; food usually comes quickly and is prepared as ordered. I've never experienced a bad dish in the 50+ times I have eaten here. Recommendations are: Bleu Light Burger (real bleu cheese crumbles, not dressing), the Salmon BLT and for an entrée the Kiltlifter Filet (split it for a smaller dinner of two).

Inside has a large chalk board with the current (see picture) beers and alcohol percentages. Recommendations are 8th St Ale, Kiltlifter and Hop Knot. The Sunbru is the lightest of the bunch for those seeking a higher quality light beer. Flights are available for those new to the beers offered.

Parking in the back is usually full but there are plenty of options on the nearby streets. Don't try to get away with parking in a neighboring business lot, you will be towed.

So, we returned for lunch the next day. That was a good move as the crowds were thinner but the atmosphere was still great the the ful menu available.

We started with an order of the Nachos and those disappeared quickly.....very tasty. My boys loved them! For lunch, I ordered the Fish N Chips. My wife had the Chicken Salad Pita. The Fish and Chips were terrific; very lightly fried with a non-greasy, flaky touch. One of the best examples I've had outside of an authentic British Pub. My wife loved the Chicken Salad Pita which had a nice flavor and spicy finish. I don't normally like Chicken Salad but had a taste of it and it was great.

One son had a pizza.....boring....but the other ordered the Chicken Enchiladas. These were above average but not in the same category as many of the straight-up Mexican restaurants in the area. Not bad but I would recommend sticking with the other brewery fare offered.

When the fish n chips special is walleye...well, you just can't say no!  The fish fry was awesome!  I haven't had walleye since my father died, and his birthday is coming up, so it was a great tribute.
5 generous pieces of fish came with super-crispy fries, tartar sauce as well as cocktail sauce, a side of coleslaw and...malt vinegar with the condiments!  
Four Peaks got it right.  Though the fish was a bit greasy on the outside, it was really tasty and fried perfectly.  There was not too much batter, so I could actually taste the fish.  Having the malt vinegar to douse the fries with gets major cool points.  Add a few dashes of salt and...mmmmyummy!
The coleslaw was, eh, nothing major.

Considering Ive never had any of their beers, I got a flight of all their drafts (highly recommend doing this). Out of the 8 they give you, my favorites were the Raj IPA, Oatmeal Stout, Sunbru, and the Peach. The Peach had this great, fruity flavor that felt like I was drinking straight peach juice! One of my favorite beers while in town. If fruity beers are your thing, get the peach. The other beers I mentioned are worth getting on their own just as well. Everything else I had is not really my thing and others will probably like it. The White Ale though is super disgusting. It tastes like someone spilled cleaning supplies into the mix and apathetically continued with their job. 
Food wise, I got the nachos based on how much accolades it received. They were good, but I dont think they were worth the hype. I think the King Kong nachos at Chaco's in San Antonio are still the best Ive had. The nachos have a good amount of cheese and the chips are good, but there's nothing about it that makes me go wow. The veggies come on the side in a bowl thats mostly soupy black beans. The blackened chicken was decent, but certainly not something to call the local butcher about. The quesadillas are pretty plain. It required copious amounts of sour cream and salsa. The lamb burger totally took me by surprise! That thing was actually quite delicious! They cooked the ground lamb just right and all the flavors blended well. The fries were good, but still nothing that are super special. 

The nachos were what I really came for. What I found was a handful of amazing beers I wish were readily available at home.

The Raj is similar to a Lagunitas but has more depth.  The Hopknot was a perfectly balanced brew with a clean finish.

We enjoyed the poutine with pulled pork and cheddar curds to start.  It is fantastic but filling!  It could easily be a meal despite being on the appetizer list.

Pete had the Peaks Burger with Bacon and I had the southwestern with hatch chilis.  The buns are ridiculously tasty, the angus beef burgers juicy as can be - the hatch chilis added tons of flavor.

There's good food, good staff, good service, good prices, and lots of outdoor seating, so this is a great place to go for a nice evening out with anyone.

I'm a foodie, so I want to take a minute to mention how good the food is here.   On my last trip, I ordered the grilled chicken beer bread, which is grilled chicken breast, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, green peppers, red onion, mozzarella and cucumber sauce rolled in beer bread with a side of french fries and had ice cream cake for dessert.  Everything came out promptly and was SO good.  I want to give a special shout-out to the french fries at Four Peaks cuz they are especially tasty.  I also want to mention the stout shake to all you dessert lovers (particularly MALT lovers).  This is an item I usually get at Four Peaks because it is sooo creamy and delicious.  It's basically a malt made with half an oatmeal stout beer topped with whipped cream and Oreo crumbs.  Beer AND ice cream?  Yes please!

Not only is the location huge, so are the portions... I had no idea. We started with an order of spicy Thai hummus with pita bread.  It was pretty tasty. The bread was soft and fresh and the hummus had a nice kick.  Other appetizers at the table where the spinach and artichoke dip, and the giant nachos.... Every appetizer was plenty for 3 to 4 people to share.  

For my entrée I went with the vegetable beer bread sandwich and fries.  The sandwich was okay, the bread was very thin and made into a wrap which I thought was interesting. Unfortunately, it got soggy fast so I ended up not eating the bread and just eating the vegetables out of the inside.  The fries on the other hand...beer battered and crispy...just the way I like them. 

I saw some pizzas floating around the restaurant too, next time I think that's  what I'm going to try, they looked amazing.

We arrived at Four Peaks at 3:30 P.M. on Wednesday 08-02-17. 

Finding a place to park, without cars driving your way is a challenge. You have to park approximately 300 feet away from the main entrance (behind the brewery) and that will only happen if one of the total twenty five parking spots are open. You have to walk towards incoming traffic to make your way towards the entrance. 

The air conditioning was not on. Today was overcast and VERY humid in the valley. I could feel how stuffy and sticky the brewery was the second we walked in. I could see people (not just myself) fanning themselves. I do not think that the staff really cared to cool off the inside by turning on the air conditioning. 

The worst part of today was the lack of service. We spent about an hour at the main bar (right behind the huge beer fermentation tanks). The bartender approached us a total of four times which included taking our order and delivering our order. Most of the time, a lot of the staff, not just our bartender seemed preoccupied with talking to each other or aimlessly walking around instead of paying attention to customers, details, and trying to craft a great experience so more customers will want to return.",1,1,1

Whoever thought that up is a genius, pure genius!! We were under the assumption that to experience anything remotely near that, we'd have to go back there. Well, we didn't have to go too far, it turns out, to get a great microbrew beer and mighty fine eats.

Enter Four Peaks Brewery: The Valley's answer to beer connoisseur's question ""Where does one go locally to imbibe on regional ales et. al.?""

Four Peaks has so many things going for it. They IDed me (loves it!), which really helps my ego in these, my more ancient hours. They have converted a warehouse effectively into a sweet dining location. The wait staff is quite efficient. Their selection of beers is tops. And the food is pretty darned good. We started out with the Peach Ale, a slightly sweet beer with a clean finish and truly a masterpiece. Our appetizer was the calamari (are you kidding me?? That's a whole squid!) I went for the Popper Burger, a delightful combination of beef--medium rare--jalapeños, cream cheese and onion fries. This isn't for wussies, which is why I didn't get far in finishing this. As good as it was, I suppose I wasn't cut out for such intense peppers on my burger. Ship me back to Ohio, postage due.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed our lunch at Four Peaks. What knicks the fifth star was that it was rather warm in the section in which we were seated and there was no shortage of flies. Yes, I get that we're in the Valley and it's turning summer, and that we were basically eating outdoors. Four Peaks can't control the weather nor the insects. But I'm home now and really jonesing that Peach Ale and have no immediate means of getting one. So, allow me this minor infraction.",3,3,5

2.  The pasta salad and steak sandwich are super freakin good
3.  I love that little doll face Courtney at the Tempe location, she is super sweet and she is always on it
4.  Your chicken rolls are greasy, fattening deliciousness and that jalapeno dip kills me because I am a baby with spice, but it kills me in a good way
5.  There are always suckers on the patio willing to bet my girly friend that she can't out chug them for drinks, and we ALWAYS be winning! Yeahhh!",2,1,1

There are days when I'm starving and wishing I could drive the six hours to Phoenix and have Four Peaks for lunch. I don't know why, but the food there is tops for a brewpub. It's not super gourmet like those participating in this gastropub movement as of late, but it's solid comfort all the way. I'm particularly addicted to their beer-battered chicken tenders and their fries (seasoned wedges) are like crack. They've got decent fish and chips (although they don't hold a candle to George and Dragon) and the other stuff's good too. 

Beer-wise, Four Peaks doesn't make the cut on my list of favorite breweries in the country, but for Arizona, it's okay. The Kiltlifer (not to be confused with Moylan's Kilt Lifter (which rates higher on BeerAdvocate) from California, and the less popular Pike's Kilt Lifter from Seattle, seems to be their most popular brew and is a pretty standard and consistent Scotch ale with just the right amount of malt and yeast. 

Other offerings include their 8th Street Ale (average), Hefeweizen (below average), and their Hop Knot IPA (which is inconsistent-- sometimes it's very hoppy, sometimes it's just got no bite at all). They have a Raja IPA which is also inconsistent-- sometimes it has no difference from the Hop Knot whatsoever, but when you do get a batch that tastes different, it's a little comparable to Lagunitas'  Hop Stupid. 

The Oatmeal Stout and Pumpkin Porter are laughable. Just cheap knock offs of better breweries, although the Stout does make a decent milkshake. And the Arizona Peach used to be a summer fave of mine up until I got a pint that tasted entirely of wheat...gross. 

It gets packed here, but they've got tons of space and a decent happy hour. Tons of Tempe locals, but worth the visit if you're in the area. Is this the best local brewery in the greater Phoenix area? Of course...but there isn't really much competition, now is there?",0,0,0

    This layout goes on forever. When you walk inside (past the nice patio area) you weave through, side-to-side, and all over the place. There is so much seating and it adds to the brewing atmosphere. We sat closer to the back, near the actual factory area, where we could have played darts if the mood had struck us. Instead, the mood to have a ""flight night"" did. 

   We both ordered the sampler--eight beers, roughly 2 pints worth (or a little more) of Four Peaks beer. Before our samplers came out, our awesome waiter also brought us three beer shots of their seasonal beers-- a Poppin' Pilsner, Chocolate Mexican beer, and a hardy Barley beer that was a little much for my taste--but at 12% alcohol content you can bet I was feeling a little toasty after that. 
  
   Along with our beers we ordered food--my friend got the French dip after much debate and loved it, while I opted for the Garden burger with beer fries. The jalapeno sauce made this burger spicy and even more delicious. The Peach beer that they brew, along with the Kilt Lifter, were my two favorites.

The hostess and the waitress (MJ) throughout the night were both very friendly and accommodating.

This is easily one of my favorite brew houses in the Phoenix Metro area. The Kiltlifter and the Pumpkin Porter (when available) are my choice of poison. They offer pretty cheap beer flights to sample all their varying beers on tap, which are all good in their own unique way.

I'm not usually a huge fan of beer so I wasn't able to enjoy the brews as much as others, but my favorite was the peach ale beer. 

I think a way that the tours can improve is if they give those who are doing the tour a designated area where we can sit down, relax, and enjoy our beers after the tour is over. After the tour was over, I didn't like how we had to go back to the front of the restaurant and wait for a table.. It was extremely crowded so we had to fight for a small spot at the bar before waiting 20 minutes to be seated with the rest of my group. We all ordered the beer flights which used up all the two drink tickets per person that they gave us for the tour. The beer flight is a good idea because of the variety.

We went in for the special menu and found the buffet to LOOK very nice but to fall short of an actual delivery. For $32 per person, we got Eggs Benedict, whose English muffin couldn't be cut with a standard knife (trust me, I tried, and I worked at it so hard I almost knocked the table over), undercooked but okay prime rib (should have had an option for cuts that were cooked more and less fatty - looked like a quality starter cut to begin with). The bacon and sausage tasted bulk-made and the waffles came with a Knotts Breakfast Syrup to-go packet. The salmon enchiladas were the only saving grace on the buffet spread; even the turkey pot pie raised eyebrows since it didn't even have a pie crust?

Not the worst breakfast I've ever had, but for $32? I could have gone to Caffe Boa or Golden Corral (seriously, that disappointed with Four Peaks) or somewhere with much better food for cheaper! Now, if there were the option to choose something other than the ""Mother's Day Brunch"" for 32 bucks a pop, then I could at least say this was my fault, but we were told that was the only option (though later, before 2pm when brunch was supposed to end, I saw ""regular"" food on other tables). 

The mimosas were okay, but small and difficult to mess up anyway.

The highlight of breakfast was the baked goods - From Chompies. Sorely disappointed in Four Peaks' Brunch.

The main reason anyone would go to Four Peaks Brewing Company is for the excellent beers. Kiltlifter is one of my favorites with its clean taste and slightly sweet finish. Grabbing a sampler, however is the way to start any experience at Four Peaks. 
The menu at Four Peaks is worth checking out as well, though, and you won't be disappointed with the results. The filet mignon was phenomenal. While it won't win any calorie counting contest, the stout brew glaze makes an already succulent piece of meat into a joyful meal. Everything I've tried at Four Peaks just has me looking forward to my next visit. 
The service is friendly, the orders arrived quickly, and the ambience is perfect for what you want in a brewery; vats.

The ""DJ"" plays pretty good music, I put him in quotes because the few times I've seen the music system it's a Macbook hooked up to someone's itunes collection. No problem with that, though--me and the guy have pretty similar tastes in music. The waitresses here are great nine times out of ten, and they are always good-looking (do they even let males serve here?). 

The barrel fries are great, even if they are still $5.50 for a considerable deduction in the amount of fries you get recently. They usually have a ""special"" or ""chef's choice"" menu where you can get something that isn't a usual menu item. Good for dates. 

The hefeweizen contains banana clove, which is amazing. The peach ale is a favorite among many women I know, and Kiltlifter is always great if you're looking to take a nap soon (heavy!).

The jalepeno popper burger is so yummy. Cream cheese on a burger is such a good idea and the crispy onion strings add nice texture. Another plus is that it's not wimpy like most ""Spicy"" items.

I was really impressed with the food! Ruben and I shared the Arizona Chicken Rolls ($8) stuffed with grilled chicken, Anaheim chiles and two cheeses and served with sweet jalapeno dressing. The rolls are HUGE and packed with chicken. Great flavors too. However, I thought the dressing was gross.

I had the 8th Street Ale Chicken Strips ($10). The chicken breast is battered with their pale ale creating a really flavorful and crispy exterior. This is also the same batter used on their fries and they were so delicious. The dish is served with a flavorful chipotle ranch that went well with the chicken and fries.

Ruben selected the Popper Burger ($11.50) that was topped with roasted jalapeno, onion straws, and cream cheese. It was good, but not my kind of burger. My mom enjoyed the Pub Fish and Chips ($11). Alaskan Cod is battered with the Kilt Lifter and served with homemade tartar sauce. The fish was really nice.

Their patio is great. My boyfriend and our friends and I would walk here after school to grab a drink and lunch or after an ASU football game. The interior is also super interesting since it's a brewery, of course. 
I love fruity beers so if you like fruity beers that are light and in this case, peachy AF, get yourself a peach ale my friend.

Their kitchen, however, has gone downhill in the last year or two. Their food used to be simply amazing, which when combined with their best-in-breed beers, made for a great night out! They remodeled their kitchen a little while back and their food seems to have lost some of its flair. It's still good, mind you, but it's not what it used to be. 

That said, I still recommend this place to anyone, and still bring my out-of-town friends here all the time, but I don't enjoy it nearly as much as I did before.",0,0,0

On a Saturday around 1 pm this place was packed - inside and out!  We put our names down to get a table and were told 25-30 minutes.  Luckily we went inside to the bar and located 4 open seats in a row.  We ended up just eating there, instead of waiting.  

I had the Pumpkin Porter - which everyone recommended and seemed to be pretty popular.  I love pumpkin beer, and visiting at the end of October was just what I was craving.  Unfortunately because it was a porter, it was a little too dark for me and not as tasty as other Pumpkin beers I've had.  This was the only 'seasonal' beer they had on tap.  Just during our 1-2 hour stay at the bar, three different customers walked up purchasing growlers and cans of the pumpkin porter - so you can tell it's a local favorite.  I also tried the Peach Ale, but wasn't really into it (too sweet).

For 4 people, we ordered two appetizers of the garlic cheese bread ($7 each).  It was cheesy, gooey, and delicious.  However, we could have just ordered one, because we only ate through half of each before our food arrived. I ordered the roasted turkey club, which came out to be a decent size for $9.5. My significant other ordered the Four Peaks Burger ($9.5) and ranted and raved how delicious it was. 

The service was sporadic.  Sometimes we would have to track our bartender\/server down and ask for things, other times she was offering us another beer before we had finished.  It wasn't bad though, and understandable due to how busy it was that afternoon. 

I found a 'Four Peaks' pint glass I wanted to purchase and was shocked when she told me it only cost $3 something.  What a good deal! (I did check online and they are $5 each).

I would love to come back to Four Peaks Brewery the next time I am in Tempe!

PS - If you are at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport - I noticed they just opened a Four Peaks location in terminal 4!",2,0,3

I'm a little surprised at all the high reviews for the beer here, it was Ok but I didn't try anything that I thought was outstanding. I did get a bunch of badges on Untappd from logging in the beers from here though, so that was a positive.

We came on a really hot day, like 117°F so we opted to sit inside like everyone else. We waited in the bar area for a bit and a table was ready within about 15 minutes. Just enough time to start sampling the beers here, but note that the bar is separate from the restaurant, so you pay and close out in the bar before going to the restaurant.

We were seated ""inside"" at a table close by an open wall to the outside heat, and it was really hot in there, the A\/C wasn't coming close to cool the place down. No big deal though as we were getting used to the heat.

Parking was an issue. They have some parking behind the place in a lot and then lined down the alley behind the place. As we were leaving, some dude was accosting us to get out of our spot faster so they could take it. And we had our daughters with but that didn't stop the profanities - yikes, not fun. Not a knock on this place directly, though it does represent a subsection of the clientele here.

This place might just have the most amazing pretzels I have ever had hands down! They come out steaming hot and just so perfectly made. If you ever imagined a perfect pretzel this would be it. In fact, that's all we ordered this time around. Why mess around with the menu? Just order rounds like you would with beer!

Speaking of which, I'm a fan of the kilt lifter but the other beers are good as well. It depends on your taste, naturally, but none of them are bad like you find sometimes at other breweries! I did venture out and order the oatmeal stout shake. It was interesting and good but not something I'd order again. I've had the chocolate stout float at another spot that I prefer over this.

We sat outside in the cold as the inside was packed.  There were plenty of heat lamps, so we didn't have a problem staying somewhat warm.

Thai Hummus was delicious.  Big fan.  Try that as an app.  Tangy with a little, slight kick.

I had the pork tenderloin special and that was tasty.  Pork was tender and the side spinach was cooked to my liking.

Downside:  Service was a little unpredictable as no on really checked on us to see how our meals were.  It also took a little while to get plates and utensils after getting our hummus to start.  But when the server did come by, she was very responsive and friendly.

A quick trip to the Yelp site quickly revealed the #1 restaurant in Tempe to be, in fact, a brewery. This delighted my boyfriend, a beer connoisseur, and me too, being a fan of highly rated restaurants and anything that makes my man happy. So we headed to the Four Peaks with high expectations and high spirits. Alas, our hopes were dashed almost from the beginning. 
The hostesses greeted us from the curb. They were extremely young and scantily clad in low, low, LOW slung jeans that did not cover their clearly illegal behinds. The place was crowded so we took a beacon and hit the bar for our first round. The bartender, despite a packed house, noticed us almost immediately and took our orders... the only quick service we received all night. The beers, well, the Kilt Lifter was a fine example of a 80 shilling Scottish ale... but the Raj IPA was heavy in diacetyls and but otherwise a reasonable attempt at an English IPA. Hopknot IPA was above average IPA with pleasing grapefruit aroma.
By the time we were seated we were happily woozy from the beers. Unfortunately, it took the bitch waitress nearly 20 minutes to take our orders and another 20 before our meals arrived. Food was decent, although side orders were botched... we DID notice the very nice disposable napkins, which were durable yet soft. Some of the nicest napkins I've ever seen of a disposable nature. 
Overall, a good people watching experience, very loud and crowded, with terrible service, adequate beer, and generic yet palatable cuisine. Would we go back? Not unless invited by good friends. Overrated.",2,1,0

It was a little loud but the atmosphere is cool - I love how it's open and the brewing tanks are exposed! There's nothing like going to a brewery and actually feeling like you're IN a brewery! 

For our appetizer, we ordered the Thai Hummus plate. That hummus was seriously some of the BEST hummus I've ever had! Next for our entree, we ordered the Veggie Beer Bread to share (such a huge portion!). The bread was so soft and yummy and the veggies inside were sauteed\/seasoned to perfection and oh so tasty! 

I'm already a fan of their Hot Knot, so naturally I ordered that. It tasted sooooo much better getting it right from the source!

I definitely recommend this place for all you crafty beer lovers!",1,0,1

I rolled into Tempe over one blistering weekend to undergo orientation for an upcoming summer job. We walked ""downtown"" the first night to explore the two or three blocks of action to some disappointment. Sure, it's a decent college town, but nothing was particularly unique about the offered venues.

Our next and final night a like-minded friend scoured the area for local breweries and unearthed this gem. Thank god we waited until after sunset to make the mile and a half slog or we may not have been able to enjoy the incredible offerings of Four Peaks.

Small disclaimer: we only ordered the beer, but we literally tried all of them - a flight plus the seasonals, the latter of which were offered us free of charge after we displayed some interest in knocking off the whole sudsy menu.

First, the flight glasses are a good size. I've been to breweries where you're lucky to get an once, but they give you quite a bit to mull over with each sample at Four Peaks. They even have custom wooden tablets that they serve the drinks on, showing a confidence in their menu that is well-earned.

There was not a miss in the whole bunch. One or two I'd be hesitant to order a pint of, perhaps (particularly the stout in summer), but nothing that I wasn't happy to try a second sip.

The star of the show was the Peach Ale. It tastes like a commercial would read: crisp, refreshing, takes the edge off those hot summer days. The peach flavor is clear and accommodating without being overpowering and my friend and I each ordered two more pints after the flight was through. I seriously considered grabbing a growler to dazzle my friends back home, but the cost of the growler - plus the fact that I would be shelling out another $25 for a check-in bag I didn't need on the way over - proved too much.

If the beers alone didn't earn 5 stars (and they do), the management would. We had a few questions about the floral notes of one of the beers, and on asking to speak to a brewer, the manager came over to answer our questions. I wish I hadn't waited so long to write this review as his name now escapes me, but I'm thinking...Jeff? Four Peaks, if you're reading this, he was managing a Saturday night a little under a month ago, and he was AWESOME. We talked at length about the nuances of the different beers and he even treated us to a small sample of some of the cask-engine brews (a first for me!). He went above and beyond on a busy Saturday night and brought the evening to the next level.

There is very little that could bring me back to Tempe. The temperature was sizzling and I'm way too far out of college to venture into that scene. 

But Four Peaks? 

Maybe...just maybe...",1,1,1

I've never really liked the food all that much and I find it to be more of a hassle than it's often worth to go there and find parking and get a table. It's not always too busy, but most of the time it is. That's the price you pay when you're popular. 

The beer is good enough to be proud of if you're a local and you don't have to get it here since it's sold all over the valley. I wouldn't ever go out of my way to get it, but ""good enough"" is about the best compliment I can bestow. I'm not a huge fan of beer to begin with, but I like it enough to have an idea of what constitutes a good beer versus a bad or average one. Some of their beers I simply don't like - it's that stomach bile flavor that turns me away. Other brews are quite tolerable to actually good.

I see this mostly as a great place to take someone who is visiting from somewhere else. There's a bit of a 'wow' factor with Four Peaks. It's sorta neat to walk in through the back door past all the tanks and whatnot. In the summer, it's also a nice and chilly way to cool off. Beyond that, it's probably only barely worth it. I've found the service to be unpredictable... usually not good. It's probably a bad idea to take a date here unless you're in college. 

When my friends suggest going here, I usually suggest someplace else - not sure exactly why. There's just something about it that doesn't lend itself to an easy dining and drinking experience... it's complicated somehow. It's odd that a place you can wear flip flops to could feel complicated, but it is. Maybe it's that tiny bit of 'factory' vibe the building gives off. It's like we're visiting the building while it's working and we're not entirely welcome there, but it's just too polite to tell us to leave.",4,4,2

Friday night (4\/8\/16) we yelped Tempe looking for a cool place to hang out and grab some beers with some friends . we decided to try Four Peaks Brewing Co.  We arrived around 9 pm and the place was packed but we managed to find a seat, the waitress was very nice and gave us the list of the specials. I was impressed with the beer flight, most places offer only 4 beers in a flight, not four peaks ... they gave us 8 to try and for 10 dollars we thought it was a great deal . we also tried the Odelay beer which was a Mexican chocolate beer, it was very smooth and delicious. We ordered the pretzels, they were nice and soft and salty just like a pretzel should be but the cheese that came with it was watery and very bland. Also, the waitress didn't tell his the cheese was extra and I was a little taken back realizing the watery cheese was not apart of the appetizer but was side order that cost 2.00. I wouldn't have mind the charge if maybe the cheese was actually tasty. I'm glad I got to try this place and I would go back for the beers.",0,0,0

We had planned on ordering dinner but we were extremely full from the appetizer. We ordered the nachos with blackened chicken, deliciously cheesey! It came with beans, salsa, sour cream and lots of cheese.

The flavor was too mellow and overall the beer seemed too light, almost watered down.

The real reason for 3 stars was the food.  Although we had some nice appetizers (pretzels with spicy cheese sauce were great, as was the Thai hummus and pita bread), but the pizzas we ordered were terrible. We ordered the margarita and the Italian.  The margarita had too much garlic powder, and the Italian tomato sauce was much too sweet and overpowered the toppings.

Service can be slow when they are busy, but our waitress was friendly and pretty attentive.  The dining area is enormous, and they also have some limited outdoor seating. But this is a college town dinner spot for sure, no pretensions of a high class brew-pub here.

-Beer: All of their beers were really nice, I was especially impressed by these beers... 

-Kilt Lifter -Scottish Style Ale - Amazing, I rate it a 8.5! It is like drinking a New Castle on Steroids!! Very low carbonation, tons of malt and light hop flavor. 
-Hop Knot IPA -- Amazing, almost an Imperial IPA very Hop Forward without the bitter hops!! I rate it 9.3 Even better from the Cask.

We sat outside, and it was gorgeous! I am sure that a lot of this has to do with the time of year (October) - like others have said, no air conditioning in late summer, probably isn't too fun! 

It wasn't too crowded so we got a table right away. The waitresses were very friendly as I have noticed was true of pretty much everyone I met on my trip to Arizona. The beers were pretty good as was the food. The menu wasn't very extensive, but it sufficed for what we were looking for.

One of the things I still can't seem to figure out is the ratio of men to women. Normally, in a Chicago bar, it's about 60% women, 40% men (and that's being generous). Now, this particular evening in Tempe, it was about 80% men, and 20% women. I have tried to come up with every reason I can think of - it was a Monday night, it's a sports bar, etc. But none of these reasons suffice, because I'm a single girl, I go out on Monday nights and I love sports bars! (I'm not an anomaly either - most of my girl friends love sports.) Let's just say I wasn't complaining either.

In the last few years, they put out a hostess stand and there is a longer wait for seating, but at least you can take the buzzer to the bar while you wait.

For beers, I'd recommend the Raj IPA and the Kiltlifter (which you will find offered at nearly every bar in Tempe, by the way).

They have some good vegetarian options, which made me happy. I went for the Portabella Veggie Beer Bread. I have to say that the title made me think it would be a portabella mushroom sandwich. It's actually a wrap. And I'm not sure how it's ""beer bread""; it just seemed like a tortilla. But it was good anyway. 

Definitely go for the fries, no matter what. They are beer battered and delicious. I'd recommend the calamari appetizer too, but beware it's strips of calamari, like chicken strips.

Beers - 5

We brought our group of 18 into Four Peaks early on a Sunday night for my wife's birthday.  The place is really cool, but was totally PACKED inside and out.  Yet, all the staff were SUPER helpful in getting us a table, beers, and food.  They were also VERY knowledgeable about the beers.  And, all the servers in our section pitched-in to make sure that everything went as smooth as possible for our large group.

The Hop Knot IPA was the big hit with our crowd.  We ordered quite a few pints and pitchers.  I also thought the Baltic Porter was an awesome Winter Seasonal and the 8th Street Pale was super easy drinking.  

As a beer geek & beer judge, gotta say that the brewers at Four Peaks  have it down for taste and drinkability.  Normally, I'm not a filtered beer fan for pub drinking (just don't see the need & you can get some thin, flavorless beers.)  But, they know how to craft a proper filtered pint here, which for me, is saying a lot.

Everyone thought the food was good and much better than most pub fare (some did comment that the cheese pizza and fish & chips were a bit too greasy.)  But, everyone enjoyed themselves and we had a great birthday party.  We would definitely go back and recommend Four Peaks to our friends.

Thanks Four Peaks!",0,0,0

This brewery's beer is readily available in Las Vegas and I've been satisfied with the couple of flavors I have tried, so this would give me a chance to try even more with a flight to accompany my food.

The place is huge as the brewery has taken over a building that was formerly an ice house. It's a great environment to hang out with your buddies and tip back some local brews. For those of you that rode in blind folded, it's pretty much on ASU campus, so you'll see plenty of students taking a break from their studies and have your ID ready also, because they'll card everyone, including an old man like me. It wasn't too crowded on the Thursday night we were there. The full menu is served until midnight and they have a reverse happy hour starting at 11 PM.

The menu is your standard bar food with apps, salads, sandwiches, burgers, and 10 inch pizzas. We ate pretty light with a burger for my wife and the Tap Room Tenderloin with the eight pour beer flight for me. The burger was slightly underdone for my wife but she was still pleased with it. The beef in the steak sandwich was seasoned well but a little tough, just make sure you bite down hard into the sandwich, or you'll be pulling the full piece of meat out between the buns leaving you in a real awkward position.

I enjoyed most of the beers with the Kilt Lifter being my favorite and the Sunbru Kolsch-Style Ale being my least favorite. There were no issues with service and pricing was completely fair.

The venue itself is phenomenal. We opted to sit inside and were very impressed with the open air feel. The place is huge and the smell is unique. We were seriously excited to see what the place had to offer. 

I ordered the Peach beer and babe had the Raj. ""Bavarian"" Pretzels to start and turkey club to split with fries as our side. Now. I put Bavarian in quotations because apparently no one who designed the menu has ever been to Germany. With the claim of Bavarian, I had an imagine of thick, home made pretzels, with a crispy outside and soft, buttery inside. The kind of pretzels I walked down to the Backerei to get every morning during both my trips overseas. But these ""Bavarian"" Pretzels were the frozen store bought kind that I could easily pick up from Vons. The only thing Bavarian about them was their size. They're huge. Ill give you that. Also. I think the spicy cheese came out of a nacho cheese bag you'd find at the Tempe ball field. Strikes one and two.

The Beers were good and quite honestly the only redeeming quality about this place besides the decor. It was extremely peach-y which is exactly what I was hoping for. I'm not an IPA drinker but the Raj was good. 

Turkey club on sourdough came next. Again. Just meh. It's hard to eff up a sandwich and while eff'd up isn't necessarily a valid statement, there was just something missing. No real flavor beyond the sourdough.

Service. Also meh. The girls were very sweet but they spent 90% of the time standing around with the other servers. Maybe this place gets busy but there was no reason for nine people to be scheduled. The clear and apparent boredom caused the girls to hover over our table. I'm all for sweet and attentive, but it almost became bothersome.

If you are looking for a variety of beers with good food, then - as I have experienced - this is not your place. 

Positives: 

1. Service.  Very good: the servers and bartenders are very affable.

2. Environment.  The place overall has a great look and feel to it, in respect to being a brewery.  TVs are on and people are chatting.  A very happening place. 

3. Specialty beers.  Their Pumpkin Ale is AWESOME. 

Negatives: 

1. Food.  Maybe its me, but I do not find the plates very appetizing.  In fact, if and when I go, I purposely do not eat.   I've tried the burgers and many breakfast items in the past; although I don't recall the specifics about each plate, I do know that they left no positive impression on me. 

2. Parking.  Horrendous. Period.

3. Climate. BEWARE: if you go in the summer months prepare to sweat.  Fans (NOT AC) are not on.  It is truly miserable experience; winter, on the other hand, is comfortable. 

4. Variety.  As stated in the opening paragraph, don't expect a wide selection of beers.  They have less than ten, albeit their own.

Overall, I would rather drink a Four Peaks beer at a brewery with a wider selection of beers and much better food.",2,0,0

After the tour I stayed for a flight and lunch.  I went with the 8th St chicken strips.  They were good.  For being a great day to be outside ( not too hot or too cold) the patio was remarkably quite empty.  My server was great, attentive.  The guy and gals at the hostess stand were all friendly.

Litterly full every single night of the week, the most amazing thing about this place is that the food is better than the beer. That isn't to say the beer isn't good, because some of it is great. Because it has become so large and so popular my only negative about this place is the fact that their seasonals and limited release list are so small and far apart. Then again they didn't become so popular by not having great beers. I'm a hop knot fan and if I'm at a restuarant that doesn't have a beer I haven't had or something I think is better it's my fall back favorite.

It probably wouldn't survive that long if they had to compete against their breweries. Having said that, they are probably the second best in Arizona (Oak Creek in Sedona is way better if beer is the only criterion). Their beers are consistently OK but sometimes their porters and stouts are a little skunky. Seasonal beers are good but I have never had a great one.

I like the building it's in but it sure is noisy when everyone is talking. They don't have live entertainment which may be a good thing since they don't need more noise. Unless you are there with friends it's kind of a boring place just to hang out, although there are plenty of cute college girls to look at.

I like to watch football there on Sundays because they show a lot of games, even if it is a Minnesota Vikings hangout.

What I do not really like at Four Peaks is the food. Brunch was just OK. I had the Brewer's Breakfast (basically your good ole American breakfast), and I hated the country potatoes. I don't want my hash browns to taste only like bell peppers. The three things on the dinner menu I have found I really like and will order every time we go are the french fries, beer bread, and shrimp and goat cheese bruschetta. However, there is not enough bread in the bruschetta as we seem to have tons of toppings left, so typically we have to use pita bread from the hummus to finish the food.  The caesar salad is just OK and my husband likes the fish and chips but they are not the best he has ever had.

I can honestly say that I have never had a bad meal there, and that I've tried nearly the entire menu.  

It's a sports bar and a brewery so it's not high-falutin' cuisine, but it is good. The burgers are big and tasty, the fries are seasoned, lightly battered and crispy.  The veggies, whether in a salad or cooked are always fresh and not overdone.  The enchiladas are delicious, the wings are good, and the pizzas are tasty but not average.  And the Sunday brunch is definitely worth heading over there to enjoy.

And the beer is oh so yummy.  A former professor of mine was the microbiologist on staff and he highly enjoyed and recommended their brew.

The building itself is pretty cool too.  It used to be a dairy back in the day, and the park next door is aptly named Creamery Park.  The jukebox plays an eclectic mix of alternative music; I've often heard They Might Be Giants, Pixies and other bands that get rare radio play.  And, it's a sports bar with plenty of TVs without being obnoxious for those of us who came for the food and brew.  The staff is ever changing, except for a few familiar faces, but always helpful and excellent.

I'd give it 4.5 stars if it were possible, but it's not.  And I can't give them 5 stars because of parking and seating issues.  This place is often too busy to handle the crowd, but in the past year they have added a host station to fairly find a seat when it's incredibly crowded.",2,2,2

Their beers are really good. Personally, I am a fan of Hefeweizens and Wheat beers--Four Peaks Hefe does not disappoint my tastebuds!!! Always hits the spot. Aside from the beer, their food is great, too. Their Chicken Beer Bread is good, and the patties they use for the burgers are really fat and come out super juicy. YUM. I also recommend going on Sundays for brunch. Their breakfast plates are huge and really good. Never have tried their pizzas, but I've heard good things. 

The atmosphere is great... I do love the beer, but quite honestly, it is the setup of this place that has really stolen my heart. There's a large patio out front and the interior is huge! Really large bar (my favorite place to sit) where service has always been a positive experience. The whole place is really laid back and really just a great place to enjoy good beer with good friends. 

The only negative thing I can say is that parking really stinks... usually you have to parallel park along the street. So it sounds like there should be a lot of space, but since this place always draws a crowd, it's sometimes more of a challenge to find a space than you'd think.

Some of my favorite menu items are the Green Chile Mac & Cheese, any of their burgers, the grilled chicken beer bread and the Salmon BLT is *really!* good.

The service at the bar was great, very attentive and the atmosphere is great. Laid back. Come in, have a drink, a bite to eat and just relax for a few.

While not bragging, I do drink a lot of microbrews and beers from around the world (yeah I'm a drunkard, what about it!?) and my IPA taste buds are starting to finally refine some. While neither beer was bad, neither was great. Scottish ales tend to be a little bland and dark anyway, even ones from Scotland. So they nailed it with that one as far as consistency goes. The IPA just lacked a little ""umpf"" that Stone, Rogue or Deschute's IPAs have.

This place was definitely hopping, the beer was flowing, and it was a great place to watch some important college bowl games.  I loved the look of the giant beer silos, or whatever they're called.  It made the place look like a factory.  I sat at a table next to them and stared at them the whole time I was there.  

The food in this place is also really good.  I had the peach beer.  I don't exactly remember what it's called, but it was just the right mixture of beer and peach flavoring.  The quesadilla appetizer was extremely cheesy, which was nice, but the cheese masked the taste of any of the other ingredients that might have been on it.  Although, the salsa that came with the quesadillas was excellent.  It tasted like fresh, home-made salsa.  My date and I shared the 12"" vegetarian pizza, which was packed with toppings.  I'm usually not a big fan of gourmet pizza, but this was one of the better ones I've had.

Overall, this place sort of reminded me of BJ's.  Good beer, good appetizers, good pizza.  This was also a nice place to watch football.  I would have given this place five stars, but the parking situation outside isn't very convenient.  I had to park my car on a dirt lot behind some random building next door.  It didn't feel very safe, and it takes away from the dining experience when you have to worry about the safety of your car.

Their beer over all is pretty good too and the staff is always pretty nice and fast considering the number of people that come here.

There are a few problems with Four Peaks though.  First off, everyone comes here.  It is always crowded and loud as a result.  You will be hoarse after having a meal here just from trying to talk to the person across from you.  

Second, the parking situation is awful here.  You have to park on the street in an area with lots of no parking signs.  This means you will have to park pretty far away usually, and if you find parking on a Saturday night, even if it is half a mile away, you are grateful to have found a spot at all.  No thanks!

Finally, the food here is not so great.  Also, a lot of it is fried and really unhealthy.

My inaugural visit to Four Peaks was part of a multi-destination afternoon in and around Tempe. My friend, who spent a lot of Quality Time at Four Peaks while attending graduate school, was understandably horrified at my cultural black hole regarding such a time-honored establishment.  Don't hate - I'm from California!  So, after a huge lunch and a stroll around the ASU campus (taking pity on the hard-working MBA students in Saturday group meetings - oh, I remember that pain...) it was time to see what I had been missing. 

I think I spend too much time in Scottsdale, because at first I was disoriented. The stand-alone building is nowhere near a strip mall. It isn't beige. The parking lot is filled with rocks and doesn't have clearly-defined parking spaces (I can never park between the lines anyway, so I was more than OK with this). Also, I didn't see a single Affliction t-shirt. Yay. 

Both the front patio and interior were packed - I think this place has a license to print money.  Even with a full bar, I didn't see anyone without a pint glass - I am guessing not many mixed drinks are served here - lucky bartenders!  In addition to the printed menus, a large chalk board lists the beers on tap and the alcohol content of each - a range from 4% to an impressive 6.9% for the Raj IPA. 

We didn't eat anything (no stomach real-estate left) but did enjoy a pitcher of Hefeweizen (hey, there is always room for that, right?). Sitting at the bar, I could see that this place appeals to a wide variety of people. To our left, a group of older guys watching basketball and eating burgers. To our right, a couple of recent ASU grads we chatted with who were contemplating life plans, law school, an upcoming trip to Southeast Asia and eating Thai hummus - lucky girls!  Maybe I need a new life plan...  :)

The food here is AMAZING! I've had numerous different dishes here and they've all come out deliciously cooked to perfection. My favorite appetizer here is the hummus, which comes with warm and moist pita bread which compliments the smooth yet spicy hummus excellently. When it comes to the entree it's hard to stray from the grilled salmon BLT, which comes on a grain-covered soft wheat bread that melts in your mouth. The prices are great for how spectacular the food is, although expect to cough up a solid twenty per person for an appetizer, entree, and beers. And speaking of beer... There's no problem savoring each flavoring. Yeah, if you know me you probably can't imagine me saying that, but damn they're good. I like the Raj IPA because it's so high in alcohol, and after two or three I'm on my ass (DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE!! TEMPE PD WILL HAVE YOU ON YOUR ASS FASTER). 

The service has always been good. I've even become friends with some of the wait staff here, chatting it up outside the bar, because they're such good people. Always perfectly on time with the food and drinks, there's no way I can imagine anyone being disappointed. 

As far as atmosphere, it's what any bar\/restaurant owner would dream of.

The food was really good. Our table had the shrimp pasta, a burger, and one of the chef's specials for that day. I personally didn't like the chef's special; but the burger was solid, and the shrimp pasta was phenomenal. I would go back just for that pasta dish...and the beer of course.

I mean, everyone knows how awesome their brews are (I love that Kiltlifter has become pretty much a staple that's on tap at a good deal of AZ bars), but I think the food here is delicious as well and tends to get overlooked.  

The last time I came here I just nibbled on some apps, and they were all delicious. The spinach artichoke is honestly one of the best I've ever had (and spinach artichoke dip is one of my favorite apps\/meals so I've sampled quite a bit). It's chunky , yet creamy, and just all around awesome. I'm also a big baked pretzel fan & the one at Four Peaks is delicious. 

When it comes to beer I generally stick to the staples (Kiltlifter & 8th St. Ale), both of which I really like (Kiltlifter is one of, if not my favorite beer). Of course when it's time to roll out the Pumpkin Porter I'm all about that as well!

Like other reviewers the dolt of a bouncer sitting on a chair guarding the joint like it's the hottest club in the world should have been my first clue.  It's a flippin micro-brewery in a dilapidated old warehouse with no A\/C - give me a break.  Luckily for us we passed the sniff test and he allowed us in!

Group of 9, waited a short while for a table.  They sat us at a long narrow table on the patio sort of like an alley way (not the front patio).  The table was positioned right in the crosshairs of two gigantic fans - it looked like we were standing in a hurricane - no way anyone can enjoy a meal getting blown around like that.  When I first asked the waitress to move us or turn the fans down she looked at me like I was nuts - pardon me, I'm only the customer getting my friggin' hair blown off my head by two dirty industrial fans!!!  My nieces were laughing because it was such a ridiculous situation.  I should have walked out right then...I knew better.

The manager and waitress turned the fans (much to the disappointment of surrounding diners on this hot, sticky evening).

It's loud, not air conditioned.  Pizza was supposed to take 'extra time' to prepare and ended up coming out 10 minutes before the rest of the food!  Nearly everyone in our group complained of way too much garlic in their food - must have been unofficial garlic-fest in the kitchen that night.  Even the balsamic vinegarette was loaded with garlic!  I like garlic, but this was bad.  My son ordered a pizza with meatballs and they deliver this ridiculous looking pizza with 6 whole meatballs sitting on top of it!!!  What the F is that all about?

Server was nice, I thanked her and the manager for helping with the fan situation.  Food was fair at best.  Sunbru beer tasted like a Bud Light - nothing special.

One thing that is consistent with most brewpubs, is that on the menu, there are beer suggestions for most of the foods. 

Now, for me, that's not a big deal because I am a craft beer guy, and I don't need help pairing beers and foods...but I can't say the same for others. And this is very helpful for people. PLUS, I'm not perfect. Maybe I can discover a pairing that will help me.

I had the Chicken Nachos and they were DELICIOUS! They didn't skimp on the amount of chicken, and it wasn't overloaded with cheese. PERFECTION!

Wings were just average Franks Red, no big deal! Lettuce wraps perfect for a warm evening outside, but there was something with a kick, very spicy!

I love that atmosphere and how the inside and outside seating merge. Some of my favorite beers are the Sunbru and Arizona Peach, they are refreshing and crisp and perfect for Arizona. 

What is surprising about this brewery is their food is really excellent too. The Bavarian pretzels and spanakopita exceed the expectations for a bar by far. 

The only complaint I have manifested at my birthday gathering on the patio a few months ago. There were roaches EVERYWHERE, it was like nothing I have experienced, everyone had their feet on their chairs and conversation was regularly interrupted by someone screeching. I even felt a few crawl over my feet. Our server was none too concerned as she never acknowledged what was obviously the problem but I chalk that up to how busy the restaurant was, and the fact that they have to already be aware of their little friends. 

This is Tempe where everyone knows roaches are abundant and it was on the patio, far from inside seating and the kitchen so I am far from writing this place off but they may want to consider an exterminator.",0,1,0

I remember when Four Peaks had the brew tanks inside the actual restaurant and they had a service where you could make your own beer inside the brewery, they even helped you bottle it and make a label. All that is gone as they have grown in popularity. 
The wings used to be some of the best ever: grilled, not fried. Now, they are just fried but still good (not great). For bar food, this is still a really good place to eat. 
The place is clean as well (one of my big pet peeves). From what I am able to observe at the Scottsdale location, they have taken the high cleaning standards required for the brewery and kept them in place for the bar\/restaurant. 
This location will get busy during happy hour, on game day, or anytime after 5pm. Be prepared to stand and bump shoulders with beer in hand until a seat opens up.

I say this because while we were at other breweries in Arizona talking about where we were going, several people told us we could skip them because they're the big, mass produced brewery. 

While it may be true that smaller breweries can have more fun with their beer, it by no means says that this brewery isn't good. 

Though it has a large seating area for the restaurant, it also has about 20,000 barrels of brewing equipment visible. It is right near campus so it can either be a convenient place to go if you're staying on campus, or annoying if you dislike the college crowd. We were there during a home football game so it was filled with people, but was not rambunctious. 

We got a sample board and it was a pretty big sample board. I liked all of the beer I tasted. Their IPA and their Porter were both very good.

3.5 Beer
Not bad, but I'm certainly not impressed. I'm a big dark beer fan, so I requested a flight with every porter and stout on the menu. While certainly palatable, each felt lacking in dimension and notable flavor--it's as if they made their basic stout\/porter recipe and then continued on to other things without further developing it. To be fair, their double pumpkin porter was decent, definitely the best of what we tried, but we still found it paling next to superior pumpkin porters. 

3.5 Food 
The food complements the beer in that it's not bad, but not outstanding. There's a fine line between subtlety of flavor and lack of flavor, and I think four peaks leans on the latter side, which would be fine if they didn't demand prices fetched by superior burgers and sandwiches. If you're promising spicy aioli, I want spicy and I want garlicky. If your promising pork belly, oh man I want that pork belly. But if you deliver a burger that's just slightly better than an average burger and demand prices of gourmet burgers...of course I'll be disappointed.",0,0,0

This is an awesome venue!  You can enjoy lunch, dinner or just happy hour!  A couple of co-works and I had lunch here yesterday.  And it was hmmm good!

Food:  The food is awesome here!  I have eaten here numerous times and I not been disappointed with any of my meals.  Yesterday, I had the fish and chips and the outside breading was crisp with a nice crunch.  The fish was moist and not ""fishy"" at all.   And their tarter sauce, rich, think and very flavorful.  I am not sure what they do to their fry's but they are some of the best I have ever had!

Environment: This is a fun place!  Loud enough to be fun but not too loud where you can't think and conduct a business meeting.  It is a bit dark, but what do you expect from a brewpub.  I would not say this is a kid's joint but if you are outside it is more accommodating for a family.

Service:  Our server was awesome!  She was on the ball with our order and getting our food out in a very timely manner!  Knew when we need a beverage refill but did not ""bug"" us.

All in all, I would recommend Four Peaks to anyone!  Even if you don't drink beer it is a great venue and AWESOME food.

I'd had their 8th St. Ale and Kilt Lifter prior to the visit, but was looking forward to sampling a few of their other beers.  All were excellent.  The oatmeal stout was delicious, even to this self-proclaimed ""hophead"".  It appears that they have a couple different IPAs on tap regularly--the Raj, which is an English style and the Hop Knot which is the more traditional, florally over-hopped American version.  That was the way to go in my opinion!  They also had a seasonal called Double Knot--a double IPA.  Absolutely delicious and potent at 9.1% abv without killing the hoppiness with an overly alcoholic taste--a difficult thing to pull off with a double IPA in my opinion.  Also had dinner on the front patio while there.  I had fish and chips.  Fairly standard for pub fare as far as I was concerned although I did really like the chips, which were really just very nicely seasoned thick fries.  The new Nimbus in Tucson has set the standard to me for the fish portion, and this did not top that.  Still tasty though and a fair portion.  A friend of mine got the salmon BLT, which looked quite tasty.
On a Thursday night, the place was packed.  But there was still a fair amount of room to get to the bar for a drink while waiting for a table, which really only took about 10 minutes (we were told the wait would be 15-20).  We sat outside on a nice patio that runs the length of the front of the bar.  Heaters are abundant for those chilly AZ february nights.:)  
If there was a parking lot, I missed it.  There's on-street parking however, but you might have to walk a few blocks once you find a vacant spot.
Wait staff was young, friendly, and energetic, but not overbearing.  They gave us our space while we had our meals.
The interior is huge, nicely decorated, and clearly a brewery when you make your way towards the back.  Plenty of seating, plenty of room to stand as well.
For those who want to take home some ""souvenirs"", they do sell beer by the growler (as well as provide refills after the initial bottle purchase).  It looks like they also run the gambit on ""Four Peaks"" clothing as well.
Overall, a great place to visit, but if you're from out of town, watch carefully--the turn onto 8th St. is easy to miss.",1,0,1

I was really excited to go to a brewery in a college town since at my alma mater, they had this fabulous brewery where i probably spent half my time at because it was just...the best place ever.  I loved how everything on the menu had something soaked in beer!  Whether it was their beer bread, chicken tenders fried in beer something, it was so good!

I got their Portabella Veggie Beer Bread (more of a wrap) and it was seriously packed with fresh vegetables and was wrapped in their beer bread.  You could tell the bread was freshly made because it was so soft and yummy.  Next time, I would ask for a little less cheese...I think they put in a lot.  I was really bummed that I didn't try any of their brews.  If you look on the menu, they suggest the type of beer you should get with each plate, which I thought was real neat!  

And OMG, the fries!  So good!!!!!  Fries in general are good, but their fries, it's seriously on another level.  

For dessert, my friends and I got their tiramisu, but their take on it was not putting in rum, but guess what they put in instead....beer.  It was seriously like 8 inches tall and 4 people couldn't even finish.  It didn't taste that different....it was actually real sweet.

We got there at 10, wasn't that busy. Right off the bat I was treated with a rude bouncer because I wasn't 21. He basically never looked me in the eye and said better order to go if you want food.

So I walk in, solid system if all you have to do to get into your bar and not get carded is say I'm ordering to go, and the bartender just says take a seat. Ok, someone makes sense here finally because I don't want to drink beer to begin with.

So we sit down, have our food, finish, then I notice the bouncer coming to our table. He says ""I see you didn't listen to me, you have to pack up it up."" I tell him we only order food and water, with our water sitting right there. His next response is what got it, ""I don't care. You didn't listen, now pack it up and get the fuck out."" I said to the out of shape fat bouncer, ""well I need my damn check and a box unless you want to just give me a free meal."" 

Our waiter was good and she was even amazed that he swore at us. But what really got me when I called the manager to just let them know about the attitude of the bounce, the manager made up excuses like ""we get a lot of college people trying to pull a fast one and I would have told someone pulling a fast one to get the fuck out."" We'll you know what, all I had was water and my bill says that, so I don't see why assume you should be allowed to swear at a customer that was told by the bar to just take a seat. 

Oh, the place has a nice roach infestation. I saw 3 go by once I finished my meal. I thought I was going to be sick. Don't go to this place, it's a shit hole environment, the food is average.

When we finally ordered and received our sampler, we were only impressed with the oatmeal(dark stout like a Guinness taste) and peach lager such that we ordered a pint of peach lager. The Hip Knot and Hefeweizen tasted very generic and were not particularly memorable. While I may have chosen the wrong day\/time to visit Four Peaks, I was disappointed with my experience for the price. Overall, good place but not wow I need to come back great!",2,1,2

The Beer: pretty consistently awesome.  All the beers are at least ""good,"" my favorites being 8th Street Ale and their IPAs (Hop Knot and Raj).  I have to say the Kiltlifter is a tad overrated, but still pretty solid, and worth a try.  I've been meaning to try one of their cask conditioned ales, but they always seem to be out, probably indicative of the quality of those selections.

The Food: fantastic!  I can't say that I've ever had a bad meal at Four Peaks.  The Italian Beef Beer Bread is the best thing on the menu, but you can't go wrong with the Chicken Fingers, Chicken Salad Pita, or really any of their sandwiches.  The fries are also great here - there's a little crispy coating on the outside that is quite tasty.  Oh, and the Spicy Thai Hummus is also a really good appetizer.  A little more liquidy than your average hummus, but really good.  It has a nice little kick to it that will have you reaching for your beer.

As for the stoutamisu - i'm a huge fan of traditional tiramisu, so wasn't sure if i'd like this version. Once again, Four Peaks has proven me wrong (and so did my brother who insisted I try both). In this version, the lady fingers are soaked in Oatmeal Stout and has the most incredible chocolate cream covering the outside along with chocolate shavings! This is an awesome twist on the classic, especially since I usually don't like stout, i happily ate this dessert :) As for the portion, it's huge - i think one slice was the length of my forearm and the width my forearms combined!",1,0,0

Great service by an attentive waitress. Waters were immediately refilled without asking and she checked on us an appropriate number of times to make sure our food was as ordered and to see if we needed more beers. 

I ordered the peach beer which was light and crisp, almost like a cider. Very easy to drink and not super filling. The person I was with got the sampler ($10) which gave about a 4 oz portion of each of the 8 beers. He then ordered a sunbru to go with his meal. 

Food was pretty good as well. I got the chicken beer bread sandwich with a side salad. The beer bread is awesome - soft, chewy, and flavorful. The chicken was juicy and the addition of the artichokes and mozzarella was a yummy combo. However, I was looking forward to the cucumber sauce being like a greek tzatziki but it was pretty bland. The side salad was nice and fresh and the homemade balsamic was delicious!  He got the salmon Blt with beer fries. Fries were crispy but a bit under seasoned. Salmon Blt was great.

We hopped the light rail, walked a few blocks and landed on Four Peaks patio where a few pitchers of Hop Knot washed down that stellar artichoke dip (tip: ask for a side of celery, which arrives ice cold and crisp, and marvel at how it contrasts the warm, gooey delishishnous...while making you feel sorta healthy for having a veg). 

Normally, I would have a burger, but only if a willing victim will split it with me because those suckers are enormous (but so worth it). This time, not so much, so I had chicken strips with a side salad thinking I'd craft my own ""crispy"" chicken salad. The strips were PHENOM- super moist and crispy without being greasy. The chipotle ranch is also amazing and not shy about the chipotle (gringo alert: it's spicy). Honey mustard was also out of this world- so fresh, tangy and sweet. 

I LOVE that they make their own dressing in addition to ridiculously amazing beer in such a cool, welcoming environment where all ages sit back and enjoy pints. I also love that they've added more shade to the patio so there's more premium seating.  

I don't love that the side salad I ordered was a wilted iceberg mix topped with super pale and sad mushy tomatoes. I think they reserve the prime time veg for entree salads.  Oh well...one more Hop Knot, please! there's veg in beer, right?",1,1,1

The food and beer here are spectacular, unfortunately, the place is overrun by frat boys, plagued by iffy service, always crowded and loud, and features a nightmarish parking situation.

First off, the beer here is glorious. I'm a man who loves beer, but not just any old brew will do. Guinness is about as low-end as I'm willing to go, and I much prefer local micro-brews. Four Peaks meets my very high, some might say pretentious, standards. They offer a wide variety here, everything from blonde to black, with a fairly inexpensive sampler to try them all at once. For my money, I like the deliciously rich, slightly sweet, slightly smokey Oatmeal Stout, or the floral, aggressively hopped, moderately bitter Hop Knot. (I love the Kilt Lifter, but I don't order it because it's available in stores.) The Hop Knot is especially good when it's cask-conditioned, as it's a bitter mellower in flavor and allows the hoppy taste to really bloom. Their website lists which beers will be offered cask-conditioned during the coming week, and it's well worth planning your trip accordingly.

The food here is generally what you'd expect: burgers, sandwiches, salads, pizza, wings, and of course, fish and chips. Everything here has been very good; you really can't go wrong with any order. But the there are a few standouts. The fish and chips here is stellar, among the best I've ever had. Crispy, beer-battered, and made with real fish and served with damn good fries. The Bavarian pretzel appetizer is amazing too, especially if you're a fan of mustard (sorry, not served with cheese). And I had the current best-burger-of-my-life here about a year ago. It was a daily special that I haven't seen since, but still, their menu burgers are excellent. Fresh meat, well-spiced, huge, and nicely laden with toppings. The only one I don't recommend is the Popper burger, as I think the flavors don't mesh too well. But that could just be me.

So, the downside... Parking is horrendous. Literally, the worst parking situation for any place I know of. I've walked a quarter mile from my car to the restaurant. I'm not exaggerating, I used a pedometer on my phone. The only real parking options are along the street, on one side, and it's parallel parking in tiny spots. Also, service is very inconsistent. About half the time, we get a competent, but not amazing server. And the rest of  the time, we get ignored. It seems like if you aren't drinking beer, you get no attention from the wait staff. The place is always packed, always loud. There usually isn't a wait to get in. But, you'll be bumping elbows with the guy behind you, shouting to be heard at your own table, and doing some serious squeezing and weaving to get to the bathroom. It's a bit better sitting outside, but only a bit, and then you'll have to deal with the weather. On big game nights, the place is insane and best avoided.

There are a lot of hassles to deal with when you eat here, but the food and the brew make it worth it. In fact, if the food and beer were all the mattered, the place would earn an easy 5 stars. Of course, in nearly every other category, it would get 1 star.",0,0,0

Unfortunately stars aligned and I found myself in a shouting match with a doorman.  From what I know about doormen you want one thing. A guy who loses his temper and sends rational thought to the wind. Rather than refusing me service upon inspection of my perfectly valid drivers license with which I have been out happily drinking for 4 years and sending me on my merry way, my ID was held as a sort of ransom. Minutes flew as we argued there street-side. I  jumped through so many hoops trying to get my ID back I could have won a ribbon at the Eukenuba dog show. I recited my birthday, over and over. Yes maybe the tenth time I will slip. Or maybe I want my ID back to leave. I recited it so many times everyone in line knew my date of birth. I wrote down my address, phone number, date of birth. Still he was unsatisfied. 

It seemed to sink in that I was who I claimed when my accompanying party was able to tell him my address and my birthday. But this only further raised his suspicions. He stumbled on a thought of pure cunning, like Archimedes shouting in the street naked proclaiming his epiphany.

""Why would they all know where he lives?""

Yes, very fishy. By now it was clear. He believed it was an elaborate ruse. For what though? To infiltrate the mecca of gentrification? Or just to get a couple beers? And yes whenever I go out I make sure everyone know my address it's the only way I can get into any overrated restaurant.  It was easier to get through TSA when I came back from Mogadishu with a suitcase full of Qurans.

 By now he is flustered. He calls out again. 

""You didn't exactly make my job easier.""

Yes, that is the role of a customer at a business that is in the service industry after all. Maybe I will wash dishes after I am done to save everyone from doing their job.

It took a manager to pry the ID from him and finally the refusal of service came. It was sort of like when you know someone is going to dump you so you spring into action to dump them first.

This place is just packed constantly! However I do love a nice summer drinking session on the patio here when all the college kiddos are away and it's just a little less insane. I've eaten here once and yes the food was really really good, but I gotta be honest, I come here to drink beer. And lots of it! Four Peaks Brewery has grown in popularity at an alarmingly rapid rate, and their beers really back up that big game they talk! They offer all the typicals: Hefe's, IPA's, Pale Ales, Stouts, etc.... but they add their own spin to each one. The Hopulent IPA has a crisp hoppy finish to it that is just divine! The Kiltlifter is by far my favorite of Four Peak's selection, as it reminds me of my favorite beer from back East, and it's now offered in cans making it an excellent choice for your next poolside beverage!

Because it is technically a restaurant, there is no smoking on the patio.... UNTIL 10PM. The nightly ritual involves all the smokers getting one ready a minute before 10, then lighting up as soon as the ash tray hits the table (sometimes before...). It gives everyone a sense of unity... and a good laugh!",1,1,0

LOVE:
1. The location, in a quiet part of Tempe.
2. The History of the building, an old Creamery.
3. The ambiance.
4. The service.
5. The food, any burger on the beer bread, oh yes!!
6. The Seasonal Beers and Hop Knot!!

HATE:
1. Warm Beer almost every time, they really need to work on their temperature on the serving lines.
2. Can be quite noisy and crowded in there, no AC equals uncomfortable customers in the summer.

Appetizers [edamame & pretzels] were hearty. My meal was the chicken fingers & fries. I couldn't hardly finish it because there was soooo much. The beer batter on the chicken was nothing like I'd had before.

It seems like every city has their versions....This makes for a fun brew finding mission when I visit other cities. Several conversations with friends recommended Four Peaks as the place ""[I] will love it!"". Reading a dozen different Yelp reviews the expectation grew...When we made the turn on 8th St. I felt lost for a moment before the gleam of light showed a well marked restaurant\/brewery. The building is a converted warehouse....and they did a fantastic job converting it into a brewery.

If you have never been here before (and over 21) check out the beer sampler. 3oz sampler of each brew on their regular rotation! My favorites are the Hefeweizen and the Arizona Peach. ""The Peach"" as they call it is probably one of the more unique tastes in beers I have had the pleasure of tasting. The chicken nachos were awesome. Most of the time when I have chicken on nachos the meat ends up slightly dry. In this case the chicken remained moist and flavorful. The fries were battered in some kind of awesome...like the seasoning was baked into it or something. 

Four Peaks has a friendly and fast waitstaff. As confirmed, the ladies that make up the waitstaff are very attractive..maybe it startled me but it was refreshing to see such great personality (as we were cutting up a little and the waitress we had was fueling the fire with her playful comments...)

I was only here briefly for a light snack and a few drinks so I never got to fully experience this place. No question it was a great place that is very locally celebrated...something I personally appreciate. Service was great, food was great, beer was awesome....these are the reasons for 5 stars

All the beer is brewed on site which means everything is fresh -- they actually use the same water they serve at the tables in the brewing process, to give you an idea how pure the finished product is. 

No matter if you're there to eat or knock a few back Peaks is a must. You can't go wrong with virtually anything on the menu but anyone happening upon Peaks for the first time should absolutely order an entree or side of the fries, an undisputed favorite. I usually go with anything involving blackened chicken, be it salad or nachos.

The sampler trey is offered at a reasonable price and provides about 4 oz servings of each of the beers listed on the big board. If you're looking for something lighter I would suggest the Sunbru or Peach -- my personal favorite is doing a half & half of Oatmeal Stout with Peach. Get inventive.

About half restaurant and half huge brewery. We decided on a table outside, there were those water misters and that sounded great to me. 

We decided on two samplers and at $9.00 each, it was a great deal and we got to try everything on the menu.

We were not quite starving so we settled on an appetizer and picked the Shrimp and Goat Cheese Bruschetta. The Shrimp were large, served with fresh foccacia and garlicky tasting brushetta mix.

But if you're reading this in the summer, you might want to knock it down a few stars.  Only misters and fans really don't cool the patio down enough when it's 110 outside.  But if you need a Four Peaks fix during the summer, head up to the Scottsdale location.  Maybe not as historic, and maybe it lacks some of the charm of the original - but the beer is the same and food is just as good up there.

The beers are great - love the usual selections, and the seasonals are always interesting.  Even when I don't love them (the Double Knot was just OK to me) they are always worth a try for the experience and the new flavor.  Kiltlifter and the Hop Knot have become my favorite regulars, but the Pumpkin Porter CANNOT BE BEAT around Thanksgiving time.  You really need to get in during Thanksgiving week to have some.  

Food is always reliable.  The Popper Burger is everything that's good in this world.  Great burger, spicy jalepenos and a nice thick slab of cream cheese.  You know, if you're into that sort of thing.  Which I am.

The fries are tasty, I've always enjoyed the pizzas as well.  Some of the other offerings are just OK, but I've never had a *bad* meal here.

Here they let us sample the grains, hops, and the tour comes with 2 drink tickets. Our guide Remy was entertaining and kept the tour interesting. The biggest issue I had with this tour, was the fact that after the tour, in order to try their delicious food and beer, and use your drink tickets, you had to go back out, put your name down, and wait for a table. OR, if you were able to snag a seat at the bar, you could, but it's very limited seating. 

There was a large seating area towards the area where the tour started, that didn't appear to be occupied or used. It was just there, complete with tables and chairs, just not being used. NOW, I don't know about you, but wouldn't it be a great idea, to allow the people who just finished the tour, to sit at those tables and allow them to use their drink tickets there? Maybe even order some food? It just didn't make sense that you'd pay for a tour, already inside the building, to then kick you out, so you can get a table back inside the restaurant.

I've never had a beer from this place that I didn't like, and the food is top notch. Plus, no matter what night you hit up Four Peaks there's always a decent and fun crowd around you. It's also right off ASU's campus, but you never feel like you're at a college bar. 

This location is a pain to park at, but once you get inside it's worth the small inconvenience. You can park on 8th street, but you may end up a distance from the bar unless you're lucky. I did have one shock when I arrived. It's been quite some time since I've been to the Tempe location, and it turns out it's a much more legit restaurant than it used to be. We were greeted by a hostess, and given a buzzer to wait for a table. This isn't the free-for-all I remember Four Peaks was when I was in college. We were seated outside. It was a cool night, but the patio was loaded with heaters. 

With generous portions, the place is really good about sharing. My girlfriend and I met another couple here. We all ordered beers, nachos as an appetizer, and then both couples split a meal. Even though we split the meals, all four diners were given full size sides with the orders. I had half of a swiss and mushroom turkey burger. It was perfectly cooked to the point that I almost forgot I was having turkey instead of beef. The nachos were also great. But there was one negative, they brought the meals out just minutes after the nachos. The bad pacing for trying to keep everything hot while you're eating it. It also made it tough because there was no room on the table. But everything is so good, I'll let it slide.",4,1,1

Last night, we had a group in from out of town so thought we'd take them to Four Peaks.  We called ahead and spoke to a gentleman who told us that ""We are never busy on weekday afternoons during the summer"" (Um, was he being sarcastic?  He sounded sincere...) and that ""There is a big parking lot that most people don't know about behind the restaurant and to the east.""  He also said that reservations were not necessary because they were not busy, nor did they expect to be.

We were surprised when we arrived and the ""big parking lot"" was actually very small and entirely occupied.  In fact, it was so cramped that it required driving backward for a significant amount of time to exit because there was no room to turn around.  The only parking we were able to find was probably 1\/4 to 1\/2 mile away down the street.  Since I am hugely pregnant and my sister has a small baby and it was 113 degrees outside, our family members dropped us off in front of Four Peaks while they went to park the car so that we would not have to walk in the heat.

When we approached the hostess (who, by the way, is located outdoors), we had to wade through a decently-sized crowd (also waiting for tables).  We were told that ""until the majority of the party arrived, we could not put our name on the list.""  In a normal restaurant, this would only seem fair because customers can sit or stand in an air conditioned building.  However, we were only 1 person short of having the majority of our party there and that person was parking the car.  The only reason he was not there yet was because this facility does not bother to provide its customers with a place to park their vehicles.  Having lived in the DC area for the last 6 years, I can say that this is to be expected in a big city but in Arizona, it is unacceptable to me.  Most every other business has to pay for\/provide parking for their customers.  What makes Four Peaks so special?

My mom asked how long the wait would be.  ""We cannot tell you until the majority of your party is here.""  Based on their silly little policy, I guess this would make sense.  She asked, ""If the person is here within 5 minutes, how long would the wait be?""  We were told 25-30 minutes... which is far from what we were told when we called ahead.  Given, I understand it would have been impossible for the man we spoke with 30 minutes earlier to predict a massive influx of customers immediately before we arrived but at the same time, it does seem a little more than ironic that this would happen on this very day within 30 minutes of our telephone call.  I can only deduce that he was being dishonest.

My mom asked if we could wait somewhere with air conditioning since we were there with a pregnant person and a baby.  The hostess pointed to the bar area, which was not an option for us because we were there with two minors.  So, basically, we were given two options: stand outside in 113 degree weather and no shade with a pregnant lady and a baby for 25-30 minutes, or leave.  We chose to leave.

Unfortunately, since parking was such a nightmare, it took us some time to reconnect with the person who drove as well as with the other two vehicles in our party that were just arriving.  It was a serious mess.  Had it not been so terribly hot, it would have just been inconvenient.  Factor in the heat and it became a health hazard.  

A little customer service goes a long way.

We will not return.",4,1,0

I hate that every time I've gone to Four Peaks, I've had to wait, wait, wait for a table.  Four Peaks doesn't have a host or hostess who is handling seating so you're completely on your own.  I suppose if you go at at time that the place isn't completely packed, it's a decent system.  

Every evening I've gone, I've found myself frustrated that I couldn't get a seat or practically had to start a fist-fight to get one.

It would be a great pairing with one of their burgers.  I also enjoyed their 8 Street Ale for those interested in a lighter beer.

We also decided to start with some of their Arizona chicken rolls, as my friend had all kinds of recommendations from friends to try them.  I couldn't believe how big these things were!  They're basically small fried burritos stuffed with chicken, anaheim chiles, and cheese.  The sweet jalapeño dipping sauce it comes with is ridiculously good!  These are best split amongst 4 people.

Waiting for seats took a while, but once we sat down, the food was really quick to arrive. I think the service was okay - it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't fantastic either. I attribute that to the fact that the place was just sooo busy. 

We ordered Brickhouse wings for appetizer. I ordered the Italian Beef Beer Bread and my boyfriend ordered Bleu Light Special Burger. We also shared a pint of the Hop Knot IPA. The beer was exquisite. It had a rich flavor that you can really enjoy. I definitely want to go back and try their other ales. The wings were really good, too - a little spicy for my liking (we sampled all three flavors), but a good starter nonetheless. My boyfriend's burger was all right, kind of like any other burger. But the beer battered fries it came with was PHENOMENAL. It's definitely a must-try if you go. Even in England, I'd never had such flavorful beer battered fries. I also loooved my Italian Beef Beer Bread. It came in a wrap instead of sandwich.

Granted, I don't care for beer, so this is more or less a review of the food, atmosphere, and non-beer-like drinks. I have been here a few times with the husband (he loves it here) and I just don't get the hype. The food is bar food. Straight up bar food. I like the outdoor seating much better than indoor. Inside the place feels a little dreary, much like many bars I have encountered. The servers are friendly enough, although sometimes the service is a little slow. I get something different to eat every time, which if you know me, is not a good thing. When I like something, I get it every visit, but here, I am just searching for something - anything - that I like enough to order next time. Sigh. I know I'll be back, and I can't say I dread coming here - I usually have fun. I just feel like there are many places I'd rather spend my money on.",0,0,1

The shrimp and goat cheese is AMAZING, but be prepared for major garlic breath.  My BF's garlic breath was so strong, it made my eyes water.  But it was worth it!  Hehe.

The beer is amazing, the food is amazing and the people are amazing! I have never tasted a beer here that I don't like (though the Hopknot and the Stout and incredible and in my opinion the best) and I have never eaten anything here that I haven't liked. I've made it my mission to branch out and try all of the food to see if I could find something that I disliked. I completely failed at that. From the Adovada to the Thai Hummus, everything is bursting with astounding flavor and cooked with care. Maybe that is why I never mind paying a few extra dollars when I decide to eat here; it's so good! And, just when I thought that all the lunch and dinner food was amazing, I tried their breakfast. As one might guess from the review thus far, breakfast at Four Peaks is great as well!

The main problem is...I feel like they didn't even TRY to seat us, hoping we would leave (probably because we were young).  As enormous waves of people spilled out and the lines outside emptied. We were \/repeatedly\/ told that our table would be ready in 10 minutes, but after another 30 minutes of waiting and the seaters avoiding eye-contact, we still were not seated.

It took us about 2.5 HOURS to get seated, and our party had to be split up.

Now, to the important part. Drinks and foods. I haven't tried the beer due to personal reasons but the cider was good - they have a full bar for those with food allergies\/ sensitivities, so if you can't drink beer, don't be discouraged! Try their other drinks which are equally good. 

The enchiladas and the massive five layer nacho plate was good considering it was bar food. I highly recommend the nacho plate appetizer when with a large group - for about $9.50 you get so much food. Check out the happy hour that takes place from 2-6 and from 11pm onwards. I haven't tried their actual dinner menu with the burgers and salads, but I want to go back to try.

One of the aspects that stood out to me the most was the great service. Four Peaks had better service than the other breweries or bars that I have been to. All of the waiters were awesome - they checked in often, filled our glasses, and made sure that we were cared for. 

No wonder the place was packed on a Thursday evening - they have amazing servers and amazing drinks.

Yeah, not the best time to go.  I'd been there around normal bar hours before, but totally forgot about the whole ""restaurant"" aspect of the place.

The time we went is kind of the odd in between time of people going to eat dinner and people still there for happy hour, so it was pretty packed.  There were several groups of people waiting for tables to eat when we got there.  Good thing we were invited to try to find a seat on the bar.   *Try* being the operative word.  It's a huge bar in the middle of the floor, with seating on 3 sides, but there weren't any seats at all.  Hmm. 

So, my friend and I got to enjoyed our first brewery crafted treat standing in between a few tables, with the seated patrons kinda checking the two of us out like, ""dumbass... didn't you realize it'd be this full?""  *shrug*

Thankfully, after about 15 minutes a couple seats at the bar opened up.  Hooray!  

I suggest the Oatmeal Stout, Kiltlifter and Hefeweizen.  All are really good, and priced nicely at less than $4.  How cool is that?

I've become obsessed with their Hefewiezen, especially in the hot summer months. And still haven't touched a Kiltlifter in several years. And their menu has become one of my favorite bar menus in the entire Valley. Always delicious, quality eats that satisfy any hungry beer drinker.
In fact, I love their Hefewiezen and Carne Asada so much, that I served it at my wedding. Think I'm kidding? I am not. Well, actually, I couldn't get their Hefewiezen because they don't do small kegs, only college frat party size kegs and that would have been far too much beer. But we sure did serve that Carne Asada (they forgot the tortillas, dammit). and the guests raved about it all night. Nice work, Four Peaks!",0,0,2

Anyhow - I've been there twice and have loved it both times. The first time I got the Kiltlifter - I think its their most popular bc I work in a bar and everyone always asks for it. Then once we got our table, I got the beer sampler. I love those things...you get a little bit of each beer and it's wonderful! My friends and I shared the Nachos. Probably some of the best I've ever had. And I LOVE nachos. 

Last night, I got the Peach Ale - delicious. Kinda girly, but it's what I was in the mood for. I decided to try something new and I got the quesadilla - also delicious. So good that I had a dream about quesadillas last night. hahah.

I have my favorite meal and when I have a fav it's hard for me to get anything else so I get the Carne Adovada. Tender with a rich smoky flavor which is really unique to Four Peaks. They serve it with black beans, rice (which I don't eat), sour cream and two big, soft, warm tortillas. It's not spicy but I add some additional kick with some AZ hot sauce. They recommend a Hop Knot which I love but I actually prefer the 8th street with this meal, just a bit lighter. 

Today's visit was very nice, our waiter was very attentive offering samples of the beer, water and checked on us often. Our food came out crazy fast. A woman who I think was the manager came by and checked on us. The bus boys removed our plates quickly. We walked around to look at the building and a gentleman from the back area came to speak with us and gave us a bit of history on the building.

When I got the Gyro pita I was pretty bummed, there was little to no lamb meat on it. it was filled with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. Everything tasted okay, but the ratio to meat was ridiculous. Then on my boyfriends New Yorker, we couldn't even really tell if there was pastrami on it, lots of coleslaw and maybe some bacon. It was bizarre.

Cool interior!  Old building repurposed well.  Comfortable open arrangement fairly well laid out and not feeling claustrophobic.  I was told by a local last night that it was once a creamery.

Friendly and attentive staff and atmosphere.  Lots of tvs if that is important to you.  Bathrooms might be improved on, seeming smallish and humid, but fairly well maintained.

All that other stuff aside, the beer selections are excellent, plus they have cask sometimes.  I find the Hop Knot IPA to be excellent.

With on-site brewing of several classics and rotating seasonal brews, if you're a beer drinker you won't be disappointing by Four Peaks. The service is usually reasonably fast, so you won't be left with an empty glass for long. You will have to wait for a table on a Friday or Saturday night, but they can usually get you sat pretty fast.

There are only two downsides to Four Peaks. The food is OK, nothing special. I've had several different entrees, and while they aren't bad, they aren't anything to write home about either. The other downside is their location. They are on a side street in Tempe, about two miles from Mill Ave, where most of the bars are located. Their parking is abysmal; you either have to find a street spot, of which there are usually none, or you have to park in their hardly-lit back lot. Generally, when I'm thinking of going there, the parking is a big limitation. 

Their location is also strange, as it is neither a great spot to launch a night out in Tempe, nor is it calmer than Mill. The ASU ""bros"" are in full attendance on the weekends, so don't expect to kick back and enjoy your craft beer in peace. At the same time, if you want to get to Mill, you'll have to get back into your awkwardly parked car or take a $10+ cab ride to Mill. Still, they're a little cheaper than Gordon Biersch, which is on Mill, so you may break even. 

Four Peaks is a Tempe must-visit. Plan for the parking and expect a lively crowd and you'll have a great time.",0,0,0

However food was quick, so no complaints. 

Fries were amazing. It made me wish I would have gotten their fry appetizer, which was a poutine..nom nom nom. My sandwich? Weeelllllll. The first few bites were ok. The flavor mix is great. Loved that, but it seems like the mint and cilantro and such were gone by the fourth bite. Then it was disappointing. I was really kicking myself for ordering it. I ate it all like a champ and crossed a culinary to do of my list. Husbands fish and chips were good. I tried to steal them,  but struck out. 

I'm not sure if this is coincidence, but I'm thinking not because I rarely rarely get stomach issues. A few hours later I felt a little off. Then at bedtime I struggled with nausea. Not the kind that makes you uncomfortable, but the kind where your body is like""get it out of me"" It was not a pretty night, but I felt fine the next day. So.I'm not sure. Do with this what you want, I'm not saying it was the food, but it is oddly coincidental since I didn't eat anything else. 

However, all is not lost. I'm not giving up. I love the menu and I feel like it was bahn mi karma that got me. I will be back top give this place a fair go at something I know I should like.

The entrees we ordered were also very good.

Fish & Chips: the fish was excellent and lightly breaded with their signature beer batter.  Chips were also lightly breaded in their batter, but I personally prefer my fries un-breaded. 

Burger & Fries:  Black Angus burger cooked to perfection (med-rare) and was very flavorful and juicy.  Again, fries breaded...

The food here is completely overrated. I think it's one of those local, established places that maybe had good food at one point, but then got lazy and sloppy in the kitchen. And now locals can't stop raving about it because it's the cool thing to do. Don't listen to that. I've been here a number of times and tired different things and for the most part it is bland a greasy. Especially the beer bread. Also this location has a way of making you feel awkward and unwanted at the door. There is always 4-5 hostesses and bouncers sitting at the front talking and laughing amongst themselves when you walk up. None of which seem to want to take their eyes away from twitter long enough to help you. And the bouncers always have a serious authority complex.

I found a spot at the bar and immediately decided on a flight of the standard offerings, which included an impressive, varied and affordable selection of eight samples for only $10. Sold. The rack included Sunbru (Kolsch), Raj IPA, Hop Knot (IPA), 8th St Pale Ale (English), Peach ale (fruit), Kilt Lifter (Scottish), White Ale (Belgian) and Oatmeal (stout). Naturally, they also serve pints and growler fills for those interested (if I wasn't flying I would've considered this a viable option for the Kilt Lifter or White).

Regarding lunch, I was craving something a little different and their specials menu featuring an elk burger fit the definition since I've never had one before.

The bar appeared well staffed, but the first two people, who were behind the bar, who were handling alcohol, growled condescendingly when I approached them ""only the bar tender can sell you a growler"". So, I'm new here, and it's busy. But pointing out who the hell can actually help me, or even getting their attention, would be nice. And the division of labour was anything but clear. If you're behind the bar, serving beer, I assume you're a bar tender.

So, which beer to get? I like their Kilt Lifter, but it's available everywhere in east valley. I wanted something dark. They had a stout on tap, perfect I thought. But, having finally found someone who could actually help me, I learned it was not available in growlers. The only other option was a black ipa. I'm not fond of ipas, but it seemed to be the only non-light beer available besides Kilt Lifter, and I'd never had a black ipa.

The black ipa was decent paired with the right food (pulled pork sandwiches with plenty of bbq sauce), and I'm sure it's fantastic if you're into ipas.

Why the low rating? Entirely because of the service. I'll find the place perfect next time. The area looks bicycle friendly in case I don't want to deal with parking. I understand not selling special small batches in bulk. But rude staff? Low rating.",1,0,0

First of all, they're a brewing company so they have to have good beer, right?  Check!  In order to get people to stay and drink beer, they have to have a good menu . . . check!  To get said people to come back again and again you have to have good tasting food, right?  CHECK, CHECK, and DOUBLE CHECK!!

All of the food I've had is top notch and delicious!  And the beers??  I crave them!!  It was Kilt Lifter that first hooked me.  Then the Hop Knot (see my Nello's review for the best Hop Knot in town tip).  And the Pumpkin Porter, one of the best seasonals EVER!  

While I think it is spectacular that you can get various Four Peaks Brew's at some of the coolest establishments across the state (even the Pumpkin Porter, when available), there is one brew that I can only find when I am lucky enough to go to Four Peaks . . . THE OATMEAL STOUT.  This is the most delicious, most creamy and smooth beer I have ever had in my life.  I dream of this beer.  The first time I tried this was shortly after I started drinking (and liking) stouts.   I tasted it, looked over at my BF and said ""I think this is better than Guinness.""  Of course I got the evil eye, but I'm sticking to my guns.  The Oatmeal Stout at Four Peaks is my favorite beer of all time!

Favorites from the menu include, Spicy Thai Hummus, Spanakopita, Bavarian Pretzels, Shrimp & Goat Cheese Bruschetta (it's a meal, but the garlic is no joke on this one), the salads are great, Bleu Light Special Burger, Veggie Beer Bread Wrap, Fish and Chips . . . just to name a few! =)

The patio is great.  The staff is friendly.  The parking is not the best, but eh, everything else makes it worth it.  Plus, I suggest taking a cab or the light rail anyway . . . better to not have to drive so that you can enjoy more brews!",2,1,1

But I went here on Friday, Oct. 26 with some friends from CO and was disappointed. For the first time. 

The server did her best as the place was packed (as usual) for a Friday lunch. But it took forever to get the Peach ale as she said they were tapping a new keg, and when we did receive it, the beer tasted flat and lacked the refreshing peach taste that normally accompanies this ale. It was the Peach ale, it was just not as good as previous visits. Maybe new keg? I don't know. One of my CO friends had been to 4Peaks before and said the same thing about this particular batch.

Then my friends ordered the Tap Room Tenderloin- both without onions. They both came with onions. And my favorite thing on the menu- the Portabella Beer Bread had been dramatically altered. Instead of the sauteed onions, mushrooms and tomatoes that used to be in the beer bread, it was carrots and broccoli. I love both of those veggies, but not in this sandwich\/wrap. It added a different taste & a crunch (both veggies were in thick, whole pieces) that was not tasty. I didn't even finish it- 1st time that's ever happened.

I'm sorry Four Peaks, I love you but you're slipping. When there are so many other brewpubs & restaurants serving craft beer, I'm baffled as to why you would change anything. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. But I guess you haven't heard that.",3,0,1

The place appears to be a large converted warehouse, almost looks like an old airport hangar in some spots to be honest, but that's just on the inside. The front, or outside patio has a what I would descrbie as an old Mission, Santa Fe, or New Mexico style facade, with some local desert plants, and about a dozen or so tables with chairs. We actually sat off from the main bar, in smaller section with several flatscreen T.V.'s. 

You can clearly see the brewing facility, mash tun, fermenters, etc. They have some swag for sale, growler bags, T-shirts, etc. as well near the restrooms. 

The food was pretty good, better than your typical brewpub too. (Reminded me of a BJ's backhome, but not how they are now, more what they USE to be 5-10 years ago) I ordered the Hopsquatch Barley wine, and my wife had a flight of about 8 of their standard taps, with a seasonal or two thrown in. 

None of their beers or food blew me away, but so far, AZ is not exactly a Beer mecca state either, so given that context, do yourself a favor, and check out a local spot.

First off, parking sucks and the place gets busy. I went on a Wednesday evening and it was packed. But with Happy Hour, what do you expect? Three dollar pints allowed me to try a bunch of their beers. My favorites included Kilt Lifter, Hop Knot IPA and the Raj IPA.

Yes, folks, yes it could. I traveled to Phoenix recently and stopped by Four Peaks. I started with a Kilt Lifter; delicious. We ordered the Thai Hummus to start; also delicious. Just the right amount of spice served with warm pitas. For my main course, I ordered the mushroom swiss burger. It was a good burger - I liked the addition of caramelized onions but didn't find anything that made it a stellar burger. But it was good. I tried a slice of the barbecue chicken pizza. That was yummy, but there wasn't enough barbecue sauce. Not sure if that's a typical thing or if that's just the way they happened to make this one pie.

I almost ordered the portabello veggie beer bread - beer and veggies? Mmmm.

The place is huge. We sat on the covered patio area - but there were outdoor tables and tons of indoor tables and bar space. It was a beautiful day to be sitting outside. I can imagine sitting there in the spring (summer might be pretty miserable) drinking a hefeweizen and just having a lovely time.

Plus, it's a Vikings bar. That adds half a star right there.",2,0,1

My husband loves beer (brews a ton of his own) and especially enjoyed the beer sampler. Trying 10 beers for around $9, yes please!  I don't really love beer so I had a cider and it was exactly what I needed.  For dinner I had the turkey burger with fries.  The turkey burger was standard but the fries were awesome.  I think it was the beer batter.  My husband go the carne adovada and he raved.  I think he may try to convince me to fly back to Phoenix just for that dish!

I've tried their soup & sandwich. It's it includes a homemade cup of soup and half of a roasted turkey club or roast beef sandwich, and I had the turkey club. Not bad. There's also a soup & salad combo if you liked to eat that inside. Boyfriend got their French dip. French dip is roasted beef simmered in au jus, topped with swiss cheese and served on a hoagie roll. The order comes with either beer battered fries, pasta salad or salad. They usually serve their salad dressing on the side, which I like because I don't like my salad drenched in sauce and eat it soggy. 

Four Peaks also sells big jugs of growlers. I believe they are $15 per, and if you bring it back for refill of any kind, you'll get a discount.

We decided to Yelp the area and found this restaurant with tons of reviews and great ratings. We arrived after 9p on a Saturday night and we found parking in the back parking lot. It was packed but luckily someone was leaving. We walked towards the front and as you enter you are carded. There is lots of patio seating and a sitting area\/ corn hole game to the right of the patio. There is a lot of indoor seating and we decided to grab a high top in the bar area.

Luckily, it was a lively night because the AZ college football game was on. Talk about die hard fans! Love the spirit and the energy from the locals. I never felt out of place and we felt comfortable have a drink and grubbing on late night eats. 

I ordered the Pear Ale and it was light and crisp. Enjoyed my 16oz-er! I ordered the cheeseburger (Swiss) and fries with no bun. Well my burger came out with a bun (which is fine), but I ordered my burger med rare. Unfortunately, my burger tasted like it was well done. The inside was totally cooked through and it was dry. I had to ask for mayo, mustard and ketchup. The fries were salty, too, so I barely touched them.

Service was good for the most part. Had to ask for condiments whereas the condiments should be offered or available on the table. Atmosphere and ambiance was awesome and I did enjoy hanging out with the locals!",8,4,7

My friend went for the Peach Ale, which she claimed to love, and I could see why. I normally can't stand fruit or sweet beers, but I would be happy with a glass. It's not too sweet, and it has *notes* of peach, not a full on peach assault. As for the food, I would love to go back and try an entree.

We went last night, Wednesday 9\/8\/2010, around 8pm for dinner and a few brews.  The restaurant is almost all by itself, with the surrounding area being residential and neighboring buildings were commercial.  It's almost like an oasis and by itself on 8th Street.  Was that a problem? Not at all.  The place creates its own ambiance without any outside help needed.  

We got there, quickly got a table and a greeting.  The beer selection was a good mix and they even had a few seasonal and cask conditioned brews in there as well.  We settled on splitting a pitcher of their Hop Knot IPA, which was a traditional IPA, 6% ABV, and just overall delicious.  We ordered our food and enjoyed the pitcher for a while, when the waitress came back over to us and apologized for the wait for our food order, stating the kitchen lost the ticket.  We had only been waiting for around 10 minutes with the beer before that, so it was no big deal and we weren't in any rush.  

Once we did get our food, it was just great.  Portions were greatly sized and the food was fresh and handmade.  Myself and 1 friend got the Italian Beef Beer Bread with their great Beer Battered Fries, and my Fiancee got a cheeseburger with a garden salad.  I'd like to point out that you have the option on sides and instead you can get a salad for an healthier option.  As burgers go, hers was a very decent size and came with the normal accoutrement but the money was in the fact that they know how to cook a burger.  She wanted medium rare and boy the color on that thing was perfect.  Moving on, the Italian Beef Beer Breads were stellar.  Homemade succulent beef shredded with green peppers, red onions, mushrooms, mozzarella cheese, and honey mayo rolled in their freshly made beer bread was just amazing.  The beer bread, for those who don't know, is made with the beer as a leavening agent and is similar to a pita, but better.  

Halfway through the meal, the waitress came back and delivered a bit of great news:  Her manager was comping the pitcher due to our wait.  We were just floored.  The fact that we were that well taken care of was appreciated.  We finished our meal and decided to grab a growler to go so we could have more drinks back at home.  The growler was appropriately priced, and refills are only $10, a great deal.  I have to say when I'm back in Tempe I'll be visiting again, just great all around.

If you live in Tempe and haven't been, put it on your list for this weekend, or heck, any night.  It's well worth it.

P.S.-- If you're a stickler for prices when going out then this place is for you.  Being that half of their menu is under $10 and the rest isn't much above that, you're wallet will thank you as well.

Cheers!",2,1,1

I wanted to point out this time the sticky hoppy pudding dessert. O. M. G. It was excellent and right up with the best desserts every. I do feel that perhaps it was not supposed to be a serving for one because when they brought it to me they also brought three spoons...but I was alone. But hey, I plowed through it.

Couple of caveats - my husband's the beer drinker, not me and he didn't try the sampler as he ordered without me. Although in his defence, he didn't know they had one - I took him there as a surprise with no pre-information ... I got a surprise myself though when I found it was only on-street parking. Not a big deal but would've been nice to know from the web site. Also would have been even nicer to know that the AC (if it was running) appeared to be non-existent - it was pretty dang hot in there. 

I don't know how the servers dealt with it, although the short shorts and tight tops were probably a good attempt. I've never been to Hooters but I imagine the work ""uniform"" is similar. 

When we sat down, it was mostly dark except for the lights of the tvs with their strobe effects. It made the menu a bit challenging. The building itself seems pretty cool, but coupled with the flashes led to an interesting comment from MH - namely that with a little tweaking, it would make a great haunted house. 

Oh, pretty noisy too - don't expect to have any real conversations in there, but anyway it's probably not the best place for one anyway. The atmosphere is very lively if that's what you're looking for,

Now to the food - good and reasonably priced. The hamburgers we had were HUGE, definitely knife and fork items. I loved the pasta salad , so much so I ordered a side order to take home. Although I probably didn't need to, so much came with the hamburger. Overall we each finished about half a plate. Saved the rest for next time (and probably the time after that ...) because it was a LOT of food. One comment about the wait staff - I know it's hot and they work very hard - but our server seemed to disappear for long periods of time. It was another guy who actually brought all the food and he was fast! 

I wish there was a way to transfer the menu to Rock Bottom, which I really like otherwise. Overall Four Peaks was ok, and maybe we'll go here again when it's cooler - a lot cooler! Enough said.",1,1,1

My friend from Seattle flew into Phoenix just to celebrate her birthday here! I know what you're thinking, of all places here? Well let me tell you, not only does it have good beer and a young crowd, their sandwiches are spectacular!

I had the Salmon BLT sandwich, and it goes in the list of one of the top sandwiches I've eaten. I never knew that adding salmon to a sandwich could make it taste so good. It was the combination of salmon, bacon, lettuce, tomato, their cheese, and probably a special ingredient that made it so tasty! 1\/2 of the sandwich was enough to fill me up. I saved the other half for my roommate who I had to share this delicious sandwich with! On the side I ordered the pasta salad which was very tasty too! The feta cheese added that extra pizazz! 

For dessert the birthday girl got three huge pieces of Tiramisu cake. Between a party of 10+, that was gone in 2 minutes! What I love about this place is the crowd. It's young, which appears to be a lot of recent graduates or people that just love good beer and good food.",6,4,5

It's better than any bar food I've had, huge servings, great fries, great beer, decent prices.  I personally like it better in the summer, when it's a lot less crazy, but for the food, I will brave the crowds.  Also, I've heard great things about the Pumpkin Porter so I'll definitely be back again in September.

Dishes I recommend: The nacho appetizer - there's lots of it and you won't regret adding meat to it.  The Reuben - my favorite and go-to item on the menu.  The fish and chips - my other go-to item.  The Italian beef beer bread - filling, cheesy, beef.  Need I say more?  Also, the Kiltlifter, the peach beer, and I'm sure many more that I've yet to try

That actually did not bother me very much because they had an ample amount of fans and the atmosphere of drinking a beer inside the brewery totally makes you get over it. The prices are very good in my opinion. The options they have were overwhelming, in a good way! I had such a hard time picking out an appetizer. I ended up ordering a pitcher of one of their fruity beers. I can't remember what it was called, but it was an ale and it was very good. I got the soft pretzel and it came with 2 dips. I guess one was supposed to be a jack cheddar cheese an the other was a dijon mustard. The pretzel was good, but the dipping sauces were terrible! The cheese sauce was so runny and didn't even taste good. I was surprised to hear that this was their ""new sauce"" for the pretzels. Bleh. The dijon mustard was alright. I am not a mustard fan at all, but I REALLY like the dijon mustard that Uncle Bear's has for their soft pretzels and I was hoping for something similar.

Lot's of outdoor tables and has a unique vibe to it, especially since it's not bogged down with tons of bars and business right next to it. 

I honestly come here for food more than the beer. Don't get me wrong, the beers are great, unique, and good in variety! But the food here to me is out of this world! You would see me here eating their food with water before you would see me putting away beer. Portions are usually pretty big, so keep that in mind. 

There's almost always a wait to be seated. The servers have overall been on point, with 1 bad experience from a server. I will say that was just a really random experience because it's never happened again. 

Also is great in terms of cultural diversity. Lots of ASU transfers and students from out of the country come here. There are a lot of Indian and Oriental students that visit depending on the time of year. I have had some great conversations with some people. Easy way to get some insight about their culture!

The beer is really good here. I like the lighter beers, such as their regular peach beer, but their other beers and seasonal are awesome too. The food is delish; I always get a hankering for their beer battered fries. Eat it with their jalapeño ranch sauce and it's perfect. That and some loaded chicken nachos are easily split between friends; their portion sizes are fairly huge. It's really an awesome spot to get together with friend, have a pint, enjoy a game and some good food.",2,1,1

Like many of the other reviewers, I STRONGLY recommend the Raj IPA, if hoppy beers are your thing. And though I didn't have it while dining here, we picked up a 6-pack of their Kiltlifter at a grocery store in Avondale the night before and was also highly impressed.

As for the food, both the sweet jalapeno chicken sandwich + beer-battered fries I got here and the grilled chicken beer bread (a wrap) at the Scottsdale location were honestly about as tasty of chicken sandwiches as I've ever had. And they DO NOT skimp on portion size. I would have tried more beer but I literally could not fit anything else in my stomach. And the service was very fast and very friendly as well.

We pull right up front - Rock Star parking!  I see the misting systems going - and people hanging around the front.  Beforehand, we had a little trouble finding it so stopped at a house to ask for directions.  There was a happy hour house party going on - about 10 - 20 somethings hanging in the front yard playing ping pong & BBQ'ing - looking like a beer ad for a commerical - we asked about FPBC & the guys were very happy to help us with the directions and said cool spot you will like it!  I say to my hubby, see this is why I love Tempe, are you sure you don't want to sell the house in PV and move here!?!  Hmmmm....

So we find it, my first thought was ok, part the BWM around the corner so we blend in!  Then I thought nah, lets just go!  The first thing I noticed was a sign that read ""no Minors"" so I have the hubby wait in the car and ask the very hip, very alternative looking door guy if we can bring our baby in & he says sure just don't try and slip him a drink!  I thought I like this place already!  We sat outside as it was a bit too loud inside (for the little guy).  As well, that scene in Sweet Home Alabama played in my head about the girl in a bar with a baby!  So we sat outside - thinking that would be better? Hee Hee...

Mind you I hate beer but played along, so I ordered the lightest beer on the menu it was a peach ale - YUMMY!  The hubby ordered three weird tasting beers and loved each one.  We had the chicken rolls which we amazing and the shrimp Bruchetta (sp?) they use WAY too much garlic but it was still good and a great portion size.

We will go back for sure, but I think we will leave the baby at home - so we can really enjoy the noise :)",2,1,2

The Girl and I were meeting up with a friend. He wasn't going to be ready for awhile, but we were hungry! So we headed out a little early. It's a good thing we did, because there was a wait. It was actually one of the less busy Friday nights I've seen, but a wait is typical on a busy night. The wait is made significantly better by the fact that you can go in and get your drinking started by ordering from the bar. There's one little spot where people waiting usually order, which can be annoying because it gets backed up. But there are plenty of bartenders to get everyone served, and the TVs all around help pass the time too. After a little while (maybe 20 minutes, maybe a little more. I lost track) we got seated outside. We sat outside on the patio, which is always my preference. When the weather is nice it can't be beat. Plus the inside gets a little loud for my tastes.

The Girl ordered Kilt Lifter. I went for a specialty beer they brewed up: a white IPA. It was excellent. I like beer in all it's many forms, but The Girl does NOT do IPA's. She took a sip and didn't even wince. The simplest way to describe it (and this doesn't even come close to doing it justice, but I'm trying to keep this review to a manageable length) is to imagine if your favorite Hefe and your favorite, medium-hopped IPA had a sweet, tangy, and citrusy little baby. I stuck with the white IPA for the whole night.

We were waiting on my friend, so we ordered the Arizona Chicken Rolls to start. This really is a requirement when you come to Four Peaks. The menu is great overall, but the Chicken Rolls are hands down my favorite item on the menu. The ""sweet jalapeño dressing"" is perfect - a nice blend of sweet and spicy. I always order an extra serving of the dressing because I use so much of it. It's $8 for two rolls, and I'll sometimes make a meal of just this alone. Okay, I'll stop gushing now...

We waited as long as we could, but ordered just before our friend got there. The Girl ordered the Tap Room Tenderloin sandwich ($12.5) with fries. She also had them put the onion straws and bleu cheese on the side. I was not feeling the typical sandwich and fries pub food that night, but Four Peaks did not let me down. On their special nightly menu (a few extra special dishes that are one night only), they had a perfect meal: a cherry wood smoked ribeye topped with poached eggs, served with cajun cream cheese mashed potatoes and grilled squash. The Girl enjoyed her sandwich, although she was very glad she ordered the onion straws and cheese on the side - there was a lot of it! There was a lot of bread (which is typical) so she didn't eat all of it. My ribeye was outstanding. Ordered it medium rare (like you're supposed to) and it came out perfect. Melt in your mouth excellence, and there was lots of smokiness to it which I really enjoyed. The mashed potatoes had just enough kick to make them feel special. I was a bit underwhelmed with the grilled squash, mostly because  the slices lacked any seasoning that I could taste. If you've got a dish with strong spice (from the potatoes) and lots of smokiness (from the steak), then plain-jane grilled veggies ain't gonna be quite enough. Just a little bit of salt and pepper helped a lot. I was definitely full and satisfied by the end of the meal.

Eventually our friend did come and we had an enjoyable evening. The waitress was attentive and nice. She was very patient and still attentive despite the fact that we sat for quite a while waiting on our friend.  

If you are at all interested in craft and local beers, then this place sets the standard for Arizona, in my opinion. There are lots of really great places popping up, but it's inevitable to find myself at another brew pub saying, ""Well, it's not as good as Four Peaks"" about something. Not everything, but  something. Four Peaks gets high marks in every aspect of the experience: atmosphere, wait staff, beer quality, food quality, and price point.

We didnt know which beer to try so we went with the sampler. Came with 9 different beers plus 1 specialty one (rye wine). We really enjoyed the rye wine, this one was 12% . This was my favorite of the ones we tried. I also enjoyed hefeweizen  and javier liked the sunbru. I look forward to seeing this brewing company at Oktoberfest this year :) For the main course I had the Italian beef beer bread, which consists of Lean roast beef with sautéed red onion, green peppers, mushrooms, mozzarella cheese and garlic
honey mayo rolled in our fresh baked beer bread. The beer bread was tasty and comparable to a tortilla , but thicker, but not as thick as pita bread. I chose the pasta salad as the side. It was very tasty but looked disgusting, had a weird grey color to it. I like the presentation of my food to be just as good as the taste. Javier had the roasted turkey club with beer battered fries. His was delicious. I now wish I would have gone with the fries. The reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is 1. there was a swamp cooler in there so it was a lil hot. 2. doesnt have a good size parking lot so you have to park along side 8th ave and walk a lil bit to the place.

If you can't handle beer that will put hair on your chest or the idea of a beer you can't see through makes you queasy, try the 8th Street IPA.  I haven't had anything on their menu that wasn't good, but I'm partial to the nachos and the chicken strips.  Careful the nachos come out on a fork lift.  Yes you can add beef or chicken to them, but you won't need to.  They stand up just fine without and you're not going to go hungry.  The mixed drinks are decent, but come on.  You're in a brewery. Live a little!

On a side note, the patio is smoking friendly and the water is awesome because as every good brewer knows, pure water makes awesome beer.

On the weekends this place gets over crowded.  You could go on a weeknight like a sensible person.  Or, you can simply find a person or two who is hogging an entire table to themselves and foist your company upon them.  Really, don't take no for an answer.

HAPPY HOUR ON A SATURDAY!!!

Yes, every day actually! from 3-7pm and a late night happy hour too starting at 10pm!! How can that be true??? Well I guess in Arizona they know how to party! $11 pitchers and $3 pints, yes it could be a little cheaper, but hey it is a happy hour every day of the week! And their beer is really good! AND they will give you FREE samples of all of their beer too!!! This is like brewery heaven!!!

To top it off, a group of people came here in Crank or Drank shirts on their first ever biking and drinking tours and this was on their tour for good reason! Their Hefe is awesome, complete with lemon wedges of course, and their Sunbru was so so refreshing on that hot day in AZ! Adriana and I definitely had our fair share of pitchers, along with an order of their beer battered fries and their specialty ice cream cake! Well, that was actually roopas, and just an FYI, oreo crumb crust and Hefe don't really mix......so save the cake for when you are done drinking ha ha

But the waiters here (the ones that don't look like they are 15!!!!!) are helpful and friendly and nice, and you will definitely get carded here, even though literally I actually felt old here since all the girls look so young! Some of them must have had workers permits I swear!

They have a cool patio to chill, Plus, how can you not like their beer!

This place is ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS packed, the worst part about it is finding parking, then sometimes depending on the number of IPA's you have finding your car when you leave (just kidding).

The food is very good.  I am a huge fan of the Salmon BLT but also love their burgers and have not had a bad appetizer either.  Service here is always attentive and friendly and it seems they are all well trained and know the menu, which is a plus when asking questions.

As far as the beer goes, there is a reason 4 Peaks won a gold medal in this years World Beer Competition, its just that good.  I love their seasonal selections, right now its Peach, and the lines will also agree that the Pumpkin Porter is top notch.  Kiltlifter is probably my ultimate favorite while my wife will sip on their IPA all night with a big smile.

I was scouring yelp trying to find a fun place to take some out of town friends who were here from Indiana.  I wanted to show them some fun in our spring desert.  I finally decided on Four Peaks.

Park on the street and it is a quick walk.  Saw that a few cars had recently been broken into as there was a lot of glass on the side of the street, but we didn't have any issues.  The patio was very nicely shaded, and with a slight breeze on a March afternoon it was perfect weather.  I was surprised that we didn't have to wait to get seated on a very busy day.  The waitress was attentive (at first) but slacked once we ordered our drinks.  It was a busy Saturday afternoon and we were having a good time, so the slow service didn't bother me.

I tried the Kilt Lifter and a friend tried the stout and both were delicious.  They have a ""full bar"" but they don't have blended drinks.  A friend ordered a cosmo that she said was decent.  Later that evening I found the kilt lifter on tap at a local bar, so it was an added bonus to be able to drink the same beer all day.  

The food was mediocre.  If there wasn't so much grease on EVERYONE'S food it would have been a lot better.  I ordered the turkey club on marble rye, and the bread was too greasy\/buttery to enjoy.  A few friends ordered burgers and fries that they enjoyed after using there napkin to soak up some of the grease.  I will try to jalapeno popper burger next time and will ask them to not add butter or toast the bun.  Someone else in my group ordered pizza which came out hot and looked like very fresh ingredients were used.  We ordered the nachos as an appetizer and they were just ok.  Big plates made it possible for almost everyone to take extras home.

All in all, we had a good time.  The beer and the atmosphere is why I will return to Four Peaks on a sunny afternoon.",2,1,1

Coming from San Diego (the beer capital of the country ;)), my expectations were that this place would not live up to the hype. Turns out, I was wrong! 

We got here on an excruciatingly hot Arizona day (107 degrees maybe?) so a cold beer was calling our name. Right when you enter, you're greeted by fans blowing cool mist from the outside which was much needed. 

Our group stayed here for a long time so we got to try most of the beers on the menu. Here's what I personally tried:

Kilt Lifter - This beer has won so many awards at various beer festivals so it was a must-try. Absolutely delicious. It's a Scottish Ale which means it has lower bitterness and higher maltines. This was a super tasteful and easy drink on a blistering hot day. I really liked the hints of caramel too. This was MY FAVORITE DRINK from this brewery and highly recommended. 

Sunbru - A light and refreshing Kolsch. Good and easy drink but a little too easy for me. Recommended if you want to drink the lightest beer available. 

Pitchfork - A traditional pale ale. A nice touch of hoppiness but not overbearing at all. I enjoyed this one. 

White Ale - basically a Hefeweizan or wheat beer. They use some local ingredients here such as Arizona orange peel. Refreshing and delicious drink. I have never been done wrong by a wheat beer. 

The service was excellent and attentive. We got some small bites for happy hour and they were really good too. This place is the cream of the crop in the AZ brewery realm and worth a visit!",6,5,7

What hasn't been said yet?!
Parking can be a pain sometimes. Careful not to be towed.
Definitely NOT a beer drinker, in fact I don't drink alcohol AT ALL, but I had a sip of my friend's beer and it wasn't bad! I think it was the Hop Not, citrus-y. I wouldn't ever order a whole glass for myself though...

So why do I come here if I don't drink? 
1.) What ASU student doesn't go to Four Peaks at least once? 
2.) All my friends drink. They are fortunate that I don't drink, so I am always DD. 
3.) Their 5 layer nachos WITH blackened chicken. SO GOOD. Warning, this monster can feed maybe up to 4 people. I came here last week and ordered the nachos. It took so long for us (3) to finish the nachos that I had to ask the server to reheat it. They did so with no problem. 
4) Cool atmosphere. 

No complaints about the heat, swamp cooler, sweating balls, etc. 

They're also opening up a second place off Broadway and Rural, but I'll stick to the original place.

I really am trying to get into my local beers.  I enjoyed the Hope Knot IPA, so my wife surprised me for a lunch date at Four Peaks!  

The place was a little less polished than I imaged it would be, sort of a sports bar feel.  The food seletion looked good, typcial bar fare combined with some very unique selections.  We only order some pretzels...and I ordered the taster set so that I could explore their full line of beers.  The beer was good overall, not the best I have had.  I still think the Hop Knot is one of their best, and their ales are strong as well.  

The best thing about this place was the incredible service.  Despite the super casual feel, the service was fantastic.  Our server covered every detail, offered wonderful suggestions and check on us often.  When I asked about the building and beer production, she fetched the manager (Mike), who was very gracious to take the time to tell us more about the brewery (the building dates back to the 19th century!).

I was starving so of course everything looked good on the menu. We started off with a cheese bread appetizer which was basically pizza when you factor in the dipping sauce. But oh so good.

I couldn't decide what to order and the waitress said both things I was deciding between were good, so she didn't make it easier. I wound up going with the tenderloin sandwich.

Its a great place to go with a group of friends. The place is usually pretty busy and the eye candy is amazing! Thanks, ASU!

The music is great. You can tell the owner is a Dead Head. There is always a great mix of Jam Bands playing. Really ties into the college vibe. Nice touch!

The menu is good for the most part but pretty static. They dont change it up much. They do however have a daily special that is typically not on the standard menu. These offerings are usually pretty darn good and I would suggest giving them a try.

Four Peaks makes good beer. The problem is that they dont make amazing beer. Most of their beers are very middle of the road. They dont really push any envelopes in terms of style or big flavor. They do make a few seasonals that are pretty interesting. Their Pumpkin Porter is a nice treat I look forward to every year. For the year round beers, you cant beat the Hop Knot. It's a solid IPA but again, nothing out of the ordinary.

The 4.5 rating on here actually breaks my beer-loving heart.  There are good, and even great, breweries in Arizona -- this just isn't one of them.

This location of Four Peaks is near the University, so parking is hard to come by.  I went when school wasn't in session, thinking it would be less busy...wrong!  Not wanting to wait for a table, we sat at the bar.  We should have known something was wrong when we ordered a beer flight and everyone stared at us.  You people are at a brewery and you've never seen a flight?  The guys next to us actually asked what it was....

The flight is a great deal at $10, and comes with a ridiculous number of beers.  I can't say that any of them were better than a 3 out of 5 star rating.  I actually left a few beers standing at the end of the night, the Hefeweizen and the Peach beer. The IPAs were not good either.  I've had their pumpkin porter in the past, and that is probably their best showing.

I can't speak to the food, but look at the photos...does this look like 4.5 star food?  The place is loud, the music is terrible, and the beer is cheap.  I suppose this is every college kids dream.  This brew house was built with a certain demographic in mind, and I am definitely NOT part of that group.",5,4,4

There were hi-def TV's all over the place, you'd be hard pressed to find a table where you don't have a good view of whatever game you choose to watch.

Normally I like to try the beer samplers at new brewpubs, but I didn't think about it until after I had ordered.  I had a glass of the Hop Knot IPA.  Delicious grapefruit and pine aromas, nice citrusy, hoppy taste without being too bitter.  Really excellent beer.  Again, if I lived in the area, I'd go try out the sampler but in full sized glasses.  :)  Now if only I could find out if they sell this in bottles in the Southern California area...

The food was good, too.  Well above-average as far as pub food goes.  Huge nacho plate for an appetizer, then had a gardenburger with jalapeno sauce and a side of fries.

The atmosphere was great, you might have to yell a little bit to be heard, but that's part of the thrill of coming here. 

I ended up with a seasonal brew called Odelay! which is a delicious mexican chocolate ale. If you're worried about too much sweetness, then there are no worries with this brew. Get it if you are looking for a solid dark ale. 

Sidenote - Had I seen it, I would have gone for the beer sampler that they had. There were a ton of beers on the wood board and it looked delicious!

My partner had the Raj IPA. For those who don't drink IPA often this was a smooth one. Had a little kick, per usual of the brew, but a nice introduction to what standard IPA's taste like. In addition, the appetizers were good, but I personally found them a little flavorless. Don't get me wrong though, they were FILLING. The calamari and the spinach dip were rich, and we felt pretty full after trying both of them. A little more salt wouldn't hurt though.

The boyfriend and I found ourselves with a free lunch hour driving around Tempe when it hit me that we should try out a place that's been talked up to me for ages.  So, we headed right over.
First of all, parking is non-existent.  We drove around the block and still never could find anything that indicated we were allowed to park there without risk of being towed.  We finally settled on parking on the street out front, but had it been anything other than 11 am, there probably wouldn't have been a spot.  
We were greeted and seated immediately, and service was fine.  It's a rather cavernous room with an old warehouse feel to it.  I'm fine with that.  It doesn't seem to be air conditioned, though, and we were relying on heavy duty fans that kept blowing away the napkins to keep us cool on a hot AZ July day.  Probably not the best choice for summer.  
The menu options looked so good when I checked out the website on the way over, but both of the sandwiches we ordered were less than spectacular.  
We ordered the Tap Room Tenderloin and the Salmon BLT and split them.  The combination of bleu cheese, onion straws and garlic-jalapeno aioli sure sounded like it'd be bursting with flavor, but it was undeniably bland.  Neither one of us could even taste the tang of the bleu cheese and there was not even a little kick from the aioli.  The blt was just as sorry.  Where the tenderloin was lacking in flavor, the salmon made up for it and then some.  Someone was a bit heavy-handed with the cajun seasoning and the salmon just came off overly salty.  I don't remember tasting any pesto in the mayo.

Also we are in the industry and we sell many Four peaks beers so agreed it was a good lunch spot to check out. My friend, my two boys and I walked up to the hostess stand that had about six staff members standing there...little awkward and only one said hello. We asked to sit on the patio and one girl said only inside is available. As we followed the speedy hostess back we noticed three open tables on the patio...we got sat in the furthest darkest table in a corner..no, seriously in a corner under some dart boards. I'm assuming the six open tables we passed inside were not available either? My friend stops the hostess before she walks away and asks about the open tables we saw on the patio. She stutters and replies that they have to keep with the server rotation and it is not that servers turn to be sat. So your telling us you have a server that cant handle being double sat?  Our server comes and we ask her (not willing to let it go yet)...can we sit on the patio..we saw several open tables and this is quite the dark corner. She looked at us irritated herself and said ill check and walks away. She returns quickly and replies the patio is a 20 minute wait and the tables available cannot sit the amount of people we have. (So you cannot pull up a chair to an outside table exactly how you did to this table we were sat at?) We would have to put two together she says. My friend and I decided to quit trying to argue our point and just order. We asked for the specials sheet...twice. She orders an 8th street...yum. Love love 
Four Peaks beer. We split a nacho and a sandwich off the crinkled up specials sheet. Kids got chicken fingers and loved them.  Food was really good...and quick.

For me, Four Peaks is good, not great. I've had some good food there, I've had some mediocre food there. Their fries are great...It's bar food, really. There's nothing that sets Four Peaks apart from a culinary standpoint, but most people seem to fall head over heels for the beer.

Here's my thing: I'm from Portland, Oregon. For anyone that doesn't know, it's an incredible place for microbreweries and amazing beer. In the state of Oregon there are dozens of independent breweries and hundreds of incredible local beer choices...

(I realize at this point you're all thinking - ""Hey, asshole. Stop talking about Portland. This is a review about Four Peaks"" - I'm getting to my point, I promise)

Upon my arrival in the Phoenix area, I kept hearing about how great the beer was at Four Peaks. Living close by, I checked out Four Peaks early on, and have been back a number of times since. I've tried a lot of their beers, and they just don't do it for me. I like the Kilt Lifter, and that's the end...The rest of their beers I am just not into. Specifically the Hef...It's the worst Hef I've ever had in my life. Forgive me, I'm a beer snob who likes what he likes, and most of the beers at Four Peaks are not my thing. With that said, everyone else seems to be in love with them, so maybe I'm the crazy one.

The other thing that sucks about Four Peaks is the wait. During peak times, you're waiting anywhere from 30-60 minutes for a table.

Positives is the size of the restaurant (it's huge), and the ambiance. It's a cool place to hang out and watch a game, and it's a good place to grab a quick bite when the wait isn't too long. I'm sure I'll come back to Four Peaks, but it won't be for the beer.",2,1,0

Lets see, I've been here for pretty much every occasion- my Birthday (for a few years), when I visited ASU recently, my ASU graduation lunch, Happy Hour after class, date nights... you name it!

As you can probably tell, I love this place.  Service is always on point, regardless of where you are seated (and I've been seated pretty much everywhere).  You have a full view of the brewery if you sit at the bar or on the opposing side of the entrance, it's pretty spectacular.  If you sit on the far side, past the bar to the right, you'll have excellent TV viewing and nice tables for larger parties (really popular during games).  Besides the seated area in the back near where the brewing takes place and the outdoor area it is 'seat yourself'.

The food is nothing short of perfection, I don't believe I've ever had a bad dish while at this glorious location and the beers!  My favorite dish (although I do not know if it is still available) is the salmon sandwich- there was some sort of glorious concoction of pesto mayo that makes my heart flutter.

Ah yes, das boot! Most would go for a kiltlifter, I feel as if it's a people pleaser, if you have a large party and you want to order a pitcher but you don't know what everyone prefers-go for it.  You also have to make the kilt lifter a staple in your beer flight, which you should definitely order if you're a first timer.  My personal favorite is the peach,  the peach brings me back to college days by the pool with a growler-its just so refreshing.  They have a beer for everyone here, plus a full bar so each guest is sublimely happy.  Growlers are great take homes (and check bag PHX friendly mind you) for about 5-7 days cost about $15 the first time and $10.00 for a refill.

All in all, I make it a mission to visit this amazing establishment each time I am in the area-even if it's just a layover at the airport I try to find a bar with some Four Peaks on tap.  If you're in the area and you're craving a great beer, good grub, and a hometown feel-check it out!

They also have a happy hour in which appetizers and beers have some discounts.  Plus, if you're a dessert-y person they have an oatmeal stout shake with all sorts of deliciousness encompassed.",3,3,1

Easily the best bar food menu around. Excellent bread and appetizers, very well done southwestern fare and amazing specials (I still haven't had one of their specials as they are usually pricey, they look amazing though!). 

They have a great beer selection, as long as you are not looking for bud\/miller\/coors. Its all Four Peaks beer on the menu, makes for a nice change and a great taster! At the beginning of every month you can get the Hopsquatch, their barrel aged Barleywine, it doesn't last far beyond the beginning of the month. Seasonally they have a number of brews that are super-tasty (Pumpkin Porter, Peche...et al). You can also get growlers of their beers to take home and fill when you are there.

I finally did brunch here, it is awesome. They do brunch better than most places that specialize in it! The breakfast croissant should be a regular menu item (OK that's one special I have had).",1,0,0

We arrived and stood in the doorway, waiting for someone to seat us for like 5 mins while at least 6 girls who obviously worked there just stood around staring at us. Not knowing what to do, we decided to seat ourselves (there was no ""Seat Yourselves"" sign out btw). We sat towards the back in the quieter section and waited...and waited...and waited! Finally a server saw us and asked us what we wanted to drink and brought us menus. It was while before she came back around to take our order.

I ordered the Margherita Pizza well done, and my guy ordered the Green Chili Chicken Enchiladas. Well, when my pizza arrived it was obvious that is was not well done as the cheese was still goopy and white, and not browned and bubbly. My guy liked his plate, but admitted that the rice was par boiled cheapo rice and not as good as many enchiladas he's had in the past. I took my pizza back and asked for Fish and Chips instead, which came out quickly enough, but were just okay, nothing special.

The place was pretty busy for a wednesday night but from what I understand thats pretty normal for them. And after my experience I understand why. As soon as we were greeted we were taken to a table inside right next to all the brewers. Cool! I love the art that goes into brewing beers and I think those large silver shining beauties are amazing. 

Our server was great. Friendly, assertive, punctual and not creepy. My man ordered the Hop Knot and I ordered the 8th Street. We barely made happy hour by the skin of our teeth. I love restaurants who give you happy hour prices on your drink even if you ordered them at 5:58pm when HH ends at 6pm. Believe it or not, some places out there would ignore your table for two minutes just to avoid the HH. So lame. This scored huge points in my book. For food, we ordered the edamame for our appetizer and the Veggie Pesto Pizza for dinner. 

The Edamame was super fresh. If you've ever had bad or even mediocre edamame, you get it. Its disgusting. I wasn't expecting anything phenomenal but was genuinely happy when I actually wanted to keep eating more of it. The pizza had buttloads of flavor! Artichoke hearts, olives, mushrooms, tomato's, mozarella and feta cheese and pesto. Mmmm. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it and didn't hate myself for eating it after.

Service was impeccable. You get your ID checked in the middle of the day, so you know they're serious about a dining experience for grown-ups only. Waitress took my order right away. Food was fresh and ready at my table incredibly fast. Unlike their Scottsdale location, my fries weren't tough and my bread didn't seem stale. They are efficient and stylish.

The Bad

Criticism still stands regarding a very unadventurous menu. It's for the most part very generic bar fare that has no go-to dish that screams ""wow, we're unique!"" You could at least have something that rotates like your brews do. Talking up beer pairings doesn't make up for that. Also, parking blows, but why are you driving here anyway? 

I know I sound really critical, but that's because I don't want the face of a local brewery to be some stick-in-the-mud on a culinary level. I don't necessarily get excited about this place, but service and atmosphere were outstanding, so my rating has to reflect such great management.",2,2,1

I'm a beer snob if you will, and this is some of the finest microbrew out there.

But the best part about Four Peaks is that they have great food, wonderful atmosphere, and hot waitresses as well.  There is everything you can possibly want, so what's not to love about this place?!?!?  Their nachos, chicken spring rolls, and cheese puffs (when they have them on special) are to die for.  I'm a fan of the Kiltlifter and the 8th Street Ales, and they always have great seasonal brews as well.  I highly recommend the pumpkin porter around the holidays. 

It's a great place for happy hour with good beer specials, and they always have a couple of different food items on special each day.

I ordered the chicken beer bread and the beer sampler, both which were wonderful. My sandwich was huge so I ended up taking some home. In addition to the peach ale, I was especially fond of the Kilt Lifter, both for the name and the taste.

We had a large party, and the person organizing our get-together tried to call an hour before we arrived to put our name on the list, but no one answered the phone after repeated attempts.  So, when we got here we waited for a bit outside while some tables cleared out.  When we finally got a table, they gave us a table that couldn't seat all of us, for they wrote down the wrong number of people for our party.  

After some more shuffling and rearranging of chairs and tables, we finally got seated.  I tried a sample of the pumpkin porter, and had the portabella-veggie beer bread.  The pumpkin porter was decent, and had a nice pumpkin-spice taste to it.  I wasn't a big fan of the veggie beer bread.  I was expecting more of a loaf-type bread instead of the flatbread that actually came out.  As a result, the dish was more of a wrap than a sandwich.  The interior of the wrap was filled with lots of fresh veggies, but I was hoping to find more portabella mushroom in it.  In addition, the veggies themselves were bland, and so overwhelmingly garlicky that I felt like I could ward vampires away for a mile with my breath.  

Despite having a large party, service, once we were seated, was good.  The waitress had no problem splitting our checks, and she refilled our drinks promptly as needed.

The place has a nice atmosphere, and it was nice sitting outside, especially on such a nice day like today was. This place was really busy when we got there today at around 11:45. One of my friends got a burger and said it was pretty good, another got a salmon sandwich which she likes a lot, another got the grilled chicken beer bread sandwich, but she didn't care for it. I tried hers and I thought it was good, although a bit bland. I ordered a special, the BBQ chicken beer bread sandwich with a side salad. The sandwich was good, it had chipotle bbq sauce, chicken, cheddar, and fried onion strings. The onion strings really made the sandwich (well, more like a wrap...but whatever). I got the balsamic dressing, and it was really good. It was probably the best thing we got. At the end we all split the stout tiramisu. This was pretty good, but I like the classic better. It is tiramisu made with chocolate mascarpone and with stout beer. I couldn't taste the stout much after the first couple bites, the chocolate took over. I would definitely come back, as it was decent, and they have beer and whatnot, but it wasn't the best place ever, just alright.",3,0,2

It is one of Arizona's oldest microbreweries and since the demise of the historic A-1 brand, the closest thing we have to a state beer.  Many microbreweries these days seem to focus on bitter super-hopped beers with other varieties being a second-class after thought.  While Four Peaks does offer the hoppy Raj IPA and the even hoppier Hop-Knot, it also has a wide selection of other excellent award-winning offerings across the entire style spectrum including their flagship Kilt-Lifter Scottish amber ale, the mild SunBru and the creamy Oatmeal Stout (the closest thing to Guinness you will find this side of Ireland).  At the brew pub, they always have one or two special seasonals including the annual spicy Pumpkin Porter.  

One would expect that a brew pub would have good beer, but what really sets Four Peaks apart from the rest is the excellent food.  Most brew pubs may have one or two stand-out dishes with most other items being more mediocre and less tasty than they sound.  However it is clear that Four Peaks has a true chef in the kitchen who is as innovative and passionate about the food as the brew masters are about the beer.  The Four Peaks burgers are among the best in Phoenix - large, juicy and perfectly cooked to order.  The attention to details shows in the trimmings - always fresh, large slices of lettuce, tomato and onion on a large fresh bun.  Likewise even the side salads (which are often no more than lettuce in most places) include mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, green peppers and croutons (in addition to their excellent homemade sweet jalapeno dressing).  Other stand-out items include excellent enchiladas, carne adovada, fish-n-chips, beer-battered fries, and several excellent appetizers including Thai hummus, killer nachos, and Arizona Chicken Rolls (a long fried spicy chicken and cheese egg roll).  All served in generous portions and very reasonable prices.

What really shows the kitchen's innovation and artistry however are the daily dinner specials (usually 3) that are special custom creations that have ranged from fine dining to comfort food to off-the-wall inventive.  A few examples include duck manicotti in a cabernet sauce, a sandwich of fried chicken and gravy served between waffles instead of bread and (my sentimental favorite) homemade sloppy joes with tater tots.  Four Peaks is one of the few brew pubs I know that could be successful on its food alone even without the beer.

The brewery is located on a neighborhood side street (8th Ave) near ASU in a historic brick building that used to be a creamery.  The large open inside has a huge wrap-around bar and several large TVs for sporting events and can get loud when busy.  I prefer the nice outside patio.  The prices are extremely reasonable and the wait staff is consistency friendly and attentive.  On weekends, there can sometimes be a wait for a table and parking (on the street) can occasionally be a challenge.   I have eaten at probably over four dozen brew pubs around the US and would rank Four Peaks among the top three for overall beer, food, service, and atmosphere.",1,0,0

The beer is good..does not get any fresher.

The green chile pork poutine is really good! Only downfall, is the cheese curds are fried. Total let down. The cheese curds should be fresh, therefore allowing the hot gravy to melt them onto the fries. I would eat them again.

Spicy Chicken Lettuce wraps were...horrifying. It was like a spicy paste with little chicken bits in it..that you spread on the lettuce leaves.  Not tasty at all.  And the dipping sauce was thick and overly spicy as well.  They were nice enough not to charge me for these, however.

The food quality has decreased slightly over the years, which brings its rating down from the easy 5 stars it would have received a few years ago. There are still many great things about this brewery.

Since being acquired by Anheuser-Busch, Four Peaks has been able to increase its beer production, which means more seasonal beer options for us! They have also made some renovations, increasing the size of their outdoor dining area.

I prefer wheat beers, so the White Ale is my favorite. I also like Kiltlifter and their seasonal Pumpkin Porter and Odelay beers. If it's your first time, definitely get the beer flights ($10) since they have so many to try. You can also sample individual beers.

As for the food, the chicken rolls (spicy chicken egg rolls with sweet jalapeño sauce) are the best appetizer I have had at any restaurant. The nachos are huge and delicious with either the blackened chicken or beef. All of the beer bread wraps are good. I have liked the Popper and Southwest burgers and the Salmon BLT. The enchiladas and pizza were average to me, but I have friends who really like both. Four Peaks also comes out with interesting specials from time to time.

The first time I went here was during World Cup 2010. It was packed because of the USA\/Algeria game, which created quite the atmosphere. 

Service was pretty good. We got a table fairly quickly, and the server was always checking back and forth despite how crowded they were. The only issue I think there might be is that this place doesn't have adequate parking, so if you are going when ASU is playing UA or something of the sort, then arrive VERY early.

The food is awesome. Probably one of the best breakfasts I ever had, and it wasn't really anything unique. Just some eggs, toast, and potatoes, but they were all just done extremely well. The only downside is the price, it cost like $8 for what normally costs like $5-6 elsewhere. The portions weren't ridiculously huge either, but overall it was worth the atmosphere. I've played soccer with the owner a few times and he's a cool guy.

Four Peaks Brewery which has only been around for about 15 years is situated in a building that has been around since the early 1890's.  Now that is quite a long time for anything here in the desert.  

If you get a chance take a guided tour of the facilty and learn the brewing process on how the beers are made.  During the tour you travel through each room of the building and really get to understand the love that is put into a beer, which believe it or not, only has a few simple ingredients.   Also during the tour, don't get freaked out as a few of the rooms feel haunted.  I'm sure a lot can happen in a building that's over a 100 years old.

 Four Peaks is not known outside of Arizona as it only delivers beer within state lines.  At some point I'm sure this will change, but still is the largest brewer of fine handcrafted beer in AZ.   They offer many different styles of beer that any connesuir can enjoy.  There food is like that of a typical bar, but the beer is why people should come here.

I have never hated anything before at four peaks and last night my boyfriend actually said it. ""I Hate this, i do not like this at all; it tastes  like chicken from a can"" Thats what it tasted like. I was expecting some grilled chicken and in chunks not a salad mayoish filling.

They have above-average bar food (with slightly above average bar food prices) and obviously good beer.  I'm a fan of 8th street ale (aptly named after the street the brewery is on) and the peach.  They had this AMAZING seasonal Pumpkin Porter this winter.... *le sigh* So. Delicious. And the salmon BLT is a contender for my ""last meal on earth"".  The beer battered fries are delicious as well and even their side salad is unusually tasty for you know, a simple side salad.

I don't come here very often since it's a bit of a drive for me from Phoenix but when I do stop by its during the workweek around 6-9.  Not sure what the scene is like on weekend, I'd imagine it gets lively what with all the alcohol and sporting events being broadcast on the many TV's hanging inside.

The wait staff has always been prompt and friendly.  The clientele is usually pretty diverse mix of Tempe folks.  Usually very spirited, which is not really what I look for in a drinking establishment but by no means bad and at the very least entertaining.

I get annoyed that every time I come to this place they analyze my ID for like 3 minutes and usually ask for alternate forms of ID.  I understand it's a necessary precaution, really, I do, but its still annoying.  Reckon I should update the photo on my ID huh. I mention it just to give a heads up if your photo ID is looking less than accurate.

All the beer here is great.  My friends love kilt lifter.  Your taste might not match mine, but I would say I am prefer Hefeweizen beers, such as blue moon and ciders.  My favorite beer here is the Hefeweizen and Peach Ale.  I love the Oatmeal Stout Shake, which is the Stout beer with ice cream.  I highly recommend that dessert and I am the type that can't stand stout beers.

Waitress took forEVER to come to our table. When she finally came around, she couldn't have acted more annoyed with helping us. She constantly looked over her shoulder or in a different direction the entire time I ordered. To the point of making me feel stupid. I couldn't even tell if she was listening to me.
Our drinks and appetizer came out fairly quick. Never did see said snotty waitress again (must've been bothering her at the end of her shift). Someone else started coming around even though she was never quite clear if she was our new waitress at that point. Sigh. Extremely horrible waitressing aside, the loaded nachos with beef (not really that spicy) were delicious. Beer samples were fun.
Waitress took so long to come around to ask if we were ready to order an entree, that by the time we were done with the nachos, we were getting full and decided to head out. Would've been nice to try something else,  but I was pretty done with the service at that point. What a turn off.
Even though the waitresses ruined my time, I'm still giving three stars because the food (what little I did have) was delicious and you can't go wrong with beer and outdoor patio seating. If I could rate the service itself, I'd give 1 star.

Sure enough, this is the kind of place college kids would love - lots of beer and huge portions of classic bar food.

While we were waiting for some others, the server suggested the nachos for the table.  The nachos came piled high on a double plate, with heaps of chicken and cheese, with beans and such on the side.  The flavor was actually pretty good for bar food.  After all that, I wasn't terribly hungry, but I decided to try the shrimp ceviche tostadas, just to have something more nutritious than chips and cheese.  Again, the portion was huge, and the flavor was decent, but the texture was just soft enough to make me wonder if the shrimp was sufficiently pickled.

But enough about the food, this place is a brewery.  I had the peach ale first, and it was good, but waaaay fruity.  I know, I'm the one who ordered a fruity beer, but most of the others I've had just hint of fruit.  This one tasted like peach syrup had been added.  I followed that with the Kilt Lifter.  That was a good beer - plenty of flavor without any bitterness in the aftertaste.  I also got a taste of the special Kilt Lifter that was aged in a bourbon cask, and that was some darn good beer.

Ordered 1 fish'n'chips entree and 1 Poutin appetizer...we were splitting both. EXCELLENT! We did pick-up and even after I got back with it, it was still good to go! Crispy batter, delicate fish and not very greasy, tasty tarter sauce...good fries too.

And the POUTIN was friggin AMAZING. Not the traditional recipe but it had their fries, cheese curds and some kinda crazy slow cooked shredded pork mixed in with it...I dunno. Just order it! 

All for less than $20...yum yum yum! 

The staff was really cool too. they hooked me up with a soda while I waited and since parking was a beeeotch, they even let me double parked my ride at the very front entrance so I could run in and grab my pick up order from the bar... Good stuff!",1,0,2

I think the politically correct (PC) society it Is getting works. I went to Four Peaks Restaurant in Tempe Arizona. My friend sitting next to me ask the bartender what her name was and she replied Dayjena and I replied also known as HOT. Dayjena then started working at the other end of the bar away from myself and my friends. Then another bartender came over and asked if we would like some food my friend asked for Her name and she said Courtney and I replied also known as hotter. I guess this was too aggressive because both girls decided to stay away from the end of the bar we were at. After we had gotten our food and paid for it I asked it speak to the management and talk to this female manager and explain the story to her. I asked her if using the word hot and hotter was inappropriate and her comment was yes it's mildly offensive. I asked her what would be the proper expression and she said the word pretty or attractive was reasonable. I said so it would be okay if I said WOW  you are really pretty! and she had a concerned look on her face. I honestly believe if myself and my friend where younger this would have not been a issue. So in closing if you are 55 years old or older don't go to Four Peaks and if you do be careful what you say because you may offend the female staff at the bar.

If you like hefeweizen, I HIGHLY suggest you try theirs. It is fantasticly creamy and not too wheaty. It has sorta made me a hefeweizen snob and turned me off of Blue Moon.  ;-)  
The chicken roll-up sandwich on their beer bread is probably my favorite sandwich in the valley.  How can you argue with chicken, artichoke hearts and cucumber sauce? Then they add grilled onions, peppers and melty cheese to make it even more delectable!  
The boyfriend and I recently tried their pizza on a casual date-night dinner.  I suggested the veggie pesto (again with the artichokes) and he of course suggested the addition of chicken... It was great! I've now had that pizza 3 times and I'm considering expanding my horizons to be fair to the other pizzas.

THE GOOD:

THE BAD:
No AC!!!  Hello?!?!  It was about 110 outside and maybe 100 inside.  

THE LOWDOWN:
I have to be honest here, the beer was ok, nothing special.  As always, I started out with the sampler.  They made a pretty good peach beer, and I don't like fruity beers.  I didn't like their hefe, and their oatmeal stout was pretty good, but again not a big stout fan.  They had 2 IPA offerings, Hop knot & Raj IPA.  I didn't like the Raj one bit, it just feel flat, but the hop knot was the best offering.   We also received a free tasting of their version of a malt liquor.....I found this odd.  It was like an upscale mickeys.  Easy to drink and easy to drink lots of it I am sure.  

The food was decent, had the southwest burger, pretty tasty.  The fries were good, they were beer battered if I remember right.  Good pub food.  In the end we ended up there for happy hour and so we got a pitcher of the hop knot.  It hit the spot in the heat, but you have to drink fast in order for the beer to not get too warm.  Thats good marketing on their part.

I fell in love with 4 peaks back when I lived in Tempe and began my 10 year college career (I took my time :) \/ :( ).  My roommates and I heard the beer was delicious and they had a bunch of different kinds to try on happy hour, some beers with higher alcohol content which is really what got me interested.  The RAJ IPA was amazing and is one of my favorite beers there but after a few times of getting drunk faster than everyone else and going home early ( or falling asleep in, on, under or around tables)  I decided to branch out and try the other beers.  Being brewed here in AZ they are all superb, fresh and delicious, the food here is also good, not amazing its not gourmet by any means but its a little ""different"" than typical bar food (wings and sandwiches), think Zipps.  For example Four Peaks has beer bread, Zipps has focaccias which isn't like focaccia at all but its good and different, there's nothing like it anywhere else than these 2 restaurants, you will have to see it or try it to really understand.

The aroma of the steeping grains is one of my favorite parts of the Four Peaks drinking (or in some people's case - Dining) experience.

I've been to Four Peaks between 15 and 30 times--this is one of the best spots in Tempe without a doubt. Through a beer class I took at ASU, I've also had the privilege of touring the brewery and comparing the equipment and techniques of other Tempe breweries such as Sleepy Dog, Electric Brewing (which I believe is now under new management and has changed names), and even Gordon Biersch. This is a very sanitary brewery that goes above and beyond just having pride in craft beer. Since Four Peaks has become so big and successful, they are able to budget experimenting with new techniques, ingredients, and temperatures which has enabled them to learn from and refine their regular processes and deliver their standard lineup of like 7 or 8 beers consistently at any time of year.  Furthermore, they often have unique seasonals that go beyond traditional beer--try to catch them when they have cask ale, barley wine, or something else out of the ordinary. You won't be disappointed  and you'll have had yourself a one-of-a-kind experience--I think they have a calendar online where you can track this stuff. Creative freedom is a huge asset for Four Peaks and it clearly shows. 

I've had a birthday at Four Peaks, many great game days, and I've even brought friends' parents here; this place is great for all (maybe not small children). The food is above average bar food (some pizza options, fish and chips, great burgers, etc.) and the seating arrangement is great. They DON'T have a\/c so the summers can get a bit rough if you're not in direct line of a mister or fan, but it's very pleasant at all other times. There was this one time however (here comes qualm reason #2), when I came back from a Thanksgiving in Chicago and decided to catch up with some friends at Four Peaks. I had just bought a new pea coat (go Black Friday shopping) and it was getting pretty cold at night this time of year, so I brought it along. Towards the end of our meal, I stepped out of the restaurant, realized that it was too cold and I forgot my coat, walked back inside, and it was GONE. What. The. Hell. I asked my server about it, talked to the bartender, spoke with the manager, called back every day for the next few days, anything I could to recover my coat. Nothing. I'm a bit disappointed with the management for not making this right because I'm pretty sure our shady server that night (who I haven't seen there since) took it. She was really uneasy when I approached her and kept directing me to different people I should talk to. She also slipped in something like ""someone came in and picked up a similar jacket tonight"" and then when I started asking more about it, she was standoffish. I told the manager this, hoping that maybe someone could at the very least buy me a beer since my coat vanished into thin air (I suppose this is my fault mostly, I admit that) at their establishment, but whatever. I replaced the pea coat the following Black Friday.

Park along the street or in the back when you come by, but I strongly suggest finding a ride or dusting off the old bike because you're going to want to spend a ""lager"" time here... hahaha... ha.... hah....",1,1,1

They have a patio that is terrific patio for people watching, and since the place is so busy, you can do plenty of that.

I like their space. They have two bars that I could see -- one as you first enter the building. This one also has a outside window to serve patio guests. They also have a large full service bar in the dining room. There is plenty of seating around the dining room.

We sat along a wall with plaques displaying various awards for their beer. They have several different styles of beer and all seemed to be average in gravity and easy drinking beer. I can't say I was really impressed with any of the options. They all seemed a bit weak in flavor. 

Food wise I ordered a spicy pork dish (Carne Adovado or something like that) with beans and rice that was quite good. Service was good but nothing exceptional.

The AZ chicken wraps were pared with a creamy sauce that had a hint of chili, it was delish, the pretzels were soft and warm and had just the right texture. I wish they would serve this with a beer cheese dip. The green chili cheese dip was ok but a bit lacking. The cheese puffs were very well done. The nachos were huge and I love how the toppings come on the side but very hard to eat, the cheese had cooled and would pull away from the chip.

However, out on the patio, with lots of misters, is the best place to sit. The service is usually good, and the food is surprisingly good for a brewery.

I like Four Peaks best in the afternoon to relax on the patio, maybe for lunch, rather than at night, when it gets more bar-like and can be hard to find parking (FYI there is parking behind the bar if none is available on the street).

I prefer my beer on the lighter side, so I always order a Pale Ale, Sunbru, or Peach Ale (my favorite, great if you like sweet, fruity brews!). I've heard the darker beers are fantastic as well from several beer-loving friends, and the selection has something for everyone.

What really gets me here, though, is the food. Oh my god, the food. I have never tried anything here that isn't delicious. If you love spinach artichoke dip, theirs is TO DIE FOR. I won't let myself order this unless I'm sharing it with at least two other people; otherwise, I'll finish it because it's my drug here. They serve it in a huge plate with all the pita bread and tortilla chips you could want.

I've also tried the Thai hummus (great spicy kick!), their gigantic burgers, a few sandwiches, and some fried food. All of it has been amazing. For dessert, you can't beat the Stout Shake. And after trying the seasonal Pumpkin variety last fall, I'm looking forward to its return this year!

The totally chill vibe and set-up of this place is pretty cool, too. If you don't know, it's not an entirely enclosed space; kind of open, similar to Dos Gringos, with a large outdoor patio area. It does get a little warm in the summer, but it's not too bad. 

Downsides? This place gets insanely busy on certain nights and weekends. Which leads into the next point: parking sucks. It's seriously horrible. You either have to park on 8th street, off some random neighborhood side street, or try to find room in one of the tiny lots nearby. I always hate the long walk from my car to Four Peaks, and I hate the drunken walk back even more. But I gotta say it's totally worth it.

Great drinks, great food, and a great place to hang out with your favorite people. Definitely not your average bar!",0,0,0

Alright, so the parking is a little bit of a pain. Sometimes it involves a 10 minute search-and-walk. And yes, it does get loud - but that's part of why you go. The atmosphere is always friendly and casual, and to be honest a hell of a lot like the atmosphere you get at a great German beer hall like Hofbrauhaus.

The food is always on point, the specials never fail, and the fries are terrific. But the real reason you come is for the beer, and that is top notch microbrew.

While on a training course at the Arizona State Lab, we all decided to have a group dinner at this brewery in Tempe.  There were about twenty of us.  We weren't expecting to sit together, but they accomodated us quite nicely.

With twenty of us.. they sure kept everything organized.. I was very impressed.

Several of us ordered various ales and beers and brews.. I'm not a beer person.. so I didn't drink any.

Someone did order the sampler and we all had a chance to try some and a lot of them were actually pretty good.. 

From what I remember.. I think I liked the pale ale and the peach ale the best.

I would have ordered my own.. but they come in large glasses and I dont usually drink that much alcohol in one sitting.. so I passed..

I ordered the fish and chips.. it came with beer-battered fried fish and french fries.  It was very good.  The portions were big so I was able to take some back to the suite and take it back to the lab for lunch the next day.

It seemed like a college hang out.. it was very crowded but it was such a laid back place.. we all had fun.

I still think the Popper Burger is outstanding, just so fresh and good! And if you haven't tried the Nachos, man you should, delsih!  I have tried a few fights within the last couple of years, but have to say my favorite is the Peach Ale, sometimes I just cave a Peach Ale in a frosty cold glass! So good!

I have even tried some of the dessert a time or too, if you go and have a sweet tooth bugging ya, try the Stoutamisu, you won't be disappointed.

So last 4th of July, we were having a keger. Hubski went to pick up the keg from Four Peaks (ice cold Kiltlifter) and there were some waitresses talking about the 4th and how they have no idea what it's about. Well hubski shows up and tells them all what's what. Now we've got a friend in Steve forever.
Everytime we are there, he takes a break to chill with us. We got a tour of the facility. This is cool- the Kiltlifter is supposed to be a Scottish beer. Four Peaks actually has biologists balance the water to match the chemicals to Scottish water. The same with the Hefe- the water matches German water. This is all so that we can have the most delicious and authentic beer possible.

But... this time after many visits over a period of five years, yes the parking sucks and during the summers it gets sticky with the misters and the large fans attempting to circulate air inside and on the patio. this time me and dani ordered dessert. The idea of dessert was aroused when we were waiting for our pager to buzz while hanging out by the bar, dani with her regular peach beer and my hefweizen. we saw a slice of chocolate fabness on a plate passing by, so, we made note and agreed that we would not really eat our oversized entrees and ensure we'd have room to eat some cake! Well the agreement was more of i'd have a little cake but nevertheless. Had the fish and chips which were DELISH... YUMMY! and we finally order the cake of least resistance the oatmeal stout tiramisu! Now this slice of tiramisu is meant to be shared by a village of dieters or a gang of dessert whores because it's mammoth prehistoric huge.

This time I was there for an end of the week decompression with coworkers. There was over 12 of us and impressively, they were able to get us set up with a table big enough to accommodate all of us in about a half hour. They have a whole other section of the restaurant that is just a bar where you can order drinks while waiting on your table.

The ambience of the place is nice. Very casual, and as with most breweries you can see the huge metallic vessels where the magic happens, as part of the restaurant's decor. They have outdoor indoor seating, and even though it is cold now, don't be afraid to sit outside because they have some pretty good heaters. My favorite little thing about this place is the cornhole game outside. It makes waiting for a table fun especially if you're with a group of people.

I figured they might have changed their menu  overtime, but would still have one of their menu items on there - spanakopita. It had tasted so good back then and I remembered I was looking forward to it. Unfortunately they didn't have it anymore. I decided to order the chicken Chile mac and cheese. When I tell you I have not had mac and cheese that's good in a long time... At least four other friends tasted it and everybody including me was stunted just how good it was. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the cheese sauce or mixture was so thick and Rich without being excessively so. The green chile added such a kick to it. It was spicy yet not overbearing. There is plenty of chicken in there, and the bacon bits are clever Finishing Touch. I had been so hungry after work and ate about two-thirds of it. It was a lot!

I have been here twice the first time we came it was about an hour before the kitchen was going to close. The bartender had an attitude, I'm sure at that point in the night she was just looking to go home there's was only about 10 people sitting at the bar because it was during the week. While her attitude was noticeable, I tried not to let it effect my experience. I've served before so I know it sucks sometimes when you get last minute people, however she could've tried harder to hide her disappointment. We didn't see her much the whole time we were there. 

We got:

Calamari: maybe I'm being picky but I like when the calamari is in rings, I don't like it in stick form. It was still good and comes with two sauces, the greenish colored sauce is really good. If was jalapeño type cream sauce, very good.

Peanut sauce wings: good, not amazing but I did like them.

Edamame: hands down the best I've ever had. ""Four peaks style"" is slightly spicy and very garlicky, I absolutely loved them.

Got the white ale both visits and I really liked it, refreshing, reminded me of a better version of blue moon. 

This past Friday we went again, it was very busy inside and out. 

Again the service was lacking. We waited quite a while for our appetizer that never came. Finally our food comes out, trying to get our server to stop for more than a second was nearly impossible, when she checked on us when our food came it was more of a walk by glance, eventually the next time she walked by (about a third of the way through my food) we stopped her long enough to say we never got our appetizer, she asked if I still wanted it I said yes. She said the kitchen forgot it but I know that's server language for ""I never rang it in and am passing the responsibility off onto the kitchen"". It was busy so I tried to be understanding, maybe both visits we just got servers on off nights. Hopefully next time around we will get better service. 

This time we got:

Carne asada tacos: very very delicious, my only dislike was they had corn tortillas which I prefer the, less authentic, flour tortilla. Just a flavor and texture thing but the meat and cheese and other toppings were 5 star. 

The pizza: don't know the name but it had different meat on it, pepperoni, sausage, I think I ham. It was good, not the best pizza ever but still delicious.

And again the edamame (which was what was forgotten): it came out hot this time, four peaks style like our first visit which I absolutely love. 

Overall the food and beers are very good, I'm hoping next time we get a more attentive server.",0,0,0

I actually prefer their bottled beer rather than their ""fresh outta the keg"" variety, which is good for them seeing as I'm more likely to pick out their product at Safeway than I am to visit the Tempe location due to proximity.  On a related note, however, their House Brew that they make especially for The Roosevelt is my second favorite local brew behind Popago's Orange Blossom.

Patio seating is a premium here in the Valley, and the fact that Four Peaks blended a warehouse motif into a sunny front porch SCREAMS Seattle's Pioneer Square without the dismal rain.

Yes, the parking is a bit silly (with the parallel parking\/sometimes lack of spaces\/a bit of walking to get there), but it is totally worth the ridiculousness of said parking. The service is great, the food is wonderful, and the beer...is amazing. If you need recommendations, I'd recommend trying the 8th st chicken strips as well as (for beers) the hefeweizen and sunbru. So, come down to four peaks and deal with the parking there like a champ, you won't regret it. 

The only thing I'd keep in mind is that their happy hour is nonsensically busy, so if you're not too fond of parallel parking or walking, happy hour isn't the best time for you to go.",0,0,0

Lets just say this place is VERY good.  The moment we found a seat at the bar, the bartender came up and took our drink orders.  I mainly just wanted to come here for the beer and by beer I really just wanted to try the Peach Ale. The Peach ale was so good!  It had a nice taste but wasn't overly fruity which i liked.  
Next wee decided to order some food.  I ordered the chicken strips and my boyfriend ordered the fish and chips.  I wasn't thinking anything of these items when we ordered them, just figured they would be standard bar food and would taste good with alcohol.  I was completely wrong.  The food here was amazing.  I never thought i would rave about chicken strips but they were damn good.  The fish and chips my boyfriend got were equally as good.

I am basing my scores off our experience in the following categories.

Atmosphere:
For a brewery the atmosephere was very nice and closely resembles a sports bar with numerous tvs present. They also sold merchandise in various forms which i thought was pretty cool.

Service:
Once seated out waitress assisted us promptly bringing two waters with her prior to us ordering them. She also check back in on is through out our meal.

Food:
I ordered the Kilt Lifter Brat Sandwhich which i found the be delectable. Carmelized onions, bacon bits, cheese and of course 3 brats split on marble rye bread. Definately worth the $11.  My wife ordered the Buffalo Wings which was about 10 or 11 total for $10. They were okay to me but she thought they were average as well. The biggest thing we wanted was more buffalo sauce.  They were not sauced well and kind of dry. Also the ranch was not good, actually flavorless (this was a first). 

BEER: (MOST IMPORTANT )
Wow, I am honestly disappointed in this department. We ordered the Hop Knot and The Raj. Both were supposed to be IPAs with the Raj being the strongest out of the two. I am a huge Ipa fan and love heavy hops and bitterness with mine in addition to flavor other aromatic notes. Neither of these beers had those elements present. The Raj tasted more like a Pale Ale than a IPa. I will say it was very smooth but lacked flavor. The Hop Knot had a mild hoppy taste but no other notes. 

Typically if a Brewery has good beer i will stay and drink many more  especially @ $5 a pint. But after these failed attempts at beer we got the check and left. I did not want to try another beer here. As always these are just my $0.02. The main reason that i gave 3 stars is that this is a brewery and we came for the beer and the beer was average at best. If this was a restaurant or bar and the expectation level was different it would have been a 4 star.",0,0,0

It would get 5 stars from me, but unfortunately I went on game day and the volume on the game was so loud it was a bit off-putting.  I know it's a bar and football season so it's not unexpected .  If you are in the mod to watch the game it's a very good place to go.  The real standout thing are the beer bread sandwiches.  They are more of a wrap than a sandwich, but very good either way.  At our table we had the mushroom one, chicken one, and the italian beef one all of us gave them high marks.  They also come with some pretty awesome fries.  How do you make a fry better?

Why the four stars for a place with such awesome beers? The bar atmosphere was an interesting mix of college bros and middle age regulars that was, for lack of a better word, a bit strange. Drunk guys at the bar were inappropriately hitting on younger girls and the bartenders were encouraging it.

The normal menu has the best bar food in the Phoenix area, but there are 3 lunch and three dinner specials daily, as well as Sunday brunch specials, that easily top any other restaurant in the same price range.  The spinach artichoke dip is a highly recommended bar bite.  It is creamy and cheesy and, despite the misleading name, full of both spinach and huge artichoke chunks.  It is paired with heaps off blue and red corn chips and soft, warm beer bread triangles.  It is perfect for sharing with friends.

Aside from being an excellent restaurant, Four Peaks also happens to be the best brewery in Arizona.  My favorite beer, Raj I.P.A, is super floral and hoppy, with only a slight bitter front end and a smooth, slightly malty finish.  It is the definition of balance and it has a gorgeous dark orange color too.  At 6.9 percent, it will also get you where ever you want to go.  For summer patio drinking, get Peachbru: half Sunbru, half Peach ale, and drink it fast while it is still cold.  

From top to bottom, the service is always impeccable.  On the rare occasion that service slips, management always ensures that customers never leave unhappy.

I really enjoyed hearing about the history of the building as well as learning about their brewing process. The $10 brewery tour comes with 2 drink tickets or 1 flight, which can be redeemed at the end of the tour. 

The only downside was that once the tour was over, we had to go back to the front, put our names down for a table, wait to get seated, and then order the drinks. It was really crowded, so our group of 6 ended up waiting more than 30 minutes for a table. I hope in the future, they would use that back space with tables for the tour guests. It was really inconvenient to have to wait for a table. 

The flight came with 8 (generous portions) glasses of different beers. My favorite was definitely the peach ale. It was light and refreshing, with the perfect amount of peach flavor. Our tour guide, Remy, also informed us about their water, which is super pure. And I can definitely agree with him that it was the best water I had in Arizona! It was tasteless and so clean.

I do enjoy a loud beer and Hop Knot IPA a big, broad-shouldered, hoppy beer. Made only from American malt and lots of American hops, which produce really good character. 

Kilt lifter. This is just a nice, clean Scottish ale with mild caramel and a touch of roast. The aroma, like the flavor, is all malt. I have only been in this tap house once for lunch. I ordered one of the lunch specials and had the two beers. 

Tap Room Tenderloin $11.5 Filet Mignon grilled to order, served on a hoagie roll topped with bleu cheese crumbles, onion straws, lettuce, tomato and roasted garlic-jalapeño aioli.

Since it wasn't a busy time, we didn't have any issues and were able to park about a block away.  I could see how it would be frustrating during peak hours.  

The sign out front said to seat yourself.  There were plenty of tables in the outdoor patio area but we opted to sit indoors.  The interior of the place is really interesting.  It was clean and cool.  

We started with the fried calamari appetizer.  It came it quickly and was awesome.  I was expecting the standard calamari rings, but these were long, panko-breaded strips topped with Parmesan.  There were crispy and tender.  For our meals, my husband and I both got the fish and chips.  Delicious!  Crunchy Kilt Lifter Beer Batter and flaky white fish.  For drinks, my husband had an 8th St IPA and a Pumpkin Porter.  He liked the 8th St but loved the porter.  He said it didn't taste as dark as it looked and was super smooth.

The place is kinda cool, huge fans going and the temperature was comfortable.  The waitress was actually knowledgeable about gluten free which was great.  She even asked me first I had an allergy or if this was just a lifestyle choice (fair question BTW).

Anyway I ended up with a Popper Burger with no onion straws (Fresh, sautéed jalapeño, onion straws and cream cheese) served on a bed of lettuce with onion and tomato.  Instead of the fries I had a side salad.

First I need to say that the servings in this joint are HUGE!  I was astonished and the plates that were coming out of the kitchen.

OH they had Woodchuck Cider on tap so that was another quick pleaser for me!

Finally the burger arrived.  IT WAS AMAZING.  No joke.  The combo of flavors were great, I have no idea what kind of meat but fantastic quality.  It was cooked to perfection at medium rare.

There are few thoughts about life in Arizona that cause a pit in my stomach like when I think about a warm night on the patio at Four Peaks.  I'm not really sure what it is about a barren warehouse converted to a brewery.  But it's magical. 

I walk around the cold suburbs of DC and am overwhelmed by the thought of a Tap Room Tenderloin (blue cheese crumbles on the side).  Or a cold pint of Sunbru on a warm summer afternoon.  Better yet, ordering a Winter Wobbler after your waitress wobbles in the aisle to demonstrate how good it is.  

I arranged to meet a girl here on a first date.  We enjoyed numerous pitchers over a couple of years.

We eat all over town and spend alot of money each year. 

We arrived at the restaurant by taxi and got our table immediately. We sat at our table and were greeted by our server. We ordered a round of drinks for everyone but one, and immediately the server said that one person in our group wasn't allowed to be served until they ate a little bit. Understandable, I run a restaurant in Vegas and know liquor liability and it was responsible of her to make that decision. But then the manager who looked as if this was his first restaurant job shifted the situation and said he couldn't serve any of us. This immediately pissed us all off and ruined our experience. The server already cut one person off and the manager blew this situation out of proportion. Not only did he lose a customer but I am so irate how he embarrassed our table and made our experience unbearable. He is a terrible asset to your company and should never be able to run a restaurant again. He lost money from your restaurant from people who all work in the hospitality industry in Vegas. I expect the company to have better standards as I know this company has a good reputation in AZ",4,1,0

During my sole visit to this establishment, I tried their flight of eight local crafts, all of which can merely be described as ""underwhelming"". I took my time and tried to savor both the flavors and the aromas of each brew, but nothing really stimulated my senses. By the time I finished all eight samples, I had not come across a single one that I would happily order as a pint. If someone twisted my arm, I might have a pint of the Hefeweizen.

A few negatives to mention....
-Parking can be a nightmare so be prepared to walk some distance.
-They can get crowded quickly and wait times for a table can get lengthy.

We were seated at a tall table on the patio, somewhat near a heater and ohmygosh, it was perfect outside. Our server was friendly and attentive, the food came out quickly, and I'm in love with their peach beer! Just like other Yelpers mentioned, the FRIES. They're really good, as was the Garden Burger which had melted pepperjack cheese, roasted red peppers, spinach, lettuce, and tomato. The sweet jalapeño sauce was too spicy for me on its own but tasted awesome on the burger. I like that you have to option to substitute the veggie burger patty in place of one of the other burger versions but lets be real - the Garden Burger has the best topping choices already.

Apparently their chicken tenders are amazing! The chicken egg rolls (umm, not sure what their official title is) weren't exactly what my sister was expecting and she'd probably order something different next time (this brings me back to the chicken tenders), but she still thought they were good and liked the jalapeño sauce and chipotle ranch to dip them in.

DO NOT park in one of the apartment complex's across the street, because YOU WILL BE TOWED. And besides, if your going to have a few beers, you shouldn't be driving anyway.

The beer here is amazing. I am not sure if they even serve guest beers. In my 10 years enjoying this brewery, I have never once even thought to ask. They have a Kolsch (which I recommend if you typically drink mass produced beer), 2 IPA's, the Hop Knot being the drier of the two, as well as an English Pale Ale, Peach Ale, Oatmeal Stout, and their  world famous Kiltlifter, a malty Scottish Ale. And in October, they serve their coveted Pumpkin Porter.

The front patio is the best way to enjoy Four Peaks, although they are usually pretty busy, so first available table usually puts you inside, which isn't a bad thing because you can see the actual brewery and all its glory.

You have to love a brewery that spends as much time and energy on the food menu as they do crafting the beer. The 8th Street Ale chicken strips and fries are comfort food. If your looking for a light, but amazing appetizer, I suggest trying the SW Chicken Rolls or the Fried Calamari. I hated Calamari until Four Peaks opened my eyes to how Calamari should taste. They have are great selection of burgers and beer bread sandwiches also. Their specials are always great too. You can tell that the specials are inspired by great chefs, and not a way to push an ingredient that will spoil if they dont sell it all by the end of the night.",0,0,0

Naturally I asked many for their opinions and a slew of places were recommended. However I noticed some of the restaurants were disliked by a few people when I mentioned another's recommendation. Only one establishment seemed to convey great reviews across the board, Four Peaks. Naturally I had to try it. 

My first visit, with my parents, was slightly overwhelming. The parking situation is subpar so prepare to walk a bit to your destination. Hardly a bane to my experience though as for the second my family and I were seated, I knew I had gone to the right place. The building itself seems to be the shell of a has-been factory of sorts. The large wide open spaces allow for maximum seating arrangements, which translates into a short waiting time. Servers here tend to be on the up and up when it comes to taking drink orders and providing refills. While I wouldn't call it a five star service, the managers clearly have constructed a solid waiting plan that finds a nice balance between giving regular service and your personal space. 
 
Make no mistake, Four Peaks is a brewery. Through and through. The beer is the number one priority, and boy do they deliver. Being the first timers that we were, the waiter suggested ordering a sample platter of beer so as to try each one and perhaps find a favorite. He was adequately knowledgable about which beers would fit which pallet and within no time at all, we had a row of beer glasses lined up in the middle of the table. All of the beers were good to great. My personal favorite (which seems to be a common choice) is the Kilt Lifter. I highly recommend it and since my initial try have bought six packs of it many times.

A large unfocused menu, to me, typically indicates a restaurant without direction. The lack of said direction often translates into poor food as well. Four Peaks defies my logic as it sports the large menu that dips into various genres of food, but the food actually manages to be incredible. 

The nachos. Order them. You will NOT be disappointed. Blackened chicken, loads of fresh cheese, and a bean dip that'd give any top of the line Mexican restaurant a run for their money. How can you go wrong?

Burgers. Burgers. And... more burgers. I consider myself to be somewhat of a beef snob. Medium rare hand pressed party, a toasted and quality bun, and a stack of fresh tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and pickles. Without any single component a burger can quickly find itself tasting like an overpriced late-night Wendy's adventure. Or in other words, nothing to warrant my five star review. Four Peaks thankfully takes their burgers seriously. Cooked to order and taste a plenty, I guarantee you will not find a dissatisfying burger on the menu. My personal favorite is the Popper Burger (I believe that is the name). Try it, you can't go wrong.

Other dishes I have tried over the several visits I've made since my first have been the fish tacos (very tasty), steak sandwich (not my favorite, but still good), and a salad (cannot remember the exact one, but it was phenomenal). As far as I am concerned, there is hardly a thing on the vast and sprawling menu that won't satisfy your hunger cravings. Portions here are absolutely massive as well. Bring an empty stomach!

Pricing manages to be fairly reasonable for an environment and food\/drink service as high caliber as it is. Four Peaks is THE place to go in Tempe.

Our server couldn't be bothered to smile or even make eye contact, let alone visit our table in any semblance of a timely fashion. We had to flag her down to place our order, after waiting fifteen minutes with the menus closed. She never visited our table to see if we might need more water or another drink. If it was only the server I would guess she was just having a bad day, but the front desk was also rude. There was a bouncer at the front who just stood there with his hand out and didn't say a word, I had to watch others to figure out I had to show him my ID. What's wrong, meathead, is the phrase, ""hello sir may I see your ID"" above your vocabulary level???

I had the eighth street ale with my meal, which was okay, but not worth any of the other rave reviews I've read here. For an ale, it was very simplistic and safe, basically tasted like any consistent ale you would get from a large mega-brewery such as Sam Adams. The best thing about the place is the music, which better be good because there is no way you are going to have a conversation in there without shouting your lungs out.

It's my boyfriend's favorite brewery\/restaurant\/hang out spot, and if he had the choice, we'd go every night, even though it's a 30 minute drive away.  While it may not be my choice for every Friday and Saturday night that I'm in Phoenix, it's a great, laid back spot to grab some food and a beer.

My favorite beers are the Hefeweizen and some of the seasonals, like this week's chocolate porter.  Prices are right, and there's usually an interesting special to try.  You can really tell that the brewmaster loves his craft - I'm especially looking forward to trying the much-touted pumpkin porter this fall!

For food, definitely go with the chicken strips.  They're hand made and incredibly juicy and flavorful.  Not too greasy, and they come with a side of delicious fries.  Other recommendations include the spinach salad with blackened chicken, the daily specials (like the buffalo burger or camarones a la diabla) or the steak sandwich on beer bread.

Overall, I'd give Four Peaks 4.5 stars for its great local vibe and cheap and tasty food and beer.  The lack of air conditioning in the summer is a definite bummer, though.  Rounding up to 5 stars for the sake of my relationship and the fact that it won't always be this hot out ;)",0,0,0

That being said, I love Four Peaks.  It's a chunk of PHX that we can actually brag about to people from else.  What other brewery out there has this well-known of a beer (Kiltlifter, the de facto beer of the Phoenix area) and THIS good of food?

Steak sandwich is ballin', a delicious and perfectly cooked filet with onion straws and blue cheese (seriously...I dont know how you can live without this once you taste it).  Chicken strips are ballin', they're so perfectly battered and tender, and the chipotle ranch is perfect.  The nachos are a heaping mound of chips and heaven.

Nice place with an awesome atmosphere. I didn't have a chance to try any of the beers on this visit, but I definitely will on my next. I had the New Yorker (pastrami sandwich) with beer battered fries....pretty darn good! Now the coleslaw was pretty bland and tasteless. But I've run that issue with coleslaw many times over around the country...so I don't really count that.

Now this place is located down a neighborhood street and away from any main strip malls or corners. So you may feel like you're not headed in the right direction to find it. You may want to look it up on a map.

There is some street parking and a small lot in the back...which is dirt. Visiting on a Satuday, noon, & during an NFL playoff game, the joint was pretty busy.

Free water aside, Four peaks in Tempe makes many great beers, some good food and combines it in  a unique industrial warehouse atmosphere. 

On my last trip here I went just for the beer, like many other times. I tried the seasonal, all be it after the season, pumpkin ale. It was pretty good with subtle spice notes,a clean finish and not too much residual sugar. 

I also had the Hop Knot IPA, the strong hops in this beer have some distinctly fruity and floral notes adding to its' complexity.

Set in an out-of-the-way, non-mainstream location, Four Peaks Brewing Company screams authenticity. The building is a gorgeous, brick warehouse originally constructed in 1892. As a former warehouse, the vaulted ceiling is massive standing 35 feet tall, the interior has all the room and more you could possibly want for both brewing and eating, and it even includes an expansive outdoor patio for taking in that amazing Arizona sun. But the best part is that on NFL Sundays, a group of die-hard fantasy fans gather to watch no less than 11 televisions - mostly plasma - and every game at the same time.

The menu is not terribly creative and features dishes you're likely to find on any brewpub menu with few surprises. I had an Italian beef sandwich served on house made beer bread. It was tasty, but not overly impressive. It was basically a high-end glob of cheese, peppers, onions and beef on a decent chunk of bread. The accompanying breaded fries, however, were outstanding. For dessert I tried the special - a small, individual strawberry tart. It was very, very good.

Overall, the beer was well above average and lends well to sitting and drinking all day, every day. My favorites were the Hefeweizen (which I don't normally go for), the Kiltlifter and the Raj IPA.

I found the Kolsch to be a bit sweet but perfect for beginners. The peach was barely peached, which I appreciate. The Hop Knot Pale had a strong up-front bitterness without any of the lingering complexity, so I didn't care for it. The Raj IPA took care of that problem and was much tastier. The Kiltlifter was sweet and spicy, almost like a Christmas Ale and the Hefe was flawless. I just wish they had more dark offerings than just the Oatmeal Stout, which could use some work.",0,0,0

I also ordered the peaks mimosa, which is composed of equals part of their peach ale beer and champagne.

First, the beer. They have ten regular offerings on tap ranging from several Ales to Witbier to IPA and Double IPA to Stout. Then they have 10 seasonal and single tanks on tap ranging from a couple of Lagers to Browns to Gose to a ridiculous Chia Milk Stout to a Malt Liquor (are you kidding me, what craft brewery does that) to a Barleywine. WOW! Too many incredible choices. A couple of trips and I still haven't tried all the ones I want to try. And did I mention that you can get these in many different pours and packages for your on premise and off premise consumption enjoyment? They offer glasses, pints and even pitchers of the beers on tap. How great is that? Many of the 10 regulars are available to go in cans, bottles and growler fills. 

Second, the food is solid with a generous selection of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, burgers, pizzas and plates featuring local products whenever possible and Southwestern style. They even offer sweets featuring a shake made with malted vanilla bean ice cream and their oatmeal stout. 

Finally, the atmosphere is great. Four Peaks brews onsite and the restaurant \/ bar \/ brewery are all together in an old brick creamery located near the ASU campus. Parking is a little bit challenging but well worth the experience.

I tried the popper burger made which chicken breast & it was extremely huge & messy\/hard to eat. The fried onions were really oily & the chicken wasn't grilled well so it ended up being really dry. Their nachos & spinach artichoke dip aren't bad.

Keep in mind that at this location, parking is a little bit of a pain. They don't have much of a private parking lot so you'll have to find street parking. Plan on taking a little bit of walk to the restaurant because it's almost always ridiculously busy. Additionally, if you're going there as a group, they don't take reservations and require at least half of your party to be there before you can be added to their list to get a table.

The crowd at Four Peaks is generally nice and attractive, everyone drinking good beer and eating good food.  The restaurant\/pub is located in a beautiful brick building, hidden among the half residential, half industrial 8th street drag.  Very well designed place with giant brass kettles and wood adornments and tables abounding around the large, open seating areas.

The food is a notch above bar food.  Everything I've had I've enjoyed pretty much.  I recommend chicken strips (handmade!), italian beef beer bread, pizza and burgers all from personal experience.  The stout tiramisu dessert is great for beer lovers, though a little bitter for a dessert for some.

The beers are great.  Hands down the best micro-brewery in Tempe (I think there are only two though ;)  The stouts are rich and delicious, I'm a big fan.

Their standard menu has plenty of great options, but one of the best things about Four Peaks are the multiple specials offered daily. They usually offer three specials, which are different for lunch and dinner, everything I've tried has been great. They also offer beer to go in the form of bottles, cans, growlers and you can even order kegs for parties or BBQs.

My girlfriend used to live walking distance from here so we used to come at least once a week, and still pretty much do. I cant tell you what on the menu we haven't ordered but we have had pretty much everything, and its ALL good!!

My tips for the best, or our faves:
**SALMON BLT** TO DIE FOR
**pretty awesome cheeseburger**
**Southwest Chicken rolls** for sure
*Pesto veggie pizza*
*Fish and Chips*
The fish and chips are phenomenal. We spoke to a random lady when we were traveling (she was from London) and we were talking about being from AZ. When she heard that, she mentioned Four Peaks and how they had the best fish and chips and they were just as good as in London. We totally agreed, but felt validated that our favorite dish had the British 'seal of approval'!

I mean everything, down to the Caesar salad is great. As far as beer, well of course Kiltlifter, but the Hef as well as the Peach beer are so great here.

*Free Beer on your birthday* Be sure to take advantage of that!

Parking is around back and there is additional street parking, but this place is so busy that I just head around back to begin with. Want to waste no time getting there! 

There is a very large patio which is fun to people watch, they have misters often. Inside there are at least a dozen huge flatscreens and then there is also a pseudo-indoor outdoor patio, very cool.

I love the rustic, no AC feel of Four Peaks. I love going with a big group of people, especially when the weather's just right and it's been a long day. Hello, Kiltlifter.

Speaking of, that is my favorite beer of all time--Kiltlifter, their Scottish-style ale. The 8th St. Pale Ale is also awesome, and their hefeweizen is one of the best I've had. 

Food is good, but I don't go there for gourmet. The nachos are huge and the burgers are decent. Again, when drinking, I tend to go for those things which are fried or covered with something awful for me--like processed cheese. I'm not alone in this, right? Hello?

Anyway, the downers: Parking is a nightmare. I'm a creature of convenience who gets frustrated easily when things are not as accessible as I would like. Also, the hostesses up front are just not nice. Seriously. For a while I tried to overcompensate their rudeness with kindness, but to no avail. Now, I just tell them how many people and keep it at that. Servers are alright; that's been a mixed bag and I hope that you get better service than I have.

Good news: Plenty o' bars and pubs have Kiltlifter on tap! Hoorah! Casey Moore's (a favorite of mine), Buffalo Wild Wings (and they're a chain!) and Rula Bula are a few that I can think of off the top of my head. BevMo! also has Four Peaks' beer bottled, which is definitely not as good as the tap or the source, obviously, but when at home, at least it's better than the ""great American lager.""

When we reached the hostess stand we were relieved to finally get an ice old beer and enjoy our mini-vacay. However, when the security checked our IDs we were not allowed to go in. Being from California, we hold vertical IDs until we turn 22 (unless you wish to go to the DMV to change it early). In Arizona, state law invalidates vertical IDs 30 days after your 21st birthday. 

Despite our protests that we are from California, security would not let us in. 

We went to a nice restaurant after that, across from ASU. Upon ordering drinks there, the waiter told us that despite our vertical CA IDs, we are allowed to drink because it is not a federal law, it's only a AZ state law...

My bf and I visited the brewery after a long day at the Phoenix Zoo. The location was easy to find with plenty of street parking (although it could be difficult during peak hours). We found a nice table on the half-indoor seating area. The ambiance was very cool, with a converted loft warehouse sort of feel.

The bf had the beer sampler, which I helped myself to some sips of. I ordered a pint of the Kilt Lifter, which was a great deal during happy hour. Next, I tried the Pumpkin Porter (full price, even during happy hour). Foodwise, I had the pub fish and chips, which are battered in Kilt Lifter, and the bf had the french dip. Both items were on par with good quality pub fare.

Kilt Lifter: great medium brew, very smooth. The type of beer you could drink every day and never tire of. Pumpkin Porter: we loved it so much, we purchased a growler so we could take some home! Note: there is an extra charge for filling up a growler with a seasonal brew. $4 for the growler itself, $10 for beer, and $5 seasonal charge. Normal refills of growlers are $10.

Once you get a seat, though, you'll be happy for much more than just an hour.
