There was a long line. It did move at a good pace though. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My food was out in no time.

I ordered the ShackBurger and Cheese Fries. The burger comes topped with cheese, lettuce and ShackSauce. I opted for no tomato. The burger was juicy and tasty. The bun was solid as well. The sauce is a nice complimentary flavor. The single is more than enough burger.

The cheese fries come topped with a mix American and cheddar cheese as a sauce. The fries are good. The cheese was very good.

I was quite happy with both the fries and the burger. New Yorkers may over hype this somewhat, but it is still a very good burger.",10,9,10

Was out in Vegas for CNY and right after we checked into the hotel, we headed straight to New York New York hotel.  

Walked up and saw a short line forming and was afraid we'd have to wait for a while but surprisingly, we were able to order our food within 5 minutes.  Not bad since I've heard people waiting hours at the location in NY.

Quickly browsed the menu and saw that they had a new addition to the menu which was called the shack meister http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/shake-shack-las-vegas-2?select=A3AtT1ZyKFgnYMkVIOcWgA#Fu4YiaFfkDwMOilF7kayjw.  Opted to try it out since it sounded pretty tasty.  Next we ordered the shack stack, shack-cago dog, fries and a coffee fair shake w\/ malt added http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/shake-shack-las-vegas-2?select=A3AtT1ZyKFgnYMkVIOcWgA#TvJZf0wIulUraPZNeWK4iQ.  

Wasn't overly impressed with the shack-cago dog nor was I impressed with the shack meister but damn was the shack stack unique!  As most have already commented, what makes this burger so damn tasty is the cheese stuffed portobello fried mushroom.  Fries were just so so but they were nicely golden fried.  I loved the coffee fair shake though it could've been a little thicker.

Would definitely come back and am still keeping my fingers crossed that they open up a location in LA.",6,6,7

We first had it in New York and had to have it when we saw it in Vegas.

First, I always like trying out 'famous' places, and seeing as how this is a famous burger place from NY, that was originally drawing hours-long lines, I definitely wanted to try it.

Second, the shop is cool. It's more modern than a typical fast food burger, and it has a good amount of outdoor seating. The patio part is strip-side, so you can check out the goings on on LV blvd, but it's still kinda private, tucked away behind some bushes.

Third, they have a good selection of beer, including one from Brooklyn Brewery made specifically for Shake Shack (even though I didn't particularly love that one).

Last, but not least, the burgers, hot dogs, and fries are all good. They are a little higher priced because they're famous and this is the Las Vegas Strip, but it's not extravagant. 

If you're in the area visiting anything at NYNY or across the street (Coke World!), I'd definitely recommend walking over to Shake Shack. And feel free to bring a big group!",0,0,1

Why do people wait hours for this in NYC?  Maybe it tastes different there, I don't know.  I hope it does.  But, if I waited 4 hours for the burger and fries I ate at this location, I would be furious at both the situation and myself for allowing it to happen.

First of all, Shake Shack is ""inside"" NYNY, and I put inside in quotations because there is no way to access it from the casino.  You have to walk outside to get in.  This is incredibly annoying, and I can't remember another restaurant with a set up like this.  I could certainly be wrong, they may exist, but I've not seen it on the Strip.

We ate at Shake Shack at around noon on Thursday of the Pacquiao\/Mayweather fight weekend.  There wasn't much of a line, although after we ordered it took a long time to get our food.  Far too long given how many people were working back there.  So long that I don't know that I would call Shake Shack ""fast food.""  I went with the double smokestack and cheese fries, but I was told they didn't have the cheese sauce.  So, second annoyance.  

When my food arrived, it was hot.  It had clearly been made fresh, which is good given how long it took.  The fries are crinkle cut, they were just the right amount of crispy and seasoned very well.  Most places just give you naked fries and leave the seasoning to you, so I've got to give it up to Shake Shack for seasoning properly.  The fries are good, but that's it.  Not earth shattering, not mind blowing, not revolutionary.  They're good.  I prefer thinner fries, so I like In N Out's better.  But, these were crispy and tasty.

The burger was a bit of a mess, it was difficult to eat without it falling apart.  The veggies were fresh; I particularly liked the pickles.  The meat is cooked all the way through but retained some juiciness.  It had a couple of crispy edges, which are my favorite.  But, not too many.  I would like it the patties were a little thinner.  The sauce was good, it's mayo based with a bit of a tang to it.  Tasted a little like dijon mustard to me, but only a little.  It's not like other fast food special sauces, which is a good thing.  My bacon needed to be cooked longer, it had virtually no crisp to it.  Again, I prefer In N Out.

The place is clean and employees are constantly asking if you need help, so that was appreciated.  Overall, glad I ate here.  Maybe it's me, maybe I am just missing something.  But, I don't see this as being worth a multi-hour wait, and for $13.50, it wasn't cheap either.  I'd eat at this location again, but only if I was near there and didn't have other plans.  I won't seek it out.",3,1,1

I was afraid the hype would skew my senses and I would be disappointed because of the unbelievably high bar my mind was placing on this burger. It didn't. The hype is real.

Simple foods, like burgers, pizza's, hotdog's, that require such few ingredients, mean that those ingredients play huge rolls individually. Shake Shack proves that. They use a brioche bun (vs a cheap run of the mill bun), roma tomatoes (vs regular), green leaf lettuce (vs iceberg). They're serious about hitting all the right notes.

It's simply a great burger. 

For me, for several reasons, it's not fair to compare this to In-N-Out. Sure, they're both burgers, but that's where the similarities end. I'm no fan of In-N-Out. I can write a book on the subject. This is far better, no competition, however, for the simple fact that this burger is roughly 30-50% more expensive, it's not comparable.

They're kind of pricey, especially considering how small their burgers are. That's the only negative that comes to mind.

The first time, the server was extremely nice. She offered to let me try a sample of a 3-flavor shake to see if I'd like it--I did. The combination of chocolate, caramel and strawberry was delicious, if a bit too sweet (but what can you expect when there's caramel involved?). The ice cream shake melted extremely fast though, which was its only detraction.

The second day, I ordered a chocolate\/strawberry shake and a shroom burger. The server got my shake order wrong (strawberry only), which was disappointing since chocolate is my drug of choice. The burger was tasty, if not a bit too cheesy (shocking, but true). If the cheese was milder in flavor, it might not have been too much, but the pungent taste was overpowering, and I actually like strong cheese. The melty cheese was also stuffed inside a deep-fried breaded mushroom, so it was a bit dangerous to bite into without getting splattered or burned.

This burger joint first started in New York in 2004, and spread to other East coast locations, and I was happy to find out they recently started opening on the West coast. Unfortunately, the only locations they have in California are all in SoCal. When they will open one in the Bay Area? I hope they open one in San Francisco someday. But as for right now, I will have to stop by when visiting LA. When looking for places to eat, I was ecstatic to see a Shake Shack on the Vegas Strip! It's near the NY NY hotel.

I came here around early lunch, and there was already a long line near the door, and tables were almost occupied. I ordered the Shackburger which is the standard cheeseburger, and as simple as it sounded, it was quite a delicious burger! This is not the typical burger you get from In N Out (sorry if you're a fan) but the burger had a thicker, juicier meat. I also tried their crinkle fries drizzled in cheese, and the regular kind. But for future visits, I'll stick to good ol' regular fries.

For dessert, I settled for the Shake Attack which is a chocolate custard ice cream with chocolate and cookie dough chunks. Which was a great, sweet treat, which was the perfect end to my meal.

So, you can only imagine how happy I was to find out that there was one in Las Vegas (not having to pay for a flight to NYC to try this out). 

To be fair, since I've had In N' Out and Five Guys, I ordered the following to compare:

Double Shack Burger; good, juicy patties, seasoned well, unfortunately someone had a heavy hand on the seasoning this night as the flavor kept going, as in, it turned out to be salty. Otherwise, it would've been a great burger, even though it is a bit on the small side (especially for the price tab)

Cheese fries; crinkle cut with a cheese sauce. My favorite part of the meal.

With the incredible food scene in LV, I question why I always want to go there and the answer is the shroom burger, fries and purple cow float. I swear I'm not 10 years old . But seriously, I've never had a better burger! Consistently crispy with the perfect ratio of cheese stuffed into the portobello. Fries are great, piping hot with the perfect amount of salt and I hate salt so I would know. Their self serving condiment area is wonderful so no one can judge the amount of mayo I take. The purple cow float is great, I've been there with several different people and it's not something everyone seems to love, but I really do. 

Opportunities for improvement are the water dispenser at the condiment bar. The water is always lukewarm, which is annoying when you're there in the spring\/summer\/fall. The bathroom could use more tidying up. It's a small space so filth anywhere doesn't do it any justice. It's always littered with paper towels.

(free refill on my lemonade!)

my main reason i wont be coming back to this location is the parking policy started in april 2016.  if you drove in, you have an hour of free parking--after that, it's $7 additional for whatever food you are trying to spend money on at the MGM hotels. now, for any food place, there's going to be a line or wait. the line at the shack shake takes at least 10-15 minutes. i found myself trying to nudge people along in the line--and the cashier's are not arrayed in a clearly visible manner off the main queue. it must be so frustrating for them to keep waving at distracted orderers. it's a lot of pressure to wait 15 minutes in line, then another 10-20 minutes for the food--and shake shack is about the farthest distance from the parking garage that could be imagined.  i ended up feeling like i had ran a sprint, waited, ate like crazy, and sprinted back to the car.  

i do admire that the employees there are fairly productive but quite nice to the customers. there was one annoying customer that kept asking for additional thing after her burger arrived--she had misunderstood that the regular burger (even though it says on the menu clearly) does not come with toppings. but the food distributor lady was very polite, even after several requests by the lady for this, that, then the other. she has quite the patience.

shake shack is solid. the employees work hard. but for the price and all the competition out there, it's not worth the stress of trying to complete a nice dining experience in under 60 minutes, esp with the parking garage a full 5 minute sprint away. i'll save my shake shack visits for other cities and, in las vegas, i'll stick with a place with free parking or 1.5 hours of validated parking...",1,0,0

But back to this place. Was super excited to check it out. I'm well aware of the hype and tried to make it here for a couple trips to Vegas. I walked over from cosmopolitan.  It was about a 15 min walk cutting thru some other hotels. The street may have been quicker, it was cold outside. I opted for secondhand cigarette smoke. I was thrown off by their burger logo outside.  The signage is all green. Then you walk in and see the signage inside features the green burger.  I waited in the quickly moving line but with anxiety. When it was my turn to order I had to ask, ""are the burgers green?""  I got a look back like I was being a smart-ass, but it was a legit concern in my mind. 

Back to the review. I ordered a cheeseburger , fries and a soda.  There were other options, but that's what I was feeling.  The wait was standard, 5 min'ish. The fries are crinkled fries. Reminded me of the frozen type mom would buy from grocery store.  Not a big deal to me as I'm not a big fry-guy any ways. The burger was really good. Had little tomatoes on them and some type of secret sauce.  It reminded me (taste and texture) of a Wendy's burger, but several notches higher in quality.

The burger was okay, but the mushroom was fried and it was too greasy for me. The cheese fries were served with a container of melted American cheese (to pour over it, I assume).

The nice thing about Shake Shack is that they serve alcohol (or at least at this location).

It was an okay, fast and relatively cheap meal but I prefer In N Out",1,1,1

So the food, I ordered the, Ionno, I forgot but it was like a double burger w\/ bacon and a side of cheese fries and a drink. This order ran close to $17? Gotta be honest the first few bites were good but the 2nd half of it went down hill. I think all burgers should have some type of veggies to even out all the grease ur expecting to chow down on. The cheese fries.. That's all it was, a piece of cheese on top of some crinkle cut fries. Pretty weak. And to add more hate how can you mess up a medium soda? It was bland and watered down.

SmokeShack 是在起司漢堡中加上了風味濃郁的煙燻培根。真材實料的厚片培根，完全不是一般速食店那種單薄濫竽充數的劣質品，從肉片到起司還有麵包，確實可以感受食材出色的品質。

Shroom Burger 是以體積龐大的Portobello香菇代替漢堡肉片，裹粉油炸後保留了香菇特有的香氣與富有水分的食感，讓不吃肉的素食者也可以盡情地享用這個全球知名的漢堡風味。

一口咬下來自各種食材帶來的多層次口感留下唇齒留香的深刻印象。不同於一般鬆散的漢堡麵包，這裡的麵包帶有類似夏威夷麵包那種加入大量奶油製作的香甜風味，讓各種新鮮的食材風味嶄露無遺。

奶昔香甜可口但是濃稠程度比較稀釋，感覺水分的比例較高沒多久時間就融化成水狀了。用餐過後不難發覺這個風迷全球的速食品牌受到廣大消費者喜愛的原因，各種餐點的水準與口味也確實超越了一般人對於速食食品的認知，但如果說真的要跟一些定位在高級路線的漢堡風味相比似乎又單薄了些。整體來說，查理個人還是偏愛 In-N-Out 這種價格實惠且帶有突出美味的速食漢堡，但品嚐美食的前提就是要吃得開心，放下比較的嚴肅心情把手上漢堡送入口中，填飽肚皮來好好享受賭城的美麗時光。",1,0,0

Located just outside of New York New York on the strip. I always wondered how their burgers were because being living in California, In N Out is the undisputed champ. I have friends that have been eating it on their trips to NYC and some have said it was better than In N Out. Others disagreed. Finally, it was my turn to taste and judge for myself.

I ordered a ShackStack ($9.49) and a SmokeShack ($6.69). The latter, I split with someone. I also ordered crinkle cut fries ($2.95) and a large strawberry lemonade ($3.50). That ShackStack was pretty tasty. Soft bread, fresh ground beef patty, melted cheese and that breaded shroom burger that oozes cheese once you bite into it. That's good use of portobello. All that with lettuce, tomato and shacksauce are what you get. I thought the bun was maybe a little too soft. The burger had good flavor but the sandwich overall was a little salty. Its not cheap at almost 10 bucks. The SmokeShack was interesting but not my favorite. It's just like the ShackBurger except it has smoked applewood bacon and chopped up cherry peppers. I wasnt a fan of the cherry peppers. I should have read the menu more carefully. Not a fan of spice on my burgers. I probably would have liked it better without that. The fries were good and crispy. Serve your own ketchup. They give you a pager so you can come up to the counter when your order is ready. I also got a onesie ($18) for my friend's newborn.

There was a little bit of a wait but we got there within an hour of them closing so it wasnt too bad. But you still have to wait as everything is cooked to order. Service was ok. You could tell it was the end of the shift on a long Vegas night. Is Shake Shack better than In N Out?? No... in my opinion, I'd still take Baldwin Park's finest any day. Dont get me wrong. I still enjoyed it and I'd have it again. Maybe I'll get a custard or concrete next time. Plenty of seating inside, out front or on the side-garden looking area.",1,0,0

Shake shack is located right on the strip. No need to enter NYNY and search for it inside. The line was relatively short on a Saturday night around 10-11PM. I wanted to see the difference between shake shack burgers and in-n-out burgers. So far, in my opinion, in-n-out still has the best taste in burgers. BUT the fries at shake shack were far superior. Crunchy and didn't get that weird soggy texture like in-n-out fries. The SHAKES WERE SOOOO GOOD. Got the Chocolate cookies and cream. Def. a fan of their fries and shakes now.

I ordered a single Shack Burger with cheese and cheese fries.  The burger had really nice flavor and was cooked to my liking.  The burger was very small...that was one downside.  The cheese fries were okay.  If I ever visit again...I agree with another Yelper...order two burgers and skip the fries.  Milkshake and concrete weren't very special.

As far as the food, it was just ok for me. The flavor of the burger didn't live up to the hype. I felt that inn n out had more flavor. The fries with the cheese was good.

Shack Burger
--The buns were nice and soft. The medium (degree of doneness) beef pattie was really juicy and flavorful. There was a good amount of super gooey cheese too! I downed this burger before I moved onto the crinkle cut fries...

Cheese Fries 
--The cheese really makes a difference (my other friend also ordered the regular crinkle cut fries). This tastes like nacho fries. I wanted to keep eating more of these!!

Frozen Custard (Strawberry Cheesecake)
--The custard tasted like a combination of frozen yogurt and ice cream. It was intensely rich and creamy, but unfortunately a bit too sweet for my liking. I ate most of the pint since my friends were too full or didn't like this as much after we ate our burgers and fries.

Went last November, it was raining and cold so I'm not sure if that's why the place was a little empty around sunset time. Still a much easier experience than the West Hollywood place I'm stuck going to now since I live in California.

I'm a big fan of Shake Shack in general, and I wrote a more thorough review about the Hollywood location so I won't go in depth again. However when I was there they had the ShackMeister burger, which was similar to a regular ShackBurger except they had crispy, delicious fried shallots as a topping. It was so freaking good, it's a shame they don't offer that burger anymore (I don't currently see it on their online menu). Their crinkle cut fries are also excellent, and the layout of the restaurant is open, large and looks great.

Also great service. When I asked for a business card, the manager said they didn't have any but went to the back and gave us some free coupons instead! It was a great keepsake and a classy move from the management.

And how fitting of it to be located outside of NYNY on the Strip. It's hard to miss, all green and lit up. For such a popular 'Hot & New' place, it was surprisingly uncrowded and line-less at the register. Ah, the benefits of visiting Vegas when it's not peak season...

We ordered the ShackBurger, SmokeShack, fries, and milkshakes, which all was about 10 minute wait on the buzzers. My burger, the SmokeShack, was okay. I do love bacon on my burgers and theirs was good, but I felt that the peppers were overpowering and took away from the patty juice. Sidenote: is it me or does the water in Vegas have a funny aftertaste? Luckily we got milkshakes, which were okay--the chocolate was much better than their Smores custard of the week)--but cost just as much as the burgers. They did serve out crispy, good crinkle cut fries (which usually aren't my preferred style). 

Shake Shack Las Vegas wouldn't be my first choice to dine at on the Strip, but it was a decent visit when trying out the brand. I'm not quite on board with the price to quality ratio, though, so 3.5 stars for me.

Disclaimer: My guest from the UK convinced me to bump up my 3.5 to a 4, mostly because this was ""the best fast food burger I've ever had"" and we ended up going again the next day. I tried the ShackMeister Burger that time, which was much better. The crispy shallots were a nice compliment to a more balanced flavor on the burger.

If you mix the frozen custard and beer together to form a creamier drink, the flavors work well together. A more subtle stout that has more roasted coffee or dark chocolate flavor forward would work a little better. Otherwise, it was really good and reminded my hubby of his college days. Rating: 4.5\/5

SmokeShack is a cheeseburger topped with all-natural Applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and ShackSauce. The seasoned beef patty was grilled to perfection. The lettuce was crisp and the tomatoes were juicy. The onions were not overpowering and had a sweetness to them. The cherry pepper was a little intense but it had a good spicy kick. The bacon, however, was a little dry making it both tough and chewy. The bacon either needs to be thinner and crispier or thicker and fried a little less for a softer texture. Rating: 4\/5

Shack Stack is a cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger (crisp, fried portabella mushroom filled with melted Muenster and cheddar cheeses) topped with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce. If you like steak and mushrooms, this is the burger for you. The fried portabella mushroom added a crispy texture, but once you bit through, the mushroom was just juicy and oozing with melted cheese like a mushroom popper. The beef patty was juicy and beefy. The bun was brioche-like and held together to the last bite. Rating: 5\/5

Cheese Fries are topped with a special blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce. The fries were crispy and the crinkle cuts helped hold the cheese sauce on the fries. An addition of chili or bacon bits would be great options to add to the menu. Rating: 4.5\/5

All Shook Up Concrete is vanilla frozen custard, Gimme Some Sugar banana peanut butter cheesecake, and chocolate toffee. The vanilla custard is made on premises and made with real sugar and milk from hormone-free dairy farms. You definitely feel the presence of Elvis while eating this! All it needed was some bacon.

FYI: we came here twice before we left Vegas and on our last day, immediately after eating our Excalibur Buffet, we drove right over for our Burgers TO GO.

It was so good that my friends and I came back the next day and order food from here again haha. The location of this place is great ! We stayed at the Cosmo and the walk from there was probably about only 10 minutes. When we arrived there was no line and a lot of extra seats left (assuming everyone's going out to eat somewhere else or getting ready to hit the club) The first day we went I ordered their Shakeshack burger with their famous fries. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Its such a simple meal but forreal tho the burger was outstandingly amazing. Better than the average In-n-out everyone keeps saying is mouth watering every single time. I love their fries though their like a crinkle cut style that still is crispy yet soft on the inside. The Sunday we went to Shake Shack was actually REALLY BUSY. Like so busy there was a line outside and it was about 113 degrees out. Even with the fans blowing mist in your face I was sweating out alot. But dont fret ! The line goes by super quick and staff is always friendly and of service. This time I ordered the Shake Stack Shroom burger with crinkle cut fries and a peach lemonade. A little pricey....but hey, ITS VEGAS PEOPLE. but the shroom burger was worth it ! Its literally a burger with a mushroom\/cheesy filling with lettuce and tomato. Pretty filling because I couldn't finish it all. Since it was so busy, the seating situation was a little different than that Friday afternoon. (Probably because it was around 12pm for lunch time)  and we had a group of 9 but luckily there was 2 tables that got up next to each other so we were able to seat somewhat near each other. And i mentioned earlier that the employees here are nice and at service. I say this again because one of my friends accidentally dropped his tray of food all over the ground and literally nothing was saved from that and he brought the tray back and the employees replaced all his food free of charge and gave him an extra burger as well on top of what he ordered (THERYE SO KIND!) so A+++ for shake shack employees, 5 stars for the food and ambiance as well !

I went to the NY NY Hotel today to try Shake Shack and overall, I am rating the food a solid 3 star!

First of the location ambiance and feel of the place is 5 star. I like the location right on the strip, plenty of views to see all, and outdoor seating when it get's too busy!

Location - 5 Star - As above

Ambiance - 5 Star - As above

Menu and Choices - 5 Star - Check out their menu online or on the wall. It is great.

Service - 5 Star - You have a rather large menu on the wall or laminated menus to review your plethora of choices that can be amazing.  

Food - 3 star - We opted for a simple hamburger with cheese, a Shack Burger SIngle which comes with lettuce, tomato and their special sauce. and a Shack Stack with is a cheese burger with a crisp fried portobello mushroom filled with melted cheese, lettuce, tomato and their special sauce!  I had a big bite of the Shack Burger and it was alright.  tasted nice, however it was NOT mouth watering to me. It did not perk up my senses to say, ahhh, I have arrived.  I was also surprised at the rather small size of the burger itself.  For me my main meal was the Shack Stack with both the meat and the mushroom.  When you bite into this, a gusher of warm melted cheese will ooze out and that was really great.  I found it really hard to taste the mushroom as it was fried and I thought for the longest time I had the wrong order as i could only see the mushroom and not the hamburger itself. It was there, just very thin and nearly non-existent.  I give this a three star overall for the fact that there was nothing remarkable about either burger.

The Fries - 2 Star - Much has been said about their crinkle fries, and their cheese fries. I would say that the fries were cooked just right, and at the same time, I must NOT be a fan of crinkle fries because I found myself missing the small, thin, crispy fries that many other places serve.  The cheese fries were highly recommended and it felt like someone had melted simple sliced cheese on the fries. I mean, the cheese to me had a processed taste to it. I did not get it, but you can betcha it was darn decent as I ate the entire THING!

The Bouncer - 5 star - They have a greeter at the front to give you a menu and to give you a quick idea of what to get. I thought the greeters were both amazing and very friendly!  Keep it up!

Frozen Custard, Dogs, Concretes- I cannot comment as we did not order this or any of the concretes.  I will give this a 5 star because you know that when it warms up a bit, I am gonna go for the works on these puppies!

Cold Brew - 2 star - orderd the $4.75 Cold Brew, steeped and cold pressed iced coffee brewed and bottled in Brooklyn.  They serve it in a 10.5 oz bottle. Tasted like simply cold coffee and it came in a plastic cup with a lid. Definitely not a bottle, and definitely I did not say - ""Wow, how do you make that!""  Instead, I said ""Wow, glad I did not order that"".   OK, actually I did, however for my son. 

I will be going back, as I cannot ignore all the yelpers who rave about this place. I maybe just was expecting something different. However, for now, I just don't get it!",13,6,8

I had average expectations even though a friend hyped the sh*t out of Shake Shack to the point I was convinced he worked in their PR department. I was apprehensive about writing a review for Shake Shack because well, I just didn't care for it. Especially those super salty, crinkle cut fries that make me feel like I'm eating cafeteria food -remember those yucky Ore Ida fries? Or its overwhelming prices and lack of a salad option -YES, I do realize it's a BURGER place but at these prices and the fact they are closer to a restaurant than a fast food establishment, they could have at least one salad. I mean, even Jack in the Box has salads... Just think about it.

Ordered:
- ShackBurger - double cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce.

- Crinkle Cut Fries - cripsy, crunchy, salty potato-y goodness! (copied from their menu. Oh yes, they do mean salty.)

- Beer Float - beer with a scoop of ice cream. Pretty self explanatory haha.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for shelling out a few more dollars for a great, restaurant worthy burger (like at BurGR ;) but not at Shake Shack. Although their burger was good, it didn't WOW me. Neither did their ""oh so famous"" crinkle cut fries, or their beer float. And call me a snob, a B, or any other name because you're one of those die hard SS fans but at these prices, I expect to be WOW'ed or at least impressed.

But I'm not saying they don't make yummy food, because they obviously do which is why they're expanding; [it's just not for me]. I waited to read Kevin's response to the whole Shake Shack vs In-n-Out debate: http:\/\/www.thrillist.com\/eat\/nation\/shake-shack-vs-in-n-out-which-is-better-shake-shack-or-in-n-out  But I couldn't agree more with his points. I think if there's a next time, I'll stick to dessert only and maybe a Bag 'o' Bones for my puppy... that's if I get a puppy too lol!

Shake Shack is notorious for its lines, no matter the location, and this one is no different. The speed of the line, however, was absolutely abysmal. From my time getting in line to when I received my food, nearly an hour had passed. The employees behind the counter seemed to be in no rush to move the line along.
As for the food- it's Shake Shack. The burgers are tasty, the toppings fresh, and the milkshakes thick and flavorful. But for the price, a lot more is expected. So, I guess I was not disappointed in my visit, as I knew what to expect.

However, the past two years or so have seen one champion sit atop the burgery throne, wearing the crown that comes with the title of best burger chain restaurant. Bow down In n' Out, The Habit, Whataburger, Five Guys, and Umami, because Shake Shack, as of 2015, is your king. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Irrespective of the weather, the time of day, or how long you've been in Vegas (too long most likely), Shake Shack on the strip is nothing short of a beautiful oasis. The desserts and shakes in and of themselves are better than anything you can find elsewhere, and the burgers truly are the stuff of legend. Fortunately, these goods will come from the fast, efficient, and friendly hands of a shake shack staff that can burn through a 50 person line faster than nearly anywhere else I've been, and they'll do it with a smile on their faces. Seating? Abundant, and even if things are packed it's likely you'll be able to post up either inside or out. Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Shake Shack could, without a doubt, slap double digit Chipotle prices on their board and still make a killing, but even in Vegas, they don't. A single SmokeShack burger? $6.70. A hefty double? Still sub $10. Fries are reasonable, shakes are reasonable - everything is reasonable, and especially since it doesn't have to be, it's a beautiful thing because it's more than likely that you're not exactly here to spend the hoards of gold that you won at the casino. Star Granted.  

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

The burgers at Shake Shack are simple, and it's that simplicity that makes nailing down what makes them so good so frustrating. Is it the fluffy but oddly flavorful bun that so wonderfully absorbs the juices of the patty and cheese? It may well be. But then wait, is it the salty but flavorful perfectly cooked patty itself that pairs so beautifully with the bacon and truly out of this world chopped cherry peppers on the SmokeShack? Is it the simplicity of the fresh lettuce, tomatos, and cheese on the standard cheeseburger that make it such that you could down three without even slowing? I honestly and truly don't know the answer, but the burgers at Shake Shack are good almost beyond description. They're everything I've mentioned and even more given the classic but tasty fries and the exotic but equally classic milkshakes that will have you finding reprieve from the oppressive heat trapped within the strip. Shake Shack is perfect. Perfect. Dual Stars Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

Without question or hesitation - Shake Shack deserves all of the love and attention that they're getting, and the Vegas location is no different. This is the best chain burger out there. Star Granted.",5,2,3

Chicken shack was disappointing because the first time I tried it, it was super juicy and not overly fried. This time it was super breaded and fried, and the chicken was dry. It was a let down. 

Shack stack was great, I would say the best you can order. It's a meat patty with the shroom burger patty (fried portobello with cheese). It's filling and so good.

Our first try at about 2 pm on a Sunday made us turn around and go to Fatburger. The lines where crazy.  We decided to give it another try on a weekday and where there about 20 minutes before they even opened.  The manager came an opened up about 10 minutes early when he saw that there where people waiting.  Thats what i call customer service! 
In comparison we had to wait 20 min pass opening time last winter while we wanted to try Berlins Berlin Burger International. Quite a difference in customer service there so applause to Shake Shack.  

As this was our first visit after hearing all the rave reviews we did not want to go crazy but sticking to what made them famous. The burgers of course.  Had the double shackburger with pickles and cheese.  

All burgers here looks amazing and picture perfect. Biting in to it i noticed that it was very juicy even though they cook the burgers well done (i prefer medium rare if the meat is good).
The lettuce was crazy crisp and the tomato ripe. The Shack sauce is a 1000 island similar sauce and not that far from In n out's sauce.  The best thing about the burger was the amazing cheese that had melted and felt almost like a creamy cheese sauce.  One of the best burger cheeses ive had.  

What brings the burger down for me was the bread that i think is too thin and doesnt make the rest of the burger justice.  Still a solid great burger without any crazy stuff too it.  

The ambiance and layout of the restaurant is nice and the location on the middle of the strip outside NY NY is hard to beat.  

I would say that the burgers are a 4 star for me, the value is a 3.5 as its a bit more expensive then In N out while i would hold the latter a tad higher also in taste.  

The manager opening up 10 min  early bumps the place up though so without him i would have given Shake Shack a 4 star rating.  So enjoy your 5 star rating and give the manager a raise!",0,0,0

I initially heard about ShakeShack from friends that traveled to NYC, and basically it was described as a ""classier In & Out"" Burger.  haha, which may or may not be true.  They have different menu options, so that is what appeals to me.  As a Vegetarian I was thrilled by their SHROOMBURGER on the menu!!  It was nice to be able to have actual protein source instead of just getting to try fries & a milkshake like at other classic Burger Places.  Also, when I was there I ordered the CONCRETE-SHACK ATTACK with chocolate custard, chocolate truffle cookie dough, chunks of dark chocolate and plenty of chocolate sprinkles and fudge sauce!!  And naturally I ordered crinkle Cut french fries to accompany all this yumminess!

My hubby opted to by a pure Chocolate Milkshake as a classic, and a baseline to compare to other places.  He did think it was delicious, but after having a few tastes of my Concrete, I think he wished he would have opted for one of their specialties!  And, you can even design your own concrete, and pick the toppings to go in as well, so that is always an option if you don't want to try their Signature Concretes.

To be fair, in Vegas, there is not a shortage of burger places such as Gordon Ramsay, White Castle, Wahlburgers, Burger Bar, Fat Burger, In & Out etc.  And, I haven't been to a majority of those to be honest, so I can't really speak to what ShakeShack compares to.  But, I just figured that I'd trust New Yorker's... I figured they would know what is up with their New York-based fast Food Chain. ;-)  And, they have vegetarian choices, so that is even an extra bonus to me!!!",0,0,0

But the entire burger was still heaven in your mouth, hashtag foodgasm. I also had the cheese fries, which were amazingly cheesy, similar to the nacho cheese and way better than animal style fries (sorry , In & Out)!

My friend and I ordered their Shake Stack Burger, the most special part is the portobello mushroom, and regular fries. With the hype of this place burdening my mind I thought that this place was just A-OK. Don't get me wrong their burgers were tasteful (the mushroom was a very nice addition) and not too shabby at all; but I don't know if it's the West Coast side of me that will always love the taste of In-n-Out more. However, I did like that the burger felt toastier and 'softer' which was nice. The review on fries are that they are crinkly fries which is a nice change from our regular skinny\/steak\/curly fries but still ... just fries. I tried my friends cheese fries and I definitely thought that the cheese they used could've been cheesier both oozing texture wise, to the taste to intrigue my palate more.

This is a place that is hyped up by people who I can only guess are making a McDonalds comparison. Habit and In and Out are just as good if not better. Actually Habit has more offerings and seams fresher.

Fried hot dogs for $4? Gray Papaya in NYC 2 for $2 and blow these away. I had their loaded hot dog and you could barely eat it as it was so soggy after the first bite the toppings were on my plate. Was it tasty? I guess but again nothing ground breaking here. It was a simple hot dog.

It was fairly low cost for Vegas but there is no way I would go out of my way to find this place anywhere else.

Hambergers? Nothing special here at all not even the toppings. Bacon and cheese? Wendy's has had that for 20 years

Hot dogs? I guess creating a creative name like ""Flat Top"" let's you charge $4 for it. Nothing more then a hot dog. 

Fries? Remember those crinkle fries your Mom used to make instead of getting you the ones you wanted from McDonalds? Well here you have them.

Concrete? A poor replica of a Blizzard from DQ at 2xs the price.

People before you make claims about something being the best out there actually get out in the world and do some real world tasting.

We got the shake burger?, stack burger?, the other burger with the bacon (don't know the official name), three shakes, cheese fries, and regular fries. First off, for all of that? It cost $50, way too much for mediocre food. The hamburgers were very small, probably smaller if you made it at home. The hamburgers were just, ok. Nothing special to it. No, OMG ingredient, this is amazing. Fries were ok, they made our order to go so I had to dip my cheese :( shakes were good but I don't think you can mess up a shake.

Price: Look to spend probably $10\/pp if everyone is getting their own burger. Don't expect to pay in-n-out value.

Food:
We ordered the ShackBurger and their  krinkle fries and it was so bomb. The burger was flavorful and the fries had just the right crunch

Service: Long line but it goes fast.

Overall, I've heard so much comparison between shake shack and in-n-out but I don't think they are comparable in that in-n-out is more fasfood-ish than shake shack and therefore, you're paying a lot less. In terms of comparison of deliciousness between the burger and fries between both, I can't decide! I probably have to try shake shack again.",1,0,1

This place in my opinion had wayyyyy to much hype associated with it. Seeing what the hype was about I decided to try it with a few friends...I originally wanted the ShackMeister Burger as I heard it was the burger on their secret menu to try but they sold out of it...so if you actually do read this review keep in mind I didn't have their best item on their menu...that's like going to In-N-Out and not having the option to order Animal Style...

I ordered: 

Shack Burger - IMO the best burger out of the two that I tried...tasted fresh but god damn them buns were heavy that Sir-Mix-A-Lot would fuck with them...

Smoke Shack - sounded good, looked good, however left underwhelmed as the mixture of cheese, cherry peppers and bacon tasted borderline fake...no idea but it wasn't just my tastebuds that were fooled as everyone ordered the same burger at the table....

Shack-cago Dog - Basically a Chicago dog that was decent

Crinkle Cut Fries - Nice break from regular fries....

Jackpot Concrete - I love frozen custard....the Jackpot has Belgian Waffles and many toppings you would put on Belgian Waffles....I fucks with this 

I don't usually provide a whole lot of weight on service in my reviews but let me be clear...the service to Shake Shack was fuckin incredible and they make sure to take care of you it's just that with other options in this city the food fell short imo...",0,0,0

Although the Shake Shack doesn't necessarily qualify as ""fast food"" (it's more appropriately kinda fast, like 5 mph over the speed limit in the middle lane fast), that's the only real issue one might have waiting at Shake Shack for their burger while thinking they're in a fast-food joint.  All their concerns will melt away when they see that Shake Shack whips em' up fresh for your mouth and in a masterful fashion: super hot, greasy and artfully covered in melted American cheese.

I had a SmokeShack burger which had Applewood smoked bacon and ShakeSauce on it. Sinking my teeth into that baby was my favorite vice in a city full of sin.  If you think you won't be satisfied with just the SmokeShack burger -- or any burger for that matter -- you can get a double of any burger on the Shake Shack menu.

I was trying to find the right words to say because people are going crazy over this. I just needed time to sort out my thoughts so don't kill me but I must be true to myself...

I prefer In and Out over Shake Shack. THERE! I said it! So much has lifted off my shoulders. PHEW!

Now let me explain- it's not a horrible place but if you put a gun to my head- yeah- I said it....I pref in and out. One major thing is the bun.  It feels and taste like a Hawaiian roll.  If you're into that- then this is the place for you.  Me, on the other hand, I like em soft but NOT sweet.  I always get my buns extra toasty at In and Out and this was soft and I could imagine it soggy iN .2 seconds. It was the type of bun that would get in the nooks and crannies of your teeth and you wouldn't even know it but when you turn to your friends or boo, there would be white chewed up bun pieces in the interproximal of 6 or more places. 

Fries with crinkled- reminded me of middle school and that's where it's gonna stay. The cheese dried immediately and made all of them stick together. Flavorless.

The loaded fries are really just three single servings with cheese, bacon and the peppers. Totally skip them and just get normal fries. They got soggy quick. 

The Shack Attack concrete came out liquid. I now today is hot but it's like I am spooning a shake. It wasn't mixed well either so the bits were all clumped into one monster piece. Flavor was great though.

The line moved quickly and my friends and I got our food fast. I ordered a shackburger and regular fries for a complete meal, and it came out to around $7.  

Shackburger: a simple burger with lettuce, tomato, cheese and shack sauce (tasted like it was mustard based); it was pretty small but it had a good flavor. I could tell they also buttered their buns because there was an extra fat component to it. 
Fries: the fries were crispy and crinkle cut, and they were good simple fries, but nothing special.

The cashier who took my order, Donna, could probably tell I had never been there. She was extremely helpful, friendly and even though there was a super long line behind me she was incredibly friendly and full of smiles. She helped me with my order and i have to admit she started off my experience quite well. 

The food itself was pretty good. I tried the shroom burger and it was definitely full of mushrooms. The sauce they put on the burger is very tasty and adds to the burger. We also ordered the bacon burger and it had tons of bacon. They have so many different flavors of shakes. I got a strawberry and it was delicious!!! Not too thick but not too thin..just right. 

Only thing that didn't make it a 5 star visit was that there was no place to sit (inside or outside).

The first time I ever went, I knew it would be trendy and I had some expectations. The first thing that caught my eye was the branding. Their branding is everything, and 3 years ago something like that really does set a business apart from the rest. To me, it shows they are passionate and care enough to have their business be different yet up to date. Their brand is cohesive and I can tell just by looking at it that is Shake Shack.

I ordered a Smoke Shack because bacon, fries, and a plain chocolate shake. I don't normally order anything dairy since I can't have it, but I was feeling rebellious. The sauce is amazing, the toppings are perfect, the bun is only cut 3\/4 of the way so the stuff inside doesn't fall out as easily, the burger is an actual beef patty which I am picky about, and the fries were the perfect balance of fried but baked and not overly greasy. I didnt eat more than a few bites of the Shake, but it was also amazing. 

Since that visit, I have had pretty much their entire menu except for the hot dogs, and I am nothing but impressed. I can order anything and know I am getting something delicious. The first time I had their chicken sandwich it rocked my world. I know will switch off between the burger and the chicken sandwich since I can't pick a favorite. 

I wish I had more to contribute as far as shakes go, but I've heard to always go with the concrete shakes since they have the best consistency. I also know that each location has their own specialty Shake. 

Bottom line, you are a fool if you don't make a trip if you have one close in your travels.",0,0,2

I don't really get the comparison with in n out and while looking at other reviews, it seems as that is the case... While in n out is good, I don't think there is much to compare... 

Both establishments make a decent ""plain"" burger... I do think that the shake shack patties have a little more flavor than in n outs... Also, in n out fries taste like cardboard, idk how anyone could like those... Shake shack crinkly fries are good and so I guess that's where my comparisons end... In my opinion, I would rather hit up shake shack then get in n out... 

But enough about that...

I had the single Shackburger which comes standard with lettuce, tomato, and shake sauce... I also had an order of fries and the meal was good! 

The size of the single Shackburger is a little on the small side so with that said, next time I would go for the Double... They're small but not White Castle small...

Although there are many great food critics and blogs out there who have many opinions on this battle and each burger, I've decided to also throw my hat in the ring. Granted no one asked for a review, but I've proactively decided to give one.

What Shake Shack deserves a 5 star for is their Smoke Shack Burger and their Frozen Custard. The Smoke Shack burger is an amazing burger that doesn't just rival In N Out because In N Out has chosen to go the simple burger route. It's not a bad thing though. The burger is so moist and delicious with a bun that perfectly fits with the burger. Nothing is worse than a burger with a thick bun that sticks out like a sore thumb. It's like you're eating bread with a side of meat rather than a cohesive burger. Thankfully, Shake Shack and In N Out both do well with their buns.

As for their fries, they're very average. The are the same type of frozen crinkle cut fries that you buy at the store. The cheese fries isn't great either. It's practically nacho cheese. But even though they lack a bit on their fry game, In N Out is in a similar boat. Some people may disagree, but In N Out's fries are very mediocre as well. You can get it special ways by asking well done, but even still neither compare to a nice McDonald's fry.

So with all that, on the regular, I'd probably choose In N Out, but Shake Shack makes a valiant effort. It's a great option for when I want In N Out but with a bit more of a twist. But first it needs to become easier to access in Los Angeles.",0,0,1

This location is on par with all the shakes I've had at their NYC locations so huge thumbs up there!

Only complaint is that this is the busiest Shake Shake that I've ever been to which says a lot since they're all busy no matter which location you go to. We were hoping to go through the line outside that only sold shakes & malts, but we could tell the longer line inside was actually moving more quickly. What we didn't realize is that we'd have to wait longer for our order to be called in that line since it'd be competing with people getting full meals. Oh well. 

But in the end, yes. Their shakes are still amazing. I won't compare the food to In-N-Out because they're just different. Just keep that in mind. In-N-Out does their thing. Shake Shake does theirs. Why can't you just enjoy both equally? I know I do!",1,1,1

I heard about this place through some East Coast youtubers who rave about it and knew they had one in Vegas so I hyped it up to my friends and made us walk all the way across the strip to get here (near New York- New York). The exterior building is pretty cool and when we got there it was late lunch but there was a decent line that went by pretty fast. We waited about 5ish minutes in line before we could order, which wasn't bad. 

I ordered the original shake burger (I think that's what it's called?) a regular cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato with their supposed shake sauce. I also got fries to share with my friend. We grabbed a wooden table in which I appreciated the decor and waited for our food via an electric beeper. Didn't take long before our group got our order.

Honestly, when I got the plate I felt a little underwhelmed. I expected so much and it looked like a small, regular cheeseburger. Now I must admit that the meat is juicy itself and was well made compared to the likes of In-N-Out, however it was just so small for the amount that it was that I just couldn't justify it. I could barely taste the shake sauce and even began wondering if there were any in my burger. I finished it in no time and started on the fries, which I must admit was pretty good. But that doesn't make up for the fact that the cheeseburger was just so...ordinary.

Fries - Probably the best fast food fries that ever existed.  Super Duper use to be good and maybe it's the locations that I've visited recently but the fries are not crispy and super greasy.  Shake Shack however, has the perfect texture, taste, seasoning, crisp factor, and I did not feel guilty afterwards, well I never do.  
Black & White (Vanilla ice cream with drizzled fudge) milkshake - its hard to make milkshakes with the right consistency.  I was sucking pretty hard, my cheeks were starting to ache.  After letting it sit and melt for a bit, it did the job but I wasn't satisfied.

Also, my sister highly recommended it since she tried it when she went to Vegas several weeks before I went.  It's located in the New York, New York hotel.  I was staying at the Monte Carlo like right next door to NY NY, so I was able to visit this place several times, since it was close by.  

I loved the burgers!  It was just so tasty, especially the meat patty.  The Shake sauce tasted good.  The veggies in the burgers were cut thick and fresh!  The crinkle cut fries were good too.  I also tried the Cookies N' Chocolatey Cream (special flavor) custard in a cone-that was so good!  You can check the website to see the calendar to preview what upcoming special flavors there will be.  They have different special flavors every week.

It is a bit pricey in my opinion (almost $15 for a burger, fries and a soft drink), but it is located in Vegas, so everything in Vegas is expensive.  They don't have combo meals, you buy everything seperately.  They serve alcohol (beer & wine) here, but I didn't try it because I was already buzzed by the time I came here late at night. 

I've passed by this location several times and I've seen lines out the door.  But luckily, during the times when I went, there was no lines, and we didn't have to wait very long for the orders.  They will give you a pager and buzz you when your order is ready.  Customer service was really good-since it was my first time, they explained about the different items they offered.

I ordered fries & the Shackburger - their original cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce, which was much pricier than a cheeseburger at In-N-Out ($5.19 vs. $2.55). The Shackburger is satisfying and definitely worth a try if you're looking for a hyped up burger joint from the East Coast. However, there was nothing spectacular about it. Don't get me wrong, the burger was tasty, but quite plain. On the other hand, the crinkle cut fries reminded me of the frozen ones you could purchase at a grocery store.

Fries were ok - it sort of reminded me of Ore-Ida fries that come from the freezer, but it was just ok.  The shakes were pretty good too.  Pricing of the burgers were decently priced.  I think the fries were expensive for what it was.  The way it works is that you order from the counter.  You're given a notifier for your order.  Once it's ready, you pick up your food at the counter.  Dining area was clean.  There are LCD TVs throughout airing sports.  All in all, great burger.  I'll be back.

Given the location, you would figure they would be open late.  On the weekends, they're open until 2am.  Sunday through Thursday, they close at midnight.  You're on the Strip!!!  We just came out of a Cirque show around 1100pm.  By the time, we got out of Mandalay Bay, it was about 11:45pm and was sad to find out Shake Shack closed at Midnight.  Bummer.

Although this place is probably considered fast food, the quality is  just as good as a sit down restaurant.

Shroom Burger: 
This is the vegetarian burger. The meat is replaced by a portobello mushroom, with  some added cheese, the entire thing is then battered and fried until it is crispy. Mmm Mmm GOOD! I am a sucker for fried stuff and this place does it right. The outside of the mushroom was super crispy but not  super oily which is slightly better for my health.  If you decide to try this, BEWARE of the hot cheese when biting into the burger, because that stuff seriously burns!

Fries: 
I am a sucker for thin crunchy fries, unfortunately shake shack's version is crinkle fry which has more potato. I was not very impressed with this, but in this case it was based on a personal preference. 

Frozen Custard:
I got a chance to sample a spoonful of my friend's frozen custard flavors. One of them got the vanilla and it was pretty good, definitely tasted better than the Wendy's freezie. Whereas, another person got the S'more's flavor. This was just alright in my eyes because it was just all chocoate and graham cracker crumbs on top. Personally, I liked the vanilla more out of the two.

Final Verdict: 
This is the first time that I have eaten something like the Shroom Burger, so unless I can find a better variation of it than I will keep coming back!",4,1,2

We tried that and also the Mushroom burger. Let's not forget the crinkle fries and the shakes here are just as popular amongst the crowds. Oh yeah, this place closes at 2am so it's pretty much busy all day long. 

The regular burger is cooked thin and I would say medium rare. I thought it was good, but not great because I like a little char on the edges of the burger and I didn't get that. As for the fries, they reminded me like the cafeteria fries you get while in grade school. I'm sure Ore-Ida sells those in the freezer aisle as well. 

However, what won me over was the 'Shroom burger that deceivingly looks like an onion ring but when you bite into it, cheese oozes out and it was also crispy on the outside. Terrific burger with their potato bun. The shakes here are awesome, they taste just like ice cream and the lady over the counter made cookies and cream just for us. Like a secret menu kind of thing. 

Overall, food is good. The wait can be long for food (We waited 15 minutes longer than most people because we wanted unsalted fries).  The bathroom and tables were in dire need of a cleanup at 7pm. I basically had to clean a water spill at the only table I can get. They do have those wipes by the trash\/ketchup condiment station in which you can clean yourself as well. 
So I probably wouldn't come back due to the wait but you can also DL their app so you can have it slightly quicker. The interior and music had this club like feel and the 4 different lemonades here are nice addition to the menu.",5,3,5

The atmosphere of the restaurant was pretty laid back, it was packed and seemed to be a mix of locals and tourists. I ordered a standard burger but asked for it well done, which they got perfectly right, even putting a well done sticker it. The burger was delicious, fresh, the toppings were fresh as well and the bun was buttery and complimented the burger nicely. I also got a ""concrete""which is a custard with two mix ins, chocolate toffee and chocolate truffle cookie dough. Unfortunately, the cashier must've messed it up and instead of truffle cookie dough I had some unidentifiable and not pleasing topping instead. Despite that mix up, the vanilla custard I could taste was absolutely incredible, the best custard I've ever had, so rich and flavorful!

- SmokeShack
- Fries

It took my second trip to Shake Shack before I could give a fair review of their burgers. 

On a previous trip I had tried their Shack Burger and that I thought was rather a let down. 

This time around I came in starving and went straight for the double SmokeShack and fries. The SmokeShack comes with smoked bacon, cheese, two patties, and shack sauce. 

While the burger was good, I feel it could benefit from some lettuce, tomatoes and pickles to cut the richness of all that cheese and protein. I confirmed that their but remains lackluster in my honest opinion. The buns would make the burger better if it were toasted. 

The fries were also just ok. They seem like your ordinary crinkle cut fries (similar to Del Taco's) and didn't leave me feeling they were spectacular. While they are good, I would say they are just average.

Don't get me wrong, you can taste the quality of the ingredients but you MUST order the Shack Stack to experience Shake Shack's fullest potential. To complete the experience, the crinkle cut fries and a shake must be added to make this even more satisfying!

The breaded mushroom filled with cheese stuck inside the burger is absolute heaven. The cheese oozes out as you bite into it. The combination of what's inside compliments each other magically.

The crinkle cut fries are cooked to perfect and the shakes are thick and creamy. The person ahead of us recommended we didn't share the shake as we had planned (I wanted to cut calories) and we are glad we didn't.

I think the burger was $5.99 and a double is not much more. I have had one of each and both were great although the bun to meat\/cheese ratio is better with the single. The most expensive part imo were the fries and drinks, but definitely worth getting to complete the meal. If I had to describe the burger, I would say it resembles a slightly smaller Ruby's Cheeseburger. You know, tastes like it was fried in butter or something. Whatever it is, it tastes great. Note that it's a different style burger than In-N-Out, which is amazing in its own right. Fries were crinkle cut like Del Taco, but they were better, more crispy I would say. Shakes were good too, not as good as a Ruby's shake but you wont be disappointed with the purchase.  I went twice on my last 2.5 day visit to Vegas, it was that good. In closing, this is an amazing food choice for a quick meal if you have other plans for the night. 

I did not get a beer here, but they have above average choices (craft) if you need to re-energize your drunken state of mind. 

Customer service was great too; the cashiers and food attendants were nice both times.

Location is right outside NY NY Casino, which is perfect for me as I hang out in the MGM - Bellagio region of the strip. 

My exact meal that the review referenced was just a plain meat and cheese only burger, one time a double and the other time a single. Fries, and a Neapolitan shake were also ordered. My only complaint is they charge extra to mix flavors on the shake, which is ridiculous.

Service at this location is great, although there was a huge line to order, they had a huge menu on the wall, which made that line move a lot quicker.

For my meal, I got the shake burger, with loaded fries, and the scrimshaw to wash it down with.  He burger is decent, rather small, but tasted good.  It's served with a potato bun which makes it different in a way. In no way does it taste better than the double double at in n out though.  The loaded fries on the other hand were really good.  They had chopped up peppers, bacon, and cheese on it.  This is a huge serving, for 2-3 people, but I had it on my own, but didn't finish it.

I liked that there was just the right amount of everything so that nothing was dripping or falling out.  Everything was just perfection - not too greasy, not too dry, not soggy.  The veggies they use are fresh and nothing beats hot, perfectly salted crinkle fries.  My husband had the portabello mushroom burger which interestingly, was a batter and fried portabello that is stuffed with oozing cheddar cheese.  Although it's the vegetarian option, it's not as healthy as most vegetarian choices in other establishments.  You can add this oozing portabello mushroom to any burger on the menu.  It's definitely different and I've never seen anything like it before, but one bite was enough for me.  It's very rich. 

If you have any room left after devouring your tasty burger and fries, be sure to try the frozen custard.  We ordered a ""concrete"" to share which had peanut butter, toffee, chocolate and bananas in it.  It was so creamy and so smooth and most importantly, so sinfully delicious!  

We didn't order any shakes, which is absolute blasphemy at a place known for and named SHAKE shack, but I had two more days left in Vegas!  I'm a light packer and my only pair of jeans that I brought with me had to be able to zipper up for two more days!  This just gives me an excuse to revisit Shake Shack the next time we are in Vegas.  

The ambiance here is bright, fun, and modern.  The tables were handmade in Brooklyn (the original Shake Shack is famous in NY) from reclaimed wood that was a bowling lane in it's past life. I appreciate detailed touches like that.  We happened to go on the night of the Grammy's and we sat in our booth while eating and enjoying the Grammy's on the Big Screen in the middle of Shake Shack.  Needless to say, I have never had a better experience with food and ambiance in a burger joint than I did at Shake Shack.  Thanks brother, for leading me in the right direction, yet again!",1,1,1

Located at NYNY, but actually outside of the casino, the outside of the restaurant is visually appealing, and draws the eye. Once inside you get immediately wrangled into a queue in front of their large menu board. This is nice as you can decide what you want while you wait in line.

I got a single ShackBurger with everything ($5.19), my husband got a double ($7.99). Note, this is just the burger, doesn't even come with fries or a drink. Maybe I'd be OK with the jacked up price - if the burgers were not BABY-SIZED. Seriously, they're tiny. Ya, they're good, the taste is awesome. Yes, very well cooked, but STILL. And yes, I know it's jacked up strip pricing. Still don't care.

Also got the black and white shake (small) and a large Fat Tire that came with a plastic souvenir cup, and a bottle of water

All in all, two people, for dinner at a fast-casual place ended up being $36.98. Yes, almost $40. We could have actually had a sit down meal for that much.

Smokeshack - I'm so glad I ordered a double because they are small greaseballs! The bacon could have been crispier. The brioche bun was a nice touch but was soaking in the burger grease. It was a good burger, not great. I would equate it to a burger at Wendy's. 

Cheese fries - the cheese was semi cold by the time I got my order.

The app seems to be automatic when it sends you the text about your order being ready at the time that you picked for pick up. The restaurant is so busy that your meal probably isn't ready, but they'll prioritize your order if you go inquire about the pick up.

Well, first off, it's definitely NOT a shack...but it's Vegas, so what do you expect?   It's a big huge restaurant on the strip; should be called ""Shake Palace, the Shake Shack's big brother out west."" Anyway, one thing to note is that you cannot access it from the New York New York hotel and casino; you have to be ON Las Vegas blvd to get there, but that's not a problem. So if you're parking you can park at either Ny ny or Monte Carlo, I think it'd be the same distance.

Burgers...same as the shake shack out east; flavorful burgers, a little on the smaller side when compared to the likes of in n out, but definitely tasty and you get more options than the former.  Any burger is good, esp the spicy ones, I usually go for two different types of single stacks, a regular and one of the other types and of course a hand-spun shake. And this being Vegas, we here have the option of alcoholic beverages with one's burger, always a plus.  

Service staff, was good and friendly and they try to keep the line goin, but the place can get rather crowded and it's hard to find a table sometimes, so you'll have to find the best non-peak time to go. 

BUT...as Vegas goes, you gave a ton of better options, so I would come here if I had a big craving for a shake, and if it wasn't busy and I was already close by. Otherwise, I would rather go to a Vegas Buffet or somewhere else...when in Rome...",1,0,0

We're from California so everyone knows the West Coast favorite is In and Out. The first thing I noticed was Shake Shack's larger menu. They have singles and doubles like In and Out but they also offer chicken, hotdogs and a family favorite- crinkle fries. They also have a variety of shakes and custards.

Now for the great debate. All of the food was good. The burger was warm, flavorful, slightly greasy, served with lettuce, tomato and shack sauce between soft buns. Did I like it?  Yes. Was it better than In and Out? In my opinion no. It's personal preference really. I've just been spoiled by large stacked burgers, toasted buns and large slices of fresh lettuce, onion, tomato and In and Out sauce. Would I eat Shake Shack again- heck yea! Shake Shack's fries are better than In and Outs, I loved their crisp crinkle fries topped with cheese. Their chocolate milkshake was thick with just the right amount of sweetness.

They were delicious, but technically that incident doesn't count as my ""first time"" having Shake Shack, so fast forward to a couple of months later when I visited Vegas with family and friends. Immediately upon checking into my hotel, I asked where the Shake Shack was and they happily told me it was right across from our hotel! To sum it up, I pretty much had Shake Shack every day during my short vacation. Oh, and I guess I should note that I am from the West Coast, so I will be making comparisons to In N Out.

Shack Burger 
This is heaven in between two buns! From their website, 100% all-natural Angus Beef with no hormones and no antibiotics cooked medium unless otherwise requested. I opted for a single, which is your standard cheeseburger with tomato, lettuce, and Shack Sauce and was pleasantly full every time I had it! I also had it bacon ($1.55) but I prefer the cheeseburger without it! The burgers aren't cheap though at $5.19 for a single and a whopping $7.99 for a double - both more expensive than an In N Out meal. A tough one, but I prefer Shake Shack Burgers over In N Out.

Fries
I love crinkle cut fries simply because they are reminiscent of my childhood hot lunches. Shake Shack fries, however, are definitely not your standard childhood lunch fries! These are perfectly crispy, golden, morsels of piping hot potatoes with a slight crunch with every bite. $2.95 will get you a nice tray of them! I also had them with cheese aka cheese fries, but I prefer them plain. Shake Shack fries over In N Out fries any day!

Frozen Custard
I read somewhere that Shake Shack was known for their custards, since I guess custards are more of an East Coast thing? I don't know. All I know is that the shakes at Shake Shack are pretty darn delicious! I had the standard vanilla and strawberry, which were good, but if you want that extra kick of sugar, definitely try the caramel because it was literally my favorite one out of the three I tried! Shake Shack shakes over In N Out shakes, ONLY because they have a caramel flavor.

Floats
My sister opted for all three floats (not all at the same time, of course!) and my favorite was the root beer as I found that the Purple Cow (grape flavored soda) and Creamsicle (orange flavored soda) tasted too artificial. Unfortunately, I didn't think this was a stand out item as I found it had too much soda and not enough custard! In N Out over Shake Shack floats, even though In N Out only has 1 float and it's on the secret menu.

Things I wish I tried
I wish I had tried other things on the menu like the Concretes, the Beer Floats, and of course the wine, but my time and belly wouldn't allow it.

For reference, 7 people each ordering a ""meal"" (burger, fries, shake) was close to $100. 7 people ordering a meal at In N out will be around $40, which is obviously a fraction of the price! Shake Shack, I wish you had a location in SF, however, your prices are just too much for me. I will be visiting whenever I go to Vegas, though!",1,0,0

The place has Vegetarian options like the Shroom Burger. The place is always packed since it is right on the strip. When we walked in there was a long line. However, there were plenty of cashiers so it went by pretty quickly. You have a huge menu to look at while you are in line, so you can explore and really think about what you want to order. It is not convenient to get to. When you park in the NY NY parking garage, it is a pretty long walk, which is the reason for me putting only 4-stars. 

Service: It was good. The interactions with the workers are fairly short. The woman who took our order was nice. She was patient with us as we asked many questions about the menu and her opinion on the food. You pick up the food after your buzzer goes off. You grab your own condiments, napkins, drinks, and utensils. The cashiers are the ones grab the beer for you. If you want to stop by only for the custard, I recommend waiting in the short line outside. There is an express window for the custard. 

Ambiance: The place is loud. Sometimes you will encounter drunk folks coming here. Just ignore them. It is great for kids since they can be as loud as they want. There is outside seating as well. The set up is organized. The place looks clean. I would have someone grab a table right when you walk in. They get taken up pretty fast! 

Food: Delicious. I got the Shack Stack, cheeseburger with the Shroom Burger combined. It is SOOO GOOD! I would never want to eat another burger unless it has the fried portobello mushroom in it. lol We also got the fries, which were meh. They were fries. Nothing epic or special. For dessert, we got the custard with red velvet mix in it. This is very good and I highly recommend it. 

Price: Fairly priced. I would say it is around $15 a person. 

Drinks: Any alcohol you buy on the strip is overpriced. The soda drinks are decently priced at around $2. That is the average for this area.

It did come with a pepper on there that I swear was hotter than a jalapeño but still good! 

The ambiance of the restaurant is very hipster and modern.. The lines are always long BUT it goes by fast since they have about 4 cashiers working at once taking orders. Great place!",0,0,1

In-n-out weighing in at about $2-3 each vs. Shake Shack weighing at about $5-9

So this is a review for Shake Shack but let me give you a little comparison...
In-n-out:
--Mouthwatering? Yes. Both burgers and fries.
--Variety? Not really, but easily customizable.
--Shakes? Good. Nothing special.
--Line? Yes. Always but eh...it comes with the price of good food.
--Price? Yes. Post grad student friendly.

Shake Shack:
--Mouthwatering? Yes. Burgers and cheese fries are yum!
--Variety? Yes. From different burgers to hot dogs to shakes to fries and even for your dog friend. Great selection for everyone!
--Shakes? Good. Small though for what I'm paying for. Nothing to die for
--Line? Very long line. But it moves VERY fast so don't be turned down
--Price? Yeah...definitely on the pricey side...borderline not sure it's worth the price? 

Overall...I think I'm going to end up going to In-n-out more. But yes, I am a fan! I personally loved the Shack Stack the most. Very filling and flavorful. You're paying for a good meal. Cheese fries are also a delicious and worth. It certainly does live up to the hype, my wallet just might not survive if I come back too often.

Also, there's big screens right by the pick up area. You won't have to miss out on a single game going on ;)",1,2,0

Let's start with the location space.  Well done, well done.  A well designed space with plenty of room.  Top notch materials and abundant light.

To order was easy enough.  Tell them what you want and they help you out if needed.

Food.
Single basic Cheeseburger.  Now, everything tasted as it should.  Fresh, well cooked and properly handled.  For me, when all put together, it has an off flavor that I just can't wrap my head around.  And the burger is a lot smaller than I expected.  But no deductions for that.

Cheese Fries.  These were good.  No complaints here.

Peanut Butter Shake.  Very, very good.

1. This location is much larger than any we've ever been to. The original Shack Shack in Flatiron is merely a stand in the middle of Madison Square Park. Meanwhile, the Vegas restaurant offers plenty of seating and a large TV that broadcasts ongoing sports games. 

2. The lines move quickly. 

3. Customer service is unmatched. After placing our order and seeing a customer heartily enjoying her double shack burger, I immediately regretted my decision of getting a single shack burger. We asked one of the staff members, Diana, if there was a remote possibility of upgrading our burger to a double patty. She went above and beyond by heading straight to the kitchen to change our orders at no cost to us - even though we insisted that we were willing to pay extra. After we received our burgers, she followed up with us to verify that our orders came out correctly. 

4. The food was consistent. The burgers, fries, and custard were on point, as usual.

I've heard good things about this place from my cousins who have been to the one in NY.

So for weeks I've been highly anticipating this meal when I touched down in Vegas.
Day 2 of our trip, we trekked down the strip from our hotel to get there for the opening at 11a.
Smart choice as soon after we found a table, the place filled up within 20 minutes. 

As a true burger connoisseur, I always go for the 2 patties or more. 
Smokestack was my choice of burger. Cheese, meat, bacon: How can you go wrong?
I was happy with my decision as the burger was juicy and full of flavor. 
The only problem was with my big mouth (literally & figuratively) I devoured the burger in about 5 bites. 

I regret not ordering another one as I was not completely full. The crinkle cut fries tasted better than I expected given my position regarding crinkle cut.

The jackpot was a jackpot of a dessert. The waffle bites were an interesting element into the frozen concoction. The strawberry puree and cookie dough bites in the vanilla custard all worked in harmony. I didn't care for the sprinkles. For a double, I found the size of the dessert to be rather small (words that have never been said to me in the bedroom). 

Bottom Line: This is better than 5 Guys, The Habit, Smashburger, Fatburger, In & Out and almost any burger chain I've tried. If your in the area, check out this burger joint.",1,3,2

Within my 6 day stay in Vegas, I had two meals at Shake Shack. During the first visit, I tried the Shack Attack - It satisfied every craving at 1AM after just getting off the plane. The condiments table was surprisingly clean and organized, there was no mess to be seen as opposed to other fast food chains. 

My second visit was a bit underwhelming, which was why I did not rate them a 5 star. This is because I tried their hot dog instead of sticking with the burger. I think I had a better hot dog from a street vendor... but the crinkly fries kept me satisfied!

-1 star for the price. This place is freaking expensive for a tiny burger. I can pay the same amount and a little bit more for a gourmet burger at a restaurant. 

-1 star for the presentation. The Chick'n Shack looked like a McChicken from MickeyDs which I can get for $2. I paid $6 for this. 

-1 star for the taste. The burger doesn't taste as fresh as it looks on the pictures. The ingredients seems to be lacking.

We were in the first row to the door outside, but the line went by pretty quickly (10 mins or so).  That was about the only thing that was quick about this place... 

We ordered 2 shack burgers, fries, and a strawberry lemonade.  Total came out to about $17 or so?  We went to sit down with our pager and......20 minutes later, we FINALLY got our food.  You would think with all the people there, they would be a little quicker and just have burgers on the grill nonstop.  I thought going to In-n-out was bad...this place is worse -_-.

We finally got buzzed, and the guy was totally confused with the orders.  He took one persons buzzer, and then my buzzer...and then someone elses buzzer.... and then.....didnt know whos order was whos.  This added to my frustration for the food taking so long.

There is only one way in and out of that area....and you constantly have people going in and out to get their food\/drinks\/exit.  

Food was alright...burgers were pretty small compared to other places.  The patty itself was salty.  Fries were good, but hard to mess up on that.  Lemonde was good!

Hearing all the rave reviews from friends, it was on the top of my Must-Eat-List on a recent trip to Las Vegas.

Conveniently located outside the New York New York Hotel and Casino, Shake Shack is known for their long lines.  As we waited, my dad was in awe of why all these people would wait and laughed that it was just a burger.  But then he had his first ShackBurger.  He admitted that it was very good and that the sauce really set it apart.  I totally agreed.

While the burger is on the small side (I could easily eat two!), it is made from 100% all-natural Angus beef and cooked to medium (unless you request otherwise, but don't you dare!).  I absolutely loved the soft potato roll it's served on.  The crinkle cut fries were delicious as well.  Didn't try a shake, but saving that for next time.  Definitely worth the wait at least once in your life!",4,0,5

It had to have been over 8 years ago when I lived in NYC... and the only thing memorable was the long ass line I had to wait on to get my food.

So when I saw that there was one that opened up in Vegas, I was pretty stoked.  I told my boyfriend that we'll go after a few weeks, for them to work out any kinks they may have in the beginning.  

So we went the other day (a month after opening).  It's located outside of the New York New York Casino and the entrance is outside so you have to exit the casino to get to it.  We were greeted by someone who gave us a menu to look at while we waited on line to order.  Although the line was long, it moved pretty quickly.

I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, no bun, cheese fries, single chocolate concrete with strawberry puree and my boyfriend ordered a chocolate milkshake.  We easily got a table and waited for our food.  It came out within 7 minutes and I was ready to dig in.

I was extremely surprised at how non-greasy the burger was.  I had it wrapped in lettuce and usually it gets quite messy but not the Shake Shack burger!  I was really impressed with their Angus meat blend!

So onto the fries... the cheese blend is their own blend and the color looks a little off because it's a little whiteish in certain areas.  But let me tell you, it is a great blend and the fries were nice and crisp!  I usually don't like crinkle cut fries but I will eat SS's any day!  I mean, I couldn't believe how each one was so crispy and I usually don't like crispy fries.  I'm still daydreaming of their fries till this day!

The concrete melted a bit since I didn't want to stand in line again and order dessert after I finished my meal so I had ordered it with the meal... it was pretty good but not something I've been craving... (like the fries)

My boyfriend said his milkshake was very good and he would go back for it.  

There's also a couple of employees that goes around cleaning tables, making sure everyone is happy and has everything they need.  

Man, I still can't believe that burger hardly had any grease!  I am just blown away!  haha

Going to make another trip soon... need to get my fries craving fixed!",3,1,1

I agree with others when they say it's not comparable to in n out though. I really liked shake shack as there were more options and the flavors were really good, but as a SoCal resident, I also love in n out. 

When I arrived around 2 pm during Labor Day weekend, I saw a long line and I thought that the wait would be forever! Luckily, it moved very fast and we got some seats inside. After you order, you get a buzzer that will let you know when to pick up your food. 

Food: 
ShackBurger - I actually had this the next day as leftovers but it was still pretty good. I'm just mad that one bite and the tomato or lettuce is gone. It doesn't tear apart very well hahah so I just had to take it in one or two bites. 

SmokeShack - I had like two bites of this because it was my bf's but it was so good! Ahh I wanted more...

ShroomBurger - I got this and it was delicious! Even though it was a deep fried panko covered mushroom with cheese and had no meat, I wanted this because it was unique. I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed it. I just wish the cheese was more melted and didn't get cold quickly. 

Black n white shake - so this is a vanilla shake with chocolate fudge apparently. It was good. Can't tell if it was special but I liked it. 

Overall: really tasty but expensive for the size! I'm not sure if I can justify the price for how small the burger is. I felt like it disappeared so quickly :( I want mooooore. Much better than bobby's burger palace (love watching him on food network but not eating his burger).

My husband had the shake stack and I took a bite...it was good but nothing impressive.  A positive was their fries were crinkled and crispy and if there is one super positive thing about trying Shake Shack, was the SHAKE!  I loved the mud slide flavor. Not too thick, not too watery, it was perfect right from receiving it. 

I liked the service to be honest, Clare was super nice and patient, explaining some menu items.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is cool and casual.  I liked the TV's and a big community table.

I would never cheat on you - In and Out ever again. Well maybe for the cheese fries ( I want more of those damn fries) and maybe the Shake Stack ( I didn't get the chance to try this burger). 

I tried the Smoke Stack which is a cheeseburger topped with all natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and shack sauce, and it was good, but not memorable compared to In and Out's burgers. The burger was even smaller than In and Out's burgers and the price was about three times more than what you would pay at In and Out. My friends warned me that the burgers were not that impressive at Shake Shack and they were right. However, their cheese fries was a winner. I loved the combination of the warm nacho cheese on their crinkle fries.

I also tried their strawberry shake, which is quite delicious, but I did not care for the price. To me, the burgers and shakes at Shake Shack is just too overpriced and I would stick to In and Out any day.

It is no surprise that this place is as popular as its NYC roots because they really do take quality into consideration to deliver the same kind of Shack Burger I would expect on 86th & Lexington or MSG. I love everything about Shake Shack, but mostly their burgers.

I'm in love with their brioche bun which is very soft and moist, and the bun is not cut across all the way so when ur eating the ingredients are not going to fall out the other side, genius! They have a special Shack sauce, which actually kinda tastes like garlic infused mayonnaise. The Shack burger will come with cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce, but if u want to add pickles or onions, they most definitely can. The cheese fries sauce are hot when they are served to you which makes it so much better, it's sort of similar to a nacho cheese. 

There are of course tables to sit at but there are also some lounge areas without a table.

I ordered the Shackburger with bacon and some cheese fries.  I know this place is typically compared to In n Out but I feel like they are a different style than that (or maybe I'm biased that In n Out is better).  I liked the burger a lot, it was very flavorful and meaty which is the type of burger I usually enjoy.  I think the best part of this meal were the cheese fries.  They had just the right amount of cheese and definitely a different style than at In n Out.  I really liked them a lot and wish I ordered more.  The burger and the fries filled me up pretty well.

My meal consisted of the Shack Burger (Double), side of fries, and large drink, totaling $16 and some change.

The burger was cooked very nicely. The red peppers atop the melty cheese and excellently seasoned patty were warm and soft, the bun slightly toasted, and the slightly sweet ""southwest"" style Shack sauce was a tasty and flavorful touch. The fries were fresh and crispy, cross cut style. The drink was a regular soft drink, nothing out of the norm. 

The atmosphere was busy. It was a warm environment full of socialization. Not too loud as to not hear your company in normal conversation, but not too low as to give off a boring vibe.

The staff seemed to be friendly, clear and concise with my order, though this is a counter style restaurant so interaction is limited.

The only qualm I have with this place was with the price. It is definitely a more upscale burger joint, and much of the price could in all fairness be contributed to its location on the Las Vegas Strip, but I would not  allow that to prevent you from at least trying it once.

New York's best is now cleverly dishing out cheesy burgers (and shakes) from the New York, New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas! This bustling burger ""shack"" is quite the word on the strip right now. Although they are connected to the Hotel & Casino, their entrance is actually located right on the strip, next to Tom's Urban and the Swatch Watch store.

There is a sizable, tourist-y line (but it moves quickly), a greeter that passes you a burger of the day card and a menu, efficiently directing you to the order window where you receive a nifty buzzer.

I never tried Shake Shack before, but I think I OD'd on melty cheese tonight. Here are the culprits:

ShackMeister Burger $6.19 (Add Bacon $1.55) - Simple. It wasn't bad... but I've had better. Cheeseburger, Shack Sauce (didn't taste it), crispy fried ale-marinated shallots (didn't taste them) , and we added applewood smoked bacon. The burger got lost in all of that thick cheese. Flavor rating: 3\/5

Shack Stack $9.49 - Shack stack you tasty son of a bun! Cheeseburger with a crisp-fried portobello mushroom cap filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses (!!), topped with lettuce, tomato and Shack Sauce (didn't taste it). Get outta town with that portobello cap. The lightly battered, seasoned and fried mushroom cap was oozing with gooey cheese and flavor. The burger was good, but the inventive mushroom cap set it off into outer-space. Flavor rating: 5\/5

Cheese Fries $3.95 (Add Fried Shallots $1) -crinkle cut fries topped with lots (and I mean lots) of melted cheese blend. We wanted to be different so we requested to add fried shallots and voila! Cheese overdose. Flavor rating: 3\/5

Strawberry Shake $5.25 - it's a good, thick, strawberry shake. Have you ever had In-N-Out's version? They taste identical. My only gripe - they serve you a small and charge you over $5. In-N-Out is the way to go. Flavor rating: 5\/5

In retrospect, I would nix the cheese fries and just order regular fries and share the shack stack with my date. But hey, you live and you learn! 

Is it worth a try? Yes. Is it better than In-N-Out? Your mileage may vary. However, I'll forever prefer In-N-Out for their affordable prices and their grilled onions! What's Shake Shack got against glorious grilled onions?",14,10,10

We decided to split a burger (mind you, we had never eaten here before) ordered fries and a chocolate malt. The burger is probably the perfect size for me, but for my hubs, it's a little too small. We ordered a shake shack burger - basically a cheeseburger. It was okay. Every bite I took, I couldn't help but just taste grease. I couldn't taste the special sauce either which was a big bummer. 

But the fries were the best part about the $15 we spent there. The fries were pretty crispy, which is how I love my fries to be. I'm not a big fan of the crinkle fries, but I am if its from SS!

I highly recommend getting the Shack Stack. It pretty much sums up the whole Shake Shack experience and you can totally forget about the rest of the list. The buns here are soft and cut half way through like a Bao. The angus beef patties are cooked medium topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato and their signature combo, a fried cheese stuffed portobello mushroom. Every bite was a flavor bomb! You can't miss out! ($9.49)

If you're wondering about the SmokeStack... It was just okay. I didn't really like the grilled cherry peppers. It didn't complement the bacon as I thought it would. The bites weren't as cheesy or juicy as the Shack Stack. Instead it was a bit dry. (single $6.69\/double $9.49)

I also tried mixing the vanilla and chocolate milk shake. Nothing special. ($5.25)

The crinkle fries were a decent size and crispy but not wow. It would've been better with the cheese. (plain $2.95\/ cheese $3.95)

My only complaint is the price to food ratio. Yes, I get it! It's the only Shake Shack in the West Coast. We welcome it! But, for the price you are paying (Vegas price), I could've had a gourmet burger that's 2-3x the size. The burgers here are way too small to really fill you up. That is unless you load up on their fries and other menu items. Now, I know I didn't come here for the fries! Not after all the hype... And especially when you have hungry tourists waiting for 40+ mins in 100+ degree weather. It can be very disappointing.

Total came out to about $30 (OUCH) but it was worth it.  Especially that shack stack burger!!!!! It's even more worth it if you add bacon to it.  But be careful because it can be VERY hot when you bite into that cheese filled mushroom (yummmm).  Fries were crispy and perfect.  

I definitely miss Shake Shack now that we've returned to reality.  Hopefully the next time I take a bite of that shake stack burger, it would be at the original location in New York City :)",0,0,0

The fries were perfectly fried: not overly cooked and not soggy. The burgers were also nice and juicy. The lettuce they use is the real romaine lettuce and not that iceberg lettuce that gives no real crunch. It was SO good! Not to mention, the frozen custard was creamy, thick and not too sweet. I think it was just the perfect amount too to satisfy my sweet tooth. My only problem with our experience here was the bathroom was pretty gross. Toilet paper everywhere and really messy.

Burgers are juicy, cooked to medium perfection. I tried the Smoke Shack (the cherry peppers add a little bit of a kick that partners well with the crispy and salty bacon) and the ShackBurger (fresh veg that didn't overpower the meat and cheese combo). 

The Chick'n Shack wasn't too shabby - the chicken was cooked well, kinda crispy breading that tasted slightly like the KFC breading of their original fried chicken. Though I enjoyed the potato bread they served these on, that was the only gripe of the people I was with. They said it tasted slightly sweeter than, say, the In and Out burger bun. 

Fries are good - nothing extraordinary but don't mistake these crinkle cut fries for the ones they used to serve with hot lunches at school. These had a slight crunch on the outside and tasted fresh unlike the crinkle fries of the late night Del Taco run variety. 

Now the shakes ... I've tried the seasonal Blueberry Pie Shake and then the Chocolate shake the next time I was here. Let me just say, if you like thick milkshakes, this is your jam. But even though the burger and fries combo doesn't look daunting it fills you up fast. So if you do order a shake, try sharing. 

Would definitely go back to try the hot dogs people keep raving about.",1,0,0

Stopped by just after the lunch hour on a Saturday.  Place was pretty busy with football games playing on all the tvs.  We went to stand in line to place our order.  Line moved quickly and we were able to find a seat at one of the communal tables.

The burgers took a bit longer than a typical fast food joint.  They give you a buzzer and you get up and pick up the tray at the counter.  Even though the buzzer went off, it still took an additional few minutes to get our tray.  

So my thoughts on the ShackBurger?  Pretty damn good.  Its a pretty typical smaller cheeseburger w\/lettuce, tomato and then there's that ShackSauce.  That's what makes the burger.  Don't know what's in it, but I could see myself craving it.  

Cheddar Bacon Fries-Another standard favorite, but the fries were crispy and the cheese and bacon were better quality.

Shack Stack: 9.59: signature cheeseburger and 'shroom burger all in one with crisp-fried portobello mushroom, melted cheese, lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce and onion ring. It looked big and thick, but it was not problem after a good workout.  The cheese oozed out that it dropped at times which made eating somewhat messy.

Black & White Shake: $5.29: vanilla shake with fudge. This popular shake was indeed very thick, but I didn't think it was extraordinaire. I'd try either root beer float or coffee fair shake next time.

Fountain drinks are unlimited refill, but there was no fountain machine, so you need to go up to the pick up counter to get replacement drinks. Water and condiments are self-served.

Parking: park in Monte Carlo parking structure, beware that they're installing ticket booth in the structure, so not sure if they will validate or charge parking fee in the future.

Shake shack definitely has great quality in their meat and buns as well as their malt shakes. 

Shake shack has better fries, their malt shakes are no question the better choice. But the choice between which is better burger, it depends who you are. 

If you love meat and cheese. Shake shack has more meat to bun ratio. Their cheese is completely melted and comes oozing out along with the juicy meat. Their burger buns are so soft you taste all meat and cheese. 

In N Out has a more all around burger, not too much meat, not too little lettuce tomato onion, and their bun is toasted. It has more textures when chewing. IN N OUT wins the all around flavor of burger. 

Shake shack takes the better fries and malt shakes. 

In N out takes the win when it comes to value. 

A double shake shack cheeseburger alone was about 8 dollars alone. MALT shake was about 6 dollars alone. If you got fries for another 6 bucks or so, youd be paying 20 a person just about. In N out is about 7 bucks for a whole meal.

I don't give many three star reviews. It's not necessarily cuz it's a three star place, but this place is overhyped and overpriced. It's a good burger, but you can find a burger this good for cheaper. Honestly a bacon burger at Sonics with hatch green chiles is a pretty good approximation to their spicy bacon thingy here. That goes for the shakes as well. We shared the fancy fries too. They were good. Just good. There are dozens of places in Vegas that have some sort of signature stacked fries that are just as good if not better (and cheaper). 

In conclusion, there are a lot of poke stops nearby. So maybe follow those poke stops to somewhere that gives you more bang for your buck.

To me it was an imposter from NY who just over-complicated the already perfect burger with high prices that couldn't hold a candle to In n Out. Though I am loyal to In n Out, I have to admit there are times I would admit I want Shake Shack instead.

The lines are crazy in the Vegas one so time wisely. Hubs and I got lucky and went on a Monday before lunch time and waited maybe 15 minutes while the line was still inside. I got the Shake stack because I wanted to give this a proper chance, also I love meat and mushrooms. Hubs got the Shack burger with a hot dog (maybe Shackago don't remember). We also got the crinkle cut fries. The food was piping hot, fresh and surprisingly good. The Shake Stack was almost suspiciously flavorful and delicious and I wondered how, hubs' burger was good too, just pretty basic and this is where a standard burger would lose out to in n out. The crinkle cut fries I had super low expectations because not once in my life have I ever had properly cooked crispy crinkle cuts. These were good though, what fries should be, hot, cooked through, crispy AF on the outside and soft on the inside. The hotdog was not memorable. I don't think the prices are justifiable especially considering their small portion sizes but whatever, imagine you're in NY and you're paying extra for the privilege.

Though this place is pretty big, there's very limited seating for the # of people going through, so don't plan on sitting down here to eat. Some of their seating is annoying, my hubs and I luckily acquired some seats and we were sitting on benches with little knee height round ""tables"" to balance our food on. It's annoying because we're stooping and bending over to eat the food, also gives me indigestion to eat like that. 

This place is located at NYNY hotel and it's pretty obvious from the street. Lines get absolutely ridiculously fucken crazy so watch out. Prices are too high for me to feel like it's a GREAT value but overall, I sometimes crave the shake stack still.",4,2,6

Since we were in Vegas this week, it was on the list of things we must do. Unfortunately we had a late breakfast and were not super hungry for lunch, so we decided to just split a burger since we were determined to try one.

When we arrived around 3:30 on Friday there was nobody in line and the food was ready in less than five minutes. Within 15 minutes of us arriving the line was literally out the door, but it seems like service is very fast here, so I am sure a long line isn't an issue.

We split a single Shackburger with no tomato (my husband despises tomatoes), an order of fries, and a salted vanilla caramel shake. It was good. My husband liked it way more than I did. I liked the flavor, the sauce was tasty, and it was very cheesy. But, I like texture, and this had none. Perhaps the tomato would have added a little bit. Also, the burgers are TINY. We cut it in half and each had about three bites to eat. I did like the fries, and the shake was pretty good.

Overall Shake Shack is a much fancier restaurant...almost Umami Burger level but not quite.
The servers are friendly  (but so are In N Out servers)  and the restaurant is nice and clean.

The vibe is much more hip\/urban than the old school diner-ish vibe of In N Out.

The burgers cost quite literally twice as much as their In N Out equivalents.  Which puts them in a bad category of 10-15 dollar fast food burger meals.   This is the category where the meal costs more than you want and never tastes quite good enough to match the price tag.   I always end up wishing I just spent less for slightly crappier food OR more for an actual sitdown restaurant burger meal.   

They have crinkle cut fries which are actually too dry inside...i much prefer the crinkle fries they serve at the random mom and pop Mexican joints in LA.   I got the shake stack which is the shroom burger + regular burger in one.   It's good don't get me wrong...but not ~9 dollars good.  The biggest problem is the tiny burger patty....i have this pet peeve against burgers having a crappy bun size to burger size ratio.   The bun is way too big for the patty in this case.  

They also serve a multitude of shakes, beers, hot chocolate and other drinks.   I got the coffee shake which was not bad but once again it's tiny.   The shake comes in a McDonald's child size cup.    

They have two fountain drink sizes...regular and large, so i'm thinking ok the regular is like a medium size at McDs (or any other fast food place really).   Nope the regular size is the same size as the shake, which is to say it's like a Happy Meal sized drink.   Sure it's unlimited refills but it's pain when you have to ask for a refill after every 2 gulps.   AND they don't take your cup and refill it,  they throw your cup away and give you a whole new one!  After 2 refills the destruction to mother nature was too great and I stopped getting refills.  Well played Shake Shack, well played.


In conclusion,  even if the burgers cost the same at Shake Shack and In N Out i would still order the In N Out burger because it's just more satisfying.",2,2,3

What makes a Shake Shack burger unique and amazing? It's the Martin's Potato roll. Okay, the Shack sauce is also key. The Vegas location does not depart from this perfect recipe.

   Ordered a shake, ""smoke shack"", fries and a bottled water- simple enough order.  To keep it short- food was overall OK, and I'm still an In and Out fan- more so now, more than ever, because of places like this. 

  Here's when it happens...after receiving my order and taking two bites, I realize where is the bacon in this? Is it THAT small?!  Come to find out, it's not there.

The black & white shake was supposedly the most popular, so I tried that. Wasn't really feeling it, but then again, I'm not much of a shake person.

I got the shack stack which had a deep fried portobello mushroom  and burger patty. This had so much hype in my mind be cause I love mushroom burgers but this didn't really appeal to me as much, the cheese filling on the mushroom might have been a little overwhelming. 

I ordered the cheese fries and didn't enjoy them that much. I guess the cheese just wasn't really what I was looking for. Higher quality cheese than your average cheese fries but the texture and flavors weren't my favorite. 

The strawberry shake I got was one of the most basic shakes they have, but it's was super amazing! Great shake, (they better do it right cause it's in their name!) not overly sweet and texture was on point with little pieces of fruit. 

Great spot!!! A lot of seating available and very modern design make this place a cool place to eat, just not really into the burger I got or the cheese fries.",1,1,1

We don't have Shake Shacks back at home, so when I was in a taxi going down the Strip and saw this beautiful neon burger, I knew I had to try it sometime during my Vegas trip. We stopped by around 4, and the line took less than 3 min. I ordered a cheese burger, crinkle fries, and a vanilla frozen custard. Everything was top notch! The burger was so good... Every ingredient had a role and they all played their role perfectly. The fries were crispy, not soggy at all. The custard was creamy and thick and oh so satisfying in the Vegas heat. 

My only little minor gripe is the service. It's my first time at a Shake Shack (hopefully not my last!), so I didn't know the lingo and I studied the menu a little bit harder than maybe others.

I like how they have cups for water or their house lemonades.

My family and I tried to swing by for lunch on Saturday, but a gas line in NYNY broke, so all the restaurants there weren't able to cook anything. That meant no burgers. Boo. The next day, I called ahead (no long wait on the phone!) and was able to talk to the manager, who i believe is named Paul, and I confirmed that they got their griddles fixed! 

So we got to Shake Shack right when it was supposed to open at 11:00am, but I guess they decided to open earlier to make up for lost sales the previous day because there was already an impressive line. No biggie though, the line moved so quickly that my group wasn't even ready to order when we got to the front. 

I liked that there were plenty of options on the menu, but it wasn't overwhelming. I ordered the SmokeShack burger, cheese fries and a root beer float. They gave us one of those vibrating restaurant pagers while we waited. The food came out in a reasonable time seeing how busy it already was. When we got our food, I felt like the burgers seemed smaller than I thought they would be. The SmokeShack still tasted great though! Love the bun and cherry pepper. The fries were my definition of perfect fries. Golden and crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. The root beer float tasted like your everyday root beer float, should've ordered a shake seeing how it is called Shake Shack, but I'll do that next time.

Awesome that they have an express line (C-Line) for drinks and cold items as well as a little Photo Booth that they make gifs out of apparently.

The menu is pretty basic with burgers, fries, hot dogs, and shakes. I opted for the basic cheeseburger with fries and I was super disappointed. The burger was smaller than a McDonald's dollar burger and was not very well seasoned. As for the fries, they were definitely those frozen crinkle fries, which again were super basic.

A few thoughts:
- They have a special ale that Brooklyn Beer makes for them and it's really good.
- I'm normally not much of a fan of crinkle-cut fries, but these are SO crispy on the outisde and perfect inside that they've converted me.
- The cheese fries are an A+ variation. Not super cheesey tasting, yet somehow just right.
- Not fan of their burger sauce, so maybe consider getting it on the side if you're on the fence about opaque condiments like I am. (For taste calibration purposes, I love In-n-Out spread and tartar sauce. SS sauce has an off-putting flavor I can't put my finger on.)

I knew when I saw that Shake Shack had opened up in Vegas, that I had to eat there the next time I was in Vegas.  It is located by the New York, New York casino on the outside though, directly across the street from M&M world.  I was pretty excited to try it out and make the comparison between Shake Shack and In N Out.  

The line was out the door long when we got there but it moved relaitvely quickly and gave us more than enough time to check out their pretty extensive menu.  They have a lot of things on their menu.  I remember seeing 4 different burgers, fries, a few different style of hot dogs and a bunch of delicious sounding shakes.  Their prices are a lot higher than In N Out but I feel like at Shake Shack you are not getting just a wholesome regular burger.  I feel like Shake Shack is more similar to 5 guys or The Habit than In N Out.  Price wise, when compared to those burger places is about the same.  There were plenty of seats despite how crowded it was.  The workers there do a pretty good job of moving the crowd and cleaning up tables.  

We settled on a Shack Burger, a Shack Stack burger and cheese fries.  Their fries are amazing!  They are crinkle cut fries smoothered in a cheese sauce.  I love cheese.  My boyfriend and I had a disagreement because I wanted to just get one order but he insisted on two orders because he wanted fries and he knew that since they were covered in cheese I would end up eating all the fries and he would not get any.  We got two...he was right.  They are deliciious!  They are so much better than IN n Out fries which I was never a fan of.  I do not know why they are so good, but they are crisp, moist with just the right amount of saltiness.  My Shack Burger was okay, it came with tomato, Romaine lettuce, Shacksauce and cheese.  I do not know if I would pay $5.20 for it, I thought that was a bit pricey.  The burger was juicy and the sauce complimented it nicely.  I liked that they use Romaine Lettuce vs Iceberg.  

The Shack Stack burger...now that thing was on a whole nother level.  It was basically the Shack burger but with a fried, cheese stuffed portobello mushroom inside.  Man, biting into that thing and the cheese exploding everywhere, wow.  That burger was almost $10, not sure if it was worth it either but I would say that was more enjoyable than the Shack Burger.  

I did enjoy Shake Shack and I would say that I am a fan.  Hopefully they open one in Southern California sometime soon so I can enjoy it a little closer to home.  I would definately check it out.  The burgers are very good but remember to get the fries!  Those things are amazing!  I am going to have to try a shake from their next time I am in Vegas.

(Half-Kidding). Trying to now be consistent about reviews, I'll break them down by: Cost, Service, Ambience, Food\/Drink, Random Thoughts.

Cost: $10-$20

Service: There are lines. Wow. Now you may be saying, gosh Mike, obviously. The most popular east coast burger chain just opened on the single busiest street in the world...I understand that, but I guess when I knew they were opening on a corner spot on the Strip I figured they would have MORE THAN FOUR CASHIERS. I went to the smallest Shake Shack in NYC and they still had 3 cashiers...

Ambience: It's fine. Seating is hard to find sometimes but it seems that they have a patio that will open up during summer which will be fun! They also have the silly roulette themed lights, which I guess add to the décor but are in all honesty probably a waste of money. 

Food: Burgers are great, charred and super! Fries are great especially with cheese. I thought the hot dogs were underwhelming and lacking the ""snap"" the you associate with a great hot dog. The main selling point for me has always been the Concretes. The two Vegas ones are great, but anytime you can add cheesecake bites, chocolate, cookie dough, or whatever else into some delicious custard, you got a recipe for hitting a jackpot! (HA! A bad pun!). They also have a ""C"" line for cold items which will be really solid when the temps hit 100.

Random: There is no casino entrance. I thought it may be more efficient to park at the Monte Carlo and cross the strip that way than parking at the NYNY and walking through the entire casino. Just food for thought.",0,0,0

Comparison to other burger chains all comes down to taste.  I mentioned to my dad how much I love the fries at In N Out.  They taste fresh and not as fried.  He said he likes his fries super crispy, so he doesn't like it as much.  What I like about In N Out, he sees as a detriment.  I say this to say that I like In N Out more than Shake Shack, but I think everyone should try both to make their own comparison, because it is not obviously clear that one is better than the other.

I got the cheeseburger with the portabella mushroom on top, cheese fries, and the black and white milkshake.  Don't come here if you are starving.  It is super popular and although the line to pay goes by fast, you'll end up waiting forever for your food.

I didn't feel like the portabella mushroom added anything to the burger.  I can see how it makes a great sandwich on its own, but I wouldn't combine the two.  The cheese fries were delicious.  I loved the cheese.  The fries itself were ok, but again, I love In N Out fries more.  The milkshake was very good.

There is plenty of room to sit and eat.  I chose to sit outside at the bar overlooking people walking the Strip.

Overall, I would definitely suggest trying here once and seeing if this is your thing.  If it was between this and Fatburger, I'd eat here every time.",0,0,0

I can't remember what I said in my last review but now I can confidently say that Shake Shack comes nowhere near our good ole In N Out. 

My updated review is solely for this LV location. But yeah, seems like the quality of the food has really dropped. Basically I'd say they can now be compared to maybe a Carl's Jr or Burger King meal based on the super soggy and deflated burgers my friends and I got yesterday. The only difference would be that Shake Shack's burger costs you $8-10 when you can get a similar soggy burger at Carl's Jr for half the price. 

ALSO, the one thing that used to be my sole reason for liking this place... their cheese fries. We got one order of cheese fries and an order of regular fries and they came out almost exactly the same but the cheese fries having a little drip of cheese on like 4 French fries. lols If you're gonna sell an item whose only difference from regular fries is... cheese. Then I think you guys should actually have some cheese on the fries? 

Bleh, overall yesterday's lunch here was super disappointing, made me feel guilty for insisting our friends come here over White Castle. 

Hopefully someone from this location actually reads these reviews and tries to make some improvements, but until then... probably won't be back for awhile.",6,5,3

From all the hype that I heard about this place, I was expecting something better. I'm not saying it was bad, it was definitely good, just nothing to write to mom about. 
So my wife and I were in Las Vegas for her company's offsite. Luckily, we were staying at New York, New York so Shake Shack was right in front of our hotel. We got in line about 11am, we had just flown in. Line was pretty long despite having a few registers open. The menu was simple, burgers, sides, custards\/shakes, and drinks. I decided to order the Smokeshack, cheese fries, and an iced tea. My wife got the original shack burger. 
For 2 burgers, 2 fries and a shake and drink, we spent nearly $30. I understand we are in Las Vegas and on the Strip none-the-less but, come on, $30 for burger and fries? 
My next complaint although, not specifically Shake Shack's fault, but our seats were ""stolen"" as we were sitting down. The only seats available at the time were, bench seats with small coffee table seats. I placed out stuff down on the seat to tend to my infant daughter and these two women decided to just place their meals on our small table. Basically, pushing us out. Thank you, someone else saw what happened and they were done with their meal and offered their table to us. I know the seating there may seem trendy and fashionable, but knowing the popularity of this place, it would be nice to have more tables and chairs. 
When we walked in, i expected that it would be a long wait because the line was pretty long, we waited about 20 mins to order. Then I would say 45-40 mins just to get our meal. That is just a little too long for burger and fries. Especially, since what you are serving is simple. We had enough time to feed my daughter her baby food and finish her milk, before we even got our food. 
We finally get our food, The burger was ok, tasted a lot like Wendy's cheeseburgers. The buns were soft and cold, I usually like toasted buns, it gives extra flavor and texture to my burger. Mine came with bacon and hot peppers, which went well with the burger. The bun seemed too soft to hold the contents of my burger, when I got half way through it, the bun had become a flat piece of paper. My biggest complaint would be that the portions were really small. That burger was probably no bigger than a slider. For the amount of money we paid, I would still expect it to be just a little bit bigger. The fries were great, the cheese sauce did not taste like it came out of a can, so I can appreciate that. 
I didn't order the shake but my wife did and I tried it, it was not bad, just very rich. 
My overall experience wasn't bad. I expected fireworks but i just go a small party popper. I don't know if I would be returning any time, people say the one in actually New York, was way better. I guess I would have to try that if I ever make it to New York. I was hoping for consistency, much like my favorite fast food chain, In-N-Out. I explained to the people who said the NY one was better, but as a company, consistency should match to be called a Shake Shack burger.",2,1,0

Right when you walk in, you receive a menu to look at while you wait in line, which is better than zoning out staring at the large menu board while the line moves and you're still...just staring.

I ordered the Shack Stack, which is a cheese burger with a Shroom burger on top (deep fried portabella mushroom filled with muenster and cheddar cheese) with lettuce, tomato, and its Shacksauce. Plus, an order of crinkle fries.

It wasn't a large (circumference-wise) burger, but it was packed thick. The fried portabella was very good, especially with the two cheeses oozing out. But it ate very, very rich and heavy when you add the flavorful and juicy cheeseburger underneath. For me, I needed a lot of ketchup to balance the burger out. It was still very delicious though! The best part of the burger was the bread because the outside was soft and the inside was very crispy and stayed that way throughout, which is amazing with the sauce on there and the gooey cheese.

Seeing crinkle fries, I was hesitant about it as I automatically see them as those store-bought frozen kind where you throw it in the oven, and the end result is either mushy fries or super hard, dry, and tasteless fries. I'm sure they were frozen once, but these fries were super good! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and very well-seasoned with the right amount of salt.

This place had a more modern feel to it. The seating area was comfortable and spacious. There was a LOT of people just working registers. They literally stood shoulder to shoulder taking customer's orders. There were also a few workers, bussers more like, standing around and waiting to grab your empty tray to take to the trash.

Overall, the burger was more on the heavy side with the cheeses and fried portabella, but it was a delicious burger. Plus, the fries were very good. It's kind of pricey considering it's just a burger joint locating outside on New York, New York Hotel. I think it's a decent once-in-a-while place to eat, but not a must return visit if you're not from here.",0,0,0

I noticed a selling point of this place is that their beef is raised without hormones or antibiotics and that alone can draw in a certain kind of crowd, but for myself, it doesn't make a difference. They do have a selection of hot dogs, shakes, and frozen custards available as well if you want to add some flavor to your meal. Each time I have visited, I have gotten the hamburger with fries. To be honest, the food is more expensive than other fast food places, and you don't necessarily get more for your dollar either. Their burgers taste just like any other hamburger and their fries are crinkle fries that don't have anything really special about them. The hype around it was not backed up by their food or price at all.

I came for the meat and potatoes and I was not disappointed. I had the double cheeseburger and the cheese fries, which was not the best idea, but still tasty. Next time I'd prefer the fries plain buuuut the burger was delicious. 
It was how  I always want my In N Out burger to taste...beefy. The burgers are a nice size and their cheese is unique because they make their own blend. Honestly, it kind of tastes like Velveeta but I was ok with that! It worked with the burger flavor overall. The bun was nice and soft and I like how they don't cut all the way through, so it's almost like your burger is nestled snugly in a nice potato bun pocket. At least it tasted like a potato bun. Easy to hold and kept everything from sliding out! 
Also they have crinkle cut fries which are my jam. Give me crinkles, waffles, tots...anything but shoestring and you've got me.

The milkshake was $5.25, and if you have read my previous reviews regarding milkshakes, you can't serve an expensive milkshake and only provide 12 oz of creamy goodness. It might have been 16 oz but if sure felt like 12. So that didn't work for me either.

The Chick'n Shack is basically Shake Shack's answer to Chick fil-A with a crispy fried chicken breast filet, lettuce, pickles, and buttermilk herb mayo.  It's pretty damn tasty!  The chicken filet was huge, crispy, juicy, and full of flavor.  I would definitely order this again!

NYNY's Shake Shack is still an awesome location and it's gotten even better now that The Park is open.  The last time I was here, The Park was still under construction so the part of the patio area was closed off.  So it was nice to finally the whole area outside Shake Shack opened up.  It makes for a great people-watching spot while enjoying burgers and shakes.",16,14,16

In Vegas I tried the Jackpot concrete that was basically Vanilla custard with some 3-4 stale tasting Belgian waffle chunks in it and sprinkles.
As far as In n Out comparison goes, I'll give Shake Shack a slight edge on burgers and huge edge on fries.  But In n Out murders them on bang for buck.  If both In n Out and Shake Shack had equal prices and were available in my backyard, I'd probably visit them equally as often.",0,0,0

He hasn't been out to New York City to see what the hype was about, and it seemed like it would take ages until he finally would be able to visit this so-called mecca.

But last year, he found out they would open a restaurant to open in Las Vegas. So he waited. And waited. And waited a few more weeks after it had opened, out of concern for the lines.

Today was the day. Finally, he would brave the crowds and navigate the labyrinth that is the Strip. He did not want to try White Castle further up the strip without having given a go at what would likely be the better burger. So he parked at the New York New York Hotel & Casino's self-parking garage, found his way through the casino, and strolled northward down the sidewalk. At about half an hour before noon, he finally arrived at his destination.

The line started outside and led to another maze inside, this one marked by the cordons. The Californian was quite patient, enjoying the air-conditioned room that  even in Spring-like weather was a relief from the desert outside. After perhaps 20 minutes' wait overall, he finally placed his order.

It would be almost another 15 minutes before his pager would ring. He was amused that these receivers were more akin to remote control devices than to the square coaster pagers used by other restaurants. Having forgotten to ask earlier, he was also glad to find stacks of plastic cups for obtaining water from the faucets. While he was playing with his phone, his pocket buzzed, and he knew immediately that the time had finally come.

He exchanged the gadget for his tray. He quickly found a seat on a high table that was being used communally by three other groups. He took a photograph of his Shack Stack burger (you would say ""of course he did!"" if you knew him), and then he ate his burger. Some might call it a slow pace, but he preferred to enjoy the flavors as best he could (as well as avoid potential indigestion).

He found the flavor of the meat patty to be much to his liking. The patty was cooked approximately to the default medium, perhaps medium-well. He regretted not ordering it rare for a brief second. He shrugged and continued to enjoy the burger, noticing the soft bun, the crunchy portobello mushroom, the gooey cheese, and the ubiquitous lettuce and tomato.

As his burger dwindled down to a few bites, he noticed that some of his neighbors at the table had obtained their order and that they had cheese fries. He asked if they would, pardon the odd request, be so kind as to sell him a fry so that he could taste it. They were generous enough to agree without any charge. While the cheese was a bit redundant with all the cheese already in the burger, he found that the fry did have a nice crisp on the outside and was salted properly. He realized perhaps a bit too late that having the fries and some ketchup might have complemented the burger.

In spite of that, he was certain in his belief that the burger needed to be able to stand on its own. In most respects, it did. However, the savoriness of the burger did not quite match that of his other favorite burgers, and there wasn't much sweetness to be found in the Shack Sauce, whereas the sauce provided by In-N-Out did have that element, and the relish he had requested on his burger at a recent Five Guys visit also provided that flavor. While he did in large part enjoy his burger, he did not feel a pressing need to return on his own because those other options are more accessible and would be certain to provide more satisfaction at a significantly lower price.

Lastly, our protagonist would urge you to try Shake Shack for yourself and decide for yourself where they stand in the burger hierarchy. He doesn't place it at the very top, but perhaps you might.",6,4,3

Got into Vegas at 12am. So hungry, what to eat? Oh shoot, Shack shack is open til 2 am. Perfect spot to grab some late night munchies. The soft potato buns are the perfect vessels for the well seasoned beef and gooey cheese to get into your mouth. I could taste some sort of seasoning from the beef or sauce. That sauce provided a creamy texture in my bite while not being over powering. I absolutely loved every bite of the burger. 

But wait there is more! In addition to the fantastic burger they serve here, the crinkle cut fries were fried and seasoned perfectly! All the crispy edges and no soggy fries. Thank you for not fking this up. Probably the best crinkle cut fries I've ever had. 

It's Vegas, so I had a beer. It was an IPA, paired wonderfully with my burger. Not gonna lie, it's kinda expensive for burger and fries. When compared to any other burger place(oh lets just saying IN N Out burgers), 1 shack burger costs almost the price of 2 double doubles.

Shake Shack is located outside of the New York New York hotel on the strip. There is lots of indoor  seating with many TVs around to watch some TV while you grind your burgers. If the weather is cooler, which it wasn't when we went, you can sit outside where there is lots of shade & cute seats. 

I was overwhelmed with the menu since it was my first time! I got the regular hamburger with their signature sauce, a chocolate PB shake & I shared fries with my friend. My first bite was heaven, it was like biting into something so delicious that you are torn between eating it all or savoring it forever. Shakes were off the hook! You can do a combination of their flavors. & lets not forget crinkle cut fries which were both crispy on the outside & fluffy on the inside. The couple I was with ordered 3 sandwiches & loved all of them. People from Hawaii go all out when it comes to food because we want to try everything.

Service - I rate a 4 out of 5. As busy as they are, their system is pretty good. The employees are polite  and, for the most part, congenial. But the food - I would rate a ""0"" out of 5. I eat at different restaurants every night of the week and include many hamburger restaurants but this is by far the worst in terms of taste, size and value. 
The food was very very bland. The cheese sauce was so bland you couldn't tell it was cheese. The fries are tasteless - similar to the Frozen fries you buy at the grocery store and bake in your oven. The shake was very small for the price. All for $33. We ate at the Outback Steakhouse in Henderson the night before and had a nice steak each, wine, soup and an appetizer for $60. And we enjoyed the meal! So, overall, I would rate the whole meal .5. I guess location is everything and they have a captive clientele so will continue to survive, especially at those prices.

The Shack operates as the storefront in front of New York New York hotel on the strip. I had bookmarked the joint for some time now because it's so hard to find cheap, good, quality food for under $10 in Vegas, but Shake Shack fit the bill.

They tout 100% all-natural Angus beef burgers. The patties were definitely hearty, no flimsiness here! The buns glowed with brioche-likeness and held up considerably well to all of the fresh toppings of crunchy lettuce, crisp slices of tomatoes, raw white onion rings, and brined cucumbers.

The Shack Attack is a chocolate lovers' dream; fudge sauce on chocolate custard on chocolate truffle and cookie dough, on Mast Brothers dark chocolate chunks, topped with chocolate sprinkles. *mic drop*

Shake Shack is New York's version of California's In & Out (kinda).  It's considered a fast food joint like In & Out, but the burgers are a bit more gourmet (the bun is soo squishy and soft, noms).  Shake Shack is also a bit more hefty on the wallet for a fast food place.  

I ate a meal at a Shake Shack in New York in 2011, and I seriously have been daydreamin' about eating it again someday.  Someday came when I randomly had a 3 hour layover in Vegas a few weeks ago and boom!  I took a cab (which was quadruple the price of my meal roundtrip) to recreate my love at first bite.  What can I say, love makes you do crazy things.

If you're in Vegas, experience a little bit of New York and order a ShackBurger, Cheese Fries, and a STRAWBERRY custard shake.  (Don't be tempted by other flavors...strawberry!  And if you fall victim to ordering something else, don't say I didn't warn you).  Just a heads up...this meal is about 1500 calories and $23.00 ish.

don't get me wrong, the food is delicious, but compared to in n out, its a joke. 
burgers are like 8-10 bucks if you get a double stack.  and the amount of people in this specific location is horrendous.  it took 5 mins just to get a refill.  wtf.  its so dumb that they do not have a sofa machine and you need to ask the people working there for a refill.

the burgers were decent, and they definitely fill you up, but its not worth the cost.  the shack stack was kinda interesting though... its a regular cheese burger with a crispy-fried portobello mushroom filled melted muenster and cheddar cheese.  the fries were also nothing special.  its just del taco wave fries with cheese.  i rather have my animal fries all day.

the only thing this place beats in n out on, is the interior decor.  but then again, its located in vegas, so everything is more flashy.  not worth the premium.

So now I know what all the hype is about! I feel like I've been secretly at war with everyone from the East Coast because we have In-N-Out, but I've been humbled. Once walking in I noticed the large wall that explains their specialty burgers, fries and shakes. So immediately my eyes fell in love with the shake shake stack, a burger nestled in a fried cheese party with all the burger fixins. Also went with then bacon cheese fries. 

We took a seat and waited for our creations, surprisingly we were helped pretty fast considering we were at the Las Vegas location. Our burgers were dropped off table side and it took one look to know this was going to be delicious. The cheese fries were crispy and buried under a cheesy fondue with crispy salty pieces of bacon. Along with the fries the burger had this taste that couldn't compare to any, a perfectly charred burger under all the loads of fries and melted cheese, it was magical!",11,8,13

BUT.  whatever category you put them in, the burgers are exceptional.  meat quality is superior to any fast food joint that exists, perhaps just as good as your 4-5 star rated full service restaurants, and better than many of the plentiful out there.

we ordered a DOUBLE SHACK BURGER, CHICK'N SHACK, FRIES, SALTED CARAMEL SHAKE and JACKPOT CONCRETE, and here's how it rolled:

the DOUBLE SHACKBURGER.  mmmm.  meat was tender, no doubt freshly ground.  crumbled easily at the bite.  so flavorful.  and the cheese.  lusciously melted on the patty.  that bun, eggy and a bite gave all the flavors and textures in the burger.  in other words, i tasted the burger as a whole, and not as a sum of all its parts.  each and every part of its components were synonymous with its bigger self, ie. as being A BURGER.  does that make any sense?  i can't think of any other way to explain it.  it was so naturally melded together, every luscious bite seamlessly glorious.  SO.  DARN.  GOOOOOD. 

the CHICK'N SHACK.  so i came in with no expectations.  but this was life-changing amazing.  so crispy, not greasy.  and ahhhh... J-U-U-U-U-I-C-Y.  i was blown away by this chick-a-dee. just perfection all around.  yeah cliché, but it's truth.  sorry...  i just don't think i'll ever want another Chick-fil-Who??  ever again.  YEAH.  THAT GOOD.  and then some.  and some more.  why oh why did hubby and i share??!

FRIES?  yummy.  everyone has their opinion on the fries.  and they compare.  but i like them.  in fact, they're reminiscent of the fries i had as a little girl on those few times mom bought frozen fries from the grocery.  BUT.  yes, these are so much better!  golden crispy outside and fluffy inside. 

SALTED CARAMEL SHAKE.  more please!!  i felt like a little girl again with this frozen custard.  Y.U.M.  i could have used an extra strong flavor on the salted caramel, but that's just me.  i like everything to taste stronger when it comes to shakes.  just wished to God they had extended their featured MISO SALTED CARAMEL flavor from the week before!!!  boo hoo... i'll just hope they bring that to LaLaLand.  i will be there.

JACKPOT CONCRETE - yummy, but mine was pretty melted and soft by the time i got to it.  will have to try again next time.  fun and festive flavor though, with the confetti sprinkles and waffle pieces and strawberry puree.  

overall, my testbuds had the time of their burger-lovin life.  i would have had dinner here too had it been closer to my hotel.  BUT.  i shall wait until Danny Meyers serves me up some in WeHo or DTLA.. #seeYAsoon #cannotFRIGGINwait #cravingSS #hangry4SSinLA

Writing this review, you should know that Shake Shack sent me a gift card to make it up to me. I wasn't sure if I would ever use the gift card because there isn't a Shake Shack in my state. Behold, though, there is one in Vegas! So, I used the gift card from last summer for this experience. That gift card in no way influenced my review here, but I thought it best to be up front about that. 

I love this Shake Shack for a number of reasons: 1) I love that is is close to the new park and that I can sit inside or out to eat my food, 2) I LOVE the prices. So much in Vegas is so overpriced. Shake Shack could charge double or triple what they normally charge and get by with it in Vegas, but they choose to go the route of integrity and charge their typical price, 3) Their burgers are just good, 4) Their custard is to die for, and 5) They stay open late, which means Shake Shack is going to give some of the overpriced places in NY, NY a run for their money.

That said, the fries are just okay. I ordered the cheese fries, and they were a little bland. I'm not sure if it is the fry itself or the cheese, but they weren't great.

The service was amazing, and the way the restaurant hustles folks through line is really good. I can see Shake Shack doing very well in this location in Vegas. I'm excited to add it to my list of places to visit when I'm there.",3,1,2

When we returned ppl started piling up, waiting to come in... the nice staff opened up the doors for us at 10:55.

My last time, it was after Cirque du Soleil's O show and this time, it was after their KA show (this is really a coincidence!) The lineup was once again really long! We wanted to eat this before our show but we would be at least 30 minutes late for our show. We started lining up but had to leave the lineup because it wasn't moving fast enough for us to order, wait for our food, eat and run to MGM. 

I wanted to order their roadside burger for my family since they haven't been to Shake Shack but I ordered the wrong burger... The Roadside burger was not on their black billboard menu and at that time, I couldn't remember what my boyfriend got, so I tried my best and ordered what seems to be the best burger out of the menu: the smokeshack (Cheeseburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, ShackSauce). I also ordered the strawberry milkshake and their cheese fries. 

Overall, I find the smokeshack a bit too salty for me, it is not as greasy as the roadside burger but I didn't like it much. The bacon was too salty but the patty and sauce was really good. I was surprised to find it a little bit\/quite spicy (I must have been blind for not seeing that it contains chopped cherry pepper!) Nevertheless, it was a decent burger but my favorite one is still their roadside burger! Next time, I would try their 'Shroom Burger (Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce),  their Shack Stack (Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce) or their simply their Shack Burger (Cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce), which seems to be the most popular option.

I find their strawberry milkshake to be really average, it tasted like strawberry as expected. I would order their black and white milkshake again but not the strawberry one.

Their cheese fries (Topped with our special blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce) was REALLY good! I really like melted cheese (I'm picky with my cheese since I don't like unmelted ones! Yes, the texture makes a big difference). I don't know why but melted cheese taste much better than unmelted cheese, don't you agree? The cheese was really flavorful but not too heavy, and went well with the fries! I would order this again but next time, I would eat this before it colds down (I don't like it when my cheese becomes ""stiff"", I like it when it stretches)!",2,1,1

Definitely one of the best fast-food burgers I've ever had. Eat your heart out In-N-Out. I was in Vegas for 3 days and I ate there twice and I'd have totally gone again, even though it was about a 30-40 minute walk from our hotel on the strip.

Cool vibe and delicious everything. The one criticism I have is that the menu isn't visible from the order counter. The menu is beside the queue where you wait to place your order, so you'd better decide what you want and remember it by the time you get to the front (remembering things in a, shall we say, compromised Vegas state of mind can be challenging at times).

The crinkle fries are delicious. I really liked them with the cheese on top.

Shake Burger: the patty was sooooo salty. Maybe this is the way New Yorkers like it? However, I did like how the ends were kind crispy. I also loved the sweet potato bun! It did become a little soggy but the sweetness was very unique!

Cheese Fries: Awesome crinkle fries with melted cheese on top. The cheese kind of tasted like those Ritz cheese dip with crackers that you ate as a snack in elementary school. I know that's super specific, but it did!!! I was expected a nacho kind of cheese. It was unexpected but I liked it!

Custard: Yeah, you've got to get this! It's a great dessert that's very rich and smooth. Perfect ending to your meal.

It's really expensive (like they all say) but I guess that's how it is in the east coast? Yes, I did compare it to In n Out and of course I love In n Out better.

The only thing to compare is their respective cult followings. That's it. As far as comparing the actual food, there is no contest. I tried each chain's burgers and fries back-to-back and Shake Shack's burger was clearly superior. The overall flavor is much better and their burgers even look more appetizing. I also like their potato buns A LOT more than In-N-Out's dry, flavorless buns (I always order protein style for this reason). I can't say I'm ready to kick In-N-Out to the curb because, let's be honest, a lot of this has to do with nostalgia, however, I'm giving the crown to the Shack.

The first time I tried Shake Shack (Shackburger), I thought it was good, but not better than In-N-Out. I was going based on my fond memories and how much I enjoy their food. I concluded that both burgers were good in their own ways and that I could enjoy both separately. A month later, I had the opportunity to try their burgers again (Double Shackburger, Shackmeister, Shack Stack) and I couldn't believe how good it tasted! It solidified my thoughts about the quality of their burgers. That same evening, I visited the nearby In-N-Out and much to my surprise, their burger looked a lot less appetizing than I remembered (especially compared to Shake Shack). And all it took was one bite - I couldn't believe the vast difference in taste!  It was flavorless. It reminded me how much I dislike their buns. I did, however, enjoy the tangy-ness of In-N-Out's secret sauce. 

I still need to figure out what I like best at Shake Shack. I like raw onion on my burger and I have yet to order a burger with it, so that'll be my next visit.

Order came out in reasonable time. The burger was hot. Produce lettuce tomato and onions were crisp. Bun was topped with sesame seeds and warm. Beef was seasoned. Their specify french fries, essential crinkle cut, were boiling hot and seasoned appropriate without need of additional salt or ketchup. 

The milkshake of the week was the pumpkin pie flavor. The milkshake was a good balance of ice cream and pumpkin pie taste. Reminded me of eating pumpkin pie with whipped cream. Tasty. Not ice and not overly creamy. Would definitely order again.

When I first saw the fries I admit I started getting anxious and questioned this decision to walk through NY NY Casino for a burger with Sysco fries. Upon first glance I saw they are the type of fries I was served in school, you know those crinkled and soggy cardboard things the National School Lunch Program passed off as food? Well thankfully they were nothing like the sad sack of fries I was served in high school. These were perfectly and evenly crisped on all sides of the fry. I started chomping away in amazement on how they were able to achieve such an even crisp on all sides of a crinkle cut fry. How did they do it? nom nom...Why has it not been done before? nom nom nom.. This is amazing! I can't believe I'm going to say this... but I like crinkle cut fries now.

We also have enjoyed some of their shakes but my favorite will always be the black and white shake. I think thats where the east coast thing comes in.. I have never had a decent one here in town. Not sure why.. I usually get a puzzled stare when I have ordered one in the past but at Shake Shack I don't have to feel like an weirdo, I fit right in. 

Shake Shack is by far the most talked about burger as of late in a city full of burger joints.  And Shake Shack is definitely a place that will stick around. I recommend going there.. Its that good!",2,1,3

Let's just say their burgers and fries are indeed good. But I'm a Californian, and I love In-N-Out. The sauce that In-N-Out uses is something that can't be replicated. The Shake Shack Burgers do not have that same sauce that I like, but it is still good in its own way.

I'd been to an East coast Shake Shack so I knew what to expect. A gussied up McDonald's or Five Guys style place with kitschy add-ons and beer. Is what it is...the burgers are slightly better than fast-food and you can get them your way...prices a re dirt cheap and for milling about Las Vegas all day hunger it was a good filler-upperer.

Line was quite long, but the place was easy to find (on the street access off Las Vegas Blvd), attached to the north corner of the NYNY hotel\/casino.

Please is great for Vegas cheats, prices are cheap, food is decent...cannot go wrong. Eventually there will be Shake Shack all around the country as they try to court the gourmet burger market.

Good luck to you Shack!

I was expecting a lot more from this place. Looking at all the reviews, I was anticipating an awesome burger that would make me want to ditch In n Out for good. That was not the case. We got the shack burgers and the shack stack, which were all pretty tasty, but small. For $9.49, I was expecting the Shack Stack to be enormous, but it was smaller than a regular fast food burger. The fries were nothing special, and the cheese fries were ok too. 

Also, it's located on the strip so there's bound to be drunk people and reckless clubbers out. We sat next to the photo taking thing, and there was a huge crowd of obnoxious people yelling and climbing on each others back right next to our food. Thankfully none of them landed in our food.

I'm blown away by all they hype Shake Shack has generated.  Went here a few days ago.  Prices are certainly reasonable but that was the only upside to my review.  Dined here w\/ a party of 3.  The burgers were ok at best!  They were cooked right but lacked flavor.  Our party of 3 split an order of regular fries and cheese fries.  The regular fried came out extremely cold.  I went back up to the counter and exchanged them.  The girl touched them with both her back and front of her hand as if she need to double confirm their coldness factory!  The cheesy fries taste like they have heated up canned cheese atop of them.  Basically Del-taco fries here.

We also had a custard and a concrete which were also just ok especially for the calories listed.  I was hoping the taste would match the calories but it didn't :-(.

It includes one regular burger without cheese with onion, tomato and lettuce, one regular fries, no sauce, one order of a 'chicken hot dog' and one small non-sweet black tea, which they never asked me for a size preference. When I ordered the food I wanted to try something that had chicken in it and the hot dog was the only thing they have, which tasted pretty good in my opinion, it definitely doesn't taste like hot dog meat and more like chicken and not as salty as a regular hot dog. The burger meat was juicy and had the flavor you could expect, fresh onions, lettuce and tomato all in a firm bun. The fries, you'd expect to have been frozen since they're crinkle cut, taste better than what you would make at home from bagged crinkle at the grocery store. The quantity really doesn't justify the price in my opinion, and it is no comparison to IN-N-Out in price, because people comparing to them, which I can get 3 burgers and 2 fries for less than 12 dollars. However, the flavors are there, the fries didn't taste like they were frozen, ever, the patty was juicy and cooked well, all fresh ingredients.

A very expensive upgrade, if you ask me!  Definitely good to try if you've never had Shake Shack before, but I'll take a pass for a cheaper fast food burger.",0,0,0

We stopped by on a Saturday evening, and the place had a line. I went with the Smoke Shack and fries. We were waiting for everyone in our party of 6 to get our food, which actually took longer than expected. They had switched one of my friend's numbers, so she wasn't called until she had to go up to them and ask what happened. She was then given her burger as well as an extra side of fries, so that was nice.

The food itself was smaller than I originally thought. Maybe it was because the Smokeshack didn't have any lettuce in it, or maybe it was because we were ravenous after having bouldered during the day in Red Rocks, or maybe it was due to the wait. In any case, I finished that small burger in like six bites, and it still left more to be desired. The fries were great, though, and I wish they came in bigger sizes too. Perhaps this is a good place to go to after having had some drinks, or maybe I just needed to get a double instead of a single. Either way, the place was solid A-Ok, but definitely didn't live up to the hype for me.",1,1,1

I ordered the following:

Cheese fries 3\/5: I may be biased since I do love fries a lot and the cheese on it made it pretty good. It was nothing special, but just simply cheese on fries. Simplicity at its finest, I guess.

SmokeShack 2\/5: I was so disappointed in the volume and quality of the burger! I really thought there would be more to it, but it was quite plain and the bacon didn't add much to it. I honestly prefer In-N-Out over this.

Food and service met all expectations.  A busser even took my tray as I was getting up to toss it.  Only the men's restroom needed attention, with piled up paper towels making it a mess.

Although the order taker said it would be substantially pink, the beef patty of a ShackBurger ordered ""medium"" was just starting to show pink.  But, festooned within a nice chewy bun with fresh tomato slices, ragged but fine lettuce, Applewood smoked bacon, very tasty pickle chips, and a great orange-colored lubricant known as ShackSauce, the burger was juicy and delicious.  I quickly determined that with a sauce resembling Jack's secret sauce, no mustard was needed.    

A Shack-cago Dog was a little unorthodox being grilled spread-eagle after the all-beef wiener was nearly severed lengthwise in two.  But the grilled meat's juices flowed out and helped make this dog very tasty.  And, when bit into, about the correct amount of zip spurted into the mouth from the included Sport Pickle.  Other than the unconventional treatment of the hot dog itself, and relish that was green but not emerald green, this looked and tasted like a classic and very good Chicago Dog.

Crinkle Cut French Fries and Cheese Fries were springy, flavorful, and satisfying.  And a regular Chocolate Shake was small, but Diane reported that, being rich and chocolately, it was quite ample enough.  We will definitely be back to this very tasty burger and dog joint to enjoy more of the same.",5,2,4

I know that seems to be a bit weird but honestly I've had better burgers and the ones at the Shake Shack are better! There just seems to be a difference in quality that stands out at the Shake Shack. 

So I stuffed my face twice while I was on my trip. They open at 11 am and by 11:09 they were already starting to get busy so I would get there early. We passed by in the late afternoon and the line was WAY out the door. They have an outside line or ""C"" line for drinks and frozen custard only which is helpful when you want something quick. 

I had the SmokeShack which had bacon, chopped cherry peppers and ShackSauce. The cherry peppers weren't too spicy but it gave the burger some good flavor. The bacon was nice and they weren't cheap with it either. 

My second visit I had the 'Shack Stack which has a burger patty and the fried Portobello mushroom on it. The Portobello mushroom is fried and has cheese in the middle of it. It is kinda messy to bite into since the cheese just explodes out of it. While it did add some flavor, I didn't think the breading on the mushroom was all that great. It didn't have enough flavor to it. The meat on the burger though was very good and I enjoyed that. 

I had the cheese fries the first time and the second time I added fried shallots to my cheese fries for a $1.00 more. Adding the shallots was worth the extra buck since it added some salty crunch to the cheese fries. 

I had the shake of the week which was a peanut butter banana and it was good but the flavor seemed to get lost. It didn't matter though because I was still eating frozen custard and that makes it the best. I also had a black & white shake which is really just vanilla and chocolate blended together and that was super creamy and yummy. I also had an 'All shook up' concrete and that had way too much going on. 
The concrete had vanilla custard, Gimme Some Sugar banana peanut butter cheesecake, and chocolate toffee. I didn't really taste the banana peanut butter in the cheesecake and the chocolate toffee got hard to eat as it was getting colder in the custard. 

I loved going here and glad that I don't have to go to New York to try them now. I'll keep coming back because it was good and for what I got it wasn't too bad of a price.",1,0,1

Cheese fries: I'm not a big crinkle cut fry person, I prefer shoestring fries. But these fries were really good!!! Crispy outside and not overly mushy inside. And did I mention cheese? Cheese makes everything better.

Blueberry pie oh my (concrete): honestly nothing spectacular. It was just soft icecream with a few pieces of blueberry pie but not much. Wouldn't order again.

Milk shake - thick, creamy, everything you want in a shake. Only drawback? PRICEY!
Smoke shack - Niman Ranch applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and ShackSauce... everything you want and need in a burger! So tasty - a little smokey, a little spicy, BACON, cheese, seasoned patty.
Special burger of the month - eh, but when in vegas, carpe diem! It was a ""nacho"" burrito with jalapenos and all. A little too spicy and nothing else.
Cheese fries - simple, clean, yes!

What else is served? Plenty - hot dogs, shroom burgers, turkey. Also, beer and wine (we'd had too much at that point, water for me!)

Coming from someone who adores In n Out, this is really saying a lot. Go all out and get the Shack burger with the mushroom and cheese oozing out.

'Shroom Burger (Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, & ShackSauce) - Basically the same as the Shack Burger just with a really well-cooked mushroom. 
Shack Burger (cheeseburger topped w\/ lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce) - Cooked perfectly and the ShackSauce tasted like mayo with sriracha.

Cheese Fries (fries topped w\/ special blend of cheddar and american cheese sauce)

It almost makes me depressed just thinking about it.
For the first time in my life I considered making an appointment with a psychiatrist.
DurIng my downtime late at night I went through my friends list and pondered unfriending anyone that wrote positively about them. 

I would describe the cheese fries this way: think of a bag of frozen fries at the grocery store, warm them up in the microwave a bit so they're soggy and not crispy, and throw on some melted cheese that they use on nachos at Little League and AYSO snack stands.

Ok, now that I got that off my chest, I think I can move on with my life.

Usually an opening with that much negatively would lead to a 1 or 2 star review, but to be fair I will rate Shake Shack as a whole:

+1 star for the spaciousness of their layout and overall presentation
+1 for the outdoor seating facing The Strip 
+1 for their custard window: I could see myself returning just for this
+1 for their burgers: read everyone else's reviews

I ordered a single Shackburger, fries, and a drink, which cost me almost $12. I have food allergies so I asked what was in their Shacksauce and was told that it was a ""secret"". What's funny about the whole thing, aside from them saying their recipe was a ""secret,"" is that there is clearly a sign on their registers that says to ask anyone on the staff about their ingredients, especially if you have food allergies. A quick Google search will give you the ingredients, so no need to ask ;)

The burger itself was good but overall, I just wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be. Their Shacksauce is good, but it didn't really add any necessary flavor to the burger. The fries were good but again nothing new. For the cost, might as well take a cab to In-n-Out just behind the Strip.

I've seen Shake Shack pictures everywhere for YEARS and always wondered what it tasted like, so my boyfriend and I were thrilled when we saw they were building one in Vegas. We ran over here on our first night for dinner - we were so excited. 

The line raps around to the door, but it moved pretty fast. It also gives you enough time to decide on what you want since the menu is pretty large. I decided on the shake stack and he got the smoke shack. We shared an order of fries. 

Shake stack: cheese stuffed deep fried mushroom stacked on top of a burger patty with lettuce, tomato, and shack sauce. I added white onions. Be very careful when eating this because the cheese is ridiculously hot and will ooze out! The mushroom was pretty salty and the patty was smaller than expected. I liked the texture of the bun but wished it was toasted (like at in n out). Not really sure what their sauce is - didn't have much flavor. Animal spread is better, just sayinnnn. 

Smoke shack: cheese burger with bacon. Pretty standard and self explanatory. 

The fries are crinkle cut, so they were nice and crispy. 

Their sodas are not self serve, so you have to ask for a refill, which is kinda a hassle - especially since they're busy. 

Overall, the food was decent but I think my expectations were too high. Their prices are also too high for how little food you get! Come on now, this IS fast food, but you're paying restaurant price. Smh! We were still hungry after this and went to Secret Pizza hahah.

Now that I've experienced it I probably wouldn't go out of my way to return. I'd say go if you've never had it and want to see what the hype is, but you'll probably be disappointed. 

Sticking to in n out! West coast is the best coast!",4,2,4

Now, the fries and custard are fantastic. Absolutely perfect. However, Shake Shack is known as a burger joint. They should ditch the burgers and sell fries and custard only.

After the meal I felt ripped off. And this is the reason I don't frequent Five Guys. If I want to spend that much on a burger I'll go to Flemings and get a steakhouse burger with oozing, dripping flavor.

Stack Shack Burger - in addition to the patty, there is a deep fried mushroom that has melting cheese oozing out in every bite. You know that feeling when you meet someone new that excites you? Well this burger was simply that. However after a couple of more bites, you start to feel like it's a bit more than you can handle. Definitely something you eat once in a while.

The second time I came back, I tried the Shack Burger which is a more classic burger. Patty was juicy and packed with tons of flavor. My friend and I decided to share 1 order of fries. If you love fries like me, know that that was a terrible idea. When I saw the fries I told my friend I wish I had ordered 2. The girl working there heard me and gave me an extra order of fries, seriously made my day!

Now coming from California you know I'm going to throw out the In-N-Out comparison.

the Shack Stack: (im not 100% if the name is right) but its the one that is the cheese burger and includes their infamous fried portabello mushroom stuffed with cheese. $9.95

this was alright but it was just TOO MUCH. I felt so heavy. the double cheese (cheese from the patty and cheese from the mushroom) was just way tooo much they should just have one cheese. It was small but surprisingly very filling. I would go back again for this but would never crave this....

Double shack burger: just a regular double cheese burger. No real special taste. just meh.... (IN-N-OUT Double double FTW! )

Cheezy Fries: i mean they tasted like fries.... frozen fries. and the cheese sauce on top was like melted nacho cheese. i just feel like i can get this at 7-11

That's the question my friend asked me and I literally do not know why I didn't get one because they are amazing! I was lucky enough to get a taste of my friend's strawberry shake and it was creamy and not overly thick. 

The burgers are a bit small for the price and unless you're getting the Shack Stack with the fried portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese, I can't see how you can get full from the regular burgers. What's great about the burgers is that the bun is closed off on one end sort of like a hot dog bun so your ingredients do not fall out. But for almost $10 for my burger, it is definitely not anything to compare with its ""rival"" In N Out in the West Coast vs East Coast debate. In terms of burgers, In N Out wins in my book both for time, price, and taste.

Fries-wise, Shake Shack has the better fries with its crinkle-cut fries and its option of cheese fries which should be a thing across all fast food burger shops.

As for shakes, I also go with Shake Shack just because In N Out shakes are always too thick for me so it's nearly impossible to drink through it without having to use a spoon or wait for it to melt. Shake Shack also have a lot more options in flavors in shakes.",1,0,1

I am one of those few who can honestly say that it's better than In n Out. Many people think I'm crazy and I think it's because they have so much West Coast pride that they don't want to admit it or if it's because I'm sick of In n Out all together. Either way, I must say Shake Shack is oh so divine. Yes, it's not as cheap as In n Out, but their potato buns are so soft, the patties are juicy, different toppings to choose from and it's just delicious. 

Does In n Out have mushrooms? No. Does In n Out have bacon? No. Does In n Out have beer and wine? Nope.

The first time I tried Shake Shack was in New York, we fell in line for over 30 minutes and it was definitely worth it! Thank God, amen, alleluia they opened one in Las Vegas and Los Angeles!

My favorite hands down is the Shack burger with bacon! Plus, this place serves wine, hello!!! Today we tried their newest burger, the Bacon Cheddar Shack burger. It was pretty good.

I can't stop drooling about Shake Shack. I wish they would open one in Orange County, it wouldn't even be a competition to In n Out.",0,0,0

First off, I don't think these two place are comparable at all.  Don't get me wrong, they are both very good but in their own ways.  For example how can you compare fresh cut fries to the frozen crinkled cut?  It's obvious the frozen will be a lot more crispier and light as opposed to the fresh cut.  There is also a HUGE difference in price.  A double double at In-N-out runs less than $3.50 and a Shack Shack burger is $9.49...that's 3x more!  

We spent over $80 for a family of 4 which included the shack shack, shroom burger, shack burger, shackmeister dog, cheese fries, plain fries and three shakes. The food was fresh and a delicious and their bread was nice and soft but a little too soft for my preference.  Had they toasted it a little would have been perfect.  My family didn't think their cheese fries was anything special but their regular fries were nice and crispy.

The Shack stack is the cheeseburger with a fried mushroom. Meat was good, mushroom was good, veggies are fresh & the cheese was pretty tasty.

What happened Shake Shack? The Vegas location was all disappointment and nothing like what I've had in the past. After trying a Shake Shack in NYC I fell in love. You know that high definition TV inside that shows you really glamorous images of Shake Shacks around the world? That was exactly how it felt in NYC. There restaurant was elegant, the customers were all beautiful and everyone was happy and friendly. Vegas felt like a typical fast food hamburger joint with a nice attempt at being more, but nonetheless fell short. The staff behind the counter seemed annoyed at indecisive customers and the amount of time it was taking for them to place their orders (Yes, I know it was CES week and I'm sure none of the customers in line had been to a Shake Shack before and probably spoke English as a second language, but it's no excuse to be rude). 
I don't know what I did to deserve it, but my hamburger came out FLAT. I wish I had taken a picture (the fact that I didn't take a picture meant it was really not Instagram worthy). It was as if someone squished my burger after it came together. 
The fries were good- crispy and on the salt-less side. A+ for those.

I have heard the original Shack is located in NYC and if this is any indication of the original, I'll be coming back to Vegas again and again and again.

We visited the Shack during the less busy season of January so the tourists weren't in FULL swing yet, but it was still quite busy, so we had plenty of time to decide what we wanted because the menu was visible as we stood in line.

We weren't very hungry, but wanted to try a variety of items since it was our first time.  We decided to share a Shack Burger and a Shak-cago Dog.  We also got an order of crinkle fries with cheese and a large diet coke to wash it all down!

  There were 5 of us and our order came to about $21.  We found a large corner booth that fit all of us.  We were given a buzzer to alert us when our dinner was ready.  It took about 7 minutes to get our food and we were super excited!!!

Everything was delicious.  The hamburger was small like a larger slider style and we ate it all quickly! The hot dog was the best, just too small for 5 people to share...haha.  We got back in line and ordered another round of burger, dogs and fries!  We mixed it up a bit and got Smoke Shack burger which was the winner of the night.  

We are heading back again tomorrow for lunch.  Gotta get a concrete icecream sundae :)

Seating was somewhat difficult to find for a group of 5. I can't imagine how difficult it would be to find a place to sit if it was a busier time.

- Shake stack - A burger that has a patty and fried portebello mushroom oozing with sauce and cheese. I shared this and this was a lot!

- Cheese Fries - the cheese sauce was yummy! But also not sure if I like crinkle fries personally. ($3.50..?)

Charton C: F*ck you, I tried Shake Shack once it's much better than In-N-Out, my favorite burger ever.

A lot of HYPE about this burger. The Shake Shack vs In-N-Out dispute went on for months and months, my head started to hurt.
I was under a lot of pressure to try it by these two in my recent trip to Vegas.

(you may be laughing right now, but too bad i'm serious)

Overall, I think In-N-Out makes a better burger
Shake Shack has crazy toppings to bring out more flavors and textures

In-N-Out just tastes fresh, it's TOTALLY California style with the fresh veggies and slim patties
At Shake Shack, the ""Shake Stack"" with the cheese-filled mushroom patty is so friggen amazingly good. I would eat the muenster cheese-oozing mushroom by itself.

In-N-Out double double with all my preferred fixings is $3.45
My Shake ""Stack"" was $9.49

In-N-Out has chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry milkshakes (simple.)
Shake Shack has frozen custard (heavenly), also tried the black & white, coffee (STRONG, they use Stumptown coffee).

At In-N-Out, potatoes are cut in front of your face, straight into the fryer. 
Shake Shack has crinkled fries (""no preservatives"" but I'm guessing once frozen)

So in the end, it's really a fight between East vs West.  It's hard to compare the two because it's a great simple burger vs an ok burger with great toppings. 
All I can say is, get the Shake Stack instead of a regular burger.. that mushroom with the muenster cheese ooze was the best part of my Shake Shack experience",27,21,24

So yes, for those familiar with Shake Shack you can find many locations within New York and all over the East Coast...us West Coast peeps don't have this CHAIN RESTAURANT. So of course, we want to try it out...

I can appreciate the burger is made with quality ingredients (no hormones in their beef) but as far as flavor and taste of the burger goes, there's much left to be desired! Even with their ""Shack Sauce"" it was very plain tasting and could have been seasoned a lot better.

I had the signature ""Shake Stack"" (single patty cheese burger with fried portebello mushrom) and the ""Smoke Shack"" (bacon cheese burger)...and although both burgers tasted just fine...it was lacking that punch to make me go OMG...very overhyped in my humble opinion! 

Price-wise...well I think Shack Shack is popular because you're not gonna find many places that will serve you anything for under $10 on the Las Vegas Strip! The burgers at Shack Shack range from $7-$10 (depending on what kind and how many patties you get). However, the size of the burger was disappointing as I finished the Smoke Shack burger in a couple bites. For the Smoke Shack (single patty), Shack Stack, and an order of fries...I spent $21!! In this case, I rather would pay a lot less to eat at In N Out or pay a couple extra dollars to eat at a sit down restaurant like BURGR at Planet Hollywood or Holstein's in the Cosmo. 

As an additional note, the Summerlin (also in Vegas, in the Summerlin neighborhood) location has a lower rating then the Strip location...like I said...TOURIST TRAP! 

Shake Shack didn't live up to the hype in my opinion and as a true California kid...I rather have In n Out or Habit Burger if we want to talk chain restaurants!

We've heard of the name before so we wanted to try it out. 

Shake Shack just opened before New Year's day so outside there was an introductory line where a guy handed out menus and introduced the items they had to offer. He briefed us on their purpose to use ""all natural premium ingredients"" with no hormones, etc. Briefly looking over the menu we see prices are a bit high than we are used to but it's okay, we're thinking it better be good cause we'd be comparing them to other popular burger joints like Umami Burger and Slater's 50\/50.

Service was efficient; we had gotten our food without much wait. The condiments counter was simple with utensils, lids, ketchup\/mustard, and water. I wish they had the sport peppers on the counter that they use in their dog, which I'll get to in a bit. Chairs and tables here remind me of Mendocino Farms in L.A.; they're made from recycled and sustainable materials. Everything about this joint reminds me that they're trying to do good for the environment and our health. Hipster, as they call it?

The presentation of the food was cute. Each burger fit in a paper sleeve and hot dog and crinkle cut fries sat in small trays. Having said that, we were disappointed in the size of our meal especially for the price we had paid. It's all quality over quantity here so you gotta give up some of your wins from gambling! However, the taste of the burgers were mediocre. I had the single ShackBurger and my bf had the SmokeShack (yes these are registered trademarks already). The ShackBurger was a simple cheese burger with one leaf of lettuce and one slice of tomato. Pretty minimal that I couldn't even taste the ShackSauce (spread). The SmokeShack was a bit better with cherry peppers but nothing really stood out. Turns out they were originally a hot dog stand in New York so it was a good thing my boyfriend ordered a Shackago dog too. This was pretty good with the toppings placed perfectly in and outside the split dog. The sport peppers was really what gave this dog a kick! We had all three concretes: Shack Attack, Jackpot, and All Shook Up, but nothing was that great about it either. I've had better concretes elsewhere.

For now, I think I'd only go back for their hot dogs which isn't much of a selection; neither is their burger choices. Also I'd like to note that their burgers and fries are good because of the quantity of oil they use. Cheese burgers and cheese fries on top of that? To me, that just sounds unhealthy too. So for being a proponent of eating natural, non-GMO, and all that crap, Shake Shack should consider adding much more veggies and using less oil in their items. Just saying!",2,0,1

What I ordered: ShackBurger, Fries, & Small Soda

ShackBurger: You know you see on TV and they take all day to make like the perfect burger. That's what I felt like when I took that first bite of the ShackBurger. The burger patty was cooked to perfection having the juices still intact. The thousand island or ""special sauce"" was little bit too much but hey it didn't get on me.

Fries: Crinkle-cut fries cooked to order and they weren't soggy fries like you get at a certain fast food chain that has the golden arches. 

Small Soda: Well I wouldn't say small but it could represent as a medium. 

Overall: Great food, wait time was relatively long but understandable when it's a busy day so it was worth the wait time.",0,0,0

Got the portabello mushroom burger which was good but its not something I would crave later in life. A little too cheesy for my taste and I love cheese but I guess i dont love it that much!. 

Fries are ok. Cheese fries have nacho cheese which I would just prefer with chips and not on fries. Again, my own preference. 

What really got under my skin....was the staff. 
Ok so my friend orders a shake stack, fries and a lemonade. All of our orders were coming out and hers was taking a bit. She goes up to the counter and it looks like someone else just took her order. The staff goes to the table where her order was and takes the food from that party and comes back and says ""Here you go"" to my friend. ummmmmmm.....ok i understand that the food wasnt eaten yet but it was sitting at another table.
Restaurant etiquette 101: YOU DO NOT GIVE SOMEONES ORDER TO SOMEONE ELSE AND THEN RETURN IT TO THEM AND EXPECT THEM TO BE OK WITH IT! 
YOU MAKE THEM A NEW ORDER. 

My Friend complains and the manager comes and asks whats wrong with the order. My friend tells her the situation and the manager replies with..""Oh you can take that one"". Yea, NO. 

They finally got the point and made her a new order, which they brought over to our table so was still questionable if it was a new one or if they just walked to the back and pretended to bring out a fresh order.

I liked the burger, but if I were ever to happen upon Shake Shack again, I would skip the fried stuffed mushroom. The concept sounded delicious, but I was disappointed in the execution.

Fries were average. Shake was average. The burger had fried shallots which were a great addition. Put that on the list of ideas that someone should have thought of sooner. My issue is that the burger seemed kinda smallish. I got the double and paid $8.99 I think. I guess for that amount I'm either expecting a larger burger or one with premium meat.

The burger wars are really heating up on the Vegas strip and Shake Shack benefits from a great location just outside New York New York.  Overall I'd put this place maybe on par with Bobby Flay's place a block down but nowhere near as good as the Broadway Burger Grill inside NY-NY.",1,0,0

As such, we had limited appetites and disproportionately soaring expectations. (Vegas first world problems.)

1) The CHEESEBURGER is satisfying though not gourmet. There's nothing fancy like bleu cheese and caramelized onions, but it's a carefully tuned version of the classic cheeseburger with cheddar\/lettuce\/tomatoes. Compared to In-N-Out, Shake Shack stands out with the thicker, juicy patty and the soft, brioche like bun. The SHROOM BURGER is quite good with panko fried portobello, though the mushroom patty is thinner than I'd like.

2) I really liked the CRINKLE CUT FRIES. I may be biased, growing up with a crinkle cut mold in my play dough cooking set and having this ingrained in my mind as the paradigm French fry. Nonetheless, it's something about the texture that somehow makes it extra delicious--my theory is that the shape increases the surface area to volume ratio to augment crispiness. I think I prefer the original to the CHEESE BACON FRIES, which had a savory flair of bacon and bell pepper; unfortunately it gets somewhat soggy and takes away from the crinkle-cut-ness texture.

3) The FROZEN CUSTARD was the highlight, velvety smooth, rich and decadent, with a full-bodied vanilla flavor. It tasted like quintessential vanilla ice cream, except with a creamier consistency somewhat like the intermediate between non-melted and melted ice cream. 

All in all, the visit was a 3-star experience: satisfactory but not mind-blowing. The portions seemed small for the price (like gourmet burger small). It does seem that Shake Shack is a bit over-hyped, which may have contributed to our slight disappointment. My advice would be to go to Shake Shack with a mindset that it's almost similar to In-N-Out--the food is good here, but it's not the place for your grandiose Vegas-level expectations.",5,1,1

The line was fairly long and they were getting things out really, really slow.  At least they are reasonably priced.  We got out with a root beer float and a concrete for under $12.  

The concrete was the wrong flavor, but with how long the wait and lines are there is no way I'm going to go back and ask for it to be fixed.  It was decent, but I think if it had been the flavor I wanted (and like), it would have been much better.  The root beer float was disappointing.  ~$6 for some root beer and 2 small scoops of ice cream is lame.  My girlfriend wasn't too impressed with it either and ended up tossing it out half full.

I had Shake Shack a few years ago in NY, and thought it was good, but not mind blowing good. It is exactly the same with this Vegas location. Imo, burger here is better than other burger restaurants from celebrity chefs in Vegas, taste, portion and price wise. The burger is small (enough for small person like me, but big guy should get two), and I love portion control so it works well for me. At $5, it is inexpensive but not cheap for a single burger. A Shroom Burger is almost $10, expensive but is a must try for first timer since it is quite unique. The meat is well seasoned, on the dry side but still acceptable.

You've had these burgers before. They are sometimes under the names of Jim's, Jakes, Hi-Life, Johnny's, or any burger joints you find on the roadside. It's the same thing, but perfected. Delicious. Seasoned and grilled at the right temperature. Fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and toasted buns.

There's a shakesauce but I think it's just thousand islands. Not sure.

You've also never experienced a roadside joint like this. It's upscale for this type of food and a fun decor. They also gave me a hamburger wristband during my visit!! You'll be paying upscale prices and that's my beef with this place. Whereas with Jim's you can get a combo for $5. Here? Double that.

Is it worth twice the amount? Are you getting whoppered if you do? $10 for the perfect roadside burger once or twice a year I would do in a heartbeat. I wish I had room for the ice cream. I heard that's really good.",3,1,1

It is what it is.  But Shake Shack coming from NYC, a place known for its diversity (as is Las Vegas), really should invest in cultural awareness training for their employees.

As for the food - mediocre.  I've had Shake Shack when in NYC, and I loved it there.  Warm and goey and delicious.  THIS SS really has lowered its standards.  My burger arrived cold.  The goey cheese inside the fried mushroom was chunky, not gooey.

(But Tiffany, this is a burger joint, what did you expect?) Fair enough, although McDonalds' has filet-o-fish. (How dare you compare Shake Shack to something like McDonalds'). Given that I wasn't smart and didn't look up my options before hand, I'm not docking points for not having more veggie\/seafood options, but rather judging Shake Shack for the items that I did eat. And my review will be more for those don't\/can't eat their usual burgers.

I came here on a Friday night around 6pm; there was a decent line, and the restaurant was pretty full. I like that there was a HUGE menu that you could read from anywhere in the line (unless, the line is out the door and around the block). I ordered regular fries and a strawberry mint lemonade, because I don't like mushrooms. One thing that I liked was the buzzers that they give you when you order. This means that you can wait at a table and chat with your friends instead of crowding around the pick up area. 

My food comes out pretty quickly considering how many customers there were. My friend ordered the mushroom burger, and because it was ""crisp-fried,"" it took a while to cook. I'm hesitant to say that I was quite disappointed in both of the items that I got. I feel like the shape of the fries affected the texture, so, the fries were not a hit in my book. The fries were on the soggier side as opposed to crunchy or crisp. The lemonade tasted watered down. I guess I expected something more sour or tart, but all I tasted as a slight hint of sweet lemonade.

I wrote a review comparing them to In-n-Out (see link below); and I did complain about their soggy hand-cut fries, but it looks like that location has gone back to crinkle-cut like this LV location!

My cousin and I visited late night so the line was pretty quick. The service was friendly, and my cousin even got some free crinkle cut fries! The presentation of the burger was much better here (you'd think it'd be similar\/the same since it's a corporate company) - similar to In-n-Out, the buns flared out a bit so you could easily see the inside.

As usual, I got my Smoke Shack which was awesome as always. Much spicier from the cherry peppers than I remember from Chestnut Hill. They had a good amount of bacon in every bite, and the patty was juicy! Their buns are also on the softer-sweeter side which I actually like but some may not prefer it. 

Lastly, I was also happy to see crunchy, crinkle-cut fries in comparison to the soggy ones I've had before at their other location. 

Overall, great experience. I'll be back since this is my closest Shake Shack to San Diego (hopefully, just for now)!

The breaded crust on the portobello mushroom is like the outer layer of a really good onion ring and gives it a nice crunch before hitting the hot cheesy center.

I had a chick named Inez ring me up and she was the best! I had this for my last meal in Vegas and I wanted to take some back home for my family.

The all shook up concrete was good and the fries were better than I remember. The inside was nice and creamy and salted perfectly.

As many fast food places are: you order, take a seat, and wait for your buzzer to go off to grab your food. Lines are quite long but go fairly fast and service is phenomenal. 

Of course I had to try a SHAKE, hence the name! Our cashier said the 2 most popular shakes are the strawberry and coffee. The strawberry was so so, nothing amazingly special, I'll have to try the coffee next time. The strawberry shake tasted exactly like in n out burgers strawberry shake, but just more expensive. The cups seem small.

The BURGERS I tried were the Shackburger and the Smoke Shack Burger. I enjoyed the regular Shackburger more. The burger buns were made like pockets, I thought that was very creative and cool. The special shack sauce they used was tasty. And cheese was really good. The burger patty was a bit chewy. And the FRIES, the crinkled fries were my favorite part!!! We tried both the cheese fries and regular fries, both very crispy and again cheese was very delicious! Overall, I prefer in n outs burgers more, but fries more at the shake shack.

Parking: Park at New York New York. Free the first hour! They don't do validation here, so if you don't want to pay extra, order fast and eat fast! 

Access: You actually don't get access to Shake Shack from inside New York New York. You actually have to walk through the hotel and onto the strip. The entrance is very easy to locate, the giant Shake Shack sign is a dead giveaway.

Line: Due to the ongoing hype, the line is pretty long. It wraps around inside, but they have huge menus for you to look at while waiting to order your food. The wait was probably 10-15 minutes.

Seating: Plenty of seating available. My friends spotted a table right away, it's a little dirty but it's a fast food restaurant. We cleaned it up ourselves anyway.

Food: I got the single patty cheeseburger with a side of crinkle cut fries. The cheeseburger was really good. Patty was cooked medium, so it was very juicy. It was a good size too, I wasn't overly stuffed when I was done with my burger. The fries were extremely amazing. Deep fried, crispy, and not soggy! I usually don't like large crinkle cute fries, but these fries totally made me change my mind!

I was on a tight schedule to get out of Las Vegas and wanted something quick before hopping on the 15 back to LA. This did not disappoint, but I'm reserving a raving review for when I try more of the menu.

My order: basic single shack burger, fries, and a scoop of the custard.
1.  Maybe its my Californian blood talking but I still prefer In-N-Out's fries. They were crispy enough here, but the price is higher and they seemed to get colder easily. When In-N-Out's fries are freshest they are super hot, crispy, and airy on the inside, which their fries were not by the end of my meal.
2. I may have to give it to these guys on the burger. The bun had a mellower, chewier taste that I loved, kinda reminiscent of asian bakery breads\/Hawaiian sweet rolls. The patty was more substantial and juicier. The cheese\/lettuce\/etc was forgettable, but that's always true. Some regrets about not getting the bacon burger or the mushroom stacked one though!
3. I'll pass on the custard next time. I could be turning into an ice cream snob, but very few ice cream places impress me outside of hagan daz and liquid nitrogen places like Creamistry.

Price: for an order of 3 single shack burgers, 2 fries, and a custard it was 27 bucks. It's more than I'm used to paying for burgers but I'm going to chalk it up to the Las Vegas prices. I swear even the Starbucks was more here than in LA.

Service\/Atmosphere: 
Very efficient for a long ass line! I was initially confused as to why the door was closed and people were waiting outside, but soon realized that it was because the line snaked out the door already at 12pm on a Monday. There was an employee outside though that made small talk with us as she managed the crowds, which made waiting in the increasing heat bearable.

The menus are posted in large print while you're in the lines so you can decide. Their buzzer system is great because you can snag a seat and chat while you wait instead of obsessively listen for numbers. The water, ketchup, etc, is centrally located and kept clean. The cleanup workers were also super sweet! A lady walked around our area looking to help patrons clear out their dishes to the trash as they are done eating.

And boy, it did not disappoint! Can't wait to have it again.

For a Friday afternoon in Vegas, the wait for Shake Shack was not as busy as one would think, but it was still very packed in the seating areas. We were in line to order for about 10 minutes, and were able to find a table and retrieve our food in about 15. While in line the staffmember was very helpful with familiarizing us with the menu, and even playfully invited us to compare the experience with In-N-Out (which I will get to later)!


* Food * 
Our party ordered a number of yummy menu items. 

Savory
1) ShackBurger - Has lettuce, tomato and Shack Sauce, and is possibly the most comparable to an In-N-Out cheeseburger. The patty is MINDBLOWINGLY delicious. I miss it already. 

2) SmokeShack - A unique burger that features Shake Shack's signature red peppers. Any burger with bacon gets an A+, and this is no exception.

3) Cheese Fries - Crinkle cut fries topped with a special, creamy American and cheddar cheese sauce (TIP: Ask for bacon and red peppers on top!).

Sweet
1) Neapolitan Shake - My love asked for a combination of the strawberry, chocolate and vanilla frozen custards and they gladly complied. Possibly the best neapolitan shake I've tried.

2) Blueberry Concrete (Flavor of the Week) - A concrete is a more dense version of the shake (think McFlurry's from McDonald's... but 10x better). This concrete had blueberries mixed in and it was wonderful.

3) *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED* Shack Attack Concrete - By far one of the best chocolate desserts I've ever ordered. This concrete was creamy, chocolatey, and filled with plenty of delicious mix-ins such as sprinkles, dark chocolate chunks and chocolate truffle cookie dough.  


* The Verdict: Shake Shack vs. In-N-Out * 
After discussing it with my friends post-meal, I have decided that the two burger chains do not invite comparison with one another bc they're in entirely different, elite leagues. SORRY if that's not what you want to hear! While their menus seem similar and their burgers are similar sizes size, their offerings, quality and taste are both on another level.

As a born and raised SoCal girl, my heart will forever love In-N-Out. There's nothing like a classic #3 hamburger, protein style with animal style fries and a chocolate shake. But their desserts do not hold a candle to Shake Shack's epic frozen treats menu. Shake Shack admittedly has a more extensive menu, so their prices do not compare to In-N-Out's affordable menu. 

Overall - head to Shake Shack for more menu options and great flavor and taste, but if you're looking for simple, classic and tasty options for the best value, then In-N-Out is the way to go.",13,9,13

My closest buddies were planning to have lunch there, and my game plan was to meet them at this specific restaurant--which initially made me think, this place must be the bomb. 

We all came here for lunch on Saturday afternoon after a night of crazy shenanigans.  Located right on the Strip, part of the NY NY property, there was no line--very lucky and surprised for a Saturday afternoon.

We placed our orders, and waited for a good ten minutes (much shorter than what I thought since it was crazy busy inside).  I will say that getting a table here is quite difficult because of the massive crowds, however people do get up and leave and that's the time to grab any table, essentially, when dining with 9 other people.  

The burgers are to die for, in my opinion.  Sure, it's not a $20 burger, but for the price, this beats In N Out.  The fries are so-so, but hey, the most important item on the menu is the burger right?  The volume is quite thick, and one can easily get full of the one burger.  

I must say that it was so fulfilling, and it was actually a nice place to eat.  It's got a young crowd to it.  

So the most important question, as maybe some of you yelpers always find from my reviews....would I come back here again?  Yes, most definitely.

If you love burgers Shake Shack is a good fairly-inexpensive spot to check out while visiting Vegas. There was a line when we went, but it is definitely worth trying at least once.  

Between the four of us, we ordered 2 single Shack Burgers ($5.29\/each), 2 Shack Stacks ($9.59\/each) and 2 orders of Fries ($2.99\/each) to share. After ordering and paying at the cashier, we got pagers that would notify us when our orders were ready. While we waited, we grabbed our condiments and found a nice booth to sit down at. The seats here are first come, first serve. 

The one thing that really stood out to me was the potato bun that these burgers are served on.

I feel like the burger at Shake Shack is better than your average burger, but definitely not as good as a gourmet burger. The prices are a bit high for such a standard choice and the wait deters me from considering a return in the near future. I might go to their California location if it's convenient, but there are many alternate options for me to explore in Vegas before paying this place a second visit.",24,19,21

There is definitely lots of space for everybody here. They got big long tables in the back. The front is a bit small compared to the rest of the restaurant. It can feel very tight if there's a lot of people in line. There was only 6 of us and I felt it was tight, no room to move at all. 

The lines were super quick, we ordered fries and a cheeseburger. They gave us buzzer and off we went to just go sit down. The buzzer system is way better than number calling, especially when it's busy and crowded. 

The food comes on a silver tray. The condiments are on the side as per usual fast food places. I wasn't hungry so I only took a bit and I thought it just tasted like hamburger. The patty is super duper flat. So it does have a  char taste. I'm not a fan as this style tastes dry to me. The fries are fries. Who doesn't love fries? 

They have custard ice cream, OOOHH YUM! Didn't try the custard but I heard it was okay.

Their burgers are just top notch: fresh, delicious, savory and full of so much flavor. Their juicy patties topped with cheese, bacon, peppers and stuffed into a potato bun is heaven. I never cared for crinkle cut fries because I always associated them with frozen food, but Shake Shack's crinkle cut cheese fries are addicting. When I want a good beer, I get their Shackmeister. When I want to add more calories to my diet, I get one of their many shake options. Always a hit, too.

The husband visited a SS location in Pennsylvania recently and gave me the skinny on the set up. He said the fries were the winner and that I would appreciate the crispness. He also predicted that I would like the bread, claiming it tastes like sweet Asian bread.
We were in town for Halloween weekend and decided to walk to New York New York to have lunch at Shake Shack from the Palazzo. Working up the appetite while being 7 months pregnant, we decided to split a burger and fries while I topped the meal off with a shake and the husband ordered a brew. The black and white shake was nothing to write home about. The burger itself reminded me of a cross between Smashburger and Hopdoddy's. The patty is thin with crispy edges. The bread is not your average bun, but it also didn't really stand out to me. Overall, it's the same size as an In and Out burg. Those crinkle cut fries though.
Damn.
Very crispy. I never knew crinkles could taste this good! Guy's burger place at The Linq are pretty similar- though the difference is you get a mix of different type of fries at his place.

So naturally, I feel like I am committing some form of infidelity by writing this review.  The burger was exceptional.  I have tried the Shack Burger and the Smoke Shack.  My wife had their shroom burger.  We have been back 4 times.  

Notably, we are from Southern California and don't gamble.  So yes, I have craved the Shack bad enough to drive 3.5 hours, enjoy the Shack, and turn around and drive another 3.5 hours.  The burger is juicy and tender, the toppings are always fresh (a bi-product of quality selection and high-turnover), and the bun is an excellent choice.

Four things to know if you are thinking about going:

1) The line can be exceptionally long.  Honestly, I am always impressed with how fast they move the line.  I cannot complain, but some people need instant burger gratification.  This may not be the place (but by that token maybe avoid In-n-Out too).  

2) The fries are crinkle cut and plain.  It feels a little odd to have such a dressed up well-planned (and executed) burger and then a small tray of crinkles next to it.  I personally am fine with it because they have always been cooked perfectly and seasoned well, but this may turn some people off. 

3)  The burgers are somewhat simple.  Some of their burgers are a little more intricate, but for the most part they are pretty standard.  That said, they take the simple and make each ingredient as spectacular as possible.  The way they ""dress up"" their burgers is to elevate each ingredient individually.  

4) Finally, the price is a little steeper than some other chains.  Everything is served a la carte, so it ends up being around $15 a person for a burger, fries, and drink.  I personally would take this restaurant over any of the ""sit-down"" chains in the price range like Chilis or Red Robin.  I don't have a problem for this reason.  If you are looking for a better costing option - I can't reccomend the In-n-Out across Interstate 15 enough.",1,1,1

Shake Shack has always had spot in me and my wife's heart. I've been living in NYC for 6 years and never a single time was disappointed with the burger. Now I live in SF and missed Shake Shack so much until we arrived in Vegas and wanted to eat the burger as soon as we step our feet to the ground of Sin City.

This place is very fancy though. Much more fancier than any location in NYC. Service was quick and easy. On top of that the employees are super friendly! Big plus on that.. They took our tray as soon as we finished (with ).

I got the 'shroom burger (vegetarian), which is a portobello mushroom with muenster cheese, lightly battered and fried. Surprisingly it wasn't too greasy or filling. It was perfect with their signature sauce.

Hubby got the double cheeseburger which to me the meat taste like in n out but with a different kick and flavor in their signature sauce. I think they mixed a bit of horseradish and vinegar in it for that kick which was delicious! Compared to In n out though, they give you more meat which is thicker but then again its much costly. 

Hubby prefers In n out while its hard to compare in my opinion as they both have their own flavors. Both are great!

I also got the cheese fries which they use the nacho cheese sauce which I love. Well im the worse person to ask in regards to the cheese because I just love cheese in general. No one calls me the dairy queen for nothing, you know. So if you don't like nacho cheese, get it plain.

Tried the shake as that's what everyone pretty much come here for but i have to say i wasn't a fan of it. Very filling and too sweet for my pallet. Level of sweetness is a bit sweeter than a coca cola on comparison and density is literally like a semi melted ice cream. Very thick\/creamy. So if you like your shake very sweet and dense, you will like it. We got the black & white and the vanilla. Their most popular is black&white and PB.

Overall, great place, not too greasy for a burger joint. A bit too costly though for amount you get. So have to (minus 1-star).",0,0,0

The burgers are dressed such that you can appreciate the flavor of each ingredient (there's not too many toppings, and one does not overpower any of the others). The burgers are half-wrapped in paper, making the eating much easier, as you can hold the burger by the paper and not have it drip all over you.

I had heard about this small chain but never tried it because there aren't any locations in my home state. Luckily this brand is gradually expanding and openly welcomes customer feedback (suggestions, praise, complaints). During the course of my 3 day vacation I dined here twice. They are open later on weekends so that was very convenient since we don't always eat at typical meal times when in Vegas.

Per my sister's recommendation, I tried the shake stack which is a traditional burger with a unique addition. Nestled in the middle of my burger was a fried portobello mushroom with gooey cheese that oozed out when bitten. If you aren't a fan of mushrooms you can order a regular burger, and if you're a vegetarian they have a burger with all of that minus the beef patty.

Word of caution, be sure to wait before taking a bite! Everything is made fresh from the moment you place your order. If you're an avid fan of fried food then you're all too familiar with the sensation of hot oil burning the roof of your mouth. The portobello mushroom is no different! Not only is the crispy crust emitting heat, but the mushroom and cheese inside are piping hot too. I wasn't given this warning before my first big chomp and quickly regretted my impatient stomach's desire to eat right away. This may not be a tactic that everyone would agree with, but my second time around I pressed down on my burger to squish the mushroom center enough to burst the crispy outer crust. Yes, cheese came oozing out immediately, but it allowed my food to cool down faster so that I could eat sooner :)

If you're ever in the Las Vegas area do your stomach and palate a favor and eat at Shake Shack! Here is a useful or maybe not useful list of all the lucky states\/state capital that have been blessed with SS locations (Maryland, New York, Texas, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and DC)

Make that... overrated and over-hyped. Other than In-N-Out, I wasn't looking to a particular place in Vegas more than Shake Shack. Clearly, I was disappointed. While my pictures may make you think ""Damn, that looks good..."", don't let them deceive you. The fries? Simple crinkle cut may-as-well-be-frozen fries. Not bad, not good, they're whatever. They have a cheese sauce they put on them, but I'm pretty confident it's the same radioactive goop you'd find on your nachos at a carnival or baseball game or what have you.

The burger was decent, thought the patty was fast food patty\/paper thin. For the price, I expected a lot more. My Shack Stack was a little salty, and almost tasted more like a grilled cheese with lettuce and tomato more than a burger. The Shack Stack has a fried portabello and cheese patty looking thing on it, which is set on top of a burger patty... the problem is, that pretty much overpowers the wafer thin hamburger. Was it bad? No, not at all, but factoring in my expectation, what people say about the place, and the price, I don't feel inclined to revisit. 

My girlfriend's Jackpot ice cream or shake or blizzard or whatever they call it was pathetic in appearance ... half melted and not loaded with toppings like suggested. Despite that, it was very good, and the best thing I had at Shake Shack.

Shake Shack may well taste amazing after a long night of drinking in Vegas, but as a sober guy just looking for a midnight snack, Shake Shack just didn't cut it for me... not to mention Shake Shack (as of July 1st) doesn't honor room charges. Boo... $20 for a mediocre meal.",5,2,2

I mean, why, In-n-Out is easily the best burger in the NATION. But I followed the hype during my last 3 trips to Sin City and found my way to its sunny outdoors location right outside New York New York.

My first trip in February, I got the classic ShackBurger, which is basically a fancy cheeseburger with fancy pink sauce, their famous ShackSauce. Eh, it was okay. While I thought the yellow-y bun was good, the meat was a little over-cooked and definitely didn't sink into my mouth. The next trip, in June, I decided to go with something a little different, venturing over to their flat-top dogs. (Why is it called that?) I got the ShackMeister Dog (again, with the weird names--In&Out keeps it simple\/classic) which has cheese sauce and ""Ale-marinated shallots."" Whatever those are. For $4, it's a pretty decent size\/interesting taste, but it's definitely not a meal. Finished it in four or five bites... so I had to order the cheese fries. Which are basically crinkle-cut fries with melted American cheese on it. Meh, I'd give that trip's meal a solid 6, maybe 7.

But this past weekend's trip, on Halloween--now THAT was a game changer. I wanted to take my boyfriend here because it was his first time in Vegas with me, and I wanted to see what he thought of the infamous East Coast fast food chain. In short: he got the SmokeStack, satisfying his love of bacon, and he LOVED it. Said the bacon made it amazing and he was the best thing he's had. (But he still likes the Habit better.) And i went back to the burger route, this time trying something new and WAY better--the Shack Stack, combining my love of traditional cheeseburgers and mushrooms (not the gross kind)! and I don't know if it was hunger or the long night before or what, but it was HEAVEN. Finally, something that combines all my taste buds with something different and new--a twist on the classic Cheeseburger--and I'm a fan. 

Overall, ShakeShack is pretty good. It's a pretty quality burger. And when in Vegas, it's definitely one of those must-go stops because it's the closest one to the West Coast. But hey, I'm from Southern California, so I gotta be loyal.",0,0,1

This is probably our 5th time here since it opened in town. I always go for either the Shack Stack or Smoke Shack. Flavors are novel and so inventive. IMHO this trumps the other popular West coast-based burger chain with cult following. Also love the Black and White shake and Shack Attack concrete. 

So it is with mixed feelings that I have to put out a word of caution. Two members of our group had symptoms of food poisoning (upset stomach and more). The only thing they ate which was different from the rest is the Black and White shake. I hope this is just a fluke. They recovered in a day or two.

I ordered a shack stack with bacon and man, it was so delicious. Their fried portobello mushroom with melted cheese inside is to die for. I never had something like that and oh my god, I'm so happy I was able to experience such delicious-ness. I wish they had avocado as a topping because that would have made it more delicious. And man oh man, their crinkle cut fries tastes so much better than In-n-Out fresh cut fries. I can probably eat a whole basket to myself but the burger surprisingly filled me up before I could even finish it. Don't let the small burger deceive you and over order! 

The only con was that the burger was a little too greasy for my liking, making it hard to finish but it was good so I had to force myself to finish it lol. Also, their cheese fries are a disappointment. The cheese is the cheese you would buy in bulk to make nachos, you should skip that. Be prepared to wait forever though because the lines are crazy.

The burger patties were pretty small (see photo) and I requested for extra tomatoes and only received a total of 3 small slices. Their shacksauce wasn't memorable and I ended up excluding it from the burger. Sometimes I think, ""hmm maybe I just didn't order the right thing"", but then I remind myself that if the plain hamburger is lackluster, then they probably shouldn't have it on the menu. The crinkle fries were ordered as well done and were tasty, but I still prefer thin-cut fries (especially shoestring!).

I like the burger as it is simply beef flavor. I am actually the type who don't like too many things going on making me not tasting the beef. I eat beef for liking the beef taste, not the condiment. So I like the way they do it, fits my need. And the burger is a bit greasy which I have no problem with, I like beef patty having the beef fat taste, I hate those that has plant oil taste. It is just my preference and they happened to fit my need. I also can tell the difference in taste for hormone free beef and conventional beef. I don't like the taste of the beef that was raised with hormones or antibiotics. So another reason I like the taste of shake shack burger.

We both like the concrete, the dairy tasted fresh and soft, the texture was good, the creaminess was right, good consistency, I was so glad that I had this instead of gelato. 

I know I can probably make the same quality of beef patty at home as long as I go to Whole Foods to get the hormone free or even organic beef. But honestly, when you eat out, the reason is that you don't have time to cook or even do dishes, or you are on the street being hungry and need to be fed right away. So I can't say that it is not special because I could probably make the same thing at home. The price is not bad too. And I got to eat the way I want without cleaning all the grease splattering around my stove and countertop. And I don't think I have the stamina to make fresh ice cream daily myself too though I am capable. So yah, I recommend this place if you are like me who don't eat conventional beef or dairy. I like every bite I had here. 

A note for people who have allergy. Their fries are made with just potato, no additives, but fried in soy oil, so if you have soy allergy, don't do fries then. The hot dog is also made with hormone free, antibiotic free meat, and there is no nitrite or nitrate, we are gonna try the hot dog next time when we are around the area. If you have allergy, tell the cashier so he\/she can tell you what items you shouldn't try.",0,0,0

Having Californian allegiances, I have to go with In-N-Out but not by much. One win Shake Shack owns is a pretty decent beer selection. The ShackMeister Ale is actually a pretty legit amber brewski that pairs well with the burgers and fries. I appreciate the fresh lettuce and tomato on the namesake burger but the patty, while legit in its own right, is slightly less juicy than its Californian comparison. Still an overall decent burger though. Can't say the same about the fries unfortunately. This is where In-N-Out's fresh cut fries win.

The restaurant itself is actually just outside of the hotel, and is currently (may never be, I don't know) not accessible from inside. It's a pretty good size space, and has a ton of seating, from booths to tables, and even some weird, but cool lounge style areas. They've also got their own restroom inside, which is a nice touch. It could just be me, but having to walk out of a restaurant and look for a bathroom somewhere else in the casino is annoying.

Now, when you first walk up the steps and inside, you'll see a big menu board right where the line forms. On more then one occasion during our visit, the line was almost out the door. So, if you're able to find one, I'd look for a paper menu to view while waiting. On that menu, they not only have burgers, but also a few hot dogs and dessert options like milkshakes and concretes. They've also got a decent selection of drinks including draft root beer, several beers choices, wine and even Stumptown Cold Brew. Sadly, it's just bottled and price almost $1 higher then anywhere else.

I ended up ordering a previously limited special burger that they've now but all turned into something that will always be available, according to the cashier at least. It's called the ShackMeister and comes topped with beer marinated shallots, cheese and their own ShackSauce. For whatever reason, they only allow burgers to be cooked either medium or rare, and even those choices aren't listed anywhere. Even so, the meat was decent and seasoned well. I'd highly recommend getting at least a double though, as the patties are only 4oz. My burger had a good amount of cheese on top, and the crispy shallots added a nice texture. They also use potato buns, which I thought was a kind of soggy, but good and still had a little chew to it. The ShackSauce however, was all but impossible to taste. 

We also ordered some cheese fries and milkshakes. The fries aren't anything spectacular on the own, but they're nice and crispy, and the cheese blend they use to top them is actually really good. My malted Coffee Fair shake was pretty tasty and had a nice strong coffee flavor, but it was pretty thin for being malted, and not sure it was worth $6 for how small it was.
 
Speaking of prices...I expected them to be up there, but not this high. All the items on the menu are a la carte style and my burger alone was $9. Our order of 2 burgers, 1 fry, 1 drink and 3 milkshakes was $44 and some change. With everything we ate tasting very similar to something like In-N-Out or even Steak 'n Shake, it prevents me from giving them anything other than a 3 star rating.

Their service however, is well deserving of 5 stars. Our party of 10 and then 2 others who showed up laters were constantly checked on by more then one employee. Because they don't have an actual soda fountain, the employees have to go around checking to see if you need a refill. We were there eating and chatting for well over an hour, and never had empty drinks. 

For visitors, I can certainly see why it'll be popular and do extremely well. It's a decent burger, the shakes are quite good and the service is excellent. But for locals, past trying it for the first time, I can't see many going out of their way for something that's similar to what you can get for half the price from places easier to get to all over town. With that being said, I'd still eat here again, I just won't be rushing back.",7,6,6

I wouldn't get a milk shake with the meal since a burger and fries was enough to fill me up.

I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quick bite before getting somewhere. Best average quality burger you can get in my opinion.",0,0,0

I watch a lot of CNBC. And within that context, I have been hearing a lot about Shake Shack in recent months. The hype got me curious--but I am not going to travel from CA to the East Coast for a hamburger.  So while in Las Vegas, I made a deliberate trip to the Shake Shack location on The Strip, on the New York New York casino property.

I visited on a Saturday night at about 11:00pm. The place was packed - not a surprise. The kitchen staff was active, and they had staff to constantly clean the dining room to accommodate the turnover of patrons.  The décor was very nice: modern, bright, and very inviting. This location had a both indoor and outdoor seating. There is a patio misting system to cool the outdoor dining area.

Since I knew nothing of this chain, I stuck to the basics:  I ordered a Double Shack Burger with cheese; ""standard fries"", and a vanilla milk shake.

The vanilla shake:  It was a very good vanilla milk shake. I cannot say that it is the best I have ever had, but it was not poor, and definitely better than mediocre.

The French fries:  Their offering of French fries is the ""crinkle cut"" variety. When served, the French fries were hotter than warm--but not ""piping"" hot. I was surprised. Based on the rate at which the kitchen was turning out orders, I would have thought that the fries would have been ""freshly hot"". They were warm and flaky on the inside, with just a slight ""crunch"" to the surface. I was not disappointed--but not impressed either.

The ""Shack Burger"":  I am sure that they have some story about their hamburger bun. The first thing that I noticed was that the upper and lower halves were conjoined, like a clam shell. The standard double burger had two patties, cheese, lettuce and tomato, along with their signature sauce. The hamburger was nice and hot--surprising, since the fries were not. The beef was juicy and flavorful.  All in all, it is a very good hamburger.  

But while eating the Shack Burger, the flavor palate reminded me of another burger I have eaten. Then it struck me:  the Shack Burger's tastes a lot like an ""In-and-Out"" burger. The flavors of the Shack Burger are a bit lighter, not as strong, but the resemblance is there.

The total bill for my meal was a little over $17.00. (If I wanted the same combo at In-and-Out, the cost for my meal would have been about $7.00.)
 
All said, it is a good hamburger. This location is very nice if you are already on The Strip, and are seeking eating options. I just don't understand what all the hype is about this chain.",2,0,1

So what makes The Shake Shack different from all the rest?

In one simple answer: ""The Shack Stack burger ."" A breaded and fried, portobello mushroom stuffed with gooey cheese on top of a juicy cheese burger. 

This is what separates shake shack from everyone else. Although they offer regular burgers and cheese burgers as well as hotdogs, it's the uniqueness of the shack stack that I found SS a burger place I would keep coming back to. 

On the downside, the price for the shack stack is just under $10.00 and nothing else but the sandwich. You may order  fries or cheesy fries or just a thick custard based milk shake.

The lines aren't as long and out the door as the other locations I've visited in NY, Chicago, or Los Angeles so the wait to order wont be a slog. Additionally, service is very fast so you're sure to be in and out in no time. In regards to taste, the Shack Burger doesn't hold a candle to what we've had in Chicago, Los Angeles or New York. While it may look the same, well maybe a bit more sloppy, the taste wasn't there for me. Where the previous Shack Burgers I've had were juicy and flavorful, this locations Shack Burger was quite dry. The patties were misshaped and cooked well done. No amount of sauce of cheese could have saved it. Maybe the quick service isn't a good idea when you don't have the time to do some quality control. The fries were the same overpriced frozen crinkled fries.

Special to this location, they offer a Bacon Cheddar Shack Burger. This was definitely a winner with the cheddar cheese giving me flashes of Umami's truffle burger flavor. The bacon gave it a needed texture and smoky flavor to bring it all around. Its a bad day when your specialty burger tastes better than your ""iconic"" Shake Burger.

So is it a must try for anyone whose never had Shake Shack? For the Shack burger, I would say no. My friends are forever scarred by the dry Shack Burger and will refuse to ever eat another. I kid you not, he said he would rather have McDonalds than Shake Shack again. For the price you are paying, one would expect a burger that was put together with care, not a sloppy mess with a dry core.",3,1,1

It's on that short list of places I've always wanted to try (along w\/ Sonics, Applebees, 5 Guys, Chick-fil-A, etc) because we just don't have one in Hawaii. I can pass on something like Applebees, but when the Yelp Hawaii CM tells you to go visit Shake Shack on your visit to Vegas, then you do it! SUCH a good choice!

Where's it at?
It's on the corner (outside) of the New York, New York hotel, across the street from the Hard Rock Cafe. They have indoor and outdoor seating, so spending a sunny day outside to nom could be nice! The inside is pretty modern, and there's a lot of seating.

Don't be scared of the line:
They have stanchions set up to snake the line before you get to the ordering counter, and the line always fills the whole area set up for it. Don't fear! The line actually moves really quickly, and it's the perfect time to decide what you're going to order while you wait. They have a huge menu board set up next to the stanchions. Once you order, they give you a buzzer so you know when you're order is ready.

Food & Drinks:
The burgers are yummy! The buns don't overtake the fillings, and the fillings are good...like, sure, I want bacon and cheese and peppers and tomato and lettuce and extra sauce! Oh, I can throw an extra patty and more cheese in there? Uh...YES! :D 

They have burgers and they have fries, but that's not what they're known for, not really. Shake Shack is known for their shakes and frozen custards! What's the difference between regular run-of-the-mill ice cream and frozen custard? Frozen custard has eggs and cream and is made into a thick custard first before being frozen; regular ice cream is just heavy cream and flavoring generally frozen from its liquid state. In other words: frozen custard is MUCH richer (it's because of the eggs). The point is that you MUST get the frozen custard! You can get it plain or you can go all out and get it with the mix-ins, which is definitely the way to go!

FYI, this fast food burger joint also sells beer & wine! Don't be surprised, it's Vegas lol. They even have beers on tap! Obviously, must be 21+ to order that. :P

Onto Fries. Fries are Better than in n out. They are crinkle kind and actually SALTED. I get their cheese sauce on them every time which is seriously magical. Its like queso- not a piece of sliced cheese melted on top.

Shakes are good- but not as amazing as a Neapolitan at In n out.

I had no clue this was here in Vegas and never thought I would ever try it unless I went to the east coast. I opted for the shack stack with the mushroom. Oh em gee. As soon as I chomped down for my first bite I felt all the cheesy gooeyness and I fell pretty much in love. The built in cheese was just pure genius. I have never had a mushroom burger constructed like that before. We went with the cheese fries and now I wish we had went with onion rings or something else. To start I don't like crinkley fries. They remind me of cafeteria food and and cheese was a bit much for me. Unfortunately we were grabbing a late lunch and had plans to eat at bachannal shortly after for dinner so I decided against a milkshake or float. This still makes me a bit sad that I didn't get to experience a purple cow float, whatever that even is.. But it sounds cool and yummy. Perhaps another day. Overall though I still much prefer in-n-out.",1,1,1

Good location.  Clean inside.  But overpriced and a tourist trap.  Two of us had a burger, fries and one very small (there's only one size and it's shockingly tiny) vanilla shake.  It came to over 33 dollars for that.  The ""shake sauce"" on the burger is not great, and pretty darn bland.  The fries are crinkle cut and I swear they look and taste like a poor man's version of frozen Ore Ida brand fries.  Not flavorful.  Not good.  I'd say to skip this place entirely... except for one thing:

They have booth seating (which is cool), but the funny part is the booths are up a small step from the floor.  There's even a little sign telling people to watch their step.  Being Las Vegas, it seems like everyone is a tourist and either drunk or oblivious to signs, and we kept seeing person after person trip on the step while we sat there.  It was hilarious.

The Smokeshack was my least favorite of the burgers. Bacon always feels like an unwanted after thought on burgers and even though they tried to balance it with acidic peppers it was still lack luster. The Shackburger is a perfect representation of a classic burger. The soft bun melts away, the burger has a crisp skin and tastes of steak, the toppings are in perfect harmony. The crown jewel of Shake Shack is the Shackmeister burger. Topped with their delicious fried shallots, cheese, and shack sauce. Perfection. Their Fries are deceiving, they look like crappy school lunch fries but they are crisp on the outside and pillowy soft inside. Cover them with cheese sauce because you are in Vegas!

FOOD & DRINK: the chicken sandwich is really tasty. I would choose it over the chicken sandwich at Chick-Fil-A even though it's a close call between the two. The prices are pretty reasonable. And they do serve alcohol. I also got a side of fries and a black&white shake. One person in my group did not like the shake after he tried mine. I thought it was okay but definitely on the extra sweet side. I got cheese fries and I liked how they were crispy even with the cheese on top. Still would choose In-n-out fries over these fries, but the chicken sandwich reigned supreme above all the chicken burgers I've tried in that price range. 

ATMOSPHERE: they have a TV playing sports! It was great especially since it's playoffs season. There was plenty of seating and it was overall very clean. The bathroom had a single sink and two stalls, so if it gets busy that's probably where you would have to wait the longest. The bathroom though was pretty clean.

You only get that kind of service at fine dining restaurants, but getting it here at a fast food burger joint was completely unexpected. Imagine you're at In-N-Out and the manager goes up to your table and follows up on your meal. Tells you a story about the business and how the history came about. Informs the menu in details. That's the service we got here from Daniel, so keep up the great work man!

Cheese fries- honestly, they didn't look like much at all but they were simple and pretty darn good.

The Strip

On one particular day while on vacation in Las Vegas, my mother decided that she did not want to eat at a buffet for lunch. She elected to eat at the Shake Shack. I never heard of the Shake Shack but could only imagine that it was somewhere I did not want to eat since I try to stay away from fast foods. I submitted to her request because I planned most of the other events during our vacation.

Upon entering the establishment, I could smell the grease in the air. I instinctively knew this was a bad idea. We walked up to the menu that was in the middle of the fast food lobby and viewed the fast food options. The foods were what one would expect from somewhere called the ""Shake Shack."" They had hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken sandwiches, a mushroom burger, fries, soda pops, water, and milkshakes. 

I'm a Pescatarian and do not usually eat meat, except on occasion. I do not like portabello mushrooms, so the vegetarian route was out of my options. I decided to get the Chick'n Shack (crispy chicken breast with lettuce, pickles, buttermilk herb mayo) and a Vanilla Salted Caramel Milkshake. My mother got the ShackBurger (cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce), Crinkle-Cut Fries, and a Vanilla Salted Caramel Milkshake.

We paid for our meals and handed a receipt, similar to Wendy's or Burger King. We waited until they called our number and retrieved our meals. I was not impressed by the presentation of the food. Not only did the chicken sandwich look greasy, but it also tasted as it floated around in grease for a while, and indeed was not crispy. The Vanilla Salted Caramel Milkshake tasted like a regular vanilla milkshake only half the size of a McDonald's milkshake. My mother did not like the milkshake and said that it had a funny taste. I told her that it was probably the salted caramel. She said that she must have missed that on the menu. She did not care for her cheeseburger or the fries.

Although it was not expensive for the Strip, it was a wasted meal in my mind, where we could have eaten once at a buffet and not eaten again that day. After reading other people's reviews of the Shake Shack, I can only surmise that those people are used to eating fast food and think that the Shake Shack is a step above McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King.

I would not recommend eating at the Shake Shack while in Las Vegas unless you are on a tight budget and are forced to eat fast foods. Instead of eating at the Shake Shack, spend your money more economically. Eat at a buffet once a day, the selections are more abundant, not soaked in grease, and provide healthier choices.",0,0,0

It's a fast food chain, so no one should be appalled at how their version of a vegetarian burger features a deep-fried cheese-stuffed mushroom cap. The vegetarian diet is not strictly synonymous with healthy. But I digress.

It's a tasty burger. A bit too much going on for my personal preference, but definitely something different to try. Beef is fresh, mushroom cap is hot and cheesy, and I found the tangy Shack Sauce added a little something extra. In the future, I'd rather get either the standard Shack Burger OR the Shroom Burger rather than combining them. I wasn't blown away, but I was pleasantly surprised.

For those irate about prices and wait times, it's on the Strip... so deal with it. Try a weekday evening after 8 and you'll have minimal wait. Price inflation isn't any different than WhiteCastle trying to sell $8 burgers, and it's cheaper than a flight to the East coast.

The burger is good enough to eat alone. The beef is perfect with just the right amount of fresh lettuce, tomatoes and onions. The bun was perfect. It made the burger.

Shake Shack is an East Coast favorite that's now doing business in Vegas.  I've been to ones in Philly and NYC and liked them a lot.  

My experience at this location was less than average. Our menu choices were not available because the ingredients were all sold out - sold out of hot dogs and got the chicken dog.  It was just ok for $6.50.  A basic Nathan's dawg could have beat it easy. 

Also there was no root beer, no cheese sauce, no water cups, no bacon, no mushrooms - this just neutralizes the greatness of what this burger could be.  It's disappointing because I hyped it up to my family and set the expectation higher than this location could deliver.  They basically thought it was an overpriced In-N-Out. Given that it's opening week for this new operation I can't fault Shake Shack too much.  I will come back in a few months and I'm sure they will sort things out for the better.

I have to say that Shake Shack has some perks, especially with its large variety of burgers and shakes. The location in Vegas is good and I'll definitely go again if I'm in town and want something quick to eat. The major downside to Shake Shack is how pricey each item is. To me, everything was slightly smaller portioned and greasier than the same item from In N Out. For example, I ordered a cheeseburger and shake and my total came out to be about $15.

We were expecting a long line, but it went by quickly. However, it was packed.. it was hard to find seating for our group of 4 but people came in and out so we were able to find seats in a big communal table. We got the shack dog (hot dog with cheese and fried onion) shack stack (cheeseburger with a fried portabello mushroom), and cheese fries. All of them were as good as I remember from NY, especially the cheese fries. After eating all that we went to the free photo booth in the middle of the restaurant and took some pictures.

Before I end this review, you may ask me, me being a Socal native: In N Out or Shake Shack? Shake Shack is pretty good.. but In N Out all the way for me. Thanks!",1,1,1

This is a futuristic fast food restaurant where people can eat fast food while watching professional sports on the overhead television sets, where instead of waiting on a long line to pick up your food, you can sit on a circular bench while watching sports until your beeper alerts you know it is ready. This past weekend, on the Sunday where Green Bay played Seattle in the Super Bowl playoffs, I spent some time inside the fast food restaurant of the future. 

  Shake Shack is located at the northern periphery of the New York New York property near the Monte Carlo. In the very near future, Shake Shack will be a Gateway business to the Park, the exciting entertainment complex that will link the Las Vegas Strip to the Arena. 

  When I visited Shake Shack, it was understandably busy. People are saying it is the In N Out Burger of the East Coast. When people say that a fast food place is the In N Out Burger of the East Coast, a long line is guaranteed. This was a long line that moved fast. This was my first impression of sharp management. The line is a small room with a wall of menu boards (pictures are below). I am impressed with the selection. Their menu includes hamburgers, hot dogs,  crinkle cut fries, concrete, shakes, wine, beer. At the end of the line, a friendly person took my order. After paying, he presented me with a beeper. Once the beeper would go off, I  would pick up my food at the pickup window. I'd plant myself on the circular bench to watch the Super Bowl playoffs. What's really neat is that there is a gigantic HD screen covering a good part of the wall above the condiments. 

  After picking up the food, there was fortunately a table. The dining room is decent size with a modern interior. In addition to the dining room are the outside seats along the Strip. With the staff persistent on cleaning the tables, and dumping your trash, Shake Shack is a clean place to eat. 

  Decisions! Decisions! I ordered the Smokeshack Burger with crinkle cut fries, and a Coke Zero. The cost was nearly double than In N Out. The Smokestack burger made up of Angus meat was out of this World. I savored the cheese, applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and Shack sauce. This is the second best burger I had in recent times (my favorite is Portillos in Chicago). The crinky cut fries I felt were good, yet inferior to Nathan's. I hear the shakes are phenomenal. After trying Boulevard Creamery nearby, I might be delaying their shakes for an indefinite period. 

  Is Shake Shack the New York In N Out? 
    After eating here and having grown up in New York, I feel that Shake Shack is more comparable to Nathan's than In N Out. Shake Shack is higher priced than In N Out, features more items, serves crinkle cut fries, and in several ways is just different. White Castle would be a better comparison between a New York fast food restaurant and In N Out. In my opinion Shake Shack doesn't have a large presence in the New York metropolitan area. For the record, there are more Nathan's and White Castles in New York than Shake Shacks. Currently , there is only one Shake Shack in Long Island, NY. Shake Shack started in 2004, where White Castle and Nathan's were established in my grandparents generation. 

  Regardless that Shake Shack, from my perspective is no East Coast In N Out, it is a futuristic fast food restaurant that is fun to hang out in. It was a ball to share in the Super Bowl playoffs while enjoying delicious food. I never had this experience in McDonald's or Burger King. 

  I am a fan of Shake Shack. It is nice to go into a fast food place watch a game until the beeper goes off, enjoy quality food while watching a game. It is nice to have friendly employees take my order and volunteer to dump my trash. I can see Shake Shack in my check-in future.",13,8,10

Maybe if I'm crazy drunk I will. At least m life members can get points on shack shake orders! Bring your receipt to the m life counter to get your purchase associated to your account. 

Here's the scoop..
- fifty fifty drink: half ice tea and lemonade tasted like nothing 
- shackcago dog: soggy bun, interesting toppings with cucumber, peppers, relish but I'd eat a Costco hotdog over this
- smoke shack: cold toppings were awkward in the burger. I can imagine the regular cheeseburger being really tasty though without the extra fluff toppings. You probably need to eat 2 burgers to be full. 1 is kinda small but perfect for a light snack\/meal
- vanilla custard: ok, kind of melting before it even touched the outside warm las Vegas air. Reminded me of McDonalds soft serve. I'd probably prefer McDonalds.

The reviews were great for this place so I decided to check it out. We went to eat there, as soon as got off the plane, and checked into the hotel. We were staying at the NYNY, so we didn't have to travel far.

I got the single ShackBurger and the Double Jackpot Concrete. Their burgers are 100% all-natural Angus beef, with no hormones, and no antibiotics. What sets this burger apart from the rest, like most burgers, is the sauce. The ShackSauce is like a tangy Thousand Island dressing. It tasted really good on the burger. My favorite item from this meal was the Jackpot Concrete. It's a frozen vanilla custard blended with strawberry puree, marshmallow sauce, and rainbow sprinkles. What I loved about it is the crispy funnel cake pieces that I tasted in there. 

My hubby doesn't eat red meat, so the only entree he could get was the Chicken Dog. He said it wasn't bad, but wished they had more options that he could choose from. They only offer Crinkle Cut fries, which was fine. I'd prefer shoestring.

I love that similarly to in-n-out, the veggies are cold but the meat\/bun is warm!! Great flavor contrast that makes the veg taste extra fresh! I think I enjoy the in-n-out sauce more than the shake shack sauce though. I couldn't even taste any sauce in my hamburger to be honest ... And I don't know how to compare patty meats since I think they all taste the same, but I think the meat here was less visually appealing due to its lack of circularity (the shape was pressed to look au naturale). 

Cheese fries were surprisingly super good. The cheese was so creamy for being a melty piece of cheese instead of liquid cheese! I do not understand. 

Also picked up a brownie milkshake which was super rich and heavy, probably more so than in-n-out's. Too heavy in my opinion ... i regret not trying orange creamsicle-ish flavor instead.

Suggestion to management: put more garbage bins around the dining area...and spring for large straws for your large drinks. We can't drink your large drinks without a bigger straw. :(

Take something that everybody loves (hamburger & shakes) and step it up a notch...that's what Shake Shake is all about. 

Located on the Las Vegas strip, just a 2 min walk from NYNY Hotel. The hamburger meat tasted fresh and wholesome. The shakes tasted like they were made from fresh ice cream (they weren't slimy like most burger places).

The Shack Stack (best pronounced in an exaggerated Chicago accent) is the ultimate.  It stacks the regular Shack Burger together with the cheesy Mushroom Burger.  I love how their buns are U-shaped so they captured all the drippings from your burger rather than letting them escape into your hand or onto your tray.

Their crinkle-cut fries are mediocre in my opinion.  Similar to frozen stuff my mom would've heated up in the oven for us growing up.

Since I've heard of this place, I've been wanting to try a Shack stack-- cheeseburger topped with a fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheese. Despite the unattractive 770 calories, this burger really fills you up! And when are you going to be able to try it again anyway? I'm not exactly from NY. My favorite part of the burger was the mushroom, wouldn't have minded if it lacked a fried exterior. Wasn't a fan of the cheese on the burger since the mushroom had melted cheese already, but with so many patrons, it's time consuming for them to customize or substitute items unless you have a food allergy. It's nice that their menu asks you to inform them of any allergies right away. Customer dedication at its best. The employee standing outside the front glass door letting people in was friendly and asks if it's your first time dining there prior to making jokes about it not being all that great. Line moves fast. 

*Crinkle cut fries were good, not overly salty, and are a fun wavy shape.

*Tried a single scoop of frozen chocolate custard, maybe I should've tried vanilla instead. It's definitely thicker and creamier than regular ice cream; it tasted like rocky road to me, almost like the chocolate ice cream and marshmallows were melted and mixed together, minus the almonds.

*Water cups and fountain are past the pick up area toward the middle. Refill as many times as you like. 

*Line\/window C outside on the left allows you to order non-hot items such as frozen custard, shakes, fountain drinks, beer, and memorabilia (T-shirts, etc.). I got the black viva Las Vegas sign\/Shake Shack shirt for $18.

Ordered their famous cheese fries which tasted kind of like maybe nacho cheese sauce on crinkle fries. I don't know why but I do enjoy crinkle cut fries more when a topping is on it because it just grabs the sauce and makes it taste different than a regular fry. Or maybe it's just me.

In SoCal it's known to be the ""In-n-Out of New York."" I didn't know what to expect and also tried to make sure I didn't have extra high expectations. Took my first bite and LOVED IT!!!!

It's definitely not as cheap as In-n-Out, but the burger is a lot JUICER and the bun is a lot SOFTER. The only downfall is that they don't have onions in their burgers. However, I was quite surprised that the burger can STILL be delicious even without the onions!!


SHACKBURGER DOUBLE: Cheeseburger stacked with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce
- I'm all about the double-double at In-n-Out, so I chose to eat the double here as well. DELICIOUS! Super juicy and just plain good. If it's your first time, I'd recommend to always start with the original - Shackburger (single or double - however way you like it; add a bacon if you'd like).

SHACK STACK: Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger (Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses) topped with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce.
- ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Cheese-stuffed mushrooms?! What more can I ask for!!!

FRIES: Crinkle cut fries

First day at CES and we hadn't had a meal all day. I heard they just opened this location and had to come here. I've been to serveral locations in NYC and miss the burgers here. Coming from CA, I prefer these burgers over In-n-Out because the buns are so soft and I'm not a fan of thousand island dressing.

My order:
Shack Stack: $9.49
Double Concrete: ($4.50) Oatmeal Creme Pie w\/ banana  chocolate cheesecake and chocolate toffee
Additional toppings: +$0.60 each

My meat patty was on the thin side with a large battered and fried mushroom & gushing with cheese. My friend's burger was thicker and more juicy. The fries are crisscut fries and very hot and not overly crunchy. Cheese on the fries had the consistency of cheese whiz.

Allison had said my concrete was made incorrectly when I went to go pick up my food, so she said she would bring it out to me when they were done. When she did, she noticed that we had ordered the cheese fries and suggested adding their cherry peppers if we liked a little spice. We said we'd try it so she came back out with a tray with a condiment cup of the cherry peppers but also a cup of bacon chunks & another order of cheese fries. She said it was in case we didn't like it but boy did we love the cherry peppers!

The weekly flavor was oatmeal creme pie and was intensely sweet and had an strong oatmeal raisin cookie flavor. I had added banana chocolate cheesecake (as suggested by the cashier) and chocolate toffee toppings which didn't help with the sweetness at all.

No In&Out, no Fat Burger, no 5 Guys and definitely no mediocre chains can come close or dare compare to the deliciousness served here.

It's completely nuts in this location, the beautifully mastered burgers, fresh hot crinkle cut fries and thick custard shakes can really make my day phenomenal!

We both ordered the Shack burger (BF added onions to his burger), and it took about 5-10 minutes for them to make it. It was about $11 for two burgers, which is pretty ridiculous compared to In-N-Out. 
The burger is pretty small in general, with a Hawaiian bun type, a nice piece of patty, lettuce, tomatoes, and shack sauce. I didn't really like the taste of the burger that much, other than the patty since the shack sauce had a strong mayo flavor and the bun was too mushy. I definitely like In-N-Out burgers better than Shake Shack, but my BF disagrees. He thought it was good since it tastes dirtier than In-N-Out, but overpriced for the size.

I came here during busy EDC weekend to see what my friend's hype was all about. He told me all the other Shake Shacks are in the east coast and that we had to try this place out. So after a few minutes of deciding whether I want to walk from Vdara all the way here.. We did it. 

I had their Shack Burger, a hot dog and some cheese fries. Surprisingly, you get some really good value here. Especially out of the fries.. I believe they're only $3.50 or so, and they were pretty damn good! Very very good. 

You know that feeling when you're hungry and you just order lots off the menu, but don't finish it? Well, I ordered a lot and ended up finishing all. The food tasted that good and I just couldn't help but killing everything.

A few weeks ago, that day arrived. I could finally toss my opinion in on the ""Battle of the Burgers"" - In n Out vs. Shake Shack.

I grabbed their basic cheeseburger, the crinkle fries and a water. I did not want to allow one of their tasty (and damn, they are tasty) shakes, custard, or a 32oz beer to cloud the flavors of the burger and fries. 

Well, the burger was solid. I'd rate it higher than Five Guys and most other burger joints. It tasted clean and by clean I mean, not a greasy-bun-destroying-mess. In-n-Out wins this one.

The fries were alright. I'm not a crinkle fry kind of guy, but I respect the fry they put out. In-n-Out takes the fries title, too.

After I thoroughly demolished my burger and fry, I ordered a 32oz beer. It was Brooklyn Brewing's special Shake Shack ale. I've had Brooklyn's offerings before and this was par for the course. Nothing mind blowing, but a pretty damn serviceable offering. I enjoyed the beer in my collectable mug as I strolled the Strip. In-n-Out doesn't have beer, so props to Shake Shack on this one.

I got tastes of both an incredible shake and their well-known custard. Both were winners to me. 

OH and the chicken sandwich looked world class. Might grab one of those instead of a burger next time I hit up the Shack in Vegas.",0,0,0

Crinkle Cuts and Concretes!

I was craving some comfort food after my team took a narrow loss and their season ended so I headed to Shake Shack. I asked a bunch of people for  directions and nobody noted that the entrance was outside of the casino, but now, you'll know and not suffer the same misery of walking in circles for 15 minutes.

Once we arrived i saw a medium size line, nothing compared to a normal Madison Square Park line though so I could handle it. I also noted that they have a ""C-Line"" for non hot food. It differs from the ""B-Line"" at the original in that you can et Shakes. 

Once i ordered the food was on a similar level to what I'm used to at MSP location. The only weakness was the burger which tasted just a little bit off, but I couldn't figure out exactly why. Even one day later I still can't seem to figure out what was off with the burger. I only finished 3\/4 of it before I moved on to the Crinkle Cut fries, which  are just as good as I recall, and happen to be my favorite thing about Shake Shack.

Finally I went on to my Shake Attack. It's my go to concrete and it was spot on. I had the chocolate hazelnut (custard special of the week) subbed in for the normal chocolate custard and it was delicious.

Now for the bad. It is Vegas priced and it seems like it is more than it is in New York. Secondly the staff, though friendly, just don't seem to have the same order taking efficiency as they do in New York. Maybe it's not their fault since most people going to this location aren't regulars, but it was definitely noticeable.

Will I be back? Yes, next time I'm in Vegas I'll stop by for a concrete or crinkle cut fries.

The food, service, presentation and general disorder left us disappointed. We gave it another try and I was happy we did.

I got the Shack Stack burger: the melted cheese-stuffed Portobello patty and cheeseburger combined. It was heavenly. I took one bite and the hot melted cheese poured out. The fresh lettuce and tomato was great and the bun just right and not stale. Everything was fresh and well-made. Husband got a Coke to drink and the Smoke Stack: burger with bacon, cheese and cherry peppers. It was a vast improvement compared to last time. We shared an order of Cheese Fries and I got a side of their Shack sauce which is a bit like a horseradish mustard. 

Dessert: I got a single concrete mixer - the Jackpot. It had vanilla frozen custard with strawberry sauce mixed with Belgian waffle pieces and rainbow sprinkles. This was extremely good! We paid $29 for all of this..not bad by Vegas standards!

I don't usually like crinkle-cut fries but the cheese fries are just soooo good and perfectly crispy. The shake stack burger is my favorite because of the fried portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese that literally drips out after you bite into it. Talk about cheese porn! Never had anything like it, and I fell in love. It's roughly $10 for a burger and they're actually pretty darn small, but I'm not trying to eat a huge meal while hungover anyway so it's always the perfect size for me.

The Shroom burger is a crisp fried portobello topped with Munster cheese and cheddar cheese. On a potato bun with lettuce, tomato, and Shake Shack sauce. So good! 

I also ended up eating the Chick 'n' Shake which was a crispy chicken breast with pickles, lettuce and buttermilk herb mayonnaise. So darn good! Since the girls I was with were drunk and not hungry I ended a eating both sandwiches. So not my fault! 

I didn't really care for the crinkle fries but then again I like skinny fries. The thinner the better, and no I'm not talking about me! I'm not big on fries in general, I'd rather have a donut.

They all were working quick inside the kitchen but maybe the company underestimated how big the kitchen should be? It wasn't crowded inside, and just a steady trickle of people coming in as it's the off season and a Sunday night too, so I have no clue how they could ever handle a real crowd when something is going on at the new arena or something.

The burger itself was fine, I really liked the gooey sauce on there and the meat was very well seasoned, but the bread was kinda chewy, it overpowered the rest of the burger for me. I also got a creamsicle float, and the custard was amazingly smooth. However, there just wasn't enough in there! Most of my drink just tasted like I got an orange soda unfortunately.

The burger was really good. It had so much flavor in it. I wanna say it's almost or equally as good as In-N-Out Burgers, and that's saying something.

I have heard people compare it to In N Out Burger, and some say it's better, some say it's not (more on this to come). But the best descriptor I heard from a friend is that ""the burger literally melts in your mouth."" What I can say about that is, it's totally accurate.

I must be honest, when we arrived just before catching a flight home, I was not too happy about the long line. In fact, every time I saw the line, it was long. But the line is long for a reason. I also must admit, I did not wait in line (my wife did) because I had to run across the street to the M&M store for the kids. Therfore, I cannot comment on the friendliness of the staff or the ordering process. What I do know is that upon my return, I was greeted with a mouthwatering burger and tasty fries. And it really did seem to melt in my mouth. So while it compares to the gloriousness of the best burger joint invented (In N Out, for all you non Californians) it was definitely close. It is slightly more expensive than In N Out, which is one of the amazing attributes of the best burger joint. I don't have a Shake Shack near home, so I'll definitely make this a regular stop when I'm in Vegas, or anywhere else I can find one. You should too.

The only negative I can report, which is no fault of the restaurant, but getting dropped off or picked up by Uber or a taxi is impossible without walking a few blocks because of the street laws here in Vegas.

It is steps from where I was staying in Excalibur. Being a CA native, I wanted to see how this place compares to our beloved In n Out. When I was in Vegas in June, I decided to put it to the test. I ordered their shack burger, their hot chicken sandwich, and cheese fries. By the end of our weekend in Vegas, we had gone three times to this place! The hot chicken was the star of the show. The breading was delicious and flavorful. Not too hot, but with actual spice to it. The slaw on top was also good. I usually hate slaw as it is full of mayo. This one had what seemed like chipotle or paprika, making it pink in color. No overwhelming mayo flavor. In fact, it complimented nicely with the sandwich. However, the bun was ice cold? I would think it would be toasted. My chicken was fine, but the bun was soggy and cold. Real let down, but still delicious

The burger has NOTHING on In n Out. Trust me. However, it was still pretty tasty. This bun was also ice cold. What is up with that Shake Shack? Toast your buns!! Your meat was juicy and flavorful. The burger was topped with lettuce, cheese, and a couple tiny tomato slices. I advice putting full size slices of tomato and adding some onion to your burgers. Moreover, no sauce? At least some ketchup on top would do a world of good. You have to do more if you want to compare with In n Out's burger with lettuce, big tomatoes, onion, and secret sauce. I do appreciate how fresh and juicy the meat was, so I still give it a good review.

The cheese fries were crinkle cut with a liquid cheese sauce. It tasted a little plasticky for my liking. The next times I went I ordered plain fries dipped in ketchup. They were delicious. Nice amount of salt and cooked just right. Sometimes In n Out overcooks their fries, so this was nice to see. 

When we went back, I ordered the hot chicken sandwich again and a root beer float. The custard they have here is amazing. Creamy and rich. On a triple digit summer Vegas day, this so hit the spot.

TL;DR order their hot chicken sandwich and fries. Just make sure you remind them to toast their buns!

And while I'm not usually a fan of crinkle fries because they scream frozen and flavorless. But these not only had a decent crunch on the outside, but they also were nicely seasoned. 

I chose to get a small custard. Being from the Midwest, I'm no stranger to awesome custard with which to create an amazing concrete. Usually with as many mix-ins as they allow. However, I decided to follow their lead this time and simply pick something from the menu. While it forever for them to prepare (compared to how fast I'm used to) and I did feel like the mix-ins were a bit on the skimpy side, this is some amazing custard!

Maybe the hype and excitement was too built up for me, but I actually wasn't at all wowed by my experience here at Shake Shack. It was not terrible however it certainly had hits and misses. Shake Shack is attached to New York New York Hotel and Casino, but you have to park at NY NY and walk through the casino out to the sidewalk on LV Blvd to enter Shake Shack. Walking inside I saw lots of heads and was actually glad we were getting our order to-go because seating inside was limited. I was surprised with the amount of customers eating inside that the line wasn't longer, but there was only one customer ahead of us. After placing our order we were told to stand off to the side near the pick-up area where it took a reasonable amount of time to receive our food and the employees who helped us were nice and helpful.

Chick'n Shack ($6.29) - Crispy chicken with lettuce, pickles and buttermilk herb mayo on a potato bun. The chicken was tasty and I really liked it, but the shredded lettuce was hot, wilted, didn't taste fresh and reminded me of what they put on the McChicken at McD's. I'd personally prefer a nice crisp piece of lettuce instead. I recently tried Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken in Downtown Summerlin and they also use shredded lettuce however it had a crisp and fresh taste to it unlike my experience here at SS. The buttermilk herb mayo could have been spread a bit heavier because I couldn't taste it at all and I love mayo on my chicken sandwiches. This sandwich was lacking in the tomato and bacon department and could even have benefited from a slice of cheese, all things I know now to add customized next time if I decide to give them another try. They have a Downtown Summerlin (happens to be right across from BRFC) location which I pass by regularly, so I'd more than likely try that one if I do and the chicken sandwich I'll have tweaked to my liking and I'll pay for the extra add-ons to make it that way. Extra bacon is currently $1.55 which isn't bad considering I don't buy drinks here and just food only. It can add up when buying the full meals, but we usually have our own fountain drinks that we stop at a corner store and get. 

Cheese Fries ($3.99) - The cheese sauce was so thin and hardly had flavor. The fries themselves were just average tasting. I personally wouldn't bother with the fries again.

Hubby liked his Double Shack Burger, but felt it wasn't anything special for $8.09 and there wasn't enough bun for the amount of burger. I thought it looked wrapped in lettuce rather than bun at first glance. Hubby most likely will not return at his request, but I'll possibly give the chicken sandwich a try in the future.",53,42,50

Where do I sign? I like the drink offerings they have too. They have alcohol and they always have some kind of special fruit lemonade. 

The builders were smart and knew this place would attract crowds so it's pretty huge. It does get crazy busy though (like line out the door busy) so it's good they opened the park right next door as that added some outdoor seating. They have the queue thing down too. Every time I've been here, even among the crowds, the staff is always super upbeat and friendly. They also get your food our super fast. My favorite is the regular Shackburger and as previously mentioned, Cheese Fries. Their Mango Lemonade is super tasty too as are their Arnold Palmers. 

The prices here are more than an In N Out or even a Habit. I don't think the regular Shake Shack's on the East Coast are as pricey, there's just a Vegas markup here. But it's still much more affordable than any of the fancy sit down places and it's a tasty, quick meal for sure.

The key is to go at kind of off times (so not right at noon or 6 o clock). But, it is Vegas so I think it's probably always fairly busy. If you're staying at Monte Carlo or New York New York, you're literally just steps away anyway. 

Now if they could just open one in SoCal that's closer than Santa Monica...",1,0,1

I've always envied my boyfriend who gets to go to NYC to visit his family for annual summer trips and I would always hear great things about Shake Shack. Ever since I heard that Las Vegas was going to be a new home for the franchise on the West Coast, I just knew that I had to get here!

So for starters, we came during a weekday so the crowds weren't that busy. We were able to get our orders down and find a table easily. However, for sure the weekends will be much more busier. But other than that, when you walk in, you will just order at the cash register and they will give you a buzzer while you take some time to flag a table to sit and wait.

We ordered:

1. ShackBurger: It's your basic cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato and delicious sauce. My bf, being the Shake Shack guru he is, said that the meat patty was lacking a bit, but overall the sides and drinks were just as delicious as the ones in NYC (4\/5)

2. Shroom Burger: I'm not a vegetarian, but I was definitely craving for this one after reading positive reviews. It's crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with ooey-gooey delicious cheeses with lettuce and tomato. SO GOOD! (5\/5)

3. Cheese Fries and Regular fries: I love the crinkle cut fries! I just wish there were more cheese sauce for the cheese fries - but overall, you can't go wrong with any of these. Very delicious! (5\/5)

4. Peanut Butter Malt Shake: My bf swears that this is the best he has ever tasted. He says that it is very comparable to the one from NYC. So yay! (5\/5)

5. Peach Lemonade: Very refreshing AND you get free refills! Nice! (5\/5)

Prices can be a bit steep, but the food here is good. Until then, I wouldn't mind coming here again to get my Shake Shack fix!",13,5,8

In my world, Malts are GREATER THAN Shakes, so I was pumped to see that option available. Of course you know I ordered a Chocolate Malt with my Burger & Fries (Crinkle Cut action!). Everything tasted really fresh and delicious. The place reminds me more of TrueBurger (Oakland) than In N Out...and they're all good in my book, plus different in their own unique ways. Shake Shack is a little more pricey than In N Out, though, so there's that. But I'd come here again in a heartbeat.

(+) Shack Burger: Juicy medium rare beef patty, crisp lettuce and tomato, sweet\/soft patty. 
(-) Chocolate Shake: Diluted chocolate, tasted mostly like vanilla, melted quickly.
(-) Cheese Fries: I could buy frozen Ore-Ida fries and melt a Kraft american cheese slice on top by myself.

A greasy, thin-pattied burger.  For what it was, it was good. I could have used a lot more lettuce and tomato.  The peppery sauce they used was alright, but the peppers actually hurt the flavor.  The crinkly fries were a bit dull.  My wife disliked her too-small and not-spicy-as-claimed chicken sandwich.

I very much liked their house ale, which was easy to drink and a lot better than some bud light.

   Shake shack wasn't around in 1993, but if so I would guess that the lyrics to his most famous song would go something like that. Now even though I have traveled to New York, I rep west coast like and had never eaten shake shack until this location opened and I truly understood that shake shack vs in n out was the burger version of 2pac vs biggie except this beef is a lot more delicious. Shake shack made sure to come correct, the venue is on the outside of NYNY, sleek design and I randomly like that they used old bowling lines for tables. There's two windows to order from. One is a quickie for drinks, shakes and swag and the Other is for food. There's the shack burger which is cool, but essentially just a cheeseburger, but what really had me speaking like ODB was the smokeshack. Take a cheeseburger, make it double, throw bacon, peppers and shack sauce and you have my attention. I could serenade that burger 24\/7\/365. That's the kind of burger that makes you call your significant other and tell them you ain't never coming home. I tried two of the beef hot dogs an I wasn't impressed to say the least.The crinkle fries are good, but the cheese fries are incredibly overhyped. Like Magna Carta overhyped. I much preferred regular fries dipped is shack sauce I also tried out the shake, and while it's good, it's not Better than in n out, but it's almost double the price. Which is quite possibly my only gripe with this place. A double smoke shack, fries and a shake is about $20, a meal I can get from in n out for less than $8. I'm not sure how much of that is shake shack and how much of that is the fact that it's on the strip, but you get what you pay for and tha shack is quality yo.  
So to paraphrase sir mix a lot again:
Ladies if the bun is round, and you want a double patty showdown

When I left at almost 1:00pm it was even worse, so make sure to come early! They open at 11:00.

I ordered their Vegetarian Shroom Burger and a Peanut Butter Shake. They both came out quickly and the Shroom Burger was DELICIOUS! It's a fried mushroom cap stuffed with cheese. Nom nom nom! I actually don't really like mushrooms very much but I loved this one. Definitely a must try! The Peanut Butter Shake was yummy as well, and I loved that it was made with custard. I've missed frozen custard ever since I moved out of Colorado and was stoked to finally get to have some again.

I liked Shake Shack so much on my first visit, that I dragged my Husband back a few days later.

And let's just get this out if the way: they are nothing like In-N-Out's burgs and quite frankly, not like any other burg I've ever had. The buns share the consistency of a King's Hawaiian roll, soft and squishy but not sweet like one. The patty is thin and flavorful, the cheese is basically Kraft American singles and melty, and the sauce is a pickle-ketchup-mayonnaisy mixup. Crinkle fries were good - they're kinda like Del Taco fries, only a little crunchier. 

I was disappointed in the shake though, we got the ""black and white"" and it was nothing to write home about. I took 2 sips and was over that shizz. 

The 'Shack is pretty expensive ($28) for 2 cheeseburgers, 1 fry and 1 shake, with small portions for the price. Don't get me wrong: I'm cool with small portions, as long as the price tag matches. That burger was great but everything else about the meal, meh. This place is also pretty packed, so be prepared. We waited in a long line for about 30-40 minutes at lunchtime. I didn't take pictures of the food because I was too busy stuffing it into my face...my bad for that. There's plenty of really good pictures in other reviews so please do scroll on.

Cool find for you grillers out there: my boyfriend found an awesome Shake Shack burger recipe hack, and it was probably the best burger I ever ate when he made it, so we were pretty excited to try the real deal. Here is the link if you want to try making them yourself, pretty epically yummo:

We struggled to find a table, but eventually we did. The restaurant is very noisy, so be prepared to either scream at each other, or eat in silence.

The food then: the burgers were very good. Juicy and tasted very nice. The fries was just ok, nothing more. Actually, they tasted and looked exactly the same as the ones you buy in your local grocery store in Sweden, from the freezer and put in the oven at home. :) Nothing wrong with that, but hey, I expect a little bit more here..

All in all, good good burger, standard fries, expensive drinks.

Would probably go again, if I was outside and hungry. On the other hand, Five Guys is just 10 minutes drive, and MUUUUUCH better. ;)",0,1,1

Came back tonight to try the burgers. We had a shack burger and a smoke shack - both single. And a side of fries to share. And our free shake for which we picked coffee

Wow. This is heaps better than in and out. The burgers were fresh, delicious and not too greasy (a bit of grease though!) 

Fries are excellent  and not oily at all. 

The coffee shake is the absolutely best!!! Heaps better than the chocolate we had earlier today

Not only is the decor and at up Heaps better than most places, we sat in a super comfortable booth watching the clippers game. Great fun.",0,1,0

The place was buzzing with people, but the order line was relatively short, so we placed our order (two shack burgers, fries, side of cheese sauce), and proceeded to wait. Roughly 10mins later, we were rewarded with juicy burgers on soft, squishy buns. It's amazing how something so simple (bun, beef, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and sauce) can be so delicious.

Coming into Las Vegas, NV, I thought I give it a try.  The food came out pretty fast.  I ordered the Smoke Shack with cheddar bacon fries and a drink.  The burger was pretty bland and did not have a lot of taste.  The only saving grace for this burger was the bacon.  The fries looked like they were previously frozen but had a nice crisp to it.  The fries had cheddar cheese with bacon sprinkled on it but tasted pretty rich and heavy.  Because of that, I didn't finished it.  The drink I had is standard for Coke, but I had to go to the counter to get my complimentary refill because the soft drink dispenser is not in the dining room.

The staff is always very friendly and helpful even when it's super busy. 

The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because the wait does get very crazy during certain times. Also, because it gets so busy it's hard to find seating inside. There is outdoor seating as well and it is shaded with misters up above. These also get full pretty quickly. The parking will also cost you.

Shack Stack- The mushroom and the cheese over powered the burger. 

Smoke shack - doesn't have that real smokey taste from the bacon. There was a kick from the peppers which my husband liked but all in all... The burgers didn't have that big beefy taste a burger should have.

Cheese fries - I was looking forward to trying this bec I love cheese! But the cheese was not cheesy at all... Has that floury taste. I don't remember cheddar cheese and American cheese tasting like that. 

All shook up concrete -okay so the vanilla custard was actually good. I would go back and just order a shake or ice cream next time.

I got in line and took a look at the menu and noticed that there were no combos. You had to order everything a la carte. What the hell kind of burger place is this?!?! The burger costs about $10, the fries were about $3, and the drink was about $3. My total came out close to about $20. Strike 1 for Shake Shack. 

I received my food, and the party I was with, all said the same thing... ""this is a small ass burger for 10 bucks."" It really was. And it was really greasy as well. Strike 2. 

I began to masticate my burger and nothing really hit me as... WOW. This was my first shake shack experience, and there was no emotions that stirred within me, unlike my first In n Out burger. Strike 3. 

I didn't order any of the shakes there because I'm lactose intolerant, but a few of my friends did, and no one raved about them. The only thing they mentioned was that the cups were freaking tiny for what they paid. 

Overall, it's overpriced, no combos, small portions, no wow factor, means I wouldn't go back. In N Out definitely wins out in every way.",7,5,2

Went to this new Vegas location at NYNY Hotel with coworkers a few weeks ago for our Friday lunch. There were a lot of people in line but service was friendly & quick! It looked like there were at least 15 workers in the kitchen hauling ass like no other resulting in the speedy production of my meal. 

I ordered the following--

Single ShackBurger ($5.19): I LOVED my burger! The patty was SO JUICY and had a really fresh taste, the bun was perfect, and the tomato & lettuce were fresh & crisp. 

Cheese fries ($3.95): weren't that special imo but my coworker loved them & ate all of mine. 

Black & white shake ($5.25): yummy, but it's just vanilla & chocolate so I'll def have to try one of their Concretes next time. 


I like that this place has plenty of outdoor seating although the current view is a partial Strip view + Las Vegas Arena construction. Indoor seating is spacious as well but fills up quickly during lunchtime.

First off, I like to buy people lunch and 4 of us cost $75 (compared to me taking 10 people to InzNOutz cost $60)  I don't care much about how much a place cost but Shake Shake is way overrated in both taste and cost.  If you charge $10 bucks for a burger, I had better do cartwheels after I am done...

I had the Shack Stack - I guess it's a burger with a fried shroom and cheese.  Maybe the cook had an off day becoz the taste was just not good.  The oil may have been old...

The fries are a joke.  I gotz the Ore Ida ones with cheese and they weren't anything special.  My high school in the hoods fries were even better.

I had a chocolate - strawberry shake - sorry, LAME!  Taste like a chocolate milk, but a tad thicker.   I can make a better on in Ninja blender at home.  Plus they forgot my shake on my order...

On top of the not so good experience from this Burger Piggy, the workers there are nice but clueless.

I don't feel like they are comparable. In-N-Out is your typical burger that's just made fresh and with high quality, so it's a classic. Shack Shack I feel is a more high-end burger place, as you can see from it's higher pricing. They have more variety in the types of burgers on their menu, including the Shack Stack, which is what I ordered. It's a cheeseburger and a 'shroom burger (crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses) put together. So freakin' good. The cheese just oozes out of the mushroom when you bite into it and it's amazing. I'm usually not a fan of mushrooms but this made me a fan!

In addition, I got the crinkle cut fries. Shake Shack differs from most burger places because they have crinkle cut fries instead of just regular french fries. At first I was hesitant to get some because I'm not really a fan of crinkle cut. I feel like they're too soft and potato-y. However, these fries were pretty good! They were fried to a level of perfect crispness, unlike most crinkle cut fries.

Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Shake Shack. It's probably not a place that I would go to all the time due to the slightly high prices for a simple burger and fries. However, I will definitely come back when I feel like indulging a little.",1,0,0

I like this location as it's situationed toward the end of the south strip, near the Park, and seating is usually available indoors or out where you may people watch or look at the street glitter at night. Lunch or in the afternoon is simply way too packed and lines are too long for my patience. 

For a fast food joint, it's quite on the pricey side. We ordered a burger to share. I wasn't hungry but wanted a bite or two of burger just so I can write a review. Husband order a burger with bacon, no fries, and a drink. When our order came, I was disappointed. The burger was smallish. For $6-7, I was expecting more.

That ""more"" came from the flavor of the bun. The meat, bacon, tomato, and lettuce is just like all other burger joints but the herby bun is what stood out. It was delicious and greasy. Not worth going through the long line for another other priced burger but definitely worth a try.",2,0,1

The fries and shakes were also just ok for us--nothing over the top (in our humble opinion).  Nobody panic, we ate every morsel (and then felt guilty because of the grease) and nothing was wasted.

SS is located right next to New York New York.
Of course I took pictures of my meal and fork.

The Quad was good, the fries were fresh,
So, why isn't Shake Shack the best? 

I'll start with the good because I don't want to be mean,
The service was great, the restaurant was clean.  

Refills on your drinks and not on the fries,
They hooked it up anyway, which was a pleasant surprise. 

I had a great time with friends and had some fun,
After only one visit at Shake Shack, I think I'm done.

Now for the bad and don't you get mad,
I got the bill and felt I was just had. 

Curious about the hype and wanted to be hip,
I was so disappointed because our meal was a grip.

This location is the first Shake Shack in the west coast and hopefully more to come! I am from Los Angeles and just happened to be in Vegas the day Shake Shack had its grand opening. Of course we stopped by to get our grub on! To my surprise, it wasn't a long wait. We waited maybe only 15 minutes and they gave us samples of their vanilla and chocolate concretes which kept me even more happy and satisfied. 

This is by far the largest Shake Shack I have ever been to. Lots of ample seating inside and outside. Heating lamps outside for those chilly winter nights. Decor is super modern and yet comfy. Service was great as usual and food was done super quick. This is a very friendly and efficient staff considering it was grand opening and there are sometimes hiccups. But I saw no hiccups. They were all a machine and happily working.

My fiance and I got the Stack Shack which is my personal favorite. I love the cheesy portabello mushroom with my burger. I also normally get their vanilla shake but this time we changed it up and got their special which was the salted caramel shake. I am so glad we did. This shake was phenomenal and so delicious and creamy! It wasn't too sweet. It was just perfection.

Just as a heads up, Shake Shack is technically not connected to a specific hotel. It is located in between NYNY and Monte Carlo. You can't miss it!

Everyone compares it to In-n-Out, but I personally think they are quite different. First off, the atmosphere. In-n-Out has the all-American fast food feel. Shake Shack is a bit hipstery with their wooden benches and fancier menu boards. They also have no drive-thru (at least not the one in Vegas). Second, price points. In-n-Out is ridiculously cheap, as all fast food institutions should be. Shake Shack's prices are higher up there. Not gourmet burger status, but close to something you would find at a sit-down burger joint.

Now onto the food. I would pay $7-10 for a full meal here. I ordered the cheeseburger. The patty was juicy, the lettuce and tomatoes were fresh, the bread was nicely toasted, all tied together with a thousand-islandy sauce (not as good as In-n-Out spread though!). Simple and clean flavors. We also ordered the cheese fries. They were hot and crispy with a good amount of cheese melted on top. Overall, I would come back, especially if I'm around the NY NY hotel. But if I'm driving back to LA already, In-n-Out at Barstow is the way to go!",1,0,0

The burgers here are very good. The best in its class. The quality of the patty is equivalent to the patties used by some restaurants which sell $15+ burgers, and they have the taste to back it up.

The only downside is the size. The burgers are pretty small. If you're an average-sized guy, one wouldn't fill you up. I guess the good thing about that is it leaves room for some shake and fries.

Us three gals finished it, but imagine if you were just one person eating it!! The mushroom burger was interesting and as my coworker described it, it was cheese filled and it exploded on her LOL.

Seats get filled fast, so make sure you have friends to help look for spots as you wait for food. Overall food experience was great~ Would definitely eat here again when I come back!",3,2,2

The Shake Shack is located right in front of the New York New York hotel, right off of Las Vegas Blvd. The location is awesome, and I love the atmosphere. The seating inside the restaurant is pretty cool. It's made to look like a fast food place, but they give you buzzers when you order so you can sit down and wait for your food. The seating area is nice, and they have a bunch of big screen T.V's with sports on them to keep you busy. 

The cheeseburger with shake sauce was absolutely amazing. It definitely has a home made hamburger feel and taste. The vegetables were fresh. The bun was soft, and the meat was soft and tasty.  The crinkle cut fries were cooked perfectly. Not too crunchy, and not too soft! They are fresh made fries. The lemonade went well with the meal.

Gotta say I love the stack shack!  The flavor, the cheesy portobello mushroom....

However, this time going back I was a bit disappointed.....

Got the shroom burger...  It was super tiny! (Slider size) for $6.99... I totally thought it was much bigger... it was tasty but it wasn't worth the money... 

Cheese fries...  $3.95 or so... small portion as well but the cheese sauce on fries was delicious... but man... so little cheese too....  

Concrete:  Got the all in one chocolate concrete... it was not too sweet and yummy... but gotta take out the cookie dough and the toffee next time... way too sweet with those in it...

Final verdict... I would go back but probably won't purposely plan a visit there... (Like I did this time around)  The size of the burgers are simply not worth it... it was much bigger when they first opened but now it has shrunk in size... hope they will take into consideration and make their burgers slightly bigger....  Otherwise, they will not be a competition to in-n-out...",2,2,2

The outcome was cold fries that were sitting under a lamp for a very long time and soda that was prepared 25 minutes before our order was called so it was watered down from the ice melting. Hell, I didn't even order a soda. I ordered an iced tea! If they're going to force you to wait 25 minutes for EVERY order before yours, at least get it right and make sure it's somewhat fresh. The staff freely admit this is how the ordering system works. Yeah, a more complicated order will take longer. Guess what?

But giving our order was not so great. Our host, Deetreid, was not welcoming: did not say hi or smile and was busy writing as we stood in front of him, did not ask if my mom wanted any burger, was impatient when we wanted mint custard (the special flavor of the week). We said yes after talking to him about it. After verifying he read out our order. Picking up we found we were not given the custard and would have to go back to line. What. The. Heck. Not our fault. And the burger did not have extra lettuce or tomatoes as requested. Lesson learned. Make sure your order is correct not just what was said, but IN WRITING -- check your receipt! So looking again at the receipt: Hamburger, Shroom,  and fries for $15.27?? Not worth it. 

The burger was dry around the edges and hard to chew, fries dry... I made no happy food noise. My mom ate her Shroom (first time) and didn't say anything. Later said the mushroom was small and greasy. I loved all these when I went to the NYC locations (every time worth raving). Always perfect even though lines were long.

As people that grew up with In-N-Out, I have to say that Shake Shack is slightly better. We also ordered the Shac-ago Dog and some fries. 

I like that Shake Shack doesn't put too much sauce, but just the right amount. The bun was fluffy and I think a potato bread. It had the nice amount of lettuce and tomato (In-N-Out sometimes put too much lettuce). The patty was a nice portion around 1\/3 lb and the fries (crinkle) and was the perfect end to the trip.

I believe I read articles announcing the opening of the first Shake Shack on the West Coast in April on 2013. I myself was super excited because I had a few friends who tried it in New York and they couldn't stop talking about how AMAZING it was and the fact that it kicks In N Out's butt. FINALLY it opens a few days before New Year's and low and behold my friend's and I are there on opening day December 29, 2014 a Monday to be exact. If I wasn't working that day I probably would of been one of the first customers in line, if not the first. I really wanted to write a review after my first visit, but I wanted to give them another shot before knocking them down. I'm certainly glad I did because I would of given them 3 stars instead of 2.

My first visit, there was no line at all which is good considering all the horror stories with 45 minute waits at the NY locations. I ordered the Shack Stack and cheese fries based off of everyone's recommendation from Yelp and friend's of mine. I was honestly not a fan and did not understand the hype from these menu items. To begin with I am not a cheese at all and both of these are bombarded with cheese. I do enjoy cheese on fries, but maybe there was a too much cheese on these fries. Maybe if you order these you can request for light cheese or even have it on the side so you don't get overwhelmed with cheese. The Stack Shack has the portobello- mushroom breaded on the outside with cheese as well. This is a really good concept, but once again I was overwhelmed with cheese because there was already cheese on the burger itself. If I order this again I may just have to order it without cheese on the burger since there's already cheese in the portobello-mushroom. I also ordered a medium size lemonade and all of these came out to $17 and some change. WOW pretty pricey I must say. So I was kind of whatever about this experience, but I knew I should order different things on my next visit and sure enough I was there again the next week on a Friday. We arrive around 6pm and there was line of about 15-20 people. The line moves fast because there are 3 cashiers upfront and a ton of employees working the kitchen. They seem to be over staffed, but I guess that's beneficial for the patrons eating here. So this time I came here with my cousin and we share 1 order of fries and single scoop of All Shook Up. I ordered a Shack Burger for myself. And sure enough I was way more impressed with my selections this time around. Since there was less stuff going on in the burger I could truly taste the quality of the beef in comparison to In N Out. I also do appreciate the fact they use a better quality ice berg lettuce. Definitely in this case you get what you pay for. Although I do like crinkle cut fries, I still prefer In N Out's because of their freshness. You could tell these are made from Yukon Gold rather than whatever type of Cane's uses for their crinkle cut fries. My cousin and I really enjoyed the All Shook Up. The consistency and texture was perfect and concrete itself was not too sweet. For the most part I can see myself ordering a shake, concrete, or a custard item on my future visits. Next time I'm here with a bigger group I'll order the Shake a pooloza, which looks amazing in pictures. Although it is a pricey for $15?!

Looking around here you could tell all of the patrons eating here are into the up and rising food scene and just life in general? Haha. I do like the interior since it looks like recycled wood they used for their fixtures and table settings. I know I won't take an initiative, but with visitors from out of town they'll be like ""I want to try Shake Shack"" and I certainly be hiding my excitement inside because I've already tried it.",1,1,2

New York New York hotel now charges for parking, although the first hour is free. You'll need more than that to rest after stumbling on over hungover in the heat. It seems to always be pretty busy, so snagging a table was excruciatingly depressing. Have someone scout for a table while someone else orders for them. 

I always get the good old Shack Burger, no need for fancy toppings. The bun is fluffy but not mushy, the patty is perfectly soft. It just looks kinda soggy and underwhelming, but the taste is perfect to me. They have other options as well, such as a veggie burger with portobello instead of a patty. 

I dislike the fries here, as I like my fries on the crispier side. My friend ordered the cheese fries and they were SUPER salty. Between the five of us we couldn't finish it. My friend also ordered the Oreo shake, personally it was way too sweet for me but I'd give the shakes another chance.

I have to admit, it was really good. It came out so fresh and piping hot, my friend burned his tongue while taking his first bite. The melted cheese inside is like lava! They cook the burger to your desired temperature which made the practically-raw-eating animals in my company happy. And it was nice that they had a vegetarian option, although I'm not sure if it's cooked separately from the meat (guessing not). The fries were crispy with soft centers. I also had their signature lemonade of the day, Strawberry-Mint. It was good but admittedly, a little sweet and less tart than what I prefer. 

Most in my party finished off their portions and came away satisfied. However, we agreed it was all pretty heavy, even for burgers... We were in Vegas, didn't drink, and really felt all that grease!

Well, in my opinion, it depends on the tier. This place would get tortured against Plan Check. But against, In N' Out, that would be a fair match.

It's been a number of years since I've been to Shake Shack. The last time was in 10 degree weather in Manhattan walking a mile back and forth to my sister's place. Yup, we had frozen custard too. I remember the burger being good but not memorable. 

This time in Vegas, I was able to try Shake Shack again. Located at the storefront of New York New York where the roller coasters once ran, the portion facing Las Vegas Blvd. has been renovated with stores new walkway. 

I ordered a SmokeShack which is a cheeseburger with applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and Shacksauce. I also ordered fries and a Shack Attack Concrete.

The burger itself is very good. It's tasty, meaty seasoned well. The bacon is good makes the burger a bit saltier. Cherry peppers give slight kick and enhanced flavor. Fries are nothing special to my liking. Definitely doesn't seem like it comes from fresh potatoes. The Shack Attack was my dessert for the day and pretty good. It's a chocolate custard, fudge sauce, chocolate truffle cookie dough (thought it was a brownie), dark chocolate chunks, and chocolate sprinkles. Honestly, I liked this better than the burger. The only thing is that I didn't notice fudge sauce unless it got lost in the concoction of ingredients. I also had Abita Brewing draught root beer. This was more sugary than anything else. I missed the strong flavor of sarsaparilla. 

The interior is pretty cool with lots some communal seating. Great for catching a game. The vibe is more homely and a variety of other items including hot dogs, shroom burger, cold brew, beer, and wine. 

So who wins? In N Out of course. Nothing beats the freshness of In N Out's ingredients of bread made that day, meat never frozen, and freshly cut lettuce and onions (hold the tomato). There is a difference and I can tell. In terms of value, it's about twice the cost. 

Shake Shack is a solid burger but I've had burgers similar. I've had Wagyu Chuck at 4th Street Market in Santa Ana and there is a resemblance. Definitely a cool spot to visit. Try the Concretes (frozen custards) for sure. I'm still a fan. Come to LA. I'd come back.",66,47,56

Couple hours later I was in line and very happy for the veggie options and got the portobello mushroom burger & the cheese fries. As the buzzer rang and I went to go get my food I was immediately struck by the portions being definitely on the smaller side, I paid 10+ bucks for this, I thought, let's see if the taste makes up for the sizes & long story short I was left underwhelmed.
The burger it's self was decent, the flavor is there - it's very cheesy as the portobello is stuffed with cheese but the buns threw me off and looked very cheap and dry and the veggies inside didn't seem that fresh. The cheese fries were good, covered in a velveeta-like substance, not spectacular in any way shape or form, but good, passable I would say, is the word to describe them.
In summary this place is VERY overhyped, after eating loads of In & Out & Super Duper Burgers...Shake Shack has nothing on either, esp. on Super Duper Burgers.

I tried a burger, cheese fries and black and white milkshake.  I much prefer the fries from In N Out.  Thought cheese on top of crinkle fries would be revolutionary but I think I actually prefer it without the cheese.  The fries were just mehhh - I just prefer thinner fries I guess!  The burger was good from what I remember.  But what was worth coming back for sure was the milkshake! So creamy and indulgent...makes me want to go back and try all the other flavors!!",1,1,2

Given that both offer burgers that are about the same size with thin patties, and both compete as higher quality alternatives, against the mega burger chains in the fast food world, I'd say that's a pretty good claim. 

So, let's pretend that the In 'n Out Double Double, and the Double Shake Shack burger are the same price. The In 'n Out Double Double is the better burger, but not by much. The Shake Shack Double is as fresh, and is cooked correctly to order with consistency. One thing I really liked were the cherry peppers. Every burger needs a distinctive touch, and the cherry peppers are that distinctive touch for Shake Shack. In 'n Out wins because their beef is tastier, and the beef should be the star of the burger, right? In addition, In 'n Out fries are better too (not that In 'n Out makes great fries, I just think krinkle fries suck), and so is the lemonade. Speed and quality of service is better at In 'n Out as well, but Shake Shack's speed and service was good. Probably not fair to compare, as Shake Shack is working with a much larger menu. Where Shake Shack really shines is in their menu variety. They have much more to offer than In 'n Out in every facet from burgers to drinks and desserts. Their menu is definitely more creative as well. Fortunately, I got to sample several items, as I was with a large party, and everything was good.

So, let's come out of the pretend world and face the reality that bother burgers are not the same price. The Double Shake Shack burger is $7.00 (at least at the Las Vegas location), while the In 'n Out Double Double is $3.75 (for you east coasters that have yet to try In 'n Out... no I am not kidding!). Sorry, but at $7.00, the Double Shake Shack Burger (and neither is the $6.00 single) is not a standout in the ever evolving world of competitive fast food burgers, and certainly nowhere near the value of In 'n Out's burgers. Simply put, while Shake Shack makes a good burger, In 'n Out offers a better burger at almost half the price. End of debate.

I was tempted to give Shake Shack 4 stars because of it's variety of menu items and over all good quality, but I can't. Why? Well besides the burgers being way overpriced, the fries were just average at best. Burgers and fries are the heart and soul menu items of any burger joint. I just can't see anything more than 3 stars for a burger joint that has okay fries and overpriced burgers. If they they lowered their burger prices by 25% or made great fries like say 5 Guys, then I could see 4 stars.",1,1,1

The restaurant is located on the ground level.  Luckily, there wasn't a line at 9:30 pm.  The menu is quite large and it can be hard to choose from all the goodies.  I ordered a single ShackBurger and a small Abita root beer.  After paying, I was handed a pager and we went to secure a table.  The only table available was close to the entrance where the cold wind would blow in as people came and went. 

After a short wait, our food was ready for pick up at the counter.  The burger was delicious.  Each bite was better than the last.  The ShackSauce was savory with an umami note.  The Abita root beer was really tasty.  It's made with Louisiana cane sugar and spring water in Louisiana.

First thing that struck me was how big and nice looking the place was. There's a huge TV in the middle. The tables were really nice as well as the table used to be part of a Brooklyn bowling alley. 

Ordered the SmokeShack burger with a Shackmeister dog and a beer float. The burger was phenomenal. The cherry peppers added both flavor and heat without overpowering the burger. The pickles was crisp and tasty. My favorite part was that all these ingredients didn't make the burger all sloppy. There's a lot of places where you would order a burger with peppers, pickles, lettuce, and sauce, and it turns into mush but this burger held up. 

The hot dog was great as well. Definitely a very cheesy dog and the shallots gave it a nice crunch. The beer float at first didn't seem too appealing. Don't know what beer they used, it's something pretty dark. Reminds me of the Devastator double Bock but can't be certain. It's a bit much but when the vanilla custard melts and combines with the beer, the tastes compliment each other. I can get used to drinking beer through a straw if it's got that vanilla custard in it. 

Another great touch is that they had calories on the menu. I love when restaurants let you know how many calories you are getting. It didn't stop me from getting all the deliciousness but it's easier to log into myfitnesspal and cry later. 

Place is definitely a place to stop in and eat. It costs a little more than regular fast food but it's worth it.",2,1,2

Finally got to try this place to see if it lived up to the hype. Heard the wait in NY can be two hours or more. But don't worry! The wait was no more than 10 min to order and another 15 min to get your food. Enjoy a beer while you wait!

My friend and I ordered the original Shake Shack burgers. Always gotta judge the place based on the og burger! I must say the meat was pretty thick & juicy, but the burger was quite small overall. The buns were a bit dense as well. I ended up picking 1\/3 of it out. Also, I don't know how they messed it up but one of our burgers came without tomatoes and the other came without onions. Seriously? How hard is it to put in the basic ingredients to your basic cheeseburger. We didn't ask for anything fancy. Just the two original Shake Shack cheeseburgers. (This would never happen at In N Out. Just sayin'.)

Anyway. Idk how people wait HOURS for this burger. But. I'm glad I tried it once. So I have a right to say that In N Out is better than Shake Shack. Hands down. (But maybe I'm a bit biased).

I love In-n-Out and now I love Shake Shack too! Aww! It's like the Biggie & Tupac battle, except I don't think this will end in blood shed. 

Came here for a Social Media meet up which also happened to be my first time at Shake Shack, ever, and what I noticed right off the bat was the layout. This place looks nothing like a fast food restaurant, much more modern and clean, which is surprising for a place right on the Strip. SS offers a lot of space to sit inside and two different outdoor seating areas, fully equipped with misters for those brain burning one hundred plus degree Vegas days. 

We ordered a ton food, Shack Burgers, Shack Stacks, Cheese fries, Shack-Cago dogs, and a Few Concretes. First off, Shake Shack kills it on presentation alone. The food looks amazing and is stacked with bright and colorful veggies, the perfect sear on the patty, and lots of Shack Sauce. Gotta have Shack Sauce. 

The Shack Burger is the perfect American cheeseburger. A thick patty, SS sauce and cheese. Cooked perfect and the buns are not only delicious carby pillows, but also connected on one end to avoid any filling from sliding out the back. Perfect burger for the SS skeptic. 

The Shack Stack is the same burger, but with a fried Portobello mushroom inside that's stuffed with cheese. This was my favorite of the entire meal, the mushroom was perfectly cooked and the fry coating on it was amazing. 

The Shack-Cago dog was very good, but fell apart as you ate it. Still the flavor was there, pickles, onions, tomato, sauce, and the bun. Great alternate meal option if you're feeling a burger at the moment. 

The cheese fries were okay, and I didn't try the concrete. I'm just not into sweets. 

In-n-out or Shake Shack? The burger at Shake Shack is better, by far, but In-n-Out has the fry game on lock. In my mind, this is a straight burger tie. 

I guess I'll just have to eat at each place again and keeping trying to break that tie. Oh the perils of Yelp life.",19,13,15

My friends and I came on a Saturday afternoon during Labor Day weekend and the line was pretty long but it moved fairly quickly. It was actually kind of nice standing in line because it gave us an adequate amount of time to decide what we wanted to order.

After reading through a bunch of reviews, I decided to order the Shack Stack and a side of cheese fries. The burger was a little smaller than I had anticipated but it was still so good nonetheless! I'm a big mushroom lover so the cheesy mushroom on top of the patty made the entire burger taste delicious. The ingredients tasted pretty fresh too. Even my friend who doesn't like mushrooms really enjoyed the bite she tried! From the rest of my friends' feedback from their orders, it seems like the Shack Stack is the only burger worth getting here. I could be wrong.. But they definitely didn't enjoy their burger as much as I enjoyed mine! So if you're a mushroom fan, definitely get the Shack Stack. It won't disappoint!

A lot of my friends would rave about this place so I was so excited finding out there was one in Vegas... but alas, OVERHYPED.

Quick points:
* They don't do grilled onions or any type of garnishes, not even lemon wedges.

* Strawberry mint lemonade was just weird, where's the mint purée that the description said?

* We had a little conversation with the cashier about not having grilled onions, and it was fine and whatever... Then they buzzed us with the buzzer they gave us and thought we were getting food, but all they did was talk more about the grilled onions and why they don't have it... Like, why would you tease me with that buzz? I was over the grilled onions already, geez.

* They did have bomb crinkle cut fries though.

* Burger was good, just not as good as I was expecting.

Unfortunately, I was recovering from a bout of gastroenteritis (coincidentally, just like when I first tried Shake Shack in New York).  I settle for a simple single Shack Burger and it was just as delicious as the first time.  The patty is a little crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and tastes like real barbeque.  Creamy Shack sauce makes it even more delectable.  It is a little on the pricier side for a fast food burger, but I believe you're paying for a quality product.  My boyfriend seemed to agree- after wolfing down a double SmokeShack, he quickly stood up for seconds- a Shack Burger & chicken dog (!!!)

There was hardly a line on opening day and the staff were super friendly and genuinely excited to serve us.  Maybe they were just well prepared, but hopefully the service stays the same.  Doesn't hurt that they also have their own exclusive beer & wine.

This time, I had my nephews with me in Vegas for them to have a taste of the East Coast. It's much larger and spacious compared to the locations I've been in New York. It gets busy, but the line gets by fast and the wait time for the food was about 10 minutes. We ordered the Shakeshack burger, Smokeshack burger, Hot dog, Crinkle Fries, and their milkshakes.

Food:
Shack burger is like a classic cheeseburger with buns, patty, lettuce, tomato, and cheese with their shack sauce spread. The goodness and quality of the burger gave it a thumbs up. If you're indecisive on which to try out, you can't go wrong with originality for the Shack burger.

Smokeshack burger was what my nephew had. He liked it, but would rather try out Shackburger for a more colorful topping in his burger with the lettuce and tomatoes. Perfect for bacon lovers!

Hot dog was basic. Hot and grilled with the hot dog split open at the center, I can't say much since my nephew likes his hot dog plain, naked, and boring.

Fries: Crispy, toasted fries which were good but may be basic for some. Some like theirs with cheese added, I preferred mine plain.

Milkshakes: I had the Black and White as recommended by the staff as their popular pick and I liked it. It wasn't too thick that I can't slurp like the ones I had from In and Out. My nephew had vanilla for his and enjoyed it as well.

Verdict: Pretty good for a fast food, comparable to In & Out with their food made with quality. As a California girl, In & Out is just as good as Shake Shack that I can't compare the two. Both have their goodness in different ways. In & Out caters more of a classic menu with their not so secret menus. Shake Shack offers a little more variety to their burgers and shakes, also selling alcohol at this location. In & Out's prices are more affordable than Shake Shack. In & Out's burger sells an average of $3, while the Shack Burger goes for $5, and the Smokeshack was close to $7. ShakeShack's shakes costs a little more than the Shack burger itself. Would I have it again? I would, if I happen to be in town since there's no Shake Shack in the Bay Area.",1,0,1

I had a tough choice with the menu, so many good burgers - simple or special? And their dessert list was huge. I decided on the SmokeStack (double burger with bacon, cheese and peppers), crinkly fries and a ""blueberry pie, oh my"" frozen custard. 

The burger was great! It was spicy and the meat was juicy and messy. The fries were good. And that blueberry pie custard was friggin amazing. I was impressed with this spot.

There was a wait during dinner time on a Saturday night but it wasn't too bad.  I ended up ordering a double shack burger, cheese fries, as well as a large lemonade.  They have two kinds of lemonade, one regular and a seasonal one.  I sampled both and the regular lemonade was far superior.

I usually hate crinkle cut fries cause I feel they don't stay as crisp and they get really soggy, but these weren't too bad.  The shack burger is just your basic burger, just patty, lettuce, and tomato.  The patty is cooked medium and has amazing flavor and it's really juicy.  The bun is a little soggy though and I wish there were more to the burger instead of just lettuce and tomato.

Everyone compares Shake Shack to In-N-Out, but I feel like it's an unfair comparison.  Personally I feel that Shake Shack tastes better, but it's double the price.  For a few extra bucks you can probably go ahead and get yourself a gourmet burger.  Also when you as for a refill they ask you to throw away your old cup and they'll get you a new one.

We walk in as a group of 4. The lines looked long but they went by pretty fast. I ordered the Shack burger and a chocolate milk shake. The food came out within 10 minutes. When I first saw the burger, it looked like a Mcdonalds cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato. I didn't realize how small the burger was going to be. I literally ate the burger in 4 bites. No lie. I was a bit hung over still so I figured the a single shack burger would be enough. The patty to me seemed pretty flavorful. Our group ordered 2 cheese fries. Big mistake for me. I didn't really enjoy cheese on the fries. I think I was just craving more of the plain fries with ketchup. My chocolate milk shake was okay. I tried the strawberry milkshake too and it was also okay. 

Overall, I was not blown away by this place at all. Maybe if I tried the burger where it was born (on the east coast), it would have tasted better. Probably because its in Vegas it was just okay. But then again, based off of what I had, In-N-Out poops on this place. Maybe because I'm a west coaster, but In-N-Out in all aspects is better than this place.

Everyone raves about Shake Shack, particularly my East Coast buds, and being an In n' Out advocate, I was eager to see what the all hubbub was about. I wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be. 

I tried a peanut butter chocolate milkshake (DUH. SHAKE shack), fries, and their special burger Roadside Shack burger. I absolutely adored the shake. You can tell its a legit real ice cream, real peanut butter shake. I was majorly impressed. The fries were crispy and crinkle cut so naturally I loved them. However the actual burger was a huge disappointment. It was overly salty and the caramelized onions were composed of salty goo and a few diced onions. However, when my mouth adjusted to the aggressive amount of salt, I did get to taste the cheddar cheese and it was so good. Very natural, sharp cheddar. 

I will definitely go back and try a different burger. Maybe this special won't last long. But be warned, the Roadside Shack is a dud. 

The place does have wonderful ambience and its for sure a chill place to sit down and grab a bite on the strip. Doesn't feel like a fast food joint at all.",3,2,5

My family and the boy took a short trip to Vegas before NYE and he found out there's a shake shack at the NYNY hotel so he dragged me there the first night we were there. I let him order the shack stack, crinkle fries, and a cranberry ginger lemonade to share since it was a midnight snack. My favorite burger place have always been In-N-Out and I can't imagine something else being more tastier and satisfying. The price is definitely pricier here, almost $10 for each burger so I had high expectations.

The interior was very nice and it was packed so I was lucky to find a table for my boy and I. Food came out about 10 minutes later and from the look of the burger, it looks really good, but I was scared to taste it just because I'm In-n-out biased. 

Not much of a fan of mushrooms, but it was fried with some cheese filling so I guess that hides it. The first bite of the burger made me cry...not because the mushroom disgusted me, but because with the patty, lettuce, and everything...IT WAS ACTUALLY GOOD..like REALLY GOOD. The cheese-filled fried mushroom exploded in my mouth which gave me an instant reaction. I combined both burger and fries together for a combo bite and it literally can't get any better.

So now I'm here writing this review, crying in the inside, because for the first time I can admit that I can't be a bias for In-n-out if I fell in love with Shake Shack. The quality all around is way better for the burger AND fries; I always had a lowkey issue for in-n-out fries.

So my final statement is that if I could, I would go to shake shack overall, but since there isn't a location in California, I'll stick to In-n-out WHICH IS STILL TASTY AND SATISFYING.

Someone should petition to open a location in southern California. PLEASE. #ShakeShackCA2K16",0,2,0

Ordered a Single ShackBurger and Cheese Fries.  My gf got the Shack Stack and regular fries.

My ShackBurger was okay.  It reminded me of a Wendy's burger.  My girlfriend's Shack Stack is a burger with a big piece of breaded mushroom.  That was alright except for the fact that it's priced at $10.  Worth $10?  No way.

As for the Cheese Fries.  Eh.  Cheese sauce on crinkle-cut fries.  Didn't wow me.  The regular crinkle-cut fries, it works.

Shake Shack serves my favorite burgers and I can't get them in California so whenever we come out to Vegas I make it a point to come here at least once. Their patties are never too greasy, buns are soft and lightly toasted, and the fixings are always fresh. People usually forget that Shake Shack started off as a hot dog stand but give the Shack-cago Dog a try and you'll realize that Shake Shack is more than just burgers and shakes. On that note, you have to order their crinkle cut fries too and if you like cheese, definitely add that cheese sauce. It's straight up liquid crack, it's so addictive!

The frozen custard is also ridiculously creamy and delicious. I just tried their holiday cookie flavor this week and it just might be my favorite yet, too bad it's seasonal. Vanilla is usually my default when ordering.

The interior is spacious and even though in recent times I feel like Shake Shack is becoming insanely popular, the ordering line moves fast and usually a table will open up while you're waiting for your food to be ready.

But my cheeseburger was a medium size, not that small, but not that big either. I was able to kill it. Haha the breaded mushroom on the shack stack is amazing. Great mushroom flavor with a little extra crunch and flavor from the breading. 

Yes, I also ordered their version of a Chicago dog to try.. When in Vegas, right?? The flavor was great, but I did have some problems... The bun was too weak to support all the goodness, and it broke as soon as I tried to lift up the hot dog. Had to use a knife and fork... Also, the hot dog itself actually tasted a bit tough. Not buttery or juicy. Sigh!

Their crinkle cut fries were nice and crunchy.  Hubby ordered his fries with cheese, but you could probably do without, bc everything else is so rich and savory (and likely also with cheese), the cheese on the fries actually got overpowered!

The first time my friend told me about Shake Shack, I was in disbelieve when he told me he thought the burgers at SS tasted better than In-N-Out. We're both In-N-Out faithfuls (and SoCal residents) so to hear this came as a bit of a shock and disbelief. And then I tried Shake Shack last year in Boston for the first time. And I was an instant fan. Since then, I've been craving Shake Shack for countless months and now it's only hours away in the West Coast! 

Is Shake Shack truly better than In-N-Out? That will always be the big debate for Californians.  I would have to say yes (*gasp!) but it also depends on what you're basing it on.  For overall value, quality, fries, and those toasted buns, In-N-Out wins.  But for overall flavor and the taste of the meat, Shake Shack truly shines. And aren't the elements of a good hamburger judged on the quality and flavor of the meat patty, anyway? And their shakes are also just as delicious. They're thick, but you can still manage to easily suck through the straw without getting a hangover.

First timers, try the original ShackBurger to start your In-N-Out comparisons.  For those that want a kick in flavor, get the SmokeShack burger.  But my current favorite is the new ShackMeister with onion strings. It's full of flavor and absolutely delicious. Pair it with crinkle cut fries and a Red Velvet Shake, and life is complete.

FOOD: I got the Bacon Cheese Fries (Best decision I've ever made. SO worth the extra 60 cents from reg. cheese fries) So my advice...do it! Indulge!
Next, I got the Smoke Shack (Crispy bacon, cheese, and cherry tomatoes on a well cooked patty and a warm fluffy bun). I got the cherry peppers on the side since the flavor is sometimes overbearing for me (I can't handle anything remotely spicy). But I liked doing this since I could then control the flavor and how many or little I put in my burger. So, if you're anything like me, it's worth a shot. 

INTERIOR: Busy, busy, busy! It is SO hard to find an indoor seat here. And it's a little chaotic (Think...fast food joint on steroids!)

We got there and the line was almost out the door. We probably waited for about 20 minutes to place our order. I ordered the ShackBurger with cheese and a Chocolate Malted Shake. Hubby got some special burger with crispy onions and a special sauce (i think?) and a coffee shake. We shared an order of the cheese crinkle fries.

The place was filled with large TVs so the hubby was able to watch his sports while we waited. Food came in about 15-20 minutes.

Couple of weeks ago, I went to Vegas with my family. Upon hearing that there's a Shake Shack that recently opened along Las Vegas strip, I was eager to give it a try again before going back to L.A.....and that time, I was impressed.

I ordered a cheese burger. What I like about this burger is that the patty is the thickest one I've ever had recently. As most of the burger chains's patties have been shrinking, Shake Shack maintained the same thickness of patty I had 5 years ago. Thumbs up!! I also had French fries and chocolate milk shake, which there were nothing special. 

It was a very busy night, and so, our orders got messed up and missed a lot of orders. However, they were corrected promptly after telling them what we were missing. And also because it was very busy that night, it took a while to get our orders.

I'm sorry, even though I grew up here in California and around the venerable In n Out Burger, I would tip my hat off to Shake Shack, the definitive winner (IMO) between the two rivals. 
My first encounter of Shake Shack was when my sister-in-law visited us form Delaware. A connecting flight through New York she gave us a bag full of Shake Shack burgers. Upon first bite, I was scratching my head and was thinking: ""how the heck does this burger still taste hella good after being in a bag for at least 8 hours?"" That is when I researched and learned the wildfire growth of Shake Shack in the Eask Coast. 

Well finally, we have a change to try Shake Shack; freshly made. They have a location at New York New York at Las Vegas so we just had to try it out. Of course, I tried out their SmokeShack, cheeseburger topped with bacon. I just had their regular crinkle cut fires to accompany my sandwich as I am focused on their burger. 

My prediction is confirmed form my previous encounter: a very delicious burger with an equally delicious bun. The only word I can describe their bun is Artisan. And the beef, mmm. The beef patty is so delicious, Prime grade beef is what I could only think off when I taste Shake Shack's beef patty; that and a generous portion of fat. Just so delicious.
And still I chose the wrong burger.

The rest of my family ordered different Shake Shack burgers. The Stack Shack (IMO) is their flagship burger. Coupled with a large whole Portobello mushroom, (a different new approach to mushroom btw) Stack Shack is crème de la crème. 

With objectivity still present, Shake Shacks' fries were alright and In n Out's is better. My daughter ordered their cheese fries and it was mediocre. But I have not yet scratched the surface of Shake Shak's menu: Custards, Chickens, Hot Dogs, and a multitude of drinks. But as far as I know Shake Shack is the king of fast casual burgers.

My friends have compared it to In and Out and I have to say that In and Out wins because of price, taste, and quality. 

I ordered the shack burger since I figured it seemed sensible to try out their original burger. When I picked it up it looked like a regular burger with no qualities that would make it stand out in my mind. Another thing I didn't like was how runny the sauce and cheese was. The bun was really soft and squishy which was weird because I am used to bread that has some sort of stability. The burger tasted alright. It had a more charred taste to it, kind of like the burgers you would have at a bbq. 

The crinkle cut fries were actually pretty good so that brought in some redemption lol. They were crispy which is really important to me because soggy fries are just nasty. If you are going to eat unhealthy, you got to do it right!

I didn't try the shake this time, but I might come back just to check it out since the place is called Shake Shack haha. I did get the SHACK-A-PALOOZA with my friends which was pretty good! The only downer is that it was pretty small looking for the price of $15.95.

They also make sure customers are heading to the registers as soon as one becomes available to keep the line moving. There is a big menu board to look at while you are in line with prices and calories.

We ordered with a friendly employee at her register. We got our beer order first. Then, we waited for our food. While waiting, we saw how crazy good the employees were at their job! There were a ton of them, and they were getting food out quickly! If someone came to the counter to complain or ask for something, they were quick to resolve the problem or get the items customers needed. I was definitely amazed.

And our food? It was great! It was just as I remembered and the reason I had to go to this location when I heard about it!",11,6,7

It's not as hyped up as many of my friends tell me it is. It is a little better than In & Out (in the quality) but the price is what makes In & Out slightly better since these burgers are not cheap! But if you're comparing it to the pricey buffets and other restaurants on the strip, this is not a bad place to dine at. You're in vegas, you're on vacation - let it loose and eat fast food burgers! 

Friends & I ordered the shackburger, shroom burger, fries and all shook up concrete (frozen custard blend).  The fries were crisp and favored over In & Out's fries. The shroom burger was decent, not mind blowing amazingly good though. The size of these burgers are also a little small too. As for the all shook up custard blend, I wasn't a huge fan of the banana cake but loved the toffee bits.

Located outside on the Strip at New York New York, Shake Shack is the latest addition to the already saturated 'upscale burger' scene here in Vegas. Upon walking in you are greeted by a massive menu board where you make your selection, order at the window, and pick up your food shortly thereafter. The restaurant has open seating so good luck finding a spot to grub. There is no server\/waiter, but they got the orders our fast and turned tables quickly. Now don't let the ordering and seating situation fool you, the price and quality here is pretty much the same as an burger restaurant on the Strip. A burger, fries, and drink\/shake will run you anywhere from $15-20. 

During my visit I tried the Smokeshack, fries and their homemade lemonade. I was surprised at the tangy flavor from the cherry peppers and the quality of the ingredients. The crinkle cut fries were thick and fresh, much better than what you get at White Castle or Cane's.  They have the option of smothering them with cheese and I recommend it! The lemonade was pretty standard but they got free refills so no issue there. 

The restaurant itself is pretty nice; as would be expected for any recent addition to the Strip. The interior has a sleek modern look to it; featuring a small lounge area where you can wait for your to-go order and sizeable dining area if you are eating in. There is plenty of outdoor patio seats available and its only gonna get better when New York New York opens its 'Central Park' area right next to SS. Overall its nice to see a place live up to the hype and worth checking out.",3,2,1

I'll say this, though: Shake Shack is freakin' delicious.

First of all, I'm embarrassed that it took me until 2015 to finally eat at Shake Shack.  I dropped by their Las Vegas location (in front of New York New York) for an early lunch.  There was a short line but it moved quickly.

I had a Shackburger (with added pickle and onions), a small side of crinkle cut fries, and a ""Shack Attack"" concrete (chocolate custard with fudge sauce and chocolate truffle cookie dough).

The food was ready for pick-up within 5 minutes, and in my belly in something like 3 milliseconds.  It was that good.  The burger was juicy, the fries were crispy, and the concrete was decadent.  I left Shake Shack feeling very, very happy.

Prices are some of the best on the Strip.  No up-charges to speak of.  I can't think of anyplace else on the Strip where you can get this caliber of a burger for $5.

I'm pretty much obsessed with Shake Shack now.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll skip so-called ""fine dining"" and eat all my meals here instead.  And I'll Instagram the results in obnoxious detail (natch).

Better yet: Shake Shack could open up a San Diego location.  That would be nice......",8,6,8

Atmosphere: The place was really over the top with lights and what night considering it was vegas. However, the seating was great inside and out. The outside seating had misters which was great for the heat. Inside where mostly booths which were comfortable. 

Service: The folks at the register were very friendly. Which is saying a lot because it was packed. They were moving the line rather quickly and we didnt have to wait long at all.

Food: It took about 10 minutes to get our food. We ordered the Double smoke shack, a single cheeseburger, and two single shake burgers. We got three orders of fries and a strawberry shake, chocolate and peanut butter shake to top it off.
The burgers had the special shake seasoning which gave the burgers a wonderful charbroil. The burgers were perfect bun to meat ratio and lived up to the hype. The fries was fantastic. The shakes were thick and rich with flavor.

To start I was not a fan of the bun. It was soft and mushy. I prefer it being slightly toasted to have a little contrast to the meat and toppings. I also felt the double patty was a little too much meat for the bun that was used. I ate about 4\/5th of the burger before I was full. The crinkle cut fries also lacked seasoning for me. 

Out of the three of us that ate, one friend liked his burger but none of us need to eat here again. They also orderd the cheese fries but it was severly lacking on the cheese sauce. One of them ordered a burger, cheese fries and shake and the total was $18 after tax.",1,0,1

We walked up the steps and went through the dessert only line which features a takeout window outside on the patio.  We walked up and received a typical mediocre ""whaddyawant"" fast food greeting.  I ordered my black and white shake and paid my money.  The clerk turned around and grabbed a pre made shake, put it on the counter and said, ""here you go.""

I heard a lot of people rave about Shake Shack burgers and know that they line up to get them but, I was really disappointed when I decided to give them a try on my last trip to Vegas. I wanted to keep it simple so I had the ""ShackBurger"". There is absolutely nothing special about it. It's like a much smaller version of something that you would get a family chain restaurant. Bleh.

I can't comment on the fries because I didn't try them. They looked OK but I wanted to try a shake instead. I enjoyed the shake. They had a few more flavors to choose from but I went with the basic chocolate ( 'cause I like to keep it simple). It was on the ""runny"" side but I actually like them when you can get them through a straw right away. 

I don't know what it is but maybe people are too caught up in the publicity and say something great about the food to go along with the crowd. I'm pretty sure if you did a blind taste test against some smaller fast food chains these burgers would be at the bottom.

I went with something simple their single burger. Nothing special. Could've made it at home. Would've thought their base stuff would be at least decent. Nope. A whopper or  something from Wendy's would've been better. It was small and too simple for the price. Its more like In and Out nothing flashy. GOOD!? Get out of here. 

Had to try a shake. Went with red velvet shake. Not bad. Good I liked it especially after walking the strip on a 100 degree kind of day but nothing special. Taste like a red velvet shake from anywhere else that serves it. Small and simple for the price once again. Strip price!? Maybe.

The atmosphere is pretty chill, I like it. They have nice inside with tvs and mostly spacious dining. Tables have lots of elbow room but back to back a little tight depending on who sits next to you. They have some seatings outside too.

I'm sure this place is good and I'm probably not only person to come in knowing nothing about the place but who's fault is it for my experience the employee or mine. Anyways I might try them out again but not anytime soon unless I hear about something I really have to try.

*Disclaimer - It is inevitable to compare this place to In N Out, please continue reading at your discretion.  

Ever since my trip to New York back in 2011 I have only dreamed of having Shake Shack again so when the news spread that there was one opening in Vegas, I knew this was my chance. Before I've eaten here, In N Out held the throne as the best fast food burger you could get. After many postponements, I finally made a trip out to Vegas with a few Yelp friends. I knew our first stop was going to be Shake Shack no matter what since it thankfully closes late. After checking into the hotel and dropping our luggage off, we headed to the New York New York hotel. 

The restaurant is located on the strip with a huge sign so it is really hard to miss. We arrived around 1:30 am and there was no line at all which was nice since we were all famished! The burger menu is fairly straightforward, there is the original ShackBurger which is their standard cheeseburger, the Smokeshack which has bacon and chopped cherry peppers or you can opt for a vegetarian option with the 'Shroom burger. If you are feeling really adventurous you can get the Shack stack which is the 'Shroom with the standard cheeseburger. Besides burgers they offer hot dogs, a variety of dessert items as well as craft beer and wine!   

Since I've already looked through the menu countless of times, I decided to go all out and get the Smokeshack burger with a double patty with an order of cheese fries and the fifty\/fifty drink which is half lemonade and tea. The cashier was very friendly; I wonder how much they make. I think the best customer service for fast food places are in no particular order: In n out, Chick-fil-a and Shake Shack. 

When you finish ordering, you get a buzzer to wait for your order; from here you can choose to find a place to sit at the vast interior or outside. It is nice that they have more than just the conventional seating of booths or tables, but also a few large lounge chair seating available. I sat down and waited anxiously for my buzzer to go off like if I held the winning lotto ticket. The wait seemed like forever but finally it was my turn to head to the counter to pick up my order. Walking back to the table shaking with anticipation I finally took a big bite after 4 long years of waiting and I can only describe it as THE ideal burger to which all burgers should be judged upon, it is THAT GOOD. Where to start? The buns are potato roll that is SUPER soft. Like In N Out, only FRESH ingredients are used to ensure the best taste from the crisp lettuce, tomato, pickle and onions, there is no trickery here. So what makes this place the king of all burgers? The patty. The patties here are larger than In N Out and not as smothered in sauce and super juicy. Combined with the bun, cheese, pickle and onions and last but not least BACON every bite is like a party in your mouth. I am also a fan of crinkle cut fries; there is just something about the ridges and the crispiness to it that a regular fry cannot achieve. Smother it in cheese and you got a clear winner. 

Needless to say that every bite of the burger was just as delicious as the first by the time I finished it I was craving another. It's so good if fact that I came here a SECOND time before I left because I missed the awesome goodness. Scrolling through the more negative reviews, I realized that many people have a common complaint which is the price. I understand how this can be a concern but it's not like you are eating it every day. This burger is better than most sit down restaurants and you are paying equally if not more to eat a burger there so I don't understand the complaint. If there was a Shake Shack locally to where I lived, I would be happy to indulge in it maybe once a week or every other week and I'm sure it is not going to break the bank. 

Well, if you have made it this far down the review then I congratulate you. 5\/5, 10\/10, whatever your grading scale is, this place takes it EASY.

Sorry, too much Colbert lately.

No chocolate cake but the secret menu has two true stand outs; a burger and a hard beverage.  The first, released for one day, then pulled over concerns of peanut cross contamination, the second, who knows.  Both remains unpublished and unlisted but even on the Vegas Strip, they know what you want when you order them.
 
Peanut Butter Bacon Burger - The solid, salt and pepper seasoned single hamburger, meaty applewood smoked bacon and a side of peanut butter sauce.  Just pour the sauce over the patty and let the residual heat do the rest, making a oozing, slimy coating as the melting peanut sauce mixes with the beef fat.  Sounds horrible but wow, it works.

Shandy - Half and half mix of their Shack made lemonade and ShackMeister Ale.  Weird combo that somehow washes everything down without being off tasting..  Hair of the dog or just needing to cool down from the rising Vegas heat.  Oddly refreshing with its sour citrusy notes, sweet punch from the sugar, and bitter notes of the beer.

The two go together like peas and carrots, ""run Jeffery run!""  Oops too much SNL.

All items are recommended. Would rotate through and give everything a try. And I wouldn't invite comparisons to In N Out--they're pretty different.

Anyways, veterans of Shake Shack know that if you've never been here, you always get that Shack Stack with a side of crinkle cut fries.

The only issue I have with the location of this place is that it's really only accessible by walking. If you drive here, you end up having to park in NY NY's parking garage.

After leaving the nearby T-Mobile Arena, this seemed like the perfect place to stop (close by). We walked in the door & went to stand in line only to be told by an attendant at a completely different door that we would have to go out through that door & wait in line. The attendant at the door was letting one to two people in at a time. I felt this was kind of strange but she opened the door just far enough so we could slip past her to stand in line behind one other person. As soon as we walked out & got behind that person, she said it was ok for us to go in. Note: why not put a sign on the door leading everyone to the one door to stand in line. This was just awkward.

Shroom Burger ($6.99): another good thing about this place is that it has option for vegetarian. And their shroom burger is the bomb. They deep dried the mushroom and stacked with cheese in the middle. Very delicious! 

Fries ($2.99): the fries are okay in my opinion. It reminds me of Del Taco fries. It's very crispy and not oily but I prefer regular fries for burgers more. Everyone seem to get cheese for this type of fries but no thanks.",1,0,0

Luckily the line went fast and it wasn't that hot yet, so we toughed it. It also provided us with time to people watch on the strip. Just can't beat seeing a dirty Olaf with a man purse.

There were three of us so we shared two orders of fries. The fries were pretty good - definitely tasty. My kid got shackburger and the hubby and I shared the smoke shack and the Shackmeister dog. Overall the burgers and dog were good, but definitely not my favorite. I wasn't a big fan of the shake sauce - it almost had a cream cheese quality to it - maybe that's what in it? Whatever is in it, it's just ok. Also, the crispy shallots fell short. The young lady who took our order (who was very nice, by the way) described them in a way that made them sound more like grilled onions. The breading was just too much.

Luckily, there is a separate ""C"" or cold line so you don't have to wait in line for a dessert. We decided to all share the Shack Attack. It was good, not great. For one thing, the dang thing was expensive and the way they fix it, you end up with a giant hole in the middle of the cup. You seriously get about half of what you expect.  Also, it was supposed to be a concrete, but it wasn't that thick. Just seemed like a milk shake that was a little thicker than normal. I do have a favorite neighborhood concrete place so maybe I'm biased.

Like most fast food joints, there isn't really a service other than getting your food, which took a little bit, but goddam was it worth it.

My wife and I ordered the burger and fries, along with a salted caramel hot chocolate (hey, I asked if she wanted a shake...and she wanted the hot chocolate. So the review has the hot chocolate. And not the shake. From Shake Shack...). The burger was unimaginably delicious. The umami, mixed with the beautiful acidity of the ketchup, the crispness of the vegetables, the soft and oh-so-buttery and flaky brioche bun, all combining to drop an absolute bomb of flavor in my mouth. The only disappointing thing was that the burger was a bit small so I ended up inhaling only half (between my wife and I) and I wanted more and more and more. In retrospect, I should have said to hell with what we had planned and to eat here instead. The fries were crinkle cut (my favorite!!!!) and super crispy with a deliciously flaky potato center. This meal was exactly what I want to eat. And it blows that it's all the way in Vegas!

TL;DR Damn good burgers. Shake Shack is better than In-N-Out. Burn me.",3,2,4

I just ordered their basic double cheeseburger and cheese fries.  I was underwhelmed.  It tasted pretty basic for a burger.  It tasted good, but I didn't see what all the hype was about.  And its definitely not a burger that I would wait a long time in line to get.  

Pros: Bun was nice, meat quality was good, and veggies were fresh.  
Cons: pretty small sized burger, even for a double burger.  I was still hungry afterwards.  And the cheese tasted pretty cheap.  Cheese whiz?  Didn't do anything for the fries but make them soggy.  Crinkly Cut French Fries?  What is this, High School?  If I am paying premium, I expect better french fries.  Overpriced for what you get.  

I would rather have In-N-Out, Fatburger, or Five Guys over Shake Shack.  I do think NY has it over the rest of the country in regards to pizza and bagels.  But for their burgers, they can go back to the end of the line.",0,0,0

So the lines here are always incredibly long, but the process was pretty quick. Didn't have to wait for too long. Nice and open space with many windows and proper seating. Their were many young people here just chowin down on some fancy fast food grub. I opted for the mushroom burger (its a fried mushroom burger with cheese). Felt like eating vegetarian, as its the option I primarily try to choose when dining out. Ordered some fries and the chocolate concrete as well. The food was decent, mushroom burger was a bit on the small side. It was a bit difficult to eat as the mushroom became rubbery and chewing after getting fried. French fries were okay. The chocolate concrete with the chocolate sprinkles was probably the best thing I ate. It was creamy and luscious. Their were a few brownie bits sprinkled in, but definitely not enough.

The shakes\/concretes are not bad. They definitely don't stand out quite like the Shack Stack but taste great with a burger and fries.

Shake Shack's restaurants are excellent places to dine in. Unlike most fast food establishments, SS offers a fun, upbeat atmosphere with up-to-date design features that add to the experience. Unique architecture, modern design and well thought out logistics make things all the better. Large tv's are located throughout the place and Customers are given a vibrating device to let them know when their order is ready - much better than trying to listen for your number to be called.

The burger was less sloppy and more tasty than In and Out, the fries are great and crinkle cut which is my favorite type and the shake was very good (got peanut butter). Overall it was a great experience and I'd totally go back again.

So excited that I got the whole shabang - a black & white shake, cheese fries, and double shackburger - for a whopping $19 thinking it would be enough for 2. Oh boy was I wrong. 

The double shackburger was really good and juicy. I loved the sauce and taste but it was puny AF. It looked a bit smaller than the In out one but for triple the price. I finished my half in 3 bites and then moved onto the fries in hopes of finding more for my belly. Those crinkly fries were good and an average size. The black and white shake was not what it was sought out to be - a vanilla milkshake with chocolate sauce swirled in. It might as well been just a straight up chocolate shake. After this snack, I was left with wanting more but did not have the dough to fulfill my cravings. Even if I bought another burger I doubt that I would have been full anyway. 

I like how this NY burger joint is located in the New York New York Casino across from MGM. Kinda cool :) The decor was nice and modern. Service uh was a tidbit rude at the cash register.

So I came here today after some raving reviews from a friend of mine. She likes this place over In-N-Out and it's super delicious blah blah blah.

Came around 2pm to a short line outside and spoke to the usher guy outside who says he eats 4 of these things a day and brings then back home to his wife...so I start thinking...""how big are these burgers?"". He explains how the menu works and all that good stuff.

Went inside and waited in the second line and looked over the decor...I don't care...It's about the food. Just looked kinda hipster\/umami-esq...No big deal.

Ended up getting a single of the one with bacon and peppers while the gf got a single of their claim to fame (sorry I forget the names). I opted for the single because I couldn't get myself to spend 3 extra dollars for a 4oz meat patty. I got the Chicago style hot dog instead to try more of the menu and fries and topped it off with a concrete (kinda like a blizzard from DQ) with the strawberry and waffle pieces. Got a side of fries and bill came to $28 bucks....whoo...that's...a lot.

Got the pager and waited a few...then got the food. 

First impressions: looks good. Kinda on the small side burger wise. I little smaller than In-N-Out but bigger patties. Gf has one tomato and one piece of lettuce, mine has a good amount of bacon and peppers. Nice crinkle fries and good looking concrete. Thought a single scoop is pretty small for the price. Chicago dog was Nathan's small but looked the part without the nuclear green relish.

Taste: bacon was good and peppers had little bite. No lettuce or tomato for this...Kinda disappointed. Tasted good but not OMG best thing ever! Bread was like a mix of brioche and hawaiian and was split but not all the way so ended up like a pocket thing. Gf's was good but ordinary. Shack sauce was kinda lacking. Nothing special. The dog was good. Split and grilled. Good condiments but no casing so no ""snap"". The fries are great. Crinkle kept the crunch. Although...for a burger place that tries to exemplify organic and no GMO ""specialty"" burger place, I would have expected real potatoes...not some Sysco or Ore-Ida frozen potatoes for fries. The concrete was good. I liked that. The waffle pieces were crunchy and tasty. The strawberry was good and the ice cream was good. Note I say ice cream...not custard as they advertise. I've had frozen custard...and it had a certain consistency and smoothness and taste...totally different than froyo and ice cream..but this...this was ice cream.

Final thoughts: I'd come here for dessert. I think the burgers are WAY overpriced. $9 for a small double cheese burger is not worth it. You could get gourmet gastro pub type burgers (huge 1\/2 or 1\/3lb with all kinds of oddball toppings) for that price. They offer no ""combos"" to help out the pricing. Taste was mediocre. And comparing to major competitors, In-N-Out to me has more flavor, but if not even that...give more veggies and for $9 you can have 3 patties, real hand cut fries, and a drink. 5 guys has many toppings, homestyle taste, fresh cut fries, and a drink as well for around the same price.

I know most people would complain about the price. $5-9 for a burger? Why not? It's antibiotic and hormone-free Angus beef. They use quality ingredients. I personally don't care paying more for better quality ingredients. 

The process is simple. Fall in line. Decide what you want so, when you get to the front of the line, you're not THAT person holding up the line. Place your order. Pay. Get your vibrator. Find a table - sometimes you have to share a table and that is normal so, learn to share and be social. Pick up your food when you feel your vibrator go off. Enjoy.

My favorite burger is the Shake Stack which has a beef patty, lettuce, crisp-fried portobello mushroom, melted muenster cheese and ShackSauce...I have to get mine without tomatoes.

The bun is like a marshmallow.....perfect texture, compliments there beef patty perfectly. Basic toppings such as lettuce and tomato but always tastes so fresh. You can also order beer or wine which is a big plus in my book. The milk shakes are top notch too....i want to try their version of a Chicago hot dog as I love Chicago hot dogs but Chicago themselves don't even sell them for almost $5!

I assumed my first encounter with the venerable New York institution would be in New York itself, but I was happy to settle with Las Vegas (in, naturally, the New York New York casino).

It took a mere glance at the menu to decide that I wanted a double ShackBurger (cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce). I'll admit that the burger was much, much better than I expected. It arrived looking pretty much like a picture-perfect burger and the first bite certainly did not disappoint.

Pretty much my favorite thing in terms of a hamburger is that crust that forms on the griddle, and boy, did this burger have one hell of a crust. The meat itself could've been juicier, no doubt, but the combination of the irresistibly crusty patties and the perfectly proportioned condiments made this one of the best hamburgers I've eaten in a while.

We also ordered a side of the Crinkle Cut Fries, and they were fresh and delicious.",0,0,0

ANYWAYS, the ""shack stack"" is a regular burger with a patty, lettuce, tomato, cheese and the buns, but what makes it a ""shack stack"" is that it comes with a mushroom. Not just any mushroom though, a mushroom stuffed with cheese and breaded with panko all over. This burger is about $10. If I were to get just a mushroom burger or a regular burger, it would be about five or six dollars. I technically paid an extra five or six dollars for the mushroom.

It would have been fine with me if it tasted amazing, but it did not tickle my taste buds the way I hoped. First off, the mushroom was salty. I usually don't think many things are salty, but this, I could tell it was salty. The rest of the burger was good; the meat and the rest of the veggies. The bun was interesting though. It was sweet unlike most places.

Shack Stack - combination with the ShackBurger and Shroom burger. This is the burger to get! Perfect combination of a beef patty and fried cheese stuffed mushroom together in a burger. The buns are also super soft. It's the one highlight I always remember back when I was in NY.

I got the ShackMeister dog and my husband got the Shack-ago dog.  We split a small order of fries and I got a peanut butter shake.  I was on vacation, what can I say?

Sat down in a terribly uncomfortable booth.  It was wooden and my belt kept getting caught on the back of the booth so I was getting irked.

We came here because my friends have never tried it before. The place already had a line outside by 11:10 AM when it opened at 11 AM. The menu isn't anything out of the ordinary - burgers, fries, shakes, etc. My usual Shake Shack order consists of a Shack Burger (single patty) and cheese fries. What I really like about the Shack Burger is their bun! It's slightly sweet and unbelievably soft. The burger is simple - lettuce, tomato, patty, and their famous Shack sauce which reminds me of the spread from In N Out. The downside to this burger is that it's pretty small and much more $$$ compared to In N Out's. This burger isn't anything mind blowing.  

The fries are crinkle cut fries which aren't my favorite to begin with. There is a pile of melted cheese on top which is good at first but can get tiring towards the end. It's a lot of cheese even for me and I love cheese lol. I definitely have to share this with someone because it is a lot of cheese flavor.

The menu is right in front of you so you can look at it and decide all you want while you're waiting in line up once you're at the counter, the menu board is way behind you so you'll have to know your orders off the top of your head. 

As much as I loved Shake Shack on my first experience, I forgot how pricey this place could get. I got a full meal of cheese fries, shack stack burger and chocolate cookies and cream shake which cost me over 20USD; compared to In-N-Out lovers, this place is definitely a lot pricier. 

With the long line means that the wait time is equally as long for your food and overall, I was actually pretty disappointed on this second experience. 

The shack stack burger has a deep fried mushroom and on my first experience came with a ""caution-hot"" sticker since the mushroom will ooze out with juices when you bite into it but the disappointing thing about this one was that firstly, I didn't get a sticker and most importantly, the mushroom was not pipping hot! 

The cheese fries were too salty for my liking and perhaps I'd suggest getting just the fries itself as the cheese cools down and hardens quite quickly. 

So unfortunately the they didn't have the mint cookies and cream shake I tried last time since it was a seasonal thing so I tried another seasonal special which was the chocolate cookies and cream. I'm generally not a fan of chocolate ice cream but I'd say this was the best part of the meal and definitely a very good way to beat the Vegas heat!

Guess I'll have to come back here again cause...third time's the charm right?",0,0,0

As many has written, it's impossible not to compare the two. FINALLY after almost 4 hours of driving from LA, we had reached our first and holy destination that is SHAKE SHACK. There were people, but the line was super short, at most only had 2 people head of us. Yay for us!

FOOD:
Ordered a regular protein hamburger (still charged as a regular hamburger at $4.16+ tax is about $4.50) already double of what an In-N-Out Double Meat Protein burger costs. Opted out of double patty at Shake Shack since that was $7.00. Portion and presentation were super lackluster, BUT they hella sold me when I took that first bite. GOOD LAWD. Literally felt like someone punched me in the face with bag full of godly flavors. I had to look around to see if my tongue was trippin' on me. The size might've been small, but fawwwk that is some deliciously cooked patty. But sadly the flavor itself couldn't save the fact that I was still starving afterwards.

Shake Shack is definitely good, but for the price- doesn't feel like good value for what I'm paying for. But still cheap eats in Vegas if you're on a budget.",8,6,6

I ordered a Shack Burger with Shack Sauce on the side in fear of the burger being overwhelmed. The sauce was actually very delicious and had a nice creamy consistency. The sauce complemented the burger well. I also ordered French fries which were nice and crispy but a little on the salty side. My mom got the cheese fries which were decent but not amazing. The burger itself looks pretty small and I finished it rather quickly however with the fries, the meal left me very stuffed which was relieved by a walk on the Strip. Overall, I would return however I won't be running back just to eat the Shackburger. Next time, I hope to try the frozen custard which looked very promising.",0,0,0

Our first time here last year, the line was out the door.  It moved fairly quickly, but the wait for the food was a different story.  Not that it took too long, but that there wasn't a single place to sit while we waited.  We pretty much stalked a few people and jumped on their table as they left.  We each got a Shackburger (cheeseburger) and shared an order of fries with some cheese sauce.  The kiddo got a shake, and I really appreciated that it wasn't a huge, monstrous serving.  It was just enough shake, since it was super duper sweet.  The burgers themselves were super tasty.  I loved the simplicity.  But it was way too small.  I could've easily had another one.  The meat was flavorful, the cheese melted to perfection, the bun, and little soft.  Done in just a few bites.  

Fast forward to the next trip here, and the line was again out the door, but not nearly as long.  The line moved super quick again.  This time, I had the SmokeShack which was a bacon cheeseburger topped with cherry peppers.  Man, this was it! The single was plenty.  Those cherry peppers added just the right amount of heat, and the bacon...yup, perfection.  We also had the chicken sandwich, and that too was delicious.  It's all about the pickle on this sammie.  As usual, we got it with the cheddar fries and were not disappointed.  Plenty of seating this time around.  

If you're staying at NYNY, having this place so close would be deadly.  We've eaten at the Times Square location as well, and this location serves the exact same food.  Good to know it's consistent,  no matter what location you go to.",1,0,0

Pretty good burger. I got the smoke shack. Overall tasty and nice kick with the peppers but wish the patty was more seasoned. For the cost, I prefer In n Out.

The cheese fries were pretty good. Nice change with the crinkle fries and not greasy or soggy, but they use the pre-melted cheese. Might be better if it was real cheese.

Got the cranberry lemonade and it was really good BUT the cup was so small.

The hugest negative was how crowded it was. So difficult to get a table. Pretty much have to prey upon people as they finish their food to guarantee you can get a seat inside. Sitting outside wouldn't be bad during the warmer days but I came during the winter so an inside seat was a must.

I was wondering why people were comparing to in-n-out or possibly smash burger. After hearing so many people trying it, finally had the chance to go last night during my friend's break while she was at work. 

This place sits on the NE corner of the NYNY casino on the outside with a HUGE bright sign. The location is pretty nice (despite the construction for the new arena). Almost hard to miss. Lots of seating inside and outside (though still not enough because its a strip location AND it was during dinner time). Upon ascending up a few steps of stairs and into the restaurant, a HUGE menu graces you upon entry showing their entire menu of food, sides, shakes, drinks, wine, champagne, and beer ! (though their ""drinks"" takes up more than 1\/2 the menu Lol) 

Upon previously reviewing the menu during work and other times of boredom, i had decided to get the Shack Stack which consisted of their shack burger + mushroom burger. Standard Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce. Just because it was my first time, i decided to go all out with an order of cheese fries and a strawberry shake. 

My friend had ordered before i did and gotten his food first. He had ordered the SmokeShack which was a Single Cheeseburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and ShackSauce. Lets just say it looked a bit sad ... small... he commented ""at least the bun is soft"" then the ol jokes start flying XD 

When i had received my order, it looked much better, due to the help of the humongous fried portabello mushroom in the middle. Is it worth almost double the price compared to the normal burger? possibly. is it worth it by itself with comparison? maybe not. The burger overall, a little unsatisfying. Bun is indeed soft and delicious, but most surprising part is the fried portabello mushroom.... was it was stuffed with cheese o.O ! (so much for the previously mentioned ""research"" huh? lol...) The mushroom is filled with a melted muenster and cheddar cheese. Not overpowering but still flavorful and stringy cheese XD.  

Strawberry shake - nice and flavorful. tick but not too thick. able to drink with straw. Pretty good shake. Kind of small though for the price. Like a small cup size you'd get from any other joint. 

Cheese fries - depressing. Lol..... Crinkle cut fries covered with a cheese sauce that reminds me of nacho cheese. Menu says its super addicting.... not so much :( was hoping for something more amazing T_T sad face 

This meal costed $20 and some change. Holy crap. Prior to visit, i was expecting the burger to be bigger, or rather everything else to be slightly bigger and better. For $20, not worth it :( At least i can say i tried it? The shakes are good, and if i were to come again, id go for a shake and maybe try a hot dog (altho sams club hot dog for $1.50 is so much more appealing LOL)",4,1,1

First of all, as other reviewers note, the line can be intimidating.  However, for Mlife Platinum cardholders (not sure if gold is on the sign as well), there is a special line that allows you to bypass the regular line.  Of course, you will get dirty looks from those in the regular line and you may have to explain that you aren't ""cutting."" What I didnt expect was being rudely approached by a staffmember who immediately said ""this is NOT a line""...oh really, then why does it say Mlife platinum?

I ordered the Shack Stack burger: Cheeseburger with a fried portobello mushroom & muenster cheese. It supposedly came with the shacksauce but I couldn't taste it at all. The mushroom had a VERY weird taste to it. I love mushrooms. I don't understand why the flavor was so weird. I didn't enjoy eating this burger at all. I can make better burgers at home myself. I hated the flavor so much I needed ranch with it but they didn't even have ranch -__-  
I also got a beer float. Which was chocolate beer and vanilla custard. It tasted like root beer... Still confused if they served me the root beer instead of real beer. I did not enjoy it either.

My boyfriend ordered a Smoke Shack: Cheeseburger with applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and shacksauce. The flavor on this burger was better than mine. It was very heavy on the peppers though. Still, didn't get to really taste that shacksauce because there wasn't a lot and the peppers over powered everything. 

We shared the Cheese fries: nothing special either. Crinkle cut fries that taste like they came out of those frozen bags from the store. There was no seasoning at all. The cheese didn't even taste good. Seems like they got generic canned cheese and threw it on top.

So, I don't understand the hype about this place. The meat on the burgers aren't even good quality. Very thin and not great in flavor either. Tasted to me like the patties from McDonalds' cheeseburgers.",1,1,1

I thought it was pretty good; the gooey-ness of the cheese was really good in the burger and the mushroom had a nice unique taste. The fries were... meh. I've never been a fan of crinkle cut fries and they weren't the crispiest either.

I saw they had a mushroom burger and gluten-free bun. I was excited but as soon as I asked about how it's cooked as I have food allergies, I knew I was in for a bad experience.  She acted like it was a big hassle to answer my questions.  I told her my allergies she rolled her eyes and asked 'what do you eat' in a very condescending tone. At this point I said never mind and I'd just get the fries but she weirdly tried to sell me on the chicken burger (um the opposite of veg\/wheat-free).

Seriously though Shake Shack was one of my mandatory eats whenever I visited NYC and to have it only a mere 4 hours away from socal instead of a 5 hour plane flight away is AWESOME. I may have jumped up and down with pure glee as I found out they opened at the NY NY in Las Vegas.

Needless to say the flavor and service here is on par with the ones I had in NYC. I ordered my usual shroom burger and cheese fries and was salivating.  The shroom burger is absolutely delicious and full of flavor.  I prefer it over their cheeseburger, but their cheeseburger is also a great option. Their crinkle cut cheese fries were on point with the ones I had in NYC.

For the reviewers that are comparing it to In-N-Out, just don't. For one Shake Shack has a higher price point and is a bit more fancier than In-N-Out, which is a more fast food\/grab and go.  Although you can get Shake Shack to go, most people eat it at the restaurant. Shake Shack also serves alcoholic beverages and has a bigger selection in its menu plus a weekly custard flavor.  The only reason people would say Shake Shack is the east coast's version of In-N-Out is because it was exclusive to the east coast like how In-N-Out is exclusive to the west coast.  So if you're a first time visiter to Shake Shack try not to compare it to In-N-Out because it's a different experience. I like both of them equally.

Location is obviously in the New York New York Hotel and Casino.  You can see it from Las Vegas Blvd since there is a huge sign for it and definitely reminds me of their NYC locations.  There is ample seating inside and outside the restaurant.  Service is quick, but the quality is still there.

With a recent successful IPO this New York based brand has never been more hyped. Some say its the Tesla of the burgers and the beginning of something huge. 

But if you look at their performance so far, they havent been able to geographically grow that fast. But who says they have to hurry?

The fact is that they now enter the sacred land of In N Out, when opening their first joint at the Vegas Strip. And its only the first of several to come, planning to open another in Los Angeles 2016.

The ppl here love In N Out, so the question is if they will abandon it for their new step brother? My predictions are not, but Shake Shack can still be a good burger joint.

When entering this venue you got two options, either a regular line or a C-line, where the C probably stands for Cold and is a faster option for shakes and stuff. The menu gives you quite a few options, and if you have never been, you will probably spend a couple of minutes observing it before deciding. I came here around 2 pm and there were no line to talk about, which i was a pleasant surprise.

Ordered a double shack burger, fries, milkshake and got a buzzer to let me know when it was ready. I really like the convenience with having a buzzer...what i dislike was to pay more than $17 bucks for this!

Burger was really good and it felt like a burger with a lot of love, fries too was over my expectations since i usually dont like the thicker ones. And venue itself was very nicely decorated and gave a clean touch to the meal.

In the end its insistently to compare the two brothers who for the first time stand side-by-side infront of their hungry crowd. But i cant see Shake Shack conquer In N Out in years, until they have wider spread of their venues. But even then, its hard to become a massive burger chain if you dont adjust the pricing. And comparing today its the double for Shake Shack.

I saw tons of Shake Shacks in Washington DC when I went some few summers ago but never got the chance to try out their food! I go to Vegas often and was thrilled to see that they finally opened one right on The Strip! It's located right outside of New York New York by the bridge. You can either order inside or outside the restaurant. Outside would probably be quicker if you're not looking to actually sit down and properly dine somewhere cool. My party and I decided to eat inside since it was summer in Vegas.... AKA 100 degrees and up. 

There is a large menu plastered up front right when you walk in the restaurant. You then wait in line for your turn to order at the front also. Then they give you a buzzer so you can go retrieve your tray of food when it's ready. The line was long when I went but it moved by quickly! Although it was crazy busy, the cashier who helped me was fun & patient, but was also efficient! You can get water and condiments on the side by the registers. You have to find your own table! They have lounge areas near the back of the restaurant and also regular tables. 

I got the single shack burger which is just a regular cheeseburger with lettuce and tomatoes. It was delicious! They have their very own sauce that makes the burger taste kind of buttery, but not too overwhelming with butter. The cheese fries are to die for. Their cheese sauce is really perfection!!! Usually when I order cheese fries from other places, the cheese gets tiring and hardens up quickly, but with Shake Shack's cheese sauce..... Holy moly I'm craving it. Their crinkle cut fries were also really good, with or without cheese! I also got the black and white shake- it was so so. It tasted more like a chocolate shake to me; I'm not really into any type of chocolate dessert by itself so I didn't really like it.

Service: Sorry, but In N' Out wins for service. When we arrived at Shake Shack there was a very long line, which wasn't a problem because it gave us time to discuss the menu (prominently displayed on a large wall right when you walk in). The line moved fast and soon enough it was our turn; however, the woman who took our order was ornery and short with us. B-

Decor: I LOVED the ambience and decor in Shake Shack. We snagged a spot on the large bar table in the center of the restaurant (shared by up to fifteen diners) and had a great view over the open kitchen and large flat screen TVs. I noticed couches, tables, and benches all throughout Shake Shack. A+

Food: We waited about 8-10 minutes for our food (as expected, given the large amount of people). It was well worth the wait! The burger patties were absolutely DIVINE. If you are looking for fresh and juicy, order the Shack Burger. I can't say enough good things about the patties. The only problem I had was that I asked for a lettuce-wrapped burger, and instead I got a patty on top of a slice of lettuce (making for quite a messy meal). In N' Out wins for food presentation and sauce but as much as it pains me to say it, Shake Shack has the better patty. A+

1. Delicious burger! I ordered the Shack Burger ($5+)
2. Restaurant was clean and very cool ambiance.
3. Menu was all over the restaurant so that was helpful.
4. Fries were crispy and well-seasoned ($3+)
5. Fast service.

Cons:
1. Pricey burger
2. Had to order fries and drink separate.
3. Buns were too greasy.
4. Order taker messed up our order only got 1 order of fries instead of 2. Newly opened restaurant should try to avoid any mistakes.

We stayed at the hotel that hosted this & we caught this meal before the game.
It was busy but also very quick to get attended.
These burgers were deliciously made. They help together each topping very wellZ
The bread was soft and seemed like it was just made. The sauce wasn't too overwhelming it was a mayo\/thousand island like feel\/taste.
The fries were the best, crinkled, well done with a crunch on the outside & soft mashed potatoes on the inside.
They complimented the burgers well.
Their prices are super good for what it is as well which made my wallet super happy.
The overall feel is like Unami, casual but sleek.

How can any burger joint rival with California's MIGHTY In-N-Out?!?!?! Just how?!?! That's impossible, I thought. 

But HOLY CRAP, after the first bite into my Shake Shack's burger, I got confused and I felt like I CHEATED on my beloved In-N-Out because I must confess that I like my meat to show a  little pink. 

Unlike In-N-Out, Shake Shack's patties are a little pinkish and a little rare and that makes the patty taste juicer and therefore more delicious tasting! 

The only downside to the Shake Shack burger is the price, it definitely cost more than In-N-Out but I'll pay more for better quality meat.

So far, I've tried their Shake Burger with double meat, Smoke Shack Burger with double meat, Shake-cago Dog and their crinkle cheese fries and I love their burgers the best! The pink meat in the burger makes a HUGE difference! The fries complimented the burgers really well.

Connie Francis vs. Lesley Gore. Only one side can ever be chosen among these eternal rivals--you can like and respect both, maybe even listen to or agree with the other. But you know you've chosen a side from birth, and you will forever be linked in fraternity with your chosen grouping. Thus, on my recent visit to Vegas I was thrust into the most important debate of our times: Shake Shack vs. In-N-Out.

Living in Hawaii, I do not have the luxury to regularly patronize the establishments of In-N-Out or Shake Shack. When I would visit California or Vegas in years past, it became a family tradition that the first (or one of the first) places we would eat is In-N-Out. This is due to our mutual love of their fresh vegetables and toasty buns. But when I learned we would have the opportunity to try the Empire State's favorite franchise, well, I started spreading the news to all comers and goers.

Now, unfortunately for Shake Shack there were a few intangibles that colored our experience here. One: It was about 1am having just strolled on down from the T-Mobile Arena and the #iHeartFestival and we were tired and bodies aching. Two: We were both (me at the time especially), sick with really bad throat and head colds. Three: It's dry as hell in the desert for Hawaii kids used to being moisturized by our fragrant air. So take this all with a grain of gray salt.

Being my first time, I was in full-on EYES greater than STOMACH mode and ordered The Stack Shack (a damn fried cheesy mushroom!), Shackburger with onions (to compare with In-N-Out), Chicken Stack (because we fell for its photogenic tuchus), Cheese Fries, Regular Fries, Lemonade, a 32oz Shacktoberfest beer (because I'm a sucker for a souvenir mug), a Jackpot concrete and a beer float. WHOA ALEX, did you win big at the Blackjack table? That's what my credit card asked me at any rate.

The verdict? Well, The Stack Shack is delicious. I mean, you make a mushroom patty filled with cheese, you're going to get at least my mouth's attention with that. In the head-to-head, the patty is thicker for Shake Shack, but I didn't necessarily get that out-of-body nirvana I got the first time I tried In-N-Out as a young, impressionable collegiate man. That could've been the drugs, but I'm pretty sure it was the burger. I'm sorry Chicken Stack--I don't usually prefer chicken to beef and in this case I still don't. It was okay, but nothing special. Fries were good, but I still give the nod to In-N-Out's shoestring fries. The Jackpot was damn delicious, though. It's too bad by that point we were so full, Shacksauce was leaking out of my left nostril. 

The atmosphere is very nice at this location. We chose to sat outside and it was nice to quietly eat amongst the din of Strip rabblerousers under the romantic glow of neon signs. 

Overall, Shake Shack is definitely delicious and I feel like I know what to order the next time around (definitely get a Stack Shack and a concrete). Is it better than In-N-Out? I'm not sure I can make that decision at this point in time, but I will defer that opinion to my wallet: ""In-N-Out! In-N-Out!",1,0,0

The shakes. I ordered the peanut butter shake which was so creamy and fragrant it was like having peanut butter right out of the jar but smoother and not as sweet. Definitely one of the better milkshakes I've had.

People compare every damn burger joint to In-N-Out and it's a bunch of crap! Stop! I am an In-N-Out fiend and probably have it four to five times a month, but comparing a place like Shake Shack to In-N-Out is not a fair comparison because they're two different style restaurants. If you want a closer comparison, compare it to Five Guys. 

I stopped by here in my way back to Calofornia from Zion National Park. You can see it while driving down the strip. The line was out is the door but seeing as there are no locations around Southern California that I'm aware of, I figured this might be my only chance to try Shake Shack for a while, as I didn't know when the next time I'd be in Vegas would be. 

The line was long but it moved pretty quick. Their menu was very comprehensive and they serve all sorts of great food and drink items. They even offer dog biscuits. When I got to the front of the line, the cashier was very friendly. 

My food came shortly after. Presentation was very nice. I ordered a Shack Burger and a creamsicle float.

The bun on my burger was spongy and delicious. The meat had GREAT texture and flavor. Cheese was gooey. The burger was fantastic. 

The float was equally good. Perfect for the hot weather. The fries that I tried were really crispy and well executed. 

What I didn't like were the prices. Even though they have a huge selection, serve beer and wine, etc., the prices are too high in my opinion. Just my two things cost over $11. If I had ordered my own fries it would have been around $15 if I can recall. If you order a beer or wine, your bill could very easily top $20. I thought it was the Vegas treatment but I've been told that that's how it is at all Shake Shacks.

So the food is excellent but the prices are high. I would definitely come back and eat here again, just sparingly. Luckily I don't go to Vegas that often.",1,0,0

There were only about five other groups ahead of me, which gave me just enough time to figure out what I wanted to order. All four or so cash registers open so the line moved reasonably fast.

Shake Shack offers eight milkshake flavors, including a weekly flavor. For the last week of March\/first week of April 2015, the flavor of the week was malted marshmallow. Overall, I ended up ordering one single ShakeBurger (their original cheeseburger with one beef patty; $5.19), one double ShakeBurger ($7.99), two double SmokeShacks (cheeseburger with two beef patties, bacon, sweet peppers, and no lettuce or tomato; $9.49 each), two cheese fries($3.95 each), and a black and white shake (vanilla with chocolate fudge; $5.25).

It took about 10 minutes for our buzzer to go off so that we can grab our food at the pick-up counter. The burgers were seasoned and flavorful, though I wish the buns were more toasted like In-N-Out's. Shake Shack's menu states that all their burgers are cooked medium unless you order otherwise. I like my burgers cooked medium, but all our patties were cooked well done. That's particularly too bad considering that a place that advertises themselves with default medium-cooked burgers overcooked each patty. I tried both the double ShakeBurger and double SmokeShack burger. I like a little heat in my food so I enjoyed the sweet peppers in the SmokeShack burger. Other than that, the ShakeBurger was better because the lettuce and tomatoes made the burger more well balanced. By the way, if you're a fan of onions, Shake Shack's burgers don't include onions... Lucky for you, onion haters!

I love cheesy fries so the crinkle cut cheese fries option is great. The cheese fries tastes just as you think they would - previously frozen crinkle cut fries with artificial cheese sauce. Good, but nothing super special about it other than it's not an item you typically see on west coast menus. As for the milkshake, the black and white shake was runnier and not as thick as I like.

Good burgers and cheese fries, but In-N-Out's burgers has Shake Shack beat in taste and price. I'm glad I had a chance to try Shake Shack without a long line and having to fly to New York. Would I wait here again if the wait was over 45 minutes long? Ehhhhhhh....",0,0,0

You wait in line and order, then you wait in line to pick it up.  Everything considered I'd give them three stars because although the prices were crazy cheap the burger was just ok and as far as chains go I'm not huge on the smashed flat burger patties (except for In n Out).",3,1,4

The meat is certainly better (juicier), but I think the overall pacakge of in-n-out is better in terms of bread, ingredients, and sauce (not to mention price).

We can now add onto that list: In N Out versus Shake Shack.  And like the other comparisons, there is no real winner.  It all really depends on your mood.

Shake Shack is great because the burgers are cooked by smashing the patty onto a griddle and letting it develop a nice charred crust. The meat is the star of the burger.  The toppings are average.  The bun itself is soft, but it could really use some ""extra toast"" (borrowing from In N Out terminology).  The standout item, and one I am sure everyone knows about, is the ""Shake Stack"".   It is a tremendous construction of a breaded cheesy mushroom patty stacked on top of a regular meat patty.  If you really want to go for gang busters, add bacon for a nominal fee (side note: I really don't give a damn if the WHO thinks processed meats causes cancer). The cheese fries make for a worthy companion.

I would be remiss if I did not toss in my two cents regarding ""who wins"" in a comparison between my beloved In N Out and Shake Shack.  The Shack wins for the superior meat patty, the option to add bacon, and for that glorious mushroom patty.  In N Out has better quality  ingredients and customization options (e.g. toasted buns, grilled onions, chopped peppers).  Taking in the whole experience of eating an In N Out burger, it really is greater than the sum of its parts.  Where it may be lacking to Shake Shack, In n Out's je ne sais quoi keeps it on equal footing.

So where does that leave you?  In N Out? Shake Shack?  Bro, have you not been reading my completely unnecessarily long review?  

West Coasters: Order the Shake Stack with bacon.  Add cheese fries.  Maybe a custard if you have the space.  There is beer if you want it, too.

East Coasters: Order the double double (animal style if you are some monster) with extra toast and chopped peppers.  Animal style fries. Neapolitan shake or root beer float for dessert.

Or, if you are feeling up for it, get both.  Gotta love Vegas.",4,4,5

SmokeShack Burger - cheeseburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and shacksauce. The burger was as good as I remember with a little kick. 

Cheese Fries - crinkle cut fries topped with a special blend of cheddar and american cheese sauce. While I thought the fries were good, I would prefer to just get the regular fries next time.

I also tried the peach lemonade and it was so refreshing on a hot day!

I tried the Shack Burger, Cheese Fries, and Chocolate Shake. Everything was really good. I'll start with the burger. Meat quality I think is better than In-N-Out, but it lacks sauce (unlike that infamous spread at In-N-Out). I actually added some mustard to bring out some of that meat flavor. Moving onto the cheese fries. Yes, very good especially with that cheese drizzled on top. Can't go wrong, especially if you like the crinkle-style fries. Having said that, the In-N-Out fries are thinner and you can taste the freshness. Again, hard to compare? The shakes at Shake Shack definitely beats the shakes at In-N-Out. First of all, you can actually drink the shakes from the get-go versus having to wait  for some defrost action with the shakes at In-N-Out. My chocolate shake was not overly sweet and cold enough to make a decadent dessert drink. All in all, solid All American burger shop right on the LV strip.

It was small, and VERY greasy (I had to tear pieces of the bun off because they were soaked in grease), the meat had no flavor at all (hear of salt?).  The meat was slightly pink, and it just seemed under cooked.  My husband had the chicken sandwich.  It looked good, so I asked for one bite.  It was even greasier than my burger, and it tasted like burnt grease.  To top it all off, I was looking forward to a chocolate shake, but the shake machine was down.

First of all, everything on the menu is a-la-carte, there are no combo meals.  I had the standard ShackBurger ($5.19), Fries ($2.95) and an Iced Tea ($2.75), total cost w\/tax: $11.77.  Pricey for a burger & fries, but it is a strip eatery, so you figure the prices are a bit inflated.

I've noticed that people compare this place to In-n-Out Burger quite a bit.  Well, the burgers are cooked when the order is placed, and they do come wrapped in paper like In-n-Out, but that's where the similarity ends.  My burger was pretty ho-hum, nothing to rave about.  The fries were good, crinkle-cut style, and nice & hot. I did not try one of their shakes, however there was nothing about the food that I did have that would make me come back again.

Considering how popular they are in the eastern half of the US it has generated a lot of buzz; it's been on my Vegas bucket list ever since the opening was announced. A year later I got the opportunity to go as my sister had a Shake Shack craving.

CONCEPT: Fast-casual burger chain with burgers priced between $5 and $10, along the lines of a Five Guys or Smashburger with the cult appeal approaching that of In-N-Out Burger. According to Shake Shack's official website, the burgers are made with the following ingredients:
- 100% natural all-Angus beef sourced with cows not fed with hormones or antibiotics. The meat is freshly ground.
- Fresh veggies - choose from a combo of lettuce, tomato, pickles or onions.
- The bun is a non-GMO Martin's Potato Roll.

The fries are of the frozen crinkle-cut Yukon kind and the shakes are made from freshly spun frozen custard. 

VENUE: Located *outside* the casino formerly the site of ESPN zone.

SERVICE: Counter service only. When my family went on New Years Day lunchtime we were in line for less than 5 minutes. This was considering that the line was outside. There was a slightly longer wait for our food to be ready. 

Your meal is ready when your buzzer rings.

My first Shake Shack meal consisted of a Shack Stack burger (Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce) and their crinkle-cut fries. I sipped a little bit of my sister's shake as I wasn't in the mood for a shake at the time.
- My sister says that it's an East Coast thing for softer buns (dunno if this is true). I appreciated the softer, sweeter bun and it's comparable to a perfectly toasted In-N-Out bun.
- Veggies were fresh.
- The portobello mushroom was freshly fried and I could hear the pop of the mushroom meat opening. The melted muenster cheese just made the mushroom burger just taste meatier.
- Burger patty was cooked to my liking. Cheeses made the burger slightly moist.

Crinkle fries were cooked consistently so all fries were crispy but they were a little on the plain side. The shake was also a little on the plain side but this was due to my sister's preference. Next time I'll get a different flavor shake and have it malted.

Though the prices reflect the Vegas standard (read: expensive!) the burger quality is worth a return visit. Though my preference still is a good In-N-Out burger more I can appreciate this burger for what it is and I understand why the East Coasters are up in arms about this chain. It certainly beats White Castle and Five Guys.",17,9,14

I've tried Shake Shack at Grand Central Station in NYC and I'm glad one opened up here in Las Vegas.  

These burgers are not ""extravagant"" by any means but they are delicious.  I have tried a few including one on their secret menu.  

Starting with the best in my opinion:

Smoke Shack:  A Bacon Cheeseburger with shack sauce [I think it's like mayo\/ketchup\/mustard\/pickle (?)] topped with chopped cherry peppers which give it just an amazing flavor and some heat.

I've also tried their Shack Stack which is one cheese burger and one Shroom Burger between two buns.  The shroom burger is crisp-fried portabello mushroom filled with gooey muenster and cheddar cheese.  

Finally, on the secret menu, I've tried the peanut butter and bacon burger.  I've never considered the combination before but apparently it's a thing.  They serve the peanut butter in a side cup here in Vegas to prevent cross contamination they say but I think it's pretty fun that way.  My daughter liked it more than I did.  Dipping your burger in peanut butter sauce was cool to her.

Shake shack also offers a variety of deserts, shakes, hot-dogs, and crinkle cut cheese fries!!   Yummy yummy cheese fries.  No need to say more. =)",0,0,0

It's almost like they feel like they have to convince themselves that they love this place so that it makes up for leaving all our amazing weather.

This location is outside the New York, New York in Vegas, facing the Strip. (I.e. don't walk inside the hotel, or you'll be lost trying to find it, because it's actually outside.) I can see this place resonating with people who don't have an appreciation for value, or people who want to tell other people that something they've haven't been able to try is awesome. In my experience, it's a really tiny burger with a big price tag and decent flavor.

I'm not a big eater by any stretch of the imagination, but I think that burger took me 6-7 bites to consume. That plus a drink was $10. I had finished my food before my roommate (who was in line behind me, and ordered the exact same thing) had even gotten his order. While the burger WAS decently tasty, it wasn't THAT much tastier than say, Carl's, where this meal would cost $7, and it would come with fries.

I didn't have room for a shake because I'd gotten a shake earlier in the day, and they were out of the signature flavor for the day. I'm not a big fan of crinkle-cut fries, and this place did nothing to change my mind. The ones drenched in cheese were even worse, as the cheese sauce adds very little in flavor.

I tried just a regular shack burger with the mint cookies & cream shake.  The burger was pretty good; I am all about the brioche bun, and minimal toppings.  The only downside is that there was (American) cheese (hello, why wasn't it called a shack cheeseburger?!), of which I am not a fan, so I ended up having to scrape it off and that took a fraction of a point off my rating.  The shake was thick and lots of flavour - sooo good! But I could even only drink half of it.  (I really gotta stop eating late).

Parking alone is a 10-15 minute walk from either New York-New York or Monte Carlo, only to find yourself lining up amongst a large crowd once arriving at the establishment.  At least the queue went by relatively fast so the wait didn't take too long despite of the line being quite lengthy.

Unlike other locations I've gone to, this spot has a C-Line which lets customers buying anything off the menu but food items bypass the regular line.  This serves as an excellent pit stop for frozen custards or even alcoholic beverages while strolling around the area.

Food was just as great as the meal I had in NYC or MIA: seasoned burger patty topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce between pillowy potato bun.  People usually compare the burger from this place to other joints such as In-N-Out and Five Guys, but I have to say, I prefer the ones from here than the latter.

I have heard for a couple months that they were opening up a Shake Shack in Las Vegas at New York New York.  To my surprise, it had opened and my fiancee and I happened to be in Vegas that week for New Year's.  We weren't sure where it was actually located in the hotel because we tried using the map kiosk at the hotel and it just wasn't working for us.  So we walked outside, because I saw on some pictures posted it had an outside storefront.  So we walked around the outside of hotel, we found it!  I'll save you the trouble of having to walk outside in either the cold or the heat... in the casino walk towards the Swatch store use that exit to go outside.  There is also a casino exit you can use also which is closer.

Apparently, the day were went was opening day!  When we arrived, I was expecting a line out the door.  I have been to the NYC location in Battery Park and we waited in line for 30 mins.  And with it being their opening day the line could have been hitting the street.  We didn't have to wait too long there were in line less than 10 mins before we were able to order.

We ordered a double Shackburger, ShackMeister Dog, Cheese Fries, and a Black and White Shake (chocolate and vanilla).  The whole thing cost over $20.  We were looking for a table to sit, luckily two women were leaving and offered their table.  They give you a buzzer to let you know your food is ready.

The look of everything look almost the same as I remembered from the original but it has been a while since I've had it.  The food had good flavor but was on the salty side for our taste.  Would I call the best burger on the West Coast?  That can be debatable.  

On value, I think In-n-Out is better based on what you get for the price.  If you're simple, the flavor maybe too salty for your taste.  I liked the fact there wasn't extra bun with no meat at the end, many time I get that when we eat burgers.  This is a good sign the portions of bun to patty is perfect.  The location is better than the one in Battery Park, reasons being there is inside sitting and you don't have to deal with the NYC pigeons trying to steal your food!

I would want to come here again to try their other burgers and other items on the menu.  This was their opening week so like many other eatery you have to work out some kinks to get it right at a new location.",2,1,1

It was totally packed and is an restaurant that everyone needs to go to at least once in their life, but I probably won't be making it a #1 priority in my life anytime soon. 

We got everything ""Shack"" on the menu. The burger, the fries, the chicken burger, the hot dog, and the custard treat to top it off. Here's a little ""mini"" review of each. 

Burger: Could've done without it. It was just a regular cheeseburger with lettuce and a tomato--I'm pretty sure I could've make a tastier one, and that's saying something because my PB&J's are still subpar... 

Chicken burger: This was a winner in my book! Get it. The chicken was juicy and had a perfect crispness to it. Not only that, but the PICKLES helped boost it to the next level. Seriously, this was the best choice of the night. 

Fancy Hot Dog: The ""Shack-ago Dog"" was fine too. It had a pickle spear, some very strong onions, and some gnarly peppers. I've never been a fan of hot dogs; however, if you are, you might like it. 

Fries: They were crinkle cut and I'm sure were very good when they initially came out of the fryer, but I think ours had sat for a hot minute before our buzzer called us to the window because they were slightly floppy. We got cheese fries with the cheese on the side, and that was a good decision seeing as those floppy fries would've been toast by the time we started eating! 

Custard: Pretty melted by the time our hot food met up with it on the tray, but the chocolate and brownie bites were delicious! 

The employees were quick and helpful, and the atmosphere was fun too. We did have to wait for about 1\/2 an hour, but that's normal considering we got enough food to feed an army. Again, it was a pleasant experience just not one I'd make time for again. 

TIPS & TRICKS: 
* If you dig the heat, there is seating outside with some nice ""misters"" to help cool you off! 
* Park in the New York New York garage, and if you can order and eat in under an hour, your parking is free!",4,1,2

Hubby also got crinkle cut fries along with a hot dog and apple juice for our daughter. I took a bite of my burger, and first thing that hits me is the flavor of the meat. So flavorful. Perfect size similar to in and out. The crinkle cut fries were crunchy and good. The mango lemonade is a little tart but good. There were lots of seating inside.

Cheeseburger was horribly over salted. Finished it because I was hungry, but I'm glad I got the root beer to help with that salt. I'll spend the extra money to get a burger at Holstein's any day.

After finishing the burger, got back in line for custard. I've heard so much about their custard that I had to try it. I missed out on trying it in NY when the line was over 50 deep.

First off, huge debacle for trying to order a ""Shack Attack"" with vanilla instead of chocolate custard. I've worked fast food before and it isn't hard to ring up a substitution. Except the guy at the register had no clue what he was doing and rung it up as a create your own that cost almost $2 more.. and he wouldn't budge from it. OK, fine. I cancel that and just order a small vanilla custard.

Worst vanilla custard I have ever had. Lack of flavor or creaminess. Thought I was eating milk ice cream. I'm familiar to good custard having been introduced to Kopps & Culver's in Milwaukee. Even BurgerFi has better custard.

I came for the custard and left horribly disappointed.

I also had a peanut-butter and banana shake which I wasn't a big fan of.  Let's get back to the food....it was amazing and everything lived up to the hype.  To make this experience even better, the service was outstanding.  Every person was attentive and they were extremely courteous.  I'm a resident of SoCal and love my In n' out, but Shake Shack is better in my opinion.  I will 100% be back when I'm in Vegas!!!",0,0,0

Ordered:

- Shack Stack ($9.59)
- Cheese Fries ($3.99)
- Shackburger ($5.29)
- 2 Coke Zeros ($2.80 each)


(+) Burgers were tasty, if a bit on the small side
(+) service was friendly and fairly efficient
(+) I actually really dig their crinkle cut fries, either plain or with cheese
(+) as with most places on the strip, great people watching and scenery ;)

(-) strip prices, so prepare to cough up the moolahs
(-) no refills on the sodas
(-) bathrooms have 1 urinal and 1 stall. Not nearly enough for a place that does this kind of volume

Overall, this place was alright. I honestly can't see myself going out of my way to come back. They were okay, but did not live up to all the hype IMO.

Being a gourmet burger chain & having a pretty big cult following, I had some pretty high expectations. My wife and I ordered a Shack Burger, Shack-cago Dog, 2 fries and a soda. The burger was cooked nicely, but the bun was soggy and cold. The size of the burger was smaller than most gourmet burgers I've eaten but still carried the high price tag. The hot dog tasted like an average hot dog but was butterflied, so it had a nice crisp every bite. The fries were hot but had no seasoning and simply tasted sub par to other burger chains.

Overall, my wife and I were not impressed with Shake Shack. The quality of the food in my opinion does not warrant the gourmet price tag.",1,0,0

Whether it be the cupcakes at Magnolia Cafe, the pastrami at Carnegie Deli (vs. the superior Jewish delis in L.A.), the Cronut or the frozen hot chocolate craze, I learn hard.

Here, the fries are not better than frozen Ore-Ida French fries sold in plastic bags at the market.  You know the variety: corrugated, large, tasteless.   The patty was of the caliber you get at a church luncheon.  Store bought, fatty.  Vegetables and bun also below par.

I'm so glad we decided to cancel our original lunch plans to stop in here. Best decision we made all day.

The was a bit of a lineup, but it moved quite quickly. After ordering, we're given a buzzer which was cool. A little more organized than calling out numbers. The location was kept very clean and modern inside. It wasn't too hard to find seats, as there is a lot of turn over here and guests are considerate to leave once done their meal.

We wanted to try the original, so we ordered the double, draft root beer and a strawberry shake. All GREAT! The burger was just so melt in your mouth delicious. It was a tad salty, but that didn't stop me from devouring this beast.

The shake was sooo friggen good. I would go back just for a shake, but it would be hard to resist a burger. The root beer was only alright, I'm not sure I would order it again.

When I looked at the menu, it was similar to that of new york. The average price of a burger is 6-10$. The shakes are around 5$. When I had arrived, I was expecting some what of a line but I seriously just walked right on up to the register and ordered our burgers. Some of the burgers have a shack sauce that reminded me of in n out, but this sauce is much saltier than I remember. Nothing beats the in n out secret sauce  

Overall, the burgers we got basically tasted like something  that I could have concocted at home. Just cook some meat, fry some bacon, melt some cheese and voila! You have a shake shack burger. The sauce was salty and I felt it had overpowered the taste of my burger. I had to drink two cups of Dr pepper to help with it. The krinkle fries were good tho! You can't mess up potatoes!

After hearing about Shake Shack opening up in Vegas, I practically begged my cousins to eat here for an early dinner just to see what the fuss is all about.

Shake Shack follows an order-and-pickup routine. In other words, brace yourself for long lines! This new addition to the Strip will certainly draw in some crowds (both locals and tourists) during peak season. During my visit, the line went pretty fast, as it wasn't terribly long. However, by the time we left, the line was already heading out the door.

I ordered the Shack Burger (single). It was fairly average for the most part. Nothing really stood out. I did like the buttery buns, but other than that, I wouldn't recommend the burger itself.

We also shared orders of cheese fries. I personally enjoyed the cheese fries. The cheese sauce was creamy and tasty. I did notice that we weren't given as much cheese as other pictures posted on Yelp (which may be due to a shortage of cheese sauce that a few unhappy customers were complaining about when we were leaving the establishment), but any more cheese, and it would've been overwhelming. The fries itself are not mind-blowing, but they compliment the burger nonetheless.

I also had their strawberry malted milkshake. Just like the burger, it was fairly standard. No artificial strawberry flavor, which was nice. However, I've definitely had better milkshakes.

Price-wise, it's quite expensive. A single Shack Burger, cheese fries and a strawberry milkshake went past the $10 mark, which is pricey for the quality and portions you get.

In conclusion, it's awesome that they've opened a NY burger joint in Vegas (New York-New York to keep with tradition.) But if you don't know what to expect, don't excite yourself. You may be disappointed with the end result.

I most likely will not return.",3,1,2

I ordered the shackburger and cheese fries and they tasted nothing like the ones in the East Coast. The flavor was completely off and it was not as juicy either.

I was visiting Vegas with my boyfriend and we were looking for a quick bite to eat. This was our first time here. We walked inside to see these huge menus in front of us and decided on what we were going to get. We got a single shackburger, a single smokeshack, a side of fries, and a jackpot concrete. 

The burgers are offered in two different ways: single or double, meaning single or double patties. Not sure if it applied with cheese too, but I assume so.

The shackburger had lettuce, tomato, and their shacksauce. It was a light burger; tasted like a real good cheeseburger though. 

The smokeshack burger had bacon and cherry peppers on it, which added nice smokiness and slight heat. The burger was well balanced and had tons of flavor.

The fries were crinkle cut, non-greasy, and crisp. 
They also have cheese fries, which I'll have to try. 

The jackpot concrete was a rich, frozen vanilla custard mixed with strawberry sauce, sprinkles, and waffle bits. It was creamy, sweet, and delicious. 

Overall, what really stood out to me were their egg buns and the patties. I absolutely love egg breads so egg buns on my burger was a huge plus. It provided a bit chewier texture than regular burger buns. The patty was cooked a beautiful medium-well, with a crisp exterior. The patty was most likely pressed down so the outside could sear to add more texture and flavor.

People keep making the comparison between this place and In N Out but the two are completely different thus not right to compare. If I were to judge solely on taste, In N Out burgers win. For variety, Shake Shack wins. 

The organic potato buns would have been better if they were toasted. For the price, I guess quantity shouldn't matter (I need 2-3 of these burgers to be satisfied). The burgers were under-seasoned. I can say that these burgers are not greasy. The fries were fried perfectly and seasoned perfectly. 

The thing that won me is their Shack Attack. I got a single for my son. I tried it and needed to get my own (and one for my daughter in the C-line) right after our lunch. The C-line is for beverages and cold delicacies. What a brilliant idea! 

I'd go here just for the chocolate frozen custard; it is incredibly sweet, rich, thick, and chocolatey. Do not order this if you do not like your desserts sweet.

- Shack Stack: SO GOOD. Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce. The fried mushroom does it for me (for a vegetarian option of the same thing: try the 'Shroom Burger).
- Cheese Fries: All the cheesy goodness!! One order is good to share for 2-5 people (depending on how much everyone eats).

But anyways, the food. 
They offer a couple different burgers but they're all definitely on the pricier side.  We ordered the ShackBurger and the ShackStack. The ShackBurger was a regular cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatos and Shacksauce at $6 for a single.  It was okay.. nothing too special about it.  However, the ShackStack was a whole nother story!  Basically it was a cheeseburger version of the ""shroom burger"" with lettuce, tomatos and Shacksauce.  The crisp fried portobello mushroom was stuffed with ooey gooey melted cheese....  Hands down, amaaaaazing.  I seriously inhaled this burger and forgot I was supposed to split half\/half with my boyfriend..oops :) Definitely lives up to the hype & I would highly recommend this burger! 

The only thing I didn't really like was how fries & drinks were not included in the prices and that you had to order them seperately.

I went the first weekend it opened, and the line was VERY long for being 5 p.m. on a Sunday night. It was all hands on deck--tons of staff members were working in the kitchen and working the dining room floor.

Here's how it works at Shake Shack: You get in line, place your order, get your buzzer and wait for your buzzer to ring. Try to get a spot at one of the tables while you wait. Then you pick up your tray at the counter.

All of their burgers are bomb--my favorite is the Smoke Shack with bacon and little bits of spicy pickled peppers. Vegetarians will be happy with their portabello burger, which is stuffed with cheese and then fried. So decadent. Their cheese fries are AMAZING--don't think about the calories, just indulge. They recently switched back to their crinkle cut fries, which aren't ""fresh-cut"" but have that nostalgia factor.

I am a personal fan of Shake Shack's hot dogs--their Shack-cago dogs are freaking amazing.

During this visit, one of the staff members saw that it was my friend's birthday and offered to bring her a frozen custard of her choice. When they brought it out a bunch of staff came out and surrounded our table, and then one worker started singing Happy Birthday. She had a fantastic voice!

The only thing I would suggest is that they extend their late night hours. Plenty of people would love to do their drunk eating at the Shack! ;)",3,1,2

I'm not sure if pricing is the same as the ones in New York or just in Las Vegas, but I thought it was expensive for what I ordered. I took my family here for a late night snack and pretty much ordered almost the same thing all around except for shakes and a beer. We all ordered a single Shackburger and fries. I thought the burger was small for $5. At In N Out, that's almost a Double Double meal. Although $7 for a double cheeseburger is a little expensive, the flavor of the patty does stand out. The Shackmeister Ale was fairly priced at $6.50 as far as beers go at burger joints. I had a chocolate\/strawberry shake for dessert because they ran out of vanilla custard. It was a delicious blend of ... you got it... chocolate and strawberry at $5. Shake Shack is worth a try when in Vegas, but I won't be craving it that much for what it's worth.

3. Lighter
4. Super affordable

Shake Shack:
1. Not-so-fast fast food

Shake Shack is more dine-in whereas In N Out (for me at least) is more of a drive-thru option. Shake Shack has more complex flavors and options, which obviously to some people may ""taste better"" since flavors are elevated. If you're looking for a simple, fresh, and cost-effective burger, then In N Out is for you! If you're looking for a once-a-week treat, go head to Shack Shack. 

Both are good, but it all comes down to what kind of burger you're looking for. Shack Shack gives more options - beer, desserts... both delicious.

I realized that the burger here just didn't cut it for me as stated in the last review and since I have started to try and eat healthier, this go round I gave a try to their chicken shack sandwich and damned if I didn't find my ""go-to"" here. 

It thankfully still comes with the soft buttery hamburger buns that I believe are the best around bar none. I even did take a liking to the lettuce and pickle that is rounding out the lower half of the sandwich and the wife can attest to the fact that I don't ever order burgers with greens (I'd like to think it hides the true taste of the beef and cheese). Ha-ha! Speaking of that, I do feel like I'm able to ""overindulge"" a bit with being able to upgrade the sandwich as I incorporated bacon and cheese which I'm sure brought the calorie count of the plain version up considerably (well you only live once). The coup de gras for me was the chicken breast itself. It was consistently massive in size and juicy from beginning to end. I found it to be less batter heavy and it kept a crunchy texture that just sent it to another level of cluckery goodness (if it wasn't so good I'd care about using the word cluckery). =OP

Their menu is larger and has more options, but is still simple and easy to navigate. I have ordered the Smoke Shack and the Shack Stack which is basically a Cheeseburger with a fried stuffed portabello mushroom. Omg yassss both are so bomb! If you want something spicy, get the Smoke Shack, but if you want to experience greatness, the Shack Stack is my go to! And of course you gotta get the crinkle cut fries. Sooo perfectly crispy I love it! 

Besides the food, I have tried their shakes and their cold brew coffee and yes, I would highly recommend all of it! Obviously with better ingredients comes a steeper price which is fair. The best way I can describe this place is a midway between gourmet burgers and fast food. You get high quality ingredients (yeah none of that ice berg lettuce garbage), decent sized servings for a fair price. At In N Out, the food tastes just as amazing because of the spread sauce they use, but on a budget. If you're willing to spend $5-10 more for the meal, I'd choose this, otherwise you just can't beat the taste and price of In N Out!",5,2,4

Also, we can't forget about their amazing fried portobello mushroom with oozing cheese or some sort of sauce after each bite.

I had the Smoke Shack; roughly $6 for a single patty, and while the burger was a bit small, all of the flavors were there! Hmmmm. If you're a fan of spice, you should get this! I do regret not ordering something else with lettuce and tomatoes though. Halfway through the burger, that bacon started getting really salty, and there was nothing to balance the flavor.

Next, I ordered a strawberry shake! Hehe... Or my friend did because he was up on gambling and was nice enough to treat me out. Hefty $6~ for a tiny, 3\/4 of a pint looking cup. It was very sweet but still sooooo good! And I honestly needed that sweetness to drown the saltiness of the burger. If the burger didn't fill me up, that shake completely hit the spot.

Cheese fries, I hear from my friends, are also very good! $4 for a serving and the cheese is nice and melted.

Around $20 for burgers, fries, and a shake? I don't think it's worth it but when I'm in Vegas I expect myself to splurge anyway. But yeah, size to price ratio is completely terrible. If not to try at least once, come here for the shake! THAT SHAKE IS REALLY REALLY GOOD.",4,2,3

I was actually pretty excited to try it out today and I must say that it was very underwhelming. I ordered the double hamburger with everything on it. I decided to add bacon for $1.55, which brought the total to $8.80. My friends' burgers ended up being slightly over $10 each. The burgers definitely had decent charred flavor, but it was nothing out of this world. 

The pros: 
- You can order beer and wine (who drinks wine with a burger??)
- The produce in the burgers are more fresh than in-n-out's
- The workers here are nice
- You can purchase overpriced treats for your dog (maybe I should put this into cons) 

The cons: 
- Burger is small... I would even categorize it as petite. After I ate here, I was still so hungry that I drove over to tacos el gordo to pick up 4 tacos.  
- The cost of my burger was as much as 2 double doubles and fries at in-n-out (this was definitely not twice the quality) 

My 2 friends and I ordered different burgers and we all came to the same conclusion... it's not worth checking out again. We would much rather go to in-n-out because it is similar quality at a significantly cheaper price point. Hell, go pay a few more bucks at Bachi Burger for something memorable. If you're in NorCal, go check out Val's burgers in Hayward, CA.... now that's a burger.

I fell in love with their vegetarian burger. 

The 'Shroom Burger'. 

Ever have oozing cheese come out of your burger bite after bite? It's pretty ridiculous.
An amazingly huge and crispy-fried portobello mushroom filled with unbelievably addicting muenster and cheddar cheese. All melted to perfection with tomato and their Shack sauce. It's entirety is crack I tell you, WITH A LASTING IMPRESSION. I had no idea what I was getting into.
And compared to In-N-Out, I would much prefer Shake Shack over any burger place at this point. We stayed at Hotel32, so happily took advantage of how close it was. We found ourselves taking fieldtrips from the penthouse to Shake Shack all too often. Also, I really like that they have a huge dessert menu and serve beer and wine. 

AH-Mazzing!

Looking forward to our next Vegas trip this weekend!!",10,9,9

Food: I had the ShackBurger, Fries, and a Strawberry and Chocolate shake (separately, but bought both haha). The ShackBurger's bun is soft and moist! I love the bread they use. The patty itself is juicy, and you can definitely taste all that seasoning it's great! The vegetables they use taste fresh, and the fries always taste like they're fresh out of the oven! The strawberry shake is by far the best shake for me out of the OG 3 (Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry). The strawberry was not too sweet or sour, and it was so creamy. It reminded me of Breyer's strawberry ice cream's distinct taste. I'm not putting chocolate or vanilla down in any sort of way. Honestly, the chocolate was like each chocolate ice cream from Dreyers or Ben and Jerry's -- I loved their shake. 

Service: Nice and orderly! After ordering, you get a buzzer and you wait at a table until they call you up.

We get there on a Tuesday night so it wasn't that bad of a wait. Ordered our food...2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 Tenaya Creek hefs...$40. Ok fine, it's in a casino. Jacked up prices are expected. We get our food and right when I unwrapped my burger, it's already an oily mess. Seriously?!? I JUST unwrapped it and it's already gross. Bun is soggy, oil is dripping everywhere...just a big disappointment. I get to the middle of my burger patties and its raw. Like straight red. I had to break the raw pieces off so I wouldn't get sick. I ordered bacon in my burger but didn't get to enjoy the crispness of it because it got soft from all the grease of the patties. When I got towards the end of my burger, it was falling apart and there was a big puddle of oil where my napkins were. I was just so upset that I couldn't even finish it and just threw it back on the tray. I was actually pissed off that my bf had paid $40 for this crap. I haven't been angry over a meal in such a long time. The only saving grace and the reason this place gets 2 stars was the delicious crispy fries and beer. 

I definitely won't be back and I'd much rather have In-N-Out to this nonsense. What a waste of a cheat day.",2,4,3

The line at this Shake Shack is ridiculously long, but I was really impressed with how fast they got everyone through--it's obvious they took care in the design and staffing to make sure folks don't have to wait too long to eat.

Recently, they added a fried chicken sandwich to their menu, and a fried chicken sandwich is one of the world's best foods. It was delicious, though I definitely should have added cheese. Also stuck with my usual cheese fries which are never disappointing.

Now, if you're a normal Shake Shacker, I'd definitely give the chicken sandwich a try. It's a nice addition for them and sticks to the quality and taste you're expecting. However, if you're an infrequent visitor, I'd probably stick with the burger (if that's your usual). The chicken sandwich is good, don't get me wrong, but it's not *as* good as the burger.

They've been open for 2 days now and I figured it would be a mad house.  I was there around 4:30pm and although it was busy, they had plenty of cashiers and there was no line. (I had a friend who went around 12:30 and said that it was a 45 minute wait, so be prepared to wait during peak lunch hours)

The staff is all very friendly and helpful and there is a large menu just as you enter.  There are also paper menus at each cash register. As you order, you can see into the kitchen, which is always nice.

They seem to have more than enough staff to cover the opening. It appeared as if things were (basically) running smoothly. I did see a couple of hiccups while waiting for my order, but everything was fixed immediately.

I ordered take-out and it didn't take long for my food to be ready. The food is all reasonably priced, unlike most Strip restaurants.  The cashier gave me my receipt and a buzzer to notify me when my food was ready.

They have a couple of areas of counter space where you can get ketchup, mustard, napkins, mayo, etc. They even had to go cups for the condiments, which is nice.

The décor is super cute.  There doesn't appear to be tons of seating, but there are low tops, high tops and booths, along with a small round bench for people waiting for take out.

Now for the burger....I ordered the double Shack burger ($7.99), which is a very basic burger with 2 patties, cheese, lettuce, tomato and Shack sauce. I also ordered a side of crinkle cut fries ($2.95). For being ""no frills,"" this burger packed major flavor.  Consider me impressed.  The fries were also very good. I like that they are fat and not wimpy like some other places.

My coworker ordered the 'Shroom Burger, which is vegetarian. It's a fried Portobello mushroom, filled with both cheddar and muenster cheese, topped with lettuce and tomato and Shack Sauce. I love meat, but this seriously looked and smelled so delicious that I can't wait to try it.

I also can't wait to go back for the desserts - they obviously specialize in shakes, but they make theirs with custard instead of ice cream.

They have a great beer selection, and I love that they have made an effort to support local businesses (Bad Beat Brewing has a beer on tap and Gimme Some Sugar's banana peanut butter cheesecake is in the All Shook Up concrete).

They are also active in the community, with 5% of sales from the ""All Shook Up"" concretes going to the First Friday Foundation.

The verdict: Fries were good, but don't hold a candle to the In-N-Out well done fries. The meat in the burger was awesome and the bacon on mine was BAZANGA (meaning it wasn't some flimsy piece of micro-bacon but a crispy slice of thick cut deliciousness).

This is a great location along the strip and is accessible through the casino and outside. The line inside wraps around, until you reach a friendly person at the cash wrap. The menu is pretty straight forward and there is a lot to choose from. I went for a cheese fry, Shack Burger, and Mango Lemonade. 

All good choices, I initially thought. The food came out fast, and I can appreciate that condiments are set aside for eaters to choose. There's free refills too, which I definitely think is way nice!

The mango lemonade, though sour with a touch of sweet, I feel is a nice attempt at a cool summer beverage; the bitter aftertaste I wasn't a great fan of. The burger was good. I wasn't raging over it, but hey, it was worth the try, I think. The cheese fries in retrospect I could do without, nothing special about it... Just... No... Cheese... Please.

Fast forward a couple hours, and meh, I couldn't. I couldn't stand by my nice thoughts about my first trip to Shake Shack. I got super sick afterwards. It's frustrating not knowing exactly what it was... Could have been the cheese, or maybe the meat was undercooked.

The patty consisted of a Portobello mushroom stuffed with white gooey cheese and then DEEP FRIED. It gives it an amazing breaded crunchy texture.  It's lovely with the other fresh ingredients - like lettuce and tomato.  The bun is really fitting too.  Nice and soft but not too soft.

I tried a bite of the smoke shack burger my husband had.  It was pretty good with a nice bite of jalapeno, but I much preferred mine over his.

The line was pretty long but it went by fairly quickly.

Double Shack Burger ($7.99): Double patty with cheese, lettuce and tomatoes and shack sauce. The burger was pretty good (we were also starving after the day club). There was nothing TOO special about it but the flavors were different than others I've tasted.

Crinkle Cut Fries ($2.95): My heart lies with in-n-out fries =( I am not a fan of the thicker cut french fries.

Strawberry Milkshake ($5.25): If there's one thing Shake Shack knows how to do right... it's the strawberry milkshake!! Price is steep but it was an absolutely perfect shake! Right consistency, sweetness level and strawberries. The strawberries didn't taste processed and this was not overly sweet compared to In-n-out!

I chose the Double Shack Burger and cheese fries for my first Shack experience and I believe I chose right!  The burger was cooked perfectly and the flavors were really good.  I will say that the burger had a striking flavor resemblance to Wendy's though.  I'm not sure how to feel about that, but at the same time, I love Wendy's too!

It was a very modern, clean and efficient place with lots of options. They sold not only food but also merchandise there. Since the first time, I asked staff's suggestion. I ordered a shack stack, chick'n stack, fries and root beer. My sister modified the Shack Stack with protein style so lettuce instead of buns. They would call your number when it's ready. The food came out pretty fast. I loved how they served Stumptown cold brew and beer to pair with your food. I didn't set up any expectations before we walked in. It was amazing delicious for a fast food chained restaurant. The combination of mushroom and cheese worked well and chicken was crispy and tender. I loved the crinkle fries which were crispy and crunchy without any salty or cheese. Compared to the other popular fast food chained restaurant in Los Angeles, I preferred this one.

Its wide open space allows for several big screen tvs that play sports channels.  The vibe is very hip and casual.

This burger mecca boasts nice clean contemporary interior design and plenty of space.  By far, much pleasanter dining ambiance compared to sterile refridgerated chains.  Primo atmosphere, primo venue.

The double-S serves a very tasty burger:  fluffy soft bun, patty that tastes like really beefy proper ground beef, and all the basic toppings of tomato onions pickle and green leaf lettuce.  I devour it sans condiment.  Yeah, pass on sauce.. inevitably some version of thousand island.  Because when beef is as quality as this, no need to mask it with sauce.  Price point for a standard burger is somewhere between In-n-Out's and Five Guys's.

Don't like burgers?  No worries.  You can get chicken, hot dogs, mushrooms, krinkle-kut fries, frozen custard, milk-shakes... plenty of variety on the menu.

Extra star for easy-to-find location right smack at street level.  No hunting high and low, wending your way through casino mazes.  Shake Shack sports a massive neon sign on New York New York casino.  Practically impossible to miss.

Im gonna have to disagree with a majority of peeps being a fan of these guys with 4 stars. As to all up and coming trends, I usually feel the need to check it out just to satisfy my curiosity.

At first I thought they were actually inside the New York New York Hotel and Casino. Nope. To access them you have to go outside to go inside the restaurant. If you see a line going out the door and down the stairs, don't worry, this is normal for the time being. Im assuming eventually the hype will die down. To my surprise, the line moves pretty fast.

I like how they keep the line moving because they are fully staffed to handle the demand. This goes for cashiers, cooks, and bussers. The only issue I have with the place is that there are not enough tables and chairs to accommodate the lunch and dinner rush. From my observation, about half the time, people that ordered just had it to go because they did not want to hassle waiting for a table to open. If you are not by yourself, have another person scope for a table as soon as you get in line. By the time you order, you should have a table ready to go. 

As for the food, I went with the Shack Stack ($9.49), Cheese Fries ($3.95), and a regular drink ($2.75). The Shack Stack was just a basic cheeseburger with a big ass breaded portobella mushroom filled with a some kind of liquid cheese. Pro tip: when you first get it, dont bite into it right away. Let it cool down a bit. Yes, I freakin burned my lips and tongue on the damn thing but it was pretty good though. The Cheese Fries were just that. Crinkle cut fries with a melted velveeta type cheese on it. As for the drink, THERE'S NO REFILLS! 

In closing, spending 20 bucks for a basic cheeseburger meal with cheese fries and a drink is a bit much. Heck even 10 bucks might be overdoing it. I get it. Prices are jacked up because its located on the strip. It's good. Just not 20 bucks good. Its just ok. I finished my meal and it was just right. So you're telling me I gotta shell out 80 bucks for a family of 4 from a supposedly fast food joint? No thanks. This visit was my first. Might be my last.

But since it was in Vegas and so was I the opportunity was seized. Really like the design both inside & outside. It's themed and branded throughout. I also was very impressed with the various vendors that were featured inside on the video screens. It shows a commitment to high quality and local vendors.

Now for the burgers. Let's use context. As the East Coast competitor to In & Out I'd say it tastes better. But before all you West Coast people start hating, here's why: the ingredients are better, but it's also more expensive so In & Out is a much better deal. I think you can get a 4x4 and In & Out for the same price as a Double Shack. But also the different kinds of custards and the cheese fries look amazing. So based on value In & Out blows this place away, but sheerly on taste Shack Burger wins. Not only are the patties bigger and have better quality meat, but the buns are softer and compliment the burger better. 

Next time I want to get the cheese fries and try a shake. I wouldn't put this place in a gourmet burger category yet, but after tasting it I actually don't think it's a competitor of In & Out. 

If you love burgers like I do it's worth a try.",4,0,4

1. Shack stack burger, what I liked about this was the fried mushroom, the burger was really simple and fresh tasting but the patty was kind of dry
2. Cheese fries, ""cheese sauce"" tasted like something from a can or packet, similar to nacho cheese sauce
3. Shack cago hotdog, liked it better than the burger, but the hot dog bun was really soggy and fell apart while eating
4. Concrete ""jackpot"" frozen custard, this was my favorite part of the meal, a sweet delicious combo of vanilla frozen custard, strawberry purée, marshmallow cream, waffle pieces, and rainbow sprinkles (I love sprinkles)

This location provides a definitive ""yes"" to that question. I love the Shack. I've been rocking shackburgers since the original location in the park was the one and only. I have eaten at Shacks in Cambridge, DC, and West Hollywood. Never had a bad experience until today.

The defining technique and characteristic of a Shackburger is the smash on the hot grill to create that beautiful Maillard crust. But the burger I got today was grey all the way through. No crust, no contrast of texture, just a grey, mushy mess on a potato roll. And mine was not an anomaly. When I was waiting at the counter for nearly five minutes for my order (despite the fact that my buzzer had buzzed) I noticed one burger after another coming out similarly. I don't know if the griddle (which I believe are top of the line) was not properly heated, or the griddles were not properly trained in the smash, or what, but the burgers coming out today were epic fails. Extremely disappointing, Shake Shack.

I definitely had high hopes but left feeling just okay. :'( 

Here we go: 
Shack stack - This is a cheese burger with a deep fried portobello mushroom filled with cheese, shack sauce, and your typical lettuce and tomato. It looked so good in pictures and the first bite definitely was glorious but I grew rather tired of it after 3 bites in. This burger was just too hearty and rich for me! Not being dramatic at all, but my heart felt heavy after the few bites. All the cheese was rather overwhelming, even for a burger lover like myself. The shack sauce was definitely too rich...as it tasted like it was just pure mayonnaise. The only reason I finished the burger was because it was $9.49. 

Double down fries - These are crinkle cut fries topped with cheese, bacon, and red peppers. I love my fries, do not get me wrong...but these were just meh, nothing to rave about. The portion was pretty generous but the price is still steep for what it is...for ~$9. 

Vanilla shake - Sadly, I think this was the highlight of my meal. The consistency was just right: not too thick and definitely not runny. Kept me pretty refreshed in the 103 degree weather this weekend. 

I'm glad I got to try this place out, but nothing compares to my beloved In-N-Out.",1,1,0

Call me old fashioned, but just give me a little mustard on the burger.  I'm glad you have to ask for onions, if you want them... everyone should do that.  LOVED the cheese fries!  They are a MUST order every time.  And I had a creamsicle float to drink (orange soda and vanilla frozen custard).  It was quite awesome!

I've forgiven them for those times because the food there is still legit. This is one of the places people hype up but I think their quality stands true to their ratings. 

I highly recommend to get the following:
-Shack Stack (a cheeseburger that includes a crisp-fried portobello mushroom with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses)
-Cheese fries (crinkle cut fries topped with melted cheese)
-Rootbeer

One thing In N Out has on them is their fries. Not digging the fries. I usually get the cheese fries--bc, cheese--but don't like the texture of the fries and don't like how the cheese is that liquidy cheese. I prefer that square Kraft cheese, lol.

I admit it - I am a sucker for some good crinkle cut fries, and the ones at Shake Shack do not disappoint! Perfectly salted and fried to a crisp, but not too much so they're overly greasy. However, I did have their special fries earlier this month with cheese sauce and bacon and they were painfully salty. I was definitely puffy from all the salt for a few days. 

Their shakes? Amazing. Simply amazing. All of them are fabulous. Grab one and then go across the street to the AC Store for a mini of Bailey's or a delicious dessert vodka to make it extra happy. 

It doesn't matter which burger we get, each of them are delicious. My husband likes the Shake Shack with the fried mushroom or whatever it is and he is in Heaven each time he gets it. 

I get the hamburger or cheeseburger either wrapped in lettuce or on their gluten free bun. Let me tell you something. They have the most delicious, squishy, buttery gluten free bun I've ever had. Their buns make me remember why I missed bread so much when my gluten allergy was at its worst over a decade ago. Perfect meat to bun ratio, and a delicious bite each time.

I had never heard of it before until I watched a Top 10 video on YouTube for best fast food burger places. To my surprise the number one spot went to Shake Shack. I was so confused because I had never even heard of the restaurant before. I quickly googled it and found out there was one in the very city I was living in! After that first taste of Burger Shack, I was sold.

The Las Vegas Shake Shack is no different from any other location I've been to. It's always packed. Be prepared to stand in a long line depending on what time you go. I've seen the lines coil or go out the front door. Also prepare to see some high prices for fast food burgers. They may look intimidating, but I personally think it's worth it.

This Shake Shack has a very large dining area which was great. It was packed but my partner and I were still able to find seating. Every time I've gone the workers have been very nice and high energy even though they are dealing with mobs of people.

Each time I've went I've gotten a burger, fries (sold separately) and a shake. I'll be honest and say I ordered a SmokeShack burger each time. I love the SmokeShack and since I don't visit Shake Shack a lot I always have a taste for this burger.

The SmokeShack has the ShackSauce, cherry peppers, and smoked bacon. Everything blends perfectly together. The ShackSauce gives it a savory sweet flavor, the peppers add a nice acidic bite, and the bacon gives it a smoky and (need I say it?) a bacon flavor. The burger patties are flattened, but that gives them that crispy outer texture and the flavor of the meat is that delicious, rich, fatty beef flavor that I know most people are looking for in a burger. The hamburger buns are nice and fresh which just adds to the experience. The hamburger buns are fresh which just adds to the experience. 

My one gripe is that I wish the burger was bigger. As far as fast food burgers go, these burgers are small. Even the double isn't very big. I'm not sure if the price of the burger matches the size. The quality does though.

The fries are delicious. They are crinkle cut so when cooked well they have that perfect crispiness. I felt that they are salted well and they match well with the burgers. As for the shakes, they are the one thing that I would say are a must (if you like ice cream that is). I've tried the peanut butter, mud pie, and pumpkin pie shakes. Each time the shake has been very thick to the point where it's difficult drinking through the straw (I like that) and each time the shake has exceeded my expectations. They truly taste like their ingredients except magnified. It tasted like I was eating an ice cream pumpkin pie when I had the shake. They are amazing and the restaurant definitely lives up to its name.

If you eat at Shake Shack be prepared to spend more than you would at other fast food restaurants. But also be prepared to have very high quality fast food. It's rare for me to find food where I think the quality outshines the price\/quantity, but Shake Shack pulls it off. However, I don't think I would enjoy it as much without getting the whole meal. I think collectively the meal deserves a 5. Definitely give it a try.",1,0,0

The french fries were just a bit average...I did like that they were crinkle cut. Being that I went to the location in Las Vegas on The Strip... it was pretty crowed and hard to find a table for my family.

 Picks:
ShackBurger ($5.19 Single) Cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce was good but not great like expected. Good ingredients but not much meat.

SmokeShack ($6.74) Cheeseburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and ShackSauce. The addition of bacon helped a little, but we did not detect high quality smoked bacon.

'Shroom Burger (vegetarian) ($6.99) Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce. Anything deep fried is tasty, even veggies.  Not very healthy though, but its Vegas Baby!

Shack-cago Dog ($4) Dragged through the garden with Rick's Picks Shack relish, onion, cucumber, pickle, tomato, sport pepper, celery salt and mustard. This one actually impressed us more than the burgers.

Crinkle Cut Fries ($2.95) were fantastic.  If only the burger could be this good.

Hand-spun vanilla Shake ($5.25) 640 calories and worth it. Thick and creamy.

Creamsicle Float ($5.25) was beautiful and hit the spot. (It was 105 degrees outside)

We tried their regular shack burger, crinkle cut fries, and of course a shake. The burger was simple, but delicious. The meat was juicy, the tomatoes and lettuce were fresh, and the bun was super soft. I enjoyed the crinkle cut fries as they have the extra surface area for more crispy goodness.

They should have told me they reopened my check and voided the amount. I thought they were going to do a refund and then recharge me, so I was very confused until my friend explained it to me. 

I would consider maybe going again only if I had an out of town guest who wanted to visit. It's too pricey to be worth it.",0,0,0

The stack shack has a fried portebello mushroom with a single burger. I got the double smoke shack. The smoke comes with two burgers on top of delicous bacon. The shake was ok.

The line goes fast, don't get intimidated. We had to catch a show next-door and only had about 45 mins, and we made it just in time after enjoying our burgers here.

The burger buns were a little soggy for me, and tasted more on the gummy side. I think if they were grilled a bit longer and were crispier, I would have enjoyed it more. 

Try out their cheesy french fries - it's  a basket of fries with melted (cheddar?) cheese on top. They give you a little wooden fork to eat the fries so your hands don't get too cheesy.",1,0,1

There's a reason this place is called Shake Shack. You don't go here for a meal. You go here for custard. Okay, wait my reasoning is flawed since ""shake"" is in the name. What I'm getting at is that this place should be called Custard Shack or at least it should be related to dairy desserts in some way.

I remembered the burger being overhyped so I decided to try the classic hot dog instead. That was more disappointing. FRENCH'S mustard? Are you fucking kidding me? And then the whole thing fell apart about one third of the way in. There was too much moisture from the relish wetting the bottom bun, when it should have been on top. Also, serving it in a wrapper would have helped.

The manager went table to table to check on customers, and was nice to bring my daughter a new bun for her burger that fell apart. (I sense a bun structural integrity problem.)

The crinkle cut fries were really good. As I mentioned the real reason to go to Shake Shack is the frozen custard. I think plain vanilla is better to taste the frozen custard flavor. We had their Shark Attack - chocolate custard with mix-ins (I don't remember which ones now). But at Shake Shack chocolate really just tastes like frozen yogurt so everyone should know to get the vanilla, which I've had in New York and was fantastic.

Food: shack burger with fries 
Drink: 50\/50

Wait: not too long. Even though the line was to the outside it didn't feel too long. Especially once we ordered our food came out within five minutes. 

Burger was very good. A little heavy in the flavor for me, but that could be because I was a bit full from all the drinking. Bread was soft and it tasted very cheesy (loved that). But seriously, kind of like a minor heart attack in the shape of a burger. 

Fries: omg so delicious. Just the right balance of soft on the inside and a bit crunchy on the outside. 

The 50\/50 drink is like half lemonade half tea. I figured with a burger I wouldn't want something too heavy to follow it. Really light, a bit sweet and totally good. Also free refills! But you have to go up to the counter to ask for refills

The exterior storefront is gorgeous and the interior is chic and has flat screens thru out the dinning room and an extra large one at the center of the dinning area. This night happen to be the National College football championship -  so it was nice to dine and enjoy the game. 

Since this was my first time ever trying out Shake Shack and I wanted to mix it up. I ordered a single Shack Burger, Shack cago dog, crinkle fries and a peanut butter shake. I heart the remote sized buzzer that alerted me when my order was ready.

Overall the food was yummy - the buns are soft and fresh, everything was not overly salted. The hot dog was lean and the toppings were fresh. The burger was delish and the peanut butter shake was bomb! The gal who took my order was a newer employee in training but did a wonderful job.

It's a quality fast food burger, but by no means is it the ""Best Burger in the World!"" as others might suggest.  

Stopped in on a Monday night and the line wrapped almost to the entrance.  The ordering is quick and efficient so it only took about 10 minutes to get the to front of the line.  I ordered the Smoke Shack and Cheese Fries with a small drink ($15.00).  The cashier was nice enough to let me know that there were free refills when I tried to order the large drink.  Food took about 10 mins and despite being packed there were plenty of open tables.

The burger had a nice soft bun with smoked bacon, cheese and slightly spicy red peppers.  I had seen on TV that Shake Shack uses a secret blend of ground beef for their patties, but after the peppers, I really couldn't taste the beef.  The burger is pretty small, but by the end I was full.  Cheese fries were nice and crispy, but the cheese sauce was pretty tame american cheese sauce.  It's impossible for cheese fries not to be good, but these were nothing to write home about.  I will take In-N-Out Animal Style fries over these any day.  

What really impressed me about Shake Shack were the employees and how smooth everything ran.  One thing I regret is not trying are the shakes and desserts.  Those looked great.  

It may sound like I didn't enjoy Shake Shack, but I did.  However, Las Vegas has sooo many great burger joints that I have to compare accordingly.  

My Recommendation: If you're in need of a quick, affordable bite on the strip, Shake Shack will please almost everyone.  If you have more time and a few extra $'s there are plenty of burger joints, like Burger Bar by Hubert Keller, that offer a better value and tastier burger.  If you have a car, go to in-N-Out for a double double animal style meal for 1\/2 the price.",5,1,1

I've tried it back in NY years back and I've dreamt about their Shack Stack since then. Then I found out they've come to good 'ol viva Las Vegas! Dream. Come. True.

It's right at the end of the ""Brooklyn Bridge"" at the NY NY hotel. The wait isn't too bad. You'll be shocked at the people waiting but the line moves fast! 

For those who hasn't had the opportunity to try it back in the East Coast, they serve a variety of different cuisines from burgers, hot dogs, custards, and adult drinks. By far my favorite thing to get here is their Shack Stack. It's a burger stacked with a fried stuffed cheese portobello mushroom inside. Freaking amazing. It's seriously the best hangover cure ever. Order it with some custard shakes and cheese fries and it's freaking bomb.

My only gripe is that compared to In N Out, it's not fresh to made to order. You'll notice that there's a bunch of burgers pre-made under a heat lamp behind the counter. The freshness doesn't even come close to the burgers at In N Out. They do also have a secret sauce similar to In N Out called the shack sauce but I like In N Outs better. 

Definitely a must try at least once. You can then compare which coast is better. West coast is definitely the best coast!!",4,1,3

I'm more of a mustard dude but it was ok.   Fries were your everyday crinkle cut fries, nothing special.  You can also get them with cheese which pretty much tastes like that canned cheese you get on nachos at the theater.  Where they failed me was the chocolate malt.   It had that over whipped foamy consistency like you get at a place like McDonald's.  I finally just threw it out.  Daughter had a concrete which looked nothing like the pictures.

My friend has had Shake Shack in NY and is a fan, so when we decided to go to Vegas, we made sure to make a stop at Shake Shack, which is so appropriately located at New York New York Casino. This is a cute burger and fries place. When we arrived, there was a line of people outside. There was an employee who was minding the door and letting people in as the line inside moved along. She also handed out menus. The line wasn't short but it moved along pretty quickly. 

There were several cashiers taking people's orders. My cashier was super friendly. She took my order of the single Shackburger (a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, and Shacksauce), the CRINKLE CUT fries, the mango lemonade, and a cup of the vanilla frozen custard. After paying, the cashier handed me one of those buzzer things, that light up and vibrate when your order is ready. My friends and I grabbed a table that was outside. Even though it was like 3 in the afternoon, the place was very busy and all the tables inside were taken. Very popular! Maybe about 8 minutes later, my buzzer went off and I went to go pick up my food, which came on an adorable little silver tray. I love eating cafeteria-style! There is a condiment station with mustard and ketchup, with napkins and straws and such. 

The Shackburger was very tasty. The crinkle cut fries were delicious. I love crinkle cut fries - they are just so cute and they remind me of childhood - hot meals in elementary school! The mango lemonade was just okay - it didn't really taste much like mango. Just more like lemonade. The custard was just okay also. I would totally come back here to get another Shackburger, or next time, I'd like to try the 'Shroom Burger, which is a fried portobello mushroom filled with cheese - it's their veggie option. Actually they even have a burger that has both the cheese burger and the 'Shroom burger TOGETHER. So this may actually solve my dilemma of wanting both! And definitely more crinkle cut fries.

Now, mind you, he's only 11 so a burger and a milkshake doesn't require much thinking so we knew we were in the clear of having to go to Gordon Ramsey's (sp?) Burgr restaurant.  Our first and only thought was to go to Shake Shack.  I had never been and had been planning on going on other trips but simply forgot.  Now that we had the time and it was a special occasion, why not.

We ordered the cheeseburgers, bacon cheeseburger, mushroom burger (not the vegetarian one but they do offer the vegetarian option), and of course strawberry and cookies and cream milkshakes and lemonade.  Everything was delicious.  The bacon was so huge it was sticking out of the burger.  The burgers come in medium or well done.  Well done for the kids, Medium for me and the hubby.  It was juicy and delicious and melt in your mouth.  The mushroom burger (actually called the Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce).  The cheese was oozing out of the burger and it just made it that much delicious.  All the flavors came together well and I didn't even need to add anything to it.  The lemonade had the right amount of sour and sweet.  I believe it was freshly made.  Oh and did I forget to mention that the drinks are free refills.  You just need to bring your cup to the counter (you keep the cover and straw) and tell them you want a refill and what you want as the refill and they will do it for you.  Handy, isn't it.

There were tvs all around so you could watch whatever game, news report, etc. you wanted to watch.  The patio area was well misted so you weren't too warm and uncomfortable sitting outside in the heat.  The walls are glass so you could easily see the tv's on the inside of the restaurant.  There are tvs on the outside in the patio area too.  The menu was easy to read.  Specials are listed everywhere so if you forgot, it's at the cashier too.  There are menus there too if you forgot what you were looking at when you looked at the menu on the wall.  There are so many options to choose from.

So naturally, when Vegas was bestowed with a Shake Shack on the strip, I was curious to see just what the hype was about.

First impression: there's a giant menu to greet you when you walk in. As a first-timer, this is useful. The interior has that modern wood\/sleek metal combination look. The layout was bigger than I what I was expecting. When we went, late-night on a Thursday, there was plenty of seating available. 

I opted for the standard: the single Shackburger with some crinkly fries. It was good. It reminded me a lot of In-N-Out, but at double the price. I guess this is where you'd go if you feelin' fancy. The crinkly fries were plumper and better than say, Raising Cane's. So I'll give them that.

Shackburger:  Tasty!  Loved the simple burger with lettuce, tomato, and shacksauce.

Smokeshack:  Didn't like this so much, it was with bacon, and it was just ok.  Preferred the regular shackburger.

Root beer float:  Can't go wrong with that.

Fries:  I happened to love the fries.  It was fried perfectly, seasoned well, and the cheese sauce was right up my alley.  Never met French fries I didn't like.

Verdict of In-n-Out vs Shake Shack:  Count me in as In-n-Out loyalist.  In-n-Out is fresher, tastier, and cheaper, too.  I like the fries at Shake Shack better, and I like that they sell alchohol here.  I fully enjoyed Shake Shack, so I'm sure I'll be back at this location next time I'm in Vegas.

Very short line - we ordered 2 smoke stacks (one a double) an order of regular fries, one order of cheese fries, a small lemonade, and a bottled water.  We got our beeper and began hunting for a table. The short line was deceiving - this place was packed! Eventually we found a table. There's ample amounts of seats but it was very busy (and raining.)

Got the food - great burger. I loved the peppers paired with the lettuce and bacon. Sooo good! The cheese fries - eh. If liquified cheese is your thing, then go for it! Next time we'll just stick with the filtered water on tap, and get shakes instead. 

$2.89 for the small lemonade $2.49 for the bottled water. $3.99 for the cheese fries, $2.99 for the regular fries, $6.99 for the single, and $9.79 for the double burger.. The prices were a bit steep.

I'd definitely come back while in Vegas, because the burgers and shakes are so tasty. Next time I'd visit while walking down the strip to avoid the parking fee (0-60 min free, anything over that ranges from $7-10.)

The mushroom burger was really good too. The cheese in it is opposite of the shack burger. The cheese was very stretchy when I bit into it and was not wet like the shack burger. The mushroom was breaded which complimented the soft bun really well. 

The fries were hard on the outside but very meaty when I bit into it. The best crinkle fries I've ever had! All the crinkles fries I've tried had before this were very soft and flimsy so when I first saw that shake shack only serves crinkle fries I was a bit disappointed. But man was I pleasantly surprised when I took my first bite of their fries. 

The milkshakes were amazing also! I tried the chocolate and strawberry ones and they were both really good. Not too sweet and very creamy. Love it!

The highlight of this Vegas trip was being able to eat at Shake Shack. Located at the New York New York, it's next to Tom Urban (look for the Brooklyn Bridge replica) & across the street from the M&M store. 

It was exciting to witness the grand opening, order from excited employees, & meet the CEO (he even graciously took a photo with us) but it comes down to the food for me. 

My husband and I ordered the Shack Burger & double Smoke Stack with fries, a shake, and fifty fifty (an Arnold Palmer). I contemplated letting my husband have a bite of my burger but I realized it would be one fewer bite for me so I kept eating. 

I was surprised that there weren't more people in line for the grand opening but I trust that people will flock here to the first West Coast location based on its stellar reputation. I will say that the friendly staff (both behind the registers & the ones in suits) on top of the delicious food have made us lifelong Shack Shack customers. 

As a Californian, I do prefer Shake Shack to In N Out. I love how soft the bun is, the freshness of the lettuce and tomato, and something I can't put my finger on.

Four Star Friday!!!!
I wasn't gonna wait til' a NY trip to try Shake Shack, so when I got the chance to visit, I definitely jumped on it. 

  Better than In-N-Out? It depends.  They do have a wider variety than your usual ""hamburger or cheeseburger- with or without onions"" menu, but to each their own. 
  My sister and I tried the Shroom Burger with crinkle fries. For some odd reason, we both had missed the ""vegetarian"" note on the menu and we were expecting a full on mushroom burger WITH a beef patty and then some, but we were surprised to notice within several bites in, that it was just breaded mushroom. A little confused? Yes. Disappointed? Yes. Did I hate it? No, it was actually quiet tasty. We were just in shock haha. The burger consisted of a crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce for $6.99. I loved the potato bun!  It was soft and yummy (oh, and non-GMO, as of last year!)  The crinkle fries were fried to a nice golden crisp, very enjoyable with peppered ketchup (try it!) - And since we were already indulging, we also had to order shakes.  After all, it IS called Shake Shack for a reason, right?   I decided to go with the Salted Caramel milkshake and my sister, a chocolate milkshake. YUMYUMYUM. The Salted Caramel was muy delicioso! Sweet, but the salt and caramel were both apparent. Dipping a fry or 10 also works wonders to the palate! The chocolate milk shake reminded me of a rich, dark Tablea (Filipino hot chocolate). Not too much a fan of, but my sister loved it! 

***Side note: Jay suggested to get the Stack Shack burger next time (Beef patty WITH the portobello mushrooms). Yes, I will definitely try that next time haha.

Pros: 
- Affordable prices
- Dog-friendly! Doggie Menu for your pup(s)
- Great location off the corner of New York New York Hotel & Casino
- Milkshakes are a must! (Bathroom-worthy for super lactose intolerant people like me :\/ lol)
- Plenty of tables available (booths, long tables, patio tables, picnic tables, etc.)
- Plenty of TV's to catch the games
- Jay the busser was very personable & friendly compared to the cashiers

Cons:
- The employees need to smile more!!!

Overall, I couldn't really compare my Shroom burger to an In-n-Out burger because of the mushroom ordeal, but I still did have a pleasant experience and would return again when given a chance.",19,16,22

The fries of in n out are far more superior than shake shacks. Shake shacks fries were doughy in the middle. You get that potatoey feeling and suddenly made the meal a lot heavier.

In and Out is equivalent to McDonalds.

Shake Shack is more of a hipster joint. Most people go there because the food tastes great and there are people like myself that will go there because their meat is humanely raised, 100% angus beef, vegetarian fed, and no hormones or antibiotics. 

People are saying that the burgers are over priced compared to In and Out? I just answered why you're paying more. Quality ingredients means more food cost for the restaurant which means more money out of your pocket.  People go to Whole Foods even though their prices are high because they sell food as God intended us to eat. The same goes for Shack Shake. People go there with peace in mind that what they are eating is REAL food and because it tastes great. 

If you're concerned about your wallet, then go to In And Out and eat burgers that Monsanto and other GMO corporations want you to eat.

Located right outside of NYNY is this hip restaurant with ample indoor and outdoor seating. Around lunch time, it gets pretty crowded but the lines move pretty quickly. They have a decent selection of alcohol, burgers, shakes, and fries. We ended up getting:

Shack Stack- $9- Basically it combines the beef patty burger with the portobello patty which oozes with cheese inside of it. This was amazing, even though the burger looked small, the flavors blended so well in your mouth. Just delightful.

Cheese fries- $5- How did they get the fries to be so crunchy? It was an aromatic mash of cheese and potatoes. It was like a cheesy potato fiesta in my mouth.

The meal came out to $30 for the both of us so it's a little bit pricier than I hoped. However, it was worth it because that blend of beef and mushroom is just amazing. I was worried to try this place because I had a nasty experience at white castle but this place is 10 times better.",5,4,5

I ordered the double shack burger, and it was not what I was hoping it would be. We also ordered the double down fries. 

The service was ok, employees didn't seem happy, the lady that took our order actually deleted my whole burger once I saw the receipt. This was due to me asking for no tomatoes, and she didn't realize she 86'd the whole burger. We also found a table but we had to wipe it off ourselves, even though there was an employee standing next to it just surveying the area. Looked around and there were actually 5 dirty tables around us. 


Starting off with the burger, it wasn't anything too special. The bun was just a potato bun which was too soft and soggy, the meat was very salty. It seemed like a burger you can get at any other restaurant that serves burgers. At least with In N Out, you can say that you can't really find that anywhere else. Especially due to the toasted bun. It was also quite greasy, and left me feeling bleh. 

But I give it the extra stars for the fries. The fries came loaded with cheese, bacon, and peppers. The fries had a nice crunch to it, and I actually really enjoyed them.

Sadly, this Shake Shack was nothing compared to the one I had in NYC. Both my friend and I was hyping it up so much to our other friends. However, after we took a couple bites of our burgers... we just sat there in despair. The burger turned out to be very disappointing. My friend looked like she was about to cry. I also wasn't told that the burger was gonna be rare\/medium rare. I didn't think it would be that bad, and the line was kinda ridiculous so I just ate my burger anyway.

People confuse it a lot of the times with Steak 'n' Shake--don't make that mistake. These two places are completely different.

The burgers at this place don't come with fries. And they're much smaller. And they're more expensive. 

Upon looking at the menu, I saw that the SmokeShack burger (a cheeseburger with bacon) is $7 for a single and $9.50 for a double! I figure the burgers must be fairly big to justify such a price--even in Vegas.

They weren't. I ordered the double, but this thing was insultingly small. Oh, and when I asked what kind of cheese they can put on it besides American, the lady said that's all they have. Really? It's basically not even real cheese!

But despite all that, bites one and two were surprisingly good. I was digging it. The bun was actually really fluffy and buttery. And the meat--which was of pretty good quality--covered up the whole bun without any excess bread at the end. But the more I ate, the more the fake-cheesiness got to me. If it wasn't for the bacon to somewhat balance it out, it would have been a much more miserable experience--for nearly $10. And I was still hungry afterwards.

My fiancee had the Shack-cago Dog at a more reasonable price of $4. This one was actually really good, too. It was your classic Chicago-style hotdog with a nice peppery kick. Oh, and the french fries were addicting as well.

If you don't know good burgers, you might like this place. But after going to other ""faster food"" burger places, like Fuddruckers or Steak 'n' Shake, this place is a step above Five Guys and a step below In-n-Out (although the meat was better here).

I love oreo flavored milkshakes anywhere, but Shake Shack's black and white shake definitely hit the spot: cold, creamy, and velvety.

FOOD:
1) Shack Stack-- ($9.49) 
I thought this was the best thing on the menu! The fried portobello mushroom literally melted in your mouth. If you're not fond of mushrooms, you shouldn't order this bc the taste of the mushroom is infused into the cheese. The buns are buttery and crispy when bitten into & the party is cooked to perfection (medium to medium rare to be exact) 
The actual burger is the size of a regular burger that you can order from in-n-out (maybe even smaller). But the height of the burger is 3.5-4 inches! You better open your mouth wide for this !! 

2) Smoke Shack-- (single: $6.69)
Shake Shack is also popular for their bacon! It had a smokey applewood taste to it. The burger also included pickled sweet red peppers which gave it a tangy-ish taste! 

3) Chicken Dog-- ($4.50) 
The texture was pretty chewy... And not worth the $4.50 in my opinion. The overall taste wasn't all that great either. It was smokey with a weird aftertaste. It didn't come with any condiments. No ketchup, mustard, relish, or anything. It was just the sausage and the hotdog bun -__-

My friends had the SmokeShacks and loved the sweet pepper and bacon. They said that the flavors went well together. We finally ended our meal with the Jackpot concrete, which was vanilla custard with some chilled crunchy waffle bits. I liked how the waffles were chilled and layered throughout the dessert. This gave the concrete a good texture.

We came at 5 pm and they were packed to the gills. There were absolutely no places to sit inside. I was standing around waiting for a table, where the people were taking their time finishing up. Someone came and took the chairs at the table I was waiting for. How rude.

I was indecisive over which of their five burgers that I wanted to try, so I opted for the Shack Stack: combination of the 'Shroom Burger and Cheeseburger. One bite into that deep fried 'shroom, and I swear, it let out some kind of a whistle-sigh. Gooey, cheesy goodness then overflowed out and plopped onto my tray. *Homer Simpson drool* 

Here's the burger bummer: all that cheese did take away from the ability to taste the burger patty. Next time around, I might select either Shack Burger or 'Shroom Burger. Unsure if I'd do both again, but dang, I just can't shake off my cravings for the Shack Stack! 

Also devoured was a single scoop vanilla custard ice cream on a cone, which wasn't enough for me. A double scoop might've been the way to go. In addition to standard vanilla and chocolate offerings, there's also a flavor of the week that can be found on the back of their menu. 

Prices are reasonable. The Shack Stack is the most costly burger on the menu, costing over $9. Their golden, crunchy crinkle fries are an additional cost. For being situated on The Strip inside the NYNY, the food is a bargain.

No complaints about the service. Quick, efficient, helpful, and amiable. 

Plan to come with other people if you dine here. Patrons are constantly coming and going, so seats are limited -- seat stalk, but don't be a weirdo about it. There aren't purse hooks on the high tables -- WTF, really? Be prepared to cradle your baggage, or take the chance of leaving your stuff on the table for someone to jack while you're stuffing your face. When the weather permits, it's great to dine outside and people watch -- that is, if you don't mind seeing the occasional rolling advertisements for escorts, but that's just a typical Vegas day on The Strip.

Stopped by here over the weekend on my way to Utah. Once you walk in they take you through a Disneyland type waiting line. The girl who took my order was super sweet and helped me pick out a burger since it was my first time.

I ordered the Shack Stack a cheeseburger combined with the shroom burger which has a delicious crispy portobello mushroom filled with both ooey goodness of melted cheeses and muenster cheeses topped with lettuce and tomato. SO SO GOOD!! Especially with their shacksauce! Must try!!

I also had a side order of their fries that I sprinkled with a bunch of pepper and dipped in ketchup, my fave :') I can't wait to visit Vegas again and stop by shack stack and try all the other things on their menu!!",1,0,1

Oh the battle of In-n-Out vs Shake Shack. You already know if you're west coast repping it will be hands down In-n-Out and if you're over from the east coast it's shake shack all day every day. They both definitely have their charm and they both are definitely delicious in their own way.

But back to Shake Shack....

This location is located outside of the New York, New York Hotel, on the corner of Park and Las Vegas Blvd. Parking at New York, New York is first hour free, second hour $7. I think parking at the Monte Carlo next door was cheaper with second hour being $5. The place is always packed as expected. I love the design concept of the place though, big, open windows, wood finishings, very modern, urban design with a huge Shake Shack sign so you can't miss it. They also have huge tvs with sports games on inside.

I highly highly recommend the Shack Stack. It's your average cheeseburger but with a deep fried portobello mushroom in it. It's a game changer. I think what I like about Shake Shack is the buns they use. It's super soft with like the consistency of a Hawaiian roll but they toast it to perfection so you have that crisp outer layer to it too. Everything always tastes fresh and the burgers are oh so juicy. The chick'n burger is not too bad either. It's made with real chicken and has a great flavor to it. The Shake Shack Sauce is a light ketchup flavored mayonnaise. And if you're feeling adventurous, try one of their shakes here, super thick and creamy.

A definite recommend if you've never been.",0,0,0

This place is amazing. Cheesy amazingness. I was blown away by these guys. They offer a mouth watering burger at a very fair price. The toppings were all fresh, and the meat was incredibly juicy and just covered in cheese. It's like a East Coast version of the West Coast In-N-Out Burger. 
The fries were crinkle cut, and fresh. I'd never had fresh crinkle cut, it's always been frozen for me. Yummy. Had their Vanilla shake, which was creamy and delicious. I was amazed to see that they do offer the regular shake flavors, as well as one weird, monthly flavor. This month's flavor was blueberry custard. I wasn't feeling that adventurous at the time... 
There was hardly a wait to get served, and the food didn't take long at all to arrive. The place was clean and well lit. I enjoyed the fact that you could post a selfie from their photo booth and email it to all your jealous friends!

In general, this location is very typical of other eateries along the strip--always busy, loud, and bright. However, we stopped in here twice and they do a very good job of getting the line moving along, even during the lunch rush. 

As far as the food is concerned, there are a variety of burgers to choose from including beef, chicken, and veggie burgers. I decided to go with the smoke shack, which is served with cherry peppers and bacon. Crinkle cut fries and a fair trade coffee shake were also ordered to complete the Shake Shack experience. Overall, the burger and fries were delicious, with the burger patty slightly reminiscent of Steak N Shake, but much thicker and meatier with more flavor to it. The crinkle cut fries were also great but in my opinion could have been a little thicker to give them more flavor. The star of the meal was the coffee milkshake which so far has been the only custard style Ice cream I have truly enjoyed. Perhaps the coffee flavor balances out the twang of the custard that I'm not a huge fan of (probably because I didn't really experience this type of ice cream growing up).

We got the Shackburger and the Roadside burger (which may be seasonal? a new addition?), an order of cheese fries, and their Sin cider. 
+ The Shackburger was basically their classic cheeseburger, and I have to say, I think they do it much better than In-n-Out. 
+ Their Roadside burger was like a cheeseburger with caramelized onions and no veggies; it was okay but I definitely missed the produce. 
+ I love cheese so the cheese fries were a win in my book. 
+ Cider was okay, but was super carbonated IMO. I didn't eat much before lunch, so it definitely hit me a lot harder than it probably should have. 

Any service you got was limited to ordering at the cash register, getting a buzzer, and waiting for your order to be ready at the counter. Very friendly during my visit. 
The restaurant itself looked very modern, and had a mix of both outdoor and indoor seating. 
Bathroom was pretty small. I think there were like two stalls and only one sink. Clean enough.

On our way out, we noticed the line out the door, and was glad we grabbed an early lunch. It was nice that they were handing out tea samples while you waited though (Their peach green tea was pretty sweet though)!

Food:
Over priced 
Bland
Most of the fries were too hard to bite through. Stale. 
The cheese tasted like processed nacho cheese. 
The shake was bland, I didn't even think that was possible. How do you make ice cream not taste good?

The only positive was that the patty serving was bigger than most, but it was a waste because it had no flavor. 

The worst part is that it upset my stomach that evening and it gave my friend food poisoning. She couldn't even get out of bed the next day, except to use the restroom. It ruined the actual good meal that she was going to have the next day at Strip Steak. Shake Shack should ask them how to cook a meal. 

Nobody else in our party liked the food much either. Similar complaints of substandard food and a ridiculous cost. 

Never again. I'll stick with In-N-Out in the future. They know how to make an amazing burger every single time. My wife and I had In-N-Out the next 2 days so we could get the disappointment of Shake Shake out of our minds.",1,1,1

I was honestly teetering between ""A-OK"" or ""Yay! I'm a Fan!""... but it came down to whether or not I was willing to endure the infamous LV strip traffic, driving through continuous construction around NY NY Hotel and Casino, then finding parking (or valet if you hate self-parking), walking through the NY-NY casino to the LV strip facing sector, and then finding Shake Shack itself! It may not be an obstacle for some individuals... but not for this little busy go-getting lady! That is a trek man!!! And this was with a husband who works two casinos down who knew the back-door ways!!! I cannot imagine if I didn't have a person to guide me through the crazy construction that was going on for the new courtyard area that MGM intl. is currently building out. 

As for the food: if you are comparing it to the East Coast Shake Shack, it will DEFINITELY NOT DISAPPOINT! It did not sacrifice it's east coast famous flavor by opening a west coast establishment. I would even risk saying that it is better! They offer alcohol too (which the East coast one we went to did not).

I don't understand what's so great about the cheese crinkle fries.. It was literally just like fries with nacho cheese on top. Definitely not worth the money. 

My BF got the roadside burger which was like a double cheeseburger with grilled onions. It sounded and looked good BUT he didn't enjoy it. He said if he were to get In N Out instead, he would have enjoyed that more. Ha ha I agree!

This is a good place to try at least once in your life. A lot of people are comparing this burger joint to In-n-Out. In my honest opinion, I would go to In-n-Out. However, if you haven't tried this place out, I would suggest you do so. You'll get a different taste, especially if you order the Shake Stack Burger they have on their menu. If you're going to try this place, go all out to see the difference. I don't recommend ordering the plain burger, it's not as flavorful, but though it is cheaper...so weigh your options.

Plan your stay....Line is long depending on the time you come here. Sometimes it goes all the way out of the door and down the stairs. 

Seating is a bit hard to find if there's a lot of people. I suggest having your friends find it while you order. There's inside and outside seating. If you find any free seats, I recommend you just take it for now until you find some place else for you and your friends.

I ordered the Shake Stack Burger and Shack Burger (single). Shake Stack Burger was flavorful and is a big burger. It is filling. The angus meat is juicy with the smoked flavor. It's a bit pricey, but it's worth getting. The Shack Burger, I felt, tasted just like a regular burger with the meat being a little bit more flavored, but not much. 

Fries were ok. They sell the crinkled fries. I, also had the Cheese Fries before too, it was way too cheesy for me. I don't really liked that taste. I personally think In-n-Out fries with their spread is absolutely delicious!! So I guess nothing can compare. LOL.

Haha you could never compare the almighty in n out to anything. As far as Shake shack, the food reminded me of a Wendy's bacon burger but bigger non squar patties and better taste. Only thing that made it different was the cherry peppers and sauce. But watch if u think you'll be like damn this guy is right. I had smoke shack double and fries and wasn't full after, Im literally going order more food bc I wasn't that impressed. Heard so much hype about this spot but it was nothing orgasmic or like made me wanna react like this a miracle of a burger. Mind you this based on what I ate. I didn't try any desserts or anything else. The pricing is way overpriced probably because it's founded in New York. I'm west coast born and raised so I'll always be biast. If I visited New York again I would not go out of my way to go to shake shack, I bet no one has said that yet... That alone should change ur mind. This is suppose to be a New York staple and it was whatever. I spent 15 dollars on a burger, fries, and drinks that alone ruined my appetite. Pricing is mayb more then New York to bc its on the strip. Who knows ..the pricing sucked for what your getting. Don't get me wrong the burger was a bomb ass burger cooked medium well...but damn 9.49 for a double burger...2.95 for freezer fries..2.25 for reg soda that was the size of a water cup.I thought this was suppose to be fast food not a restaurant I don't know what it was but mayb I should of asked for sauces on the side to dip in or customize my burger... Something to make me feel like I didn't get ripped off......... 

Well round two let's see what's up. Hopefully this time it redeems my first experience. Ok round two was ten times better then my first round.

Burger was perfect in size and juicy; bun a soft, yeast bread pillow to soak up the patty grease; toppings fresh, crisp, and plenty how I like it.

Fries had a good crunch for crinkle fries (I'm more familiar with the softer version and don't care for it) and topped with the cheese sauce made it even better.

Concrete didn't live up to expectations though. I ordered a small create your own to share considering everything else we ordered. The menu concretes had too many mix-ins for my taste so I went simple vanilla frozen custard with chocolate truffle cookie dough. The latter was very rich, too rich for me.

A table is quite hard to come by during lunch. A number of us were kind of hovering, surveying the tables, and anxiously waiting for people to leave so we could swoop in. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.

we made it here shortly before closing ~1:45am on a saturday and there was no line. we ordered one of each burger, the shackmeister hot dog, regular fries, and cheese fries to share. they have their own unique names but basically you have the (burger) options of: a hamburger, cheeseburger, cheeseburger w\/cherry peppers + bacon, the shroom burger, and the shroom + cheeseburger combined. burgers have special sauce and all the other stuff you'd expect in a burger (lettuce, tomatoes..). 

the verdict? the meat burgers were solid and delicious, but not uhhhhhmazing. couldn't even taste the special sauce, and pretty small. the surprising favorite of mine is THE SHROOM BURGER. it's this amazingly deep fried pocket filled with a portabello mushroom and oozing Muenster cheese. it's so delicately fried, but packed with lots of flavor, and the mushroom is nice and tender. hands down my favorite burger there. 

the shackmeister dog was nothing extraordinary. tasted like any other hot dog, but with crispy fried shallots at the top. good, but meh. my friends also tried the shackmeister ale and were impressed. as for the fries debate: cheese vs no cheese? i actually preferred the non cheese one because the cheese makes it soggy..HOWEVER, you can also ask for cheese on the side so i'd recommend doing that. best of both worlds. 

service was great even though it was so late at night, lots of seating, beautiful venue with pretty glittery sign. DEFINITELY recommend this place i'm a hardcore in-n-out fan and will stick with their burgers, but the shroom burger is outta this world! we wanted to grab some burgers to bring back home, but the next day, line was loooooong around noon =(

The menu is to the point but damn...all those shakes and malts and stuff looked hella good. But I wanted to focus on the burger first before indulging my sweet tooth and of course, I failed once I got to the counter. 

I ordered a single Shake Shack burger just as my starter and asked ""what is the best shake on the menu."" The cashier offered the black & white...vanilla milk shake with fudge! oohhhh wiii! and yes, I caved in and added it to my order. I was sooo close to getting them cheese fries too.

I have to say, that is a really great tasting burger! Not as sloppy and big as In N Out, but it was fresh and meat was lean and juicy and that cheese melted so beautifully on top of that patty. 

The black n white shake was deeee licious! Thick and creamy, the fudge was a nice touch to the vanilla. The fudge wasn't over powering in taste either.

It sounds so good since this is the only location on closest to the west coast. The burgers are pretty good! There's nothing really special about it but compared to In N Out, they have better options than just a regular hamburger or cheeseburger. The bun isn't toasted either which is why In N Out seems better. The patty was pretty juicy in the SmokeShack (the one with bacon) and it did have a kick to it. Definitely something different and nicer for a fast food burger place. The inside looks so nice and they have a separate window for just shakes and ice cream so you don't have to wait in the line. 

But hands down, the shakes are a lot better than In N Out. Try Black&White or Neapolitan shake. Another thing that I thought was good was the Jackpot concrete (frozen custard with Belgian waffle pieces, strawberry purée, and sprinkles). They definitely have better ice cream that's worth a try!!

It seems very fitting that NY-originated Shake Shack has come to Vegas and settled in New York New York. You can see the bright glittering sign and storefront right off of Las Vegas Blvd. You queue up outside, go through switchbacks inside, order, get a pager to know when your order is ready, and find your own seat either indoors or outdoors. I had the original when I was in NY, so I was eager for the bf to try it.

I got the same burger as last time -- a single size ShackBurger, which is just a cheeseburger, for $5.19. Bf tried ordering the hamburger, double size, but I think the server misheard and instead put down a double ShackBurger with bacon, which was $7.99 + $1.55 (for the bacon add-on). Due to the long line and the crowds of people, we didn't bother adjusting the order.

Food came in a reasonable amount of time. We scooped a booth table (score!) and waited probably 10ish minutes. Bf digged the food, especially the potato bun, which is apparently an East Coast thing. Bacon was nice and crisp, so we didn't feel completely gypped by the almost $2 cost for the add-on that we didn't really want. The burgers, however, were on the small size and the price was high for the size you receive. Our order of fries ($2.95) came hot and very crisp--love it! We also ordered the jackpot concrete. The description sounded good (vanilla custard, Belgian waffles, strawberry puree, marshmallow sauce, and rainbow sprinkles), but the presentation not so much. Not worth the $5. I'd say, stick with a shake.

Juicy, flavorful, fresh. The burger itself was outstanding, the bun was soft and just the right size, special sauce was, well, special!

The fact that we dont even have shake shack in the bay makes it really hard to compare a burger that cost 3x more money. 

I was in Vegas EDC weekend and decided to check out. The first thing that caught my eye was the prices. It is a lot more expensive for fast casual dining. at $10 per burger alone its pretty steep. I got the mushroom burger. The burger was a little bit bigger than In n out. Inside the mushroom was stuff cheese which i didn't know. It was awesome. I wish more places would cook the bun from the inside so its nice and crunchy and will hold its composure more. 

There are a lot of better tasting burgers than In N out, but it still can't beat its value. SS was awesome but $16 meal is pretty steep. I will def make my way back her when i come back to vegas tho.",8,4,8

Don't judge me, lol) and am so glad I finally did! This location is such in a prime spot on the strip, right on the corner, connected to New York New York. I ordered the Shackburger, pretty standard as I typically like to get the original of a restaurant's speciality for the first meal at that restaurant. I got the fries (which were crinkle!) and I HAD to get a shake...I mean it's SHAKE Shack. I had to! I chose the Mud Pie Shake, which was a seasonal flavor. 

My first thought of my burger when I looked at it was 'wow, it's so mini'. To be honest, I expected it to be more sizable, especially for the price you pay. But I suppose it was the perfect size for me since I was able to pretty much finish that, all my fries, and also drink my shake. 

The burger: The bread was so memorable. Perfect amount of sponginess and bounce. Not dry and airy. It was nice and dense. And moist. The bread is the first thing I think of when I think of the burger. The meat was fresh and tasted like an actual burger (well, duh lmao) but the meat tasted real. My burger came with lettuce, tomato, and Shacksauce, though I was a little sad to see that there were no onions. The hamburger comes with onions, though! But for some reason the other burgers do not. I'm assuming it's because all the other burgers come other ingredients like mushrooms, Shacksauce while the hamburger does not.

The fries: I am always so excited to see crinkle fries on the menu. But I can never find good crinkle fries. Maybe I just don't go to the right places, but the crinkle fries I usually have aren't very good- they're dry and too soft and often get soggy by the end of my meal. But the ones from Shakeshack were the complete opposite. Nice and crispy, firm, did not go soggy. Fave crinkle fries so far.

The milkshake: it was nice and thick, but not so thick to the point where my eyes would be bulging out because I could not suck it up the straw. It was  creamy and sweet and perfect with my meal.

Honestly, I've been craving another Shackburger ever since I left Vegas and am quite sad I'll have to wait until I visit SoCal or Vegas again. Until next time, Shake Shack :)",4,0,1

ALL was delicious. For me, I LOVED the Shack Burger, simple standard burger but the taste and flavor was a punch in the face. So delicious!!! From that moment on, anything else I tried was just, meh. The Chick 'n Shack was a little too rich and heavy for me. I probably wouldn't order the Shack-Cago Dog again because too many flavors were mixed together. The Cheese Fries a definite 2 orders next time. My husband really enjoyed the Smoke Shack, because he liked the spiciness. Wouldn't get the shakes but the concretes are a new texture I haven't experienced. Thicker and almost gummier in texture but all delicious! All in all a great meal!

Went today (10\/7\/15) with a buddy, ordered 2 burgers and fries. His came correct, mine came plain (absolutely naked). Went back up front and they kindly remade it. When I finally bite in it was... blah. Poorly dressed (almost no sauce). Fries were unremarkable freezer type crinkle cut. Based on that it would get 2 stars. 

But about 3 hours later I got chills and nausea. Called my buddy and he said ... dude I think I'm sick, I feel warm and sick to my stomach.

They got three of the most popular burger chains all within one mile of each other. In n Out, White Castle, and the incredible SHAKE SHACK. I didn't really expect too much besides a good burger. I've heard the comparisons to In n Out but I knew better than to compare and to take it as its own beast. Now I'm from LA, so In n Out is my thing but DAAAMMNNNNN. Not gonna lie we were blown away. 
Ok first, we were trying to not be fat, so we decided to share. We fixed that later. We started with a smokeshack double, cheese fries, a coke, and a vanilla shake (Our idea of not being fat). 
So first and foremost; the cheese fries are off the hook! I know it's just cheese and fries but they were bomb. My 5' girlfriend demanded her own cheese fries next time. 
The vanilla shake was really good, and the fact that they only use sugar and milk products without any corn syrup makes it that much better. 
Now the smokeshack double was good, however it came with peppers and that really affects the taste of the burger. So while it was good, I felt I didn't get a fair chance to really experience the flavor of their burger. So after we finished what we already ordered we did the fat thing and went back to get a shack burger with lettuce and tomato. And man, that's where it's at. They have different variations but I believe the original is the best. I'm coming back tomorrow. No lie. If they weren't already about to close when we left I would've gone back again tonight! Super bomb. And I didn't even know until we left but my girlfriend informed me that they only use grass fed certified Angus for their patties. That's just a bonus for me because I'll be back regardless. Good job east coast. Good job.
Oh and the service was impeccable. But it wasn't busy when we went so I'm not sure how they handle the rush.",3,2,2

Since I've been on a low carb diet, I wasn't able to enjoy the full shake shack experience. I know, poor me. Anyways, I ordered the smoke shack protein style (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun). Well first off, they messed up on my order and gave me a regular burger with the bun. We told them about it and they fixed the order. I ended up getting a burger that was semi-wrapped in lettuce so everytime I took a bite, stuff fell out. It was annoying.

My girlfriend told me when she visited the one in New York she felt as if In and Out was still far superior than Shake Shack.  I was in town for an entire week for SEMA and decided to pop into Shake Shack for a quick lunch.

I love a goo burger as much as the next person but this place really disappointed me.  I paid a little under $20 for lousy food.  Literally I had very high expectations but came out more disappointed than anything else.  I ordered the SmokeShack double, cheese fries and a malted black and white shake.

SmokeShack- 2\/5, it wasn't good at all.  Super salty burger, only the pepper gives it a nice flare but really nothing special at all.  The meat tasted dry and uneventful.

Cheese Fries- 3\/5, it wasn't bad, just very oily, so oily, between two people we ddi not finish them.  

Malted Shake (Black and White)- 1\/5, this was just bad.  It tasted like blended chocolate milk.  This is probably the worst shake I've ever had at a place known for their 'shakes'.  Very small potion for a very high price as well.

Although this place is very hyped up, when I went there was no line, walked right in, ordered, got my food in 6-7 minutes and left fairly disappointed a few minutes later.  Would I come back?  No.

Had the double Shake Shack straight off the menu, no adders.  Took a bit for the order to come up, but they were busy and I don't mind waiting for quality, heck they even give you a buzzer so you know when your order's up, genius.

What stands out the most was how the melted american cheese formed a shell around the two patties, I honestly wondered the entire time I was eating how they did that.  You could tell the meat wasn't just ground beef -- come to find out its a mixture of brisket, short rib, and sirloin.  It takes great deal of pride and confidence in your burger to go that bold, and it pays off big.  This joint gains a great deal of respect from me for doing that.

The shack sauce was reminiscent of the animal sauce from In and Out, but a bit thinner, and I liked that -- not so mayonnaisey.

I tried Shake Shack once before, but I wanted to try again one more time before I can give a comparison. This location is located inside New York New York. I heard and read about the long lines here, but both times, I have been lucky and there was minimal lines. The employees here try very hard to move everyone along so the lines here move fairly quickly. 

I have tried here the Shake burger (which is their normal hamburger with tomatoes, lettuce, onion, and cheese), fries (which are crinkle cut), cheese fries and vanilla shake. I have to give Shake Shack the edge (BARELY) on the burger and fries. The burger is delicious and tasty, with all the ingredients and meat tasting so fresh. The fries are crispy and oh so tasty. But, I am going to give it up to In N out for their animal fries (their version of cheese fries) and the shake. The cheese fries at Shake Shack tasted a little bland. It was pretty much the crinkle cut fries with cheese melted on it. Nothing special. The shake was also a bit of a let down. There was just nothing special about it. I had figured for the price I paid for it (which was a little more expensive than In N Out), it would be amazing. 

So, bottom line, which do I like better??? I don't know!! I think both places are good, with certain items being better at each restaurant. I am sure I will change my mind each time on which is better.  For the time being, I am going to be happy knowing there are 2 fast food places that are so good and tasty.",19,12,16

The price for any double-patty is about $9-10. My boyfriend said a single is pretty small and won't fill me up, so I got the shake stack.
I honestly don't think the beef patty was all that special in terms of taste. Yeah, the quality of beef may be fresh, but meh. 
-The mushroom was good! Nice little crunch from the breading, and it goes well with the cheese that's melted inside the mushroom. I would probably suggest getting the mushroom on its own, instead of a shake stack. The mushroom patty sort of loses its shine when eaten with the beef. 
-Most memorable part of the burger was the sauce. It's just right, not too heavy like innout's thousand island spread. Maybe cause it's more of an aioli. 
-Lastly, I love the buns on these, because they're so soft. It's a personal preference. I'm not sure what it is, but it reminds me of potato buns\/bread. 
Shake: I got the shake of the week: mudpie. 2\/5 stars. I don't like chocolate all that much, but I LOVE mudpie ice cream. Sadly, it tasted nothing like it. It was very sweet, and completely lacked coffee flavor. This (expensive) shake tasted like a milk-chocolate milkshake-reminded me a lot of Nestle milk chocolate, but in a thick milkshake form! Was it bad? No, it's just not what a mudpie is suppose to taste like. 

Overall Thoughts: 
-If youre in Vegas and want a good burger, I suggest spending an extra 5 bucks (14-15$) at Gordan Ramey's ""BURGR"" in Planet Hollywood. Yes, it's a little more expensive, but it's also bigger. But more importantly, you definitely taste the difference in flavor and quality of the patty!!
-Many people compare this to innout and I don't think you can really compare the two. But if I had to choose with pricing excluded, strictly cheeseburger to cheeseburger, I'd pick innout. The seasoning on innout's patty is just so darn good and more complex. I feel like a shake shack burger can be emulated with some quality ground beef and some fresh cracked salt and pepper for the natural beef taste. It's good, but not exciting.",2,1,0

In N Out cooks their patties in a different style than Shake Shack making the flavors of the burgers entirely different. The burgers itself are smaller in comparison so minus 1 star for that and the service was average. This location has great seating and the restaurant is clean and beautiful.

I personally enjoyed my shroom burger very much and I enjoyed the taste of the fried portobello meatiness in every bite of my burger. It was juicy and cheese brought everything together. The patty is fresh and not greasy at all however it does takes more than one burger to get full. They even have a peanut butter burger!

I have been wanting to go to Shake Shack for a pretty long time, and finally, we got to go. We just arrived in LV from SD today, and for a late dinner we decided to go to Shake Shack. We went on Christmas Eve night around 9:30 and they were open. Also it was nice because there weren't as much as people I thought there would be. I ordered the single burger, cheese fries, and a strawberry shake. 
The single burger honestly tasted a bit disappointing. I'm a fan of In-N-Out and their cheeseburger is way better. Shake Shack's burger have buns that look very greasy and taste very mushy and heavy. That really was a downfall for the burger, I prefer the light and slightly toasted buns, like the In-N-Out ones. However, the fries and shakes were amazing! The cheese fries were just perfect! Crispy and cheesy goodness. My brother got the vanilla shake, and it was good but the strawberry was better. Definitely like the shakes better here than In-N-Out. 
Now the service was not so great. The guy that was taking our orders looked nice, but he messed up our orders... At first I wanted whipped cream on my shake,then after finding out you had to pay extra for it, I asked for it to be taken out, but at the end they still put whip on my shake and had to pay for it. Also we wanted 2 double burgers and 2 singles, but he charged and gave us 3 double burgers and 1 single burger. Literally the employee confirmed our order by saying 2 doubles and 2 singles, but still charged and gave us 3 doubles. I feel like he intentionally did that to us because we looked like foreigners. (We are Asian) Well anyways I did enjoy most of the food, but not sure if I would get the single burger again.",0,0,0

A tab for a family of four was $51. Shake Shack was super packed on a Sunday night, and Strip walkers found no cool refuge inside. Instead, temperatures inside the restaurant were sweltering. Maybe the A\/C was out of order?

SHROOM BURGER ($6.99): A fried portobello mushroom with an overload of melty cheese inside. Comes with lettuce and tomato. The mushroom was kind of chewy at times. 3\/5

CHEESE FRIES ($3.99): Crinkle cut fries topped with a thin cheese sauce. I think I'd like the fries better without the cheese sauce. 3.5\/5

SHACK ATTACK ($4.59): Chocolate custard goodness with brownie bites thrown in the mix. Delightful. A single serving is more than enough for two people. 4\/5

I think if it was cooler inside and the cashier was friendlier, I probably would have given Shake Shack four stars. Their second location in DT Summerlin has much friendlier employees (and A\/C!).

You can get a Double-Double combo for about $6 bucks at In-N-Out while a Double Shack Burger is $8 bucks a la carte. 

I ordered the Shack Stack which is the cheeseburger with the cheese stuffed mushroom all in one. $10 bucks. 

Burger was too salty. I couldn't taste the meat due to the giant battered and cheesy stuffed mushroom overpowering the meat. So the meat to cheese to bun ratio was way off in this burger. Does not live up to my expectation of what a $10 dollar burger should taste like.

Girlfriend ordered the double Smoke Shack: Double bacon cheeseburger. $10 bucks.

Burger again was too salty. She got 2 patties so this time the meat to bun ratio was much better. The pickled red peppers with its acidity balanced well with the richness of the melted cheese and bacon. Not a bad burger but not a $10 dollar burger by any means.

Fries: Probably the highlight of the meal. These are crinkle cut fries with just the right amount of crunch on the outside and they are thick enough that you get some chewy potato on the inside. Decent sized portion for $3 bucks.

Summary: Burgers are overpriced by $4 bucks. If you're comparing this to In-N-Out then do yourself a favor and get In-N-Out, you get the same size\/type of burger at the price that it's worth. 

If I was to spend $10 on a burger, then I'd go to Bachi Burger instead. Take notes Shack Shack, Bachi Burger is what a $10 burger should look and taste like.

Burgers are my all time favorite food, so it's extremely disappointing when it's not what it's made out to be. My girlfriend and I came here for lunch on a Monday around 12:30 or so. It was quite busy but the lines were moving fast. We were able to snag a table before a flash flood of people came in. 

The pager I was given for the food buzzed about 10 minutes after I ordered. I thought to myself ""Wow! This place has already impressed me"" Nope, I was wrong. I hand the person behind the counter my pager and she dumps it into a basket with a bunch of other ones. She proceeds to talk to a co-worker, when she finally turns back around she stared at me with a blank face as if I didn't just hand her my transponder. She asked if she could help me, and I'm stunned. I couldn't believe she did all that mindlessly. She takes my receipt and locates my beer and said the food will come out shortly.

15 minutes have gone by since my pager first buzzed and I'm getting quite impatient. I'm standing at the pick up counter at this point and she finally acknowledges my presence. She says ""You've been standing here for a while, what did you need?"" I tell her I'm still waiting for my food and she asks for the receipt. I tell her she took the receipt the first time and crumbled it after I got my beer. She then goes on the accuse me of lying and saying that the receipt was only for the beer. Ridiculous!!! I wish they had name tags, Jesus Christ. I recite my order and she turns around and like magic, my order appeared. 

At this point I'm fuming and don't really have an appetite. But I paid $40 and damn well need to eat it now. I ordered the Smoke Shack for me, Stack Shack for my girlfriend and the Double down fries. The burger is mediocre at best. And the double down fries are pretty plain. Just has nacho cheese drizzled over it with small chunks of bacon on it. The ShackMeister beer also sucks. 

It might just be that I came on an off day, but from what I experienced, it's all hype. Don't believe it. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere for a burger.",6,2,3

The  Service: Saturday lines are SUPER LONG but faster than you think! Friendly + Knowledgeable

Going through the line took 15-20 minutes. I forgot the name of the cashier that helped me, but I remember hearing her speak Japanese to the people before me. She was really nice and was patient with my family's large order. 

Shout out to one of the staff there named Edith for helping us out in the line by answering a lot of the questions we did have and coming to check on us when we ate! My dad used to manage restaurants and all I could hear was him comment on how efficient the staff was and how fast their food was coming out for how many people there were in the large dining room. By the time we finished eating, my mom wanted to order a couple more shroom burgers to take away. For some reason it took longer than it did before and when it came the food burgers felt colder. Before we said anything, Edith showed up! She had them remade and we had it in our hands under 5 minutes. We tried tipping her but she refused and said hospitality's always included. We were all so blown away! My parents are excited to see Shake Shack come to Portland soon! 

Food Quality: drive 4 hours, stand in line, and happily wait for food DELICIOUS 

Burgers to get: everything on the menu 
Burgers we can vouch for because we ate them: shroom, shake stack, chicken, smoke shack
-The shroom and Shake Stack are identical except the Shake Stack has the cheese patty. When you see that it says it has mushrooms, it's not like the mushroom you expect like on a pizza. It's a fried mushroom with melt in your mouth cheese inside. 
-The chicken shack was pretty good too! It has a small spicy kick, but it's a good balance between the lettuce and some sort of their own ranch looking sauce. 
-Smoke shack was the cheese burger with bacon and spicy pepper bits. It had their signature sauce, and it was beyond good. I wish the burgers were bigger given how good they are! 

Also you must try the Cookies & Cream shake alongside some cheese fries! 

Atmosphere: Loud + Exciting 
The dining room's modern and simple in design. Main focus points include the front of the kitchen, huge TV screen wall on the other side of the menu, and table seating everywhere. It's seat-yourself type dining so if you had a big party like we did beware wandering for tables may take a while. If you don't like crowds, I would order take out. 

Pricing: More expensive, but worth it

Among 5 people we ordered: 5 burgers, 1 chicken, 2 shakes, and 3 small soda drinks (which by the way, they give free refills on). We paid like $80 with tax.",0,0,0

As this review is LONG OVERDUE, I'll just summarize the main points:

1.  Located at New York, New York.  Shake Shack is actually located outside the hotel\/casino.  Look for the various signs and arrows to help you find your way to this indigenous NYC establishment.  I walked over from the Luxor and all the signage was extremely helpful.

2.  Indoor and outdoor seating available.

3.  The menu is pretty straight forward:  Burgers, fries, shakes, and drinks.  I ordered a smoke shack burger, fries (crinkle cut), and a lemonade.  My downfall was not ordering a shake.  I must have been out of my mind honestly for failing to have the product synonymous with its name.  Well, I guess there's always a next time (which I'm sure there will be).

4.  The burger was outstanding!!  I first visited SS on a visit to NYC two years ago, and I will say that the food is as good as I remember it to be.  The burger was juicy and well prepared, while the bacon provided that extra goodness of flavor.  It was so delicious!  The fries were pretty awesome too; good portion and very crispy.  

5.  The setting \/ atmosphere is spacious, airy and fun.  The service is efficient and quick.  The staff that helped me at the order counter was friendly but to the point as to keep the line moving.  Incidentally, the line moved at a very decent pace.  I didn't want to wait too long for my food as I observed that the kitchen operated as a well-conditioned machine; everyone has a specific job and all seemed very capable and productive.  The staff in the indoor dining room kept things neat and tidy.

BOTTOM LINE:  The burgers and fries are awesome!  Its cool and convenient to have this NYC eatery in Vegas.  I'll be back....... for a SHAKE!",6,6,6

I think we spend about $35 for 2 burgers (1 ShackBurger & 1 Shack Stack), 2 hot dogs (Shack-cago dog), cheesy fries and a drink! Not bad! We definitely left full! I wanted to try one of the shakes or ice cream but I had no room left! We were stuffed. 

When my husband went to the fast order window to get a drink refill, he received 2 free chicken sandwich coupons! So nice! I wish I remembered the name of the staff member that gave this to us!

   There wasn't much of a wait either night. When entering an employee handed out a readable menu in case you don't want to look at the giant wall menu. I was lucky enough on the first visit to be handed a sample of the custard. I prefer custard over ice cream and it was good. With multiple people taking orders the line moves fast. You are handed a buzzer to let you know when the food is ready and it doesn't take long to get your food. Condiments are located at a couple of stations along with napkins, straws and utensils.
   I had the double shack burger and the shack stack. The burgers themselves are a bit greasy but still flavorful. Both came with shack sauce which is a garlic\/ mayo spread that is just ok but the downfall was the Crisp fried portobello. Filled with Munster and cheddar cheese it is served with a warning that it is hot. To me it has a steamy watery taste when you bite into and ruined the burger. The fries were your basic crinkle cut fries you can find in the freezer section of the local grocery store. I must of had the bottom of the bag as all the fries were broken off pieces and not the thicker meaty pieces. I liked the draught root beer they served. It is made in Louisiana at a brewing company and is one of the best I've tasted. 
  I want to go back and try a shake or a Concrete( like a DQ blizzard). They have a lot of flavors and have a monthly schedule of custards that change weekly. This is something to grab while in the area but not worth going out of your way for. Their prices are high but being on the strip that's expected.",5,0,1

If you're eating dairy, you can get their cheeseburger and cheesy fries! Cheese makes everything taste better. Though, I withheld myself and went for regular fries. 

I also ordered an ice tea, which was unsweetened. I found it very refreshing especially on a hot summery day in Vegas. 

Everything was great! The line moved quickly, the service was speedy, and the restaurant is clean. The ambiance is casual, and they've got real plants around the place.

I remember when Shake Shack first opened and everyone was super super excited. I made sure I came in to try this place out (if you know me, you know my obsession of burgers). The whole interior and exterior design is beautiful. You seriously cannot miss it. The restaurant front is right on the Strip at New York New York. The signage is huge and clear with their outside patio area. Then you get in and everything is super modernized and very attractive. 
Anyway, many people compare Shake Shack with In-N-Out (Shake Shack being the East Coast burger joint, and In N Out being the west side's). First off... 1. In n Out prices are way more affordable. Shake Shake's prices are pretty high for practically mini burgers, and the fries come with so little as well. The size and price dont match up. 2. In n Out's simplicity and their signature sauce is just so original and yummy, Shake Shack is okay...and really salty if you ask me.. 

I dont know, MY OPINION: not a huge fan of Shake Shack. Maybe I came on a bad day and need to give it another try, but as for my first impression, ehhh ill stick to In N Out - the west coast original!!",8,3,2

It's the strip so long lines and a wait are to be expected, but the service at this location is poor. After waiting to place your order, you're still looking at a decent wait to receive your food. I had to wait 30 minutes after I had ordered once just to get two shack burgers and a drink. I understand having to wait a little, but the food should be hot at the very least. More often than not the burger comes out cold and I've had to send it back.  The most recent time I went, which was earlier this week, I had to send my food back twice. The first time the patty was cold and the second time the bun was almost frozen.  They are pretty good about replacing your food quickly though. 

Overall, the quality of the ingredients they use in their food is good, portions are small, price is on the high side, service is poor, burgers seem undercooked, and there are long waits to both place orders and receive food. It's just too much of an inconvenience and too big of a hassle for me to keep going here and I really wouldn't recommend this place until there is improvement in relation to some of the above-mentioned critiques.

I had the 'shroom burger and BF had the shack stack. Both were deeeelicious and we loved the gooey cheese that's baked (fried?) into the mushroom. We also noticed the bun was closed off on one side, so we wondered if that was on purpose to keep the cheese from oozing out the bottom. If so, smart! We also shared an order of cheese fries and a custard. I prefer the fries plain so you can really enjoy the crispness 'cause by the bottom, the fries were too cheesy.

Finally i dont have to fly to New York to have the best East coast burger on the west side. Shake shack man its been 5 years since ive had this place but man one bite and BAM flavor town flash back. This spot is head to head east coast vs west coast in n out many can debate and say but im west coast and this burger is up there; is it better than in n out not gonna say but its def can rival it. Why do i like shake shack, well for starters they have a more flavorful bun, their meat pattys are bigger and more flavorful and all that cheese. Something about this burger also is less greasy than some other places but this is what an all american burger should taste like. Now the fires MmmmMmmm a little crispy nice and add the cheese oh my goodness!! All i can say is im a fan i was a fan when i had it in NY and glad its out here on the west side; sorry in n out but ill be going here more often",0,0,0

Overall:

Eh. If you want a burger this is the place to be. Just do not expect something mind blowing or special.

Parking:

Typical strip parking. Walk, taxi or just park at the Monte Carlo or New York self-parking\/valet. *5 stars*

Establishment: 

Nothing too special about the decor. Service was okay. You order at the counter. I did feel a bit rushed during the order process but nothing to cry about. *3 stars*

Food:

Smokehouse burger: Decent burger with a nice spicy kick nothing mouth burning. *3 stars*

Cookies and cream shake: Again nothing amazing just a decent shake if you are in the mood for one. *3 stars*

Shake of the week (Cookies and cream): Nothing special about this either just a bit rich and creamy. *3 stars*",1,1,1

I love the giant menu upon walking in. I didn't love that there was no menu to reference once you got to the actual register. Set up of the dining area didn't really make sense to me either. There was no clear walkway from between all the stations and tables.

The lady at the register was absolutely lovely. She was helpful and friendly, but I don't know how to say that without making you think of a naive minimum wage high school-er who hasn't had her enthusiastic spirit crushed by customer service yet. This lady was genuinely friendly. Extra star for her.

As for the food itself, I tried the spicy chicken sandwich, the shackburger, the fries, and the strawberry mint lemonade. I loved my spicy chicken sandwich. I think it's way better than the burger. It was actually seasoned and flavored. The burger relied on the shack sauce to save it, but the meat itself was plain. I'm not too big a fan of the buns used, but I did appreciate how it was cut so that the sandwiches kept their form. The fries are just fries, nothing wrong with them. The strawberry mint lemonade was actually too minty for me, but I just mixed in regular lemonade and it was delicious. 

I would definitely be down to get the chicken sandwich again.",0,1,0

This particular location is very open, plenty of seating throughout.  There is plenty on the menu to choose from so your appetite should be satisfied.  I did not try the hot dogs (although it did look tasty) but went with the ""smoke shack"" burger.  This is a cheeseburger with applewood smoked bacon.  It also has cherry peppers to add to the depth of flavor.  I'm not sure what type of bun they use but it goes perfect with it!

I honestly waited until I tried Shake Shack a few times to come to this conclusion. I wanted to make absolute sure that I was not making a mistake. Yes, Shake Shack is more expensive. Value-wise, there is no competition to In-N-Out, but if you don't take into account price, then the burger at Shake Shack tastes better. Simple as that.

The griddled meat is the star of the show, as it should be in any burger. That sear develops a crust that adds so much flavor to the burger itself.

This may be a preposterous and unpopular conclusion as a California kid, but I love Shake Shack. And guess what, I also love In-N-Out. There. I said it. Don't @ me.

I wanted to take my SO here as he's never had Shake Shack before. I've been to the one in NY and remember them mostly for their featured lemonade rather than the food. I wanted his opinion on the infamous debate of in-n-out vs. shake shack. 

Mind you, we had a rough night that spilled into the morning.. I mean it's Vegas.. lol. We get to the register and it's not busy at all. We're looking at the menu trying to decide what to get and I suggest the Cheese Fries but he doesn't give a yes or no answer.. He just kept perusing the menu and as he's looking, the girl at the register makes a comment, ""hey she wants cheese fries, if she asks for it, it means you should get it.."" OR something along those lines.. She didn't say it in a rude way or anything but it was just bad timing and the joke didn't resonate to the SO.. I get that she was trying to connect but it just wasn't going to happen no matter what she said.. 

The SO wasn't feeling it so he stormed out.. He felt it was rude for her to make that comment and also felt he couldn't read the menu in peace. So I continue to order the food and follow him outside.. He was very upset about how the register lady treated him and refused to go back inside.. Although I didn't agree with his perspective of what happened, I have to respect his feelings so I went back to request a refund. I didn't even have to explain the situation, just the fact that the SO was dissatisfied with the service, they not only refund the money, but they gave us extra fries as an apology. I rated them high just for that..

I subtracted a star because I do agree that the comment made was unnecessary, the seasonal lemonade wasn't as good as the one I had in NY and because In-n-Out does win the taste test overall in the end.",0,1,0

Good thing 'cause it isn't worth hours of waiting for this place. 

I like that their menu is simple so you're not bombarded w\/ a bunch of choices, but it's not as simple as In N Out. 

Shack Stack - Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce. I wanted grilled onions instead of regular onions, but they couldn't do that so I settled for adding crispy onions ($1 extra). They're basically the same onions as the Smoke Shack burger. The only thing similar to the original NY shake shack are the buns. The buns are pillowy soft and toasted nicely. Somewhat similar to hawaiian bun texture, but w\/out the sweetness! The patty could've used more flavor for sure, but the portabello mushroom oozing w\/ cheese was good! I was smart this time and waited for it to cool a bit so the cheese wouldn't burn my mouth lol

I was debating custard or concrete and they ran out of their flavor of the week for the custard so I decided to get the concrete. 

All Shook Up Concrete - Vanilla custard w\/ banana PB cheesecake and chocolate toffee. It sounded good, but wasn't worth the price nor cals. In case you're wondering, the concrete is basically like a Mc Flurry, it's a thick frozen yogurt\/ice cream type consistency. The single was pretty small, I would say save your $ and go to Sprinkles at the LINQ Plaza for ice cream.

We finally got to check it out after hearing so much about it... and I'm glad we did. Both of our burgers were cooked perfectly... juicy! The buns are amazing. I'm not sure what buns they use, but woah. Weird, I know... but we both noticed that while eating. 

So to avoid sounding anymore like Sir Mix A Lot... on to the shake! I got a vanilla shake... I honestly thought it'd be a little bigger, in size. But the shake quality and taste was a solid 8 out of 10. 

Shake Shack serves up some crispy crinkle french fries...which we also enjoyed. This serving size is another that I thought would be a little bigger. For the strip, the pricing was less than we though it'd  be. Two burgers, one order of fries and a vanilla shake came up to $21 and some change, not cheap but not horrible either. 

I love the decor! This location is clean and spacious... lots of tvs (mostly showing sports the night that we dined in). They also have a quick window (outside) for drink orders...and outdoor seating. It's best that you pay attention to the menu and know what you want to order while in line so that when you get to the window, you don't waste time. have never been to the Shake Shacks on the east coast, but this one is definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!",2,1,1

Shake Shack in my opinion is a wonderful new edition to the burger scene in Vegas. Its unique enough to not be In n Out and its not too fancy to be a Gordon Ramsay burger. Whoever says this place offers a simple burger is wrong. It is definitely something special. No where else in Vegas can you get such an oozy gooey cheesy burger or a giant portobello stuffed with cheese between two buns. They should honestly rename the burger ""cheesy burger"" but whatevs. I also normally don't like crinkle cut fries because they come out soggy but surprisingly the fries here were quite crispy. The coffee shake I got was good but nothing too spectacular. Only downside I can see if the price. Though it is something different, paying such a high price for this burger, at this portion, is not the best. However, I do recommend that everyone try this once. Its definitely something you don't want to miss out on.",3,1,3

Well, he was pretty much right on his opinion. Not a huge line at mid afternoon, but it was almost to the door inside. Ordering was pretty quick tho. Got the shake burger, with cheese and bacon added. Order of cheese fries, and a drink, not big on shakes, but in hindsight should'a checked one out.

Took almost 20 minutes for my order. Don't have to worry about overeating here, burger, fries, especially the drink (counter fills on all soda, so no self serve, but I did notice they do free refills if you go back to counter) were all on the small side.

Burger tasted good, no real complaints, but I don't think it was anything out of the ordinary. The cheese sauce on the fries at least had a good flavor, but it would have been nice if the sauce had covered all the fries. Fries are frozen crinkle cut, and while they were done good, crispy, they're frozen. I figured a place like this would be doing fresh cut. Soda cup was about 3-4 good swigs. I can appreciate the free refills, but wow, get bigger cups already. Like drinking out of a glorified dixie cup.

STRAWBERRY SHAKE   (3.5\/5)
- knocked off points due to the price & size. INO is better & more worth it

SMOKE SHACK   (4\/5)
- the raw onions were ok. Better if it was w\/ grilled or chopped caramelized onions

SHACK STACK   (4\/5)
- the crisp-fried Portabello mushroom filled with melted cheese was yummy!

HAMBURGER - PROTEIN STYLE   (2\/5)
- Patty seemed a lil tasteless w\/o the ShackSauce (in which I had asked for but didn't get) 
- they don't wrap up the burger but instead they place it on a bed of greens
- green leaf lettuce is good but it doesn't offer the crunch like the iceberg lettuce at INO

SS BUNS   (5\/5)
Shake Shack uses amazing soft buns (Martin's potato roll, toasted in butter) that's hinged to keep the everything in place in prevention of a burger backslide.  Mmmm the butter!!


:: OVERALL ::

The burgers are kinda small. Hence for someone like me I had to eat 2 vs just 1 to get my fill. Taste-wise -- it was pretty good (except the Hamburger). Value-wise -- prices are a bit steep.

I got the Smoke Shake (cheeseburger with bacon and cherry peppers) and cheese fries. My experience was already going off to a bad start before even ordering because I didn't anticipate the prices here would be so hefty. My burger was about $7 and the fries are $3-4 (I forget). Once I got my food, I noticed the portion size...like, these burgers are pretty dang small. I also was expecting a bigger volume of fries, but I appreciated that they weren't drenched in cheese. 

It wasn't all bad though: for the size, the burger was super filling. It's a pretty heavy meal, which can be good or bad depending on what you're into. The meat was flavorful and the cherry peppers were a GREAT addition to the bacon and meat (they weren't that spicy though, which was disappointing). And while I'm not usually a fan of crinkle-cut fries, I did enjoy the crunch factor of the fries and the flavor of the cheese. 

Verdict: In N Out takes the cake for sure. It's cheaper, tastes fresher, and is faster. I think my friends all agreed as well. But Shake Shack wouldn't have such a loyal East Coast following if at least some people didn't find it amazing, so I'd recommend giving it a try at least once to gauge for yourself.

Also, free refills for soda!",3,0,0

I came in on a Saturday afternoon and surprisingly, there was only a few people in front of me in line! Talk about some good timing. It was a little more challenging finding a place to sit but we managed to snag a table in under 5 minutes. Person who served me was super cool and super nice, even when I handed him the wrong amount of money (how embarrassing). I have to say the service here is pretty amazing considering it being just a fast food joint. 

The menu is huge and clean; you can see it once you walk in. I'm a pretty simple person so I opted to get the Shack burger, which is the basic cheeseburger. The burger was pretty good, but I was a bit underwhelmed while eating it. There wasn't anything special about the patty but it was definitely cooked well. What won me over were the cheese fries. I love cheese and I love potatoes. I'm usually not a fan of crinkle-cut fries but holy cow, every ridge of their fries were crunchy and the cheese oozed over it made it 100 times better! Also got a vanilla shake which was delicious.

Overall, I'd come back again but I definitely prefer in-n-out more.",2,1,3

tip: ASK FOR ONIONS!! I love onions and they don't ask so I wasn't aware it was an option.

FINALLY! I got to try the infamous East coast version of In n Out... It was really good, very tasty and surprisingly filling but In n Out has my heart. I also really liked their modern decor and decorating! Very nice.

Shake Shack has a much bigger menu and I would love to try their other items but I went for the simple double party cheeseburger. We also got the cheese fries and regular fries.

The cheese fries were good. My boyfriend said it was too cheesy for his taste but ""too cheesy"" doesn't exist in my world.

The double patty burger looks small but it's quite filling. I love onions in my burger and decided to ask if they had any about half way through, and surprisingly they do! They just don't ask if you would like in your burger (like In n Out does) 

Basically, it's like fancy fast food. Shake Shack is good, but I can't eat it too often like I can with In n Out.",2,1,1

So, another east coast company tries to get a taste of the west coast just like 5 Guys. According to a few news sources, this Shake Shack location is making way more than their Times Square location. I consider it a positive thing because Shake Shack has definitely left a mark on the Las Vegas strip. 

What I heard through the grape vine is that it's better than 
In N Out but I disagree. In N Out in my opinion is still the best when it comes to burgers and fries. I ordered a double cheeseburger with regular fries, to be honest it's just average in my opinion. Maybe I'm not a burger enthusiast but I still side with the food at In N Out.

I saw the pictures and read the amazing reviews and now it was finally my turn to partake and man, it did not disappoint.

Let me just weigh in on the great burger war I've seen going on in the reviews... my favorite quick serve burger is from the Habit.  But that doesn't mean I can't love and appreciate another burger.  So just because you enjoy one, you don't have to trash another.  It's not a Sophie's choice here.  It's a burger.  That being said, Shake Shack is friggin delicious.

The line is usually long, but don't let that deter you, it moves quickly.  The server who took my order was super friendly and answered all my newbie questions.  I went with a standard shack burger fries and a drink.  First time, you need to make sure the core menu items can stand up.

After about a 10 minute wait, the order was up.  And yes, it looked as delicious as all the pictures people take.  Is there any better combination than meat and cheese?  Besides Penn and Teller, I think not.

Forget the look, the taste was amazing.  Moist and every single element was bursting with flavor.  Their secret sauce is a nice touch as well.  If I had to compare, I would say it's kind of similar to Smashburger with the overall type of burger it is, yet the flavors are definitely distinct.

I'm glad there isn't a shake shack closer to me... this could become a problem.  A delicious problem.  

Honestly, the strip is loaded with burger joints - some casual and others super fancy, but you'll be hardpressed to find a tastier burger.  Can't wait to go back.",1,2,1

Price: Shake Shack is definitely up there when it comes to fast food joints. Think Fat Burger prices, but maybe not quite as steep. 2 Smokeshacks, 1 cheese fries, and a 16oz Shackmeister ale came out to about $25. Meh.

Burger: The Smokeshacks we ordered came with bacon and cherry peppers. The peppers really added a great deal of flavor and they were a nice touch. I wish the cheese fries had them! The meat had a nice char and was good overall. It's about the same size as an In n Out burger.. but that's where the similarities end for me. The bun was soft and yellow, and looked much like a potato bread bun to me. Good overall, but not sure it's worth the ~$6 price tag.

Cheese fries: Crinkle cut fries tasted like the frozen kind you can fry up at home. The cheese sauce was too salty and just made the whole thing turn into a cheesy mashed potato-like dish. Wasn't too big of a fan and didn't really care for it. The dinky little popsicle stick-ish fork wasn't the most efficient eating utensil either...

Shackmeister ale: Ok so I wasn't expecting anything spectacular but since we were here, I wanted to try their house beer! Brewed by Brooklyn Brewing, it popped up on my Untappd as a pale ale... uhhh no. It didn't taste anything like a pale ale, or at least what we're more familiar with on the west coast. It tasted like a light lager. Boyfriend said it reminded him of Dos Equis... Take that as you will. Wouldn't order it again.

The line: It wraps around inside, but when we got here around 3pm on a Friday, it reached just to the front door. The wait was about 15 minutes or so to the front counter where we placed our order. The wait for food was maybe another 10 minutes.

The service: They mess up orders here. A lot. The table behind us had their orders messed up from what we overheard, and they messed our order up as well. I had originally ordered the 32oz Shackmeister ale to share w\/ the bf... but the server rang me up for the 16oz one, despite him verbally repeating my order to me and me, again, clarifying with him that I wanted the 32 oz. What'd we get? The 16 oz. (It's okay though--he actually ended up saving us bc the beer wasn't good anyway). And I'm not sure if it was intentional, but they also gave us 2 cheese fries, instead of the 1 we ordered. Were they making up for the other 16oz of beer that they didn't give us? Idk. But it worked to our advantage so whatevers. 2 cheese fries it is. Too bad the fries were too salty and mushy & we didn't even finish them anyway.

I get skeptical so I was keeping my expectations low on this one.  So we got there around lunchtime and I was pretty hungry because I had skipped breakfast that morning.  I ordered the The Smokeshack which had peppers and bacon some fries and a concrete thing called the Shack Attack.

The burger was ok.  Nothing special.  I read some of the other 5 star reviews and everyone seems to compare it to In N Out so I too will compare it to In N Out.  I personally think the burgers at In N Out are better.  The burger that I got at Shake Shack was very underwhelming.  It was tiny for the price and the patty just wasnt all that.  

The fries were fries.  I love the fact that they were crinkle cut fries, but flavor wise, nothing special.  I still think the fries at Mcdonalds is the absolute best and if you think my review is tainted because of that comment, SCREW YOU!  Just kidding =)

Lastly, the concrete thing I ordered.  It was called the Shack Attack and it contained the following:

Chocolate custard, fudge sauce, chocolate truffle cookie dough and Mast Brothers Shake Shack dark chocolate chunks, topped with chocolate sprinkles'

Sounds good right?  It was ok.  The problem was that it was already melting by the time my buzzer went off.

My favorite is the Smoke Stack!!! Oh hello cherry peppers!! Mmm mm good. This is not your typical burger joint, these guys don't fit into a cookie cutter category and if you've had Shake Shack you know what I mean. Each burger is made of 100% Natural Angus beef and served on a non-GMO potato roll. You can ask for your choice of lettuce, tomato, pickles and onion and I believe there's no up charge. With that I always get their famous crinkle cut fries with cheese. Ohhh mah gaw, shut the front door! These fries make my heart sing, literally my heart screams with such love and hate as it may not be the healthiest choice but it's darn tasty!! Excuse me while I wipe away my drool...

And I'm back...

Customer Service is so good, too! Those working at the counters aren't rude or rushing to take your order like other like establishments. 

The Shackmeister Ale is also a tasty one which is brewed by Brooklyn Brewery.

We tried Shack Stack, a cheeseburger with batter-fried portobello mushroom and ShackSauce, which was pretty good.

However, the regular ShackBurger was pretty boring, and the fries were less than average.

We took the nice patio seating and it was one of the best locations to have a quick bite, I must admit.",1,0,1

Shake shack is definitely GOOD... The food is fresh, juicy and really rich. I got the shack stack which includes a fried portobello mushroom (that seemed to also be infused with cheese) and it was DELICIOUS.... Their hamburger buns are unique. They're really moist and fresh. The meat patties are bigger than In-n-out's. I will say the burgers are really small for the price. This place is PRICEY for what you get.  The shack stack was $9 something and it's about the size of an in-n-out burger. 

The concretes are good but aren't really that crazy or special like they're hyped up to be IMO. I got the chocolate with Belgian waffle bits. It was crazy rich and sweet. And dense. And melted fast. 

The cheese fries are soo good... I don't normally like crinkle cut but I liked these--probably because they were smothered in cheese.

Overall, I'd say:
Really good but too expensive 
Burgers are much oilier than in-n-outs 
Service was good. Place was clean and lively 

We got 2 shack stacks, 2 cheese fries, 1 chocolate shake and 1 chocolate concrete with Belgian waffle bits and it was $40.",0,0,0

Crinkle cut fries are better here than the fries at In 'n Out - got it with cheese on the side for an extra $1.  I didn't get a shake, but my friends did and I had a sip.  The chocolate taste more like a cross between a milk and dark chocolate, so it wasn't too sweet, nor was it too thick.  It was actually pretty good.

It's been a really long time since I've eaten at In-N-Out in Las Vegas because I would always rather eat a burger at Shake Shack. The first time I ever ate here, I tried the SmokeShack, which is basically a bacon cheeseburger. It was sooo good! However, every other time that I've been here, I always order the 'Shroom Burger and I can't get enough of it. Instead of a hamburger patty, they use a fried portobello mushroom that is filled with cheese. I don't know why, but it hits the spot every single time. The fries have the perfect amount of crunch and are really good whether or not they are topped with cheese. Another great thing is that there is a ""no bun"" option for the health-conscious people who want to indulge in a burger, but want to skip the carbs. Last, but not least, get a shake! They are delicious and perfect during the summer when its extremely hot outside. I've tried the strawberry, coffee and cookies & cream shakes and have not been disappointed.",1,0,0

According to the statistics, Americans eat 3 burgers a week, that's a total of 50 billion burgers a year. That's right, fifty billion. 

Why are Americans so obsessed with a hamburger patty between two buns? Well, you don't have to go far to figure this out. Just read through the reviews on yelp or articles naming the 10 best burger places. The single common denominator is there is no one reason, everyone has their own opinion as to why or how they prefer their burger. 

As for me, I've had my share of burgers. I may not eat the average 3 burgers a week, but I know what I like, similar to the billions of burger consumers out there in this world. 

Which brings me to Shake Shack. Since this New York burger joint has gone public, there has been a lot more buzz surrounding it's burgers. They serve more than just burgers, such as hot dogs, but their core business is burgers. They also have some pretty good shakes I hear made with custard ice cream. 

Their only location on the west is Las Vegas, but I hear they plan to expand into the LA market in 2016. Fortunately, I happen to be in Vegas for my brother's wedding and took the opportunity to see if this was a burger I would be willing to add to my burger diet. 

First thing I noticed when I walked into the Shack was how many offerings they had on the menu. In addition to their burger options, there was a section for shakes and custard ice cream, as well as alcohol which included beer and wine. 

I wasn't interested in the other distractions, I was focused on their burgers. I ordered the double with cheese. This comes with two decent size patties, tomato, one leaf of lettuce, soft bun, and their shack sauce. Onions are not included. 

The size of the patties caught me off guard. They were bigger than I expected and a bit greasy. The paper for which the burger was wrapped in was soaked in grease. The patties had a nice outer crust. The shack sauce was nowhere to be found. I couldn't tell you whether or not I liked it because the flavor was missing. I did like the soft bun, but would have preferred it toasted. All in all, I thought the burger was okay, but a bit pricey. 

The fries were good. I like the wrinkle shape and it the crispiness. They also have a cheese add on option. 

I'm not sure if they offer refills on the drinks as there weren't any self serve drink stations. 

For burger, fries, and small drink, it costs $14. This definitely isn't something I would eat on a regular basis given it's price point, but something I would eat occasionally.",2,2,2

Ordered the single stack, cheese fries, soda and a custard cup.  First off, don't compare it to In n Out.  They are both great in their own right.  I would compare Shake Shack to Super Duper Burger in San Francisco.  The patty was very good. Seared nice and juicy.  The highlight was the bun.  I believe it is a potato bun.  It is awesome  and just a moist bun, nothing I had before.  The burger is pretty small and I was thinking I should have gotten the double patty but I think I had my fill of calories.  That is why it reminds me of Super Duper Burgers.

The cheese fries were great.  As good as Nathan's cheese fries.  The custard was great.  Almost as good as Luv-it Custard.  The odd thing is that sodas are single serving and not the soda fountain.

Usually these places are overhyped and ends with a disappointed me, but not here. Fiancé and I each got a Shack Burger with regular fries (gotta start with the classics on the first visit) and we also split the Shack-Cago dog (Chicago style hot dog... took us a minute to figure that out). The cheeseburgers were so good! Meat, buns, and veggies are all super fresh and juicy. Nice thick cuts of pickles, onions, and tomato so it's got a nice crunch factor. The fries are crinkly cut, thick and crispy, just how I like them. We could've passed on the hot dog. It had relish, onions, a long pickle spear and little baby chili peppers. I love me some original Chicago dogs from Chi-town, but this didn't really do it for me. We also got a chocolate shake, which we will pass on next time too. It's just a shake, no big deal. 

A lot of people compare this to In-n-Out, but it's like comparing apples to oranges. Yes, the're just cheeseburgers, but different IMO. My loyalty will always be with In-n-Out, but Shake Shack is a very close contender. Can't wait to come back. 

Tip: We got here on a Saturday right at 11 when they open and there was already a line outside the door. We were lucky enough to grab a table (one of us stayed in line while the other grabbed a table), but people after us weren't so lucky so make sure to get here early!

I came on my first day Monday, July 6. It was pouring rain and super windy outside as we arrived. Inside the place, it was dripping in areas from the rain. I ordered the Smoke Shack single with Fries and a Rootbeer on draft. Smoke Shack has to be requested to get lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles on it. If you forgot to mention or ask about that, you'll just get the meat, cheese, bacon, special sauce, cherry peppers n buns. The fries are so fresh and crispy cooked just right! The Rootbeer, I didn't like. It tasted flat so I had to return it and get another soft beverage. I tried a taste of their peach lemonade, it was way too tart. I went with Coke, to be on the safe bet. 


The following day, I went on Tuesday July 7. No rain, no leaking roofs this visit. It looked like things were back to normal. I figured to order a double this time (Smoke Shack Double), cheesy fries, and their desert. The double was waaayyyy too much for me, I was better off with the one patty, took me forever to finish it and it tasted less cheesy with double the meat and veggies. The cheesy fries we're soo delicious, I wanted to get more but was getting full from my double cheeseburger, and wanted to save room for ice cream custard. 

For desert, ordered two different ones to try. My favorite was the white one (All Shook Up), as the other (Jackpot) was too sweet with the strawberry syrup. I would order just the concrete (custard) all those other flavors were making it less creamy and complicated for my taste buds as I didn't think the mixings blended really good together. 

Oh yes, this place is constantly busy. It will die down for maybe 5-10 mins and the line quickly gets packed again. They do really well for seating though, because a lot of the people just eat and leave. They give you buzzers, and so you grab your food when it goes off.

food: I ordered the smoke shack burger, fries, and a Coke. the burger itself was okay. I didn't realize that the burger doesn't come with lettuce and tomato until I received my food. I think the smoke shack burger is good, but not great. I think if they added lettuce and tomato it would've tasted better. it was too greasy\/salty for my liking. yes, I'm aware that bacon can be salty but it was a little too much. the fries were golden and crispy. the shake shack sauce is good, but I like in n out better. I tried the milkshakes that my friends ordered and it was delicious~ I definitely wanna give it a try again when I'm back in Vegas. 

service: there was a bit of a wait when I went. it was a Sunday afternoon during lunch hour. ordering was easy. cashiers were nice and friendly. the only problem was finding a place to sit. there were no tables available for my party and I to eat, unless it was outside but it was cold. we had to wait for people to finish eating and ask if we can have their tables afterwards. 

price: decent, not bad. probably spent around $20 for two burgers, drinks, and fries.",0,0,0

I ordered the smoke stack and a coffee shake. My husband ordered a shack burger with cheese a Chicago dog and we split the loaded fries. My issue: the topping on the smoke shack and the loaded fries were the same and I had a cherry pepper overdose. Being from Indiana (the capital of the vomit inducing White Castle-originators of the crinkle cut fry) I am not obsessed with crinkle fries since they are common place. The burger was ok, nothing special for me. However, the coffee shake was amazing and I felt like a pretend New Yorker with an ice cream coffee product.

It's located at New York New York facing Las Vegas Blvd. You cross the Brooklyn Bridge to get to it. It's a nice spot. Has indoor and outdoor seating.

I tried the Shake Shack burger and cheese fries. The cheese is your typical nacho cheese, good but the fries are good alone as well. The burger was a good size. Not too overwhelming and messy. I'd say it's a close second in my book to In-n-Out. I would definitely eat there again next visit.",1,0,0

I have been to a few locations in NYC and this location in Vegas produces the same quality of food!  It is also very spacious unlike the locations I have been to in New York.  My order came out fast and hot when I was there.    

Everything about the burger is good.  The meat is cooked well and has great flavor.  The toppings are fresh and the cheese is melty.  The potato bun is soft and fluffy.  I love it all.  There is nothing too special about the fries but they are good and come out hot.  The shakes are to die for too.  I love the black and white shake which is a combination between vanilla and chocolate.  I also highly recommend the peanut butter chocolate shake as well - great peanut butter flavor.

Our group tried the ShackBurgers, hot dogs, cheese fries, chocolate shake, and the ""All Shook Up"" concrete.  All super tasty (hence the reason for 2 visits).

Combine those two directives, and one is prone to end up at Shake Shack on the Strip sooner or later while in The City of Sin.

Unbeknownst to me ahead of time, Shake Shack is evidently the ""In N Out of the East"", or so they say.  Probably a good thing they didn't have that bar set for them ahead of my visit, as In N Out holds a VERY special place in my heart (likely literally as much as figuratively).  

We showed up on a mild Friday night to a line about 15 deep, and it moved pretty quick.  The food menu is quite a bit more broad than In N Out (or at least not as secretive?), and there are a LOT of beverages and ice-creamy desserts on offer.  

I grabbed a Smoke Shack burger and a Coffee Fair Shake.  The burger was very, very good.  It is very close to being on-par with In N Out's offering.  There was awesome flavor coming from the burger as a whole, but I definitely want to call out the bacon on this one - it was distinct and flavorful, and really added a smoky layer of punch to the sandwich.  The shake was tasty as well.  Props go out for the different, funky shake flavors!

My brother-in-law was gracious enough to offer me one or two (okay, maybe a handful) of his cheese fries, which combine American and cheddar cheeses, and are as addictive as advertised.  At least that's the excuse I provided my brother-in-law for my heavy-handed 
""share"" of fries...

I'm willing to say that the East Coast definitely has a hit on its hands with this joint.  So much so that I'm glad one isn't in my hometown, as I could see myself visiting here WAAAAAY too often!",2,2,2

With your soggy buns and gloopy shakes, you consistently find ways to disappoint me. I've been to both the Shake Shack next to Central Park and in Citi Field. This one is probably the worst. It's a serviceable burger, but nothing more than that. This burger right now only has nostalgia purposes. Even the shakes don't taste like custard. When a black and white shake tastes like a slightly upgraded Oreo Mcflurry, you know this isn't where you want to be eating. There's a Burger Bar here, and honestly, I might as grab a White Castle slider if I'm feeling like remembering the good times in New York. Otherwise, I'd head across the way for some delicious In n Out. The two best things I can mention about this place are: the water mister outside and the scenes of New York on their panoramic display screen. And if you think them serving east coast beer is good, remember that most east coast beers (especially NY breweries) aren't very good when compared to their western brethren.",0,0,0
