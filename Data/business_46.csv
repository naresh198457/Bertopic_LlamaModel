Underneath the trained smiles to pacify you they don't do much to fix anything. Spent A lot of money on a Penthouse loft and the room was horrible, wall paper were peeling off in the bathroom and the carpet was wet. They say someone overflowed the bathtub and flooded the place. At least fix the problem before the next guess. So the apologized and invited me back this year to make up for the problem, great right that is a good move until they check me into an suite that had dog urine on the carpet, and they moved me to a lower floor but took them over a day to move me and did not tell me how long it would take we will call you when its ready, 5 calls and 3 visits to the front desk the room was ready at 3 pm the next day waisted the whole day for these people. Too many incidents to be a 4 Diamonds.... I don't think so",0,0,0

Pretty much loved the Vdara. We were here for 3 nights

I thought the $30 early check in fee was a bit over the top but oh well.

The location is more or less perfect. Right next to Aria tucked behind Cosmo (short 5 min walk), connected by tram to crystals, bellagio and monte carlo, you betcha.

Our room, Executive Corner Suite. Super clean, A\/C broken callled service line, fixed in 20 minutes! Amazing service here. Room was sweet, great view of strip, nice extra 1\/2 bath for our guests, full kitchen. We honestly saved a lot of money stying here as we stocked our full kitchen and ate breakfast and lunch daily pretty much.

Our house attendant was awesome, again just really great service. 

The pool is nice and the Market Cafe was very convenient, great prices there too especially on sparkling.

I'm looking forward to our next visit",4,0,1

Pros:
- Beautiful new hotel. Everything is clean and top notch. The décor is very chic and trendy.
- The rooms are all suites, therefore it's like having your own mini apartment. This is nice if you had to stay here for awhile. You have your kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and living room.
- Beds are extremely comfy. As soon as you hit the pillow you are asleep (or maybe that is from all the late night adventures :-)
- Overall the staff is very friendly.
- The gym is awesome! Tons of cardio and weight machines, as well as free weights and yoga mats.

Cons:
- They did not have any restaurants. They only place you could eat was the Market Café, which is not that impressive. Not to mention it is only open for breakfast and lunch. There is no place (other than room service) that is open for dinner.
- It is far away from everything (except the Aria & Bellagio). You defiantly have to walk a bit to get to the other casinos.
- It does not have a casino
- It's extremely hard to get a taxi. Each time I needed one, I had to wait at least 20 minutes each time. 
- The cleaning service was not good. They left a mess in my room, a mess that I did not originally make.

Guess after re-reading my review, I would give it two stars. When you think of the endless amount of hotels they have in Vegas, this does not compare to half of them.",5,0,0

Everything was a lot smaller than expected, from the room to the amenities at the hotel (pool, gym, etc.) to the hotel itself. There is not much going on here, so I would avoid this place if you are looking for a fun Vegas experience. They are also nickel and dime you - everything at the hotel is extremely overpriced and they didn't honor the promotion I signed up (fortunately Expedia stood behind it even though the hotel itself wouldn't). On a positive note, you can find a solid, clean room a very good rate and it is very convenient to other hotels worth hanging out at.",1,0,1

The rooms are GORGEOUS. I recently had the opportunity to stay in the Corner Suite, and it exceeded my expectations. The room featured an unparalleled strip view of the Bellagio fountains, a full kitchen with dining table\/stove\/dishwasher, a washer\/dryer, a huge living room, an incredibly comfortable bed, a large soaking tub, and a really nice vanity area.
I will say that if you are here for pleasure, navigating around the strip can be a little tricky due to an odd location and unmarked pedestrian entrances. And reception at the front desk is hit or miss. My last check-in agent was pretty rude when I asked for a late check-out, and essentially told me that nobody at the hotel could help me. Other than that, I really like this hotel and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",1,0,0

The front desk was not being helpful nor apologized. I highly recommend anyone to stay away from this place.

There is no parking lot to self park, you must park at the Aria or Bellagio. Valet parking for this place should be included, it's $18 a night with resort fees on top of that for 5 days, it's kind of crazy.

The first night we were in our room staff just walked in without knocking (we had a city view corner suite) We requested an extra blanket and pillows, housekeeping just walked right in without knocking or ringing the bell.. About 3 hours later that night we had another incident, house keeping walked into our room because someone had ordered them to clean up our room (we never called housekeeping other than when we requested blankets) my partner was walking around in his boxers and again, housekeeping just decided to walk into our room. The room is quite large so I am not sure how far they had walked in before I heard them talking. As you can imagine I felt uncomfortable knowing that someone may walk into our room at any minute for the remainder of the stay. Head of housekeeping called to apologize but we still felt that it was a privacy violation.

The next night we ordered room service since it was a bit of a hassle to get back to our car and or take the tram, when our food arrived the room service attendant dropped some of soup on the floor, of course she cleaned it up, but again, not what we are paying for.

The parking situation, we had to use a key card to get in and out of the Vdara, at least 3 times our card did not work. When we checked into the hotel the hospitality staff at the front desk did not ask for our parking ticket to include it on the key card so we can get in and out of the parking lot. Thankfully Aria parking lot staff was helpful and advised us how to make our lives easier with the parking situation.

I do not think we will ever be staying at the Vdara again. I have stayed at many hotels \/ suites in Vegas over the part 10 years and this was the first time I was unhappy with our stay.

The rooms were enjoyable overall, it was a nice and quiet place to be away from the hustle and bustle of the casinos but the service should be addressed.

Definitely not staying here again.",0,2,0

So much value for what you pay. You basically get a small apartment with an awesome little kitchen. Very tranquil compared to a lot of other places in Vegas, but still very close to everything. (It's right behind The Cosmopolitan.) 

Their room service took pity on me when I had waited 2hrs for a failed GrubHub order to arrive. They had a DELICIOUS veggie burger with TONS of avocado on it to me within like 10 minutes. 

Their bartender was so nice to me as well - she told me to just ""make up a drink"" when I couldn't pick from the menu. 

A hotel that gives you lots of avocado, the exact cocktail I want and free wifi just gets me - you know? Plus I think they allow dogs!

It was $155.23 a night through hotels.com, not including tax recovery charges + service fees.

POSITIVES:
- Clean shampoo-like smell when you enter the hotel. Simply delightful.
- Modern, clean hotel facilities. High-class all around.
- Easy to navigate.
- TWO 42-inch flat-screen TVs that were back to back. One facing the king bed, one facing the sofa bed. Yes, they work at the same time.
- Free WiFi, no login, seemed pretty fast.
- Gorgeous bathroom with a sliding door that is so quiet, great for sleeping guests.
- Motorized window blinds and shades that you can operate by pressing some wall buttons.
- Stellar window view
- No plastic housekeeping door hangers. Inside the room, you press a button by the side of the door which indicates ""Do not disturb"" or the other requesting service. On the outside of the room, a circle is lit in different colors by your door accordingly.
- No worrying about being bothered by noisy neighbors. So quiet as you sleep.
- Staff service attitude was pleasant - very polite and professional.
- Mannerly valet service. When you call them to bring the car around, they bring it out pronto. No wait time.

NEGATIVES:
- Parking is costly. $18 for 24-hr valet (I forget the other hourly amounts). Vdara doesn't have its own parking lot so you have to find a spot at the neighboring Aria or Bellagio's parking lots with a 10 minute walking distance they said. $10 for self-parking at the Aria. Might as well valet...
- No pots\/pans\/plates\/utensils in the kitchen. You may request for plates and utensils though.
- No coffee machine in the room.
- The fridge, which was super tiny, didn't seem cold at all. No freezer.
- Sofa bed had no bedding and pillows in the room. You had to request for it. Called them once and they said they'll bring it up. Waited almost at least an hour before calling again and they came promptly and set it up.
- The TVs are glitchy. Turn them on, try to change the options to TV\/Movies\/Music, and in a few seconds, the TV screen turns pitch black as if it were asleep\/hibernating. Turn off, turn on, try the same thing and it goes to sleep. I FINALLY realized that I have to press the remote control buttons that are labeled ""Movies,"" ""Shows,"" and ""Music"" or whatever they said. The most user-unfriendly TV ever. No instruction manual or anything explaining this.
- Room temperature doesn't seem to cool down fast enough.
- Bathroom vent near the toilet area is weaksauce. No vent switch either.
- Was rudely awoken at 3-4 a.m. by a hotel staff member asking us if we ordered food. NO. Why wasn't the room number confirmed ahead of time?! This is unacceptable.
- Spa was broken on the day we wanted to use it.
- Housekeeping staff knocked on our door at 11 a.m. as we were about to leave and said she'll come back in 15 minutes. When we returned around 3 p.m., she was still there and needed 10 more minutes...so we sat on chairs because the sheets were wet from the spray she used on it.
- The housekeeping lady was charging her cell phone on top of one of our serving plates, not on the counter. Ew? Disgusting.

We complained to the management and got our resort fees waived. Since they were willing to work with their guests and make the customer happy, I am leaving them a positive review. The Vdara has the potential to be an extraordinary hotel.",3,0,2

Because it's not overly crowded and doesn't smell like cigarettes. The lobby area is smaller than most hotels, but it didn't take away from the modern and clean feel that the hotel exudes.

The check-in was painless and quick. When we got into our room, it was spacious and very clean. The only negative thing I have to say about this hotel is that their bath tubs are really small and uncomfortable. I would've preferred a comfier bathroom. The toilet was placed across from the shower and it seemed cramped. I didn't like the set up.

The plus is that it's connected to other casinos through a bridge walkway and located near the middle of the strip; so it's close to everything. The wifi here is free and the connection is not as bad as other hotels. I would recommend staying here if you want a clean, smoke-free hotel, but if you're looking for a party-like atmosphere then you're better off at another place.",7,1,1

Over the past year I have always been a huge customer advocate for the Vdara and told my friends and business associates that if they are traveling to Vegas your hotel should the their destination of choice.
 
However over the last couple of months, my customer experience has been less than stellar and I will no longer frequent your hotel during my Las Vegas business trips. Here is a summary of my experiences and how they have effected by decision.
 
In speaking with my business counter part, who stays as frequently at Caesars as I do at the Vdara, he is upgraded with each visit to either a higher floor or larger room. In addition he is always thanked for his loyal patronage and told how much they appreciate his continued business. On my most recent stay (March 2 - March 5) when I checked in, I explained to the employee that many of my previous room charges had not credited to my MLife Account. She said she would look them up for me and when she accessed my file she said ""Boy, you stay here a lot"" and then gave me a card with a phone number to cal for assistance with my issue. No, thank you for your loyalty Mr Harris or I am so sorry for this inconvenience Mr Harris; just I cant help you but here is a card with a number to call. Stellar service.
 
During my previous stay in February I left two iPhone chargers in the room and asked during my current visit if they could be in a lost and found. The front desk employee was very nice and called the department for in that morning, but then found out that it did not open until 11 AM. She said that she would follow up and call me on my mobile phone with an answer. To this date I still have not heard from anyone, so I will assume nothing was turned in or there was no follow up from the employee.
 
I was also quite shocked on Tuesday morning when I went to the Fitness Center to find out it was under construction. A nice employee at the Spa said that I could use the Aria Fitness center at no charge if I showed by room key, but as it was 49 degrees that morning and I was wearing shorts and a T-shirt that was not ideal. When I asked where the Fitness Center was located in the Aria she said that I could ask the Door Man for directions when I arrived. Really?? Should this not have been something that the front desk notified me of when checking in? Should there not have been some map provided to me at check in with this information? Why was I paying a daily resort fee of $30+ a day and not have use of a fitness center? Lovely.
 
To your credit, the Valet team are amazing. When I arrive each time they always say "" Welcome Back Mr Harris"" even though they have not seen me for two to three weeks. Perhaps this is because I have a bright orange car or because I am a big tipper, but they are the only ones who treated me like a loyal and valuable customer. I would recommend whoever manages that department is promoted to manage the front desk for a better overall customer experience.
 
So now I have a Total Rewards Card and have booked my first room at Caesars next week. I realize that I will be starting over again with a new program, but I am looking for a company to recognize my loyalty and thank me for my patronage. Somehow your hotel seems to have lost that focus and for that, I am truly disappointed.",5,0,0

My bf and I are locals and he had surprised me with tickets to see Britney at Planet Hollywood for my birthday, but had waited last minute to book us a hotel for the night after the show. Around 5:30pm we went on the app MyVegas to see if there were any good deals on rooms for the night. Although Vdara was posted for a little more than he wanted to spend ($79 thru MyVegas), we discovered it was way cheaper than calling to book where the same room was priced at $248. We booked through MyVegas and checked in around 7pm. When we got to the front desk, we casually mentioned that we had plans to go to the Britney show since it was my birthday and our front desk guy, Dylan, immediately said, ""Since we are celebrating a special occasion, let me see what I can do for you."" Moments later he had upgraded us from their typical room to their 2 Bedroom Hospitality Suite on the 46th floor! The room was incredible! Two huge bedrooms, the master tucked away within its own quarters. 2.5 baths, a living area complete with seating for 6+ and a full sized kitchen with an electric flat-topped stove, oven, dishwasher, fridge & freezer, wine cooler, cabinets, and even a washer and dryer!

Pros: 
Beautiful architecture
Non-smoking
Large heated pool\/hot tub

Here's what happened with me. Vdara guarantees that they'll check you in at 3PM latest. I arrive at 2PM and ask if I can check in early but they inform me that my room was still being cleaned and say they'll call me. I lounge by the pool and wait til 3 but still no call. So I go down and ask about my room. Still being cleaned. I wait til 3:45 and that's when I go to the desk for a third time and I finally have them switch me to another room...which is promptly snapped up by another guest so they have to find yet another room for me which they finally do. After all that, I receive no apologies and of course no compensation. Some guarantee.

So I'm fuming when I arrive at my room. I paid $50 extra for a ""fountain view"" and stupid me thought it meant I could watch Bellagio's fountain show. Well I could....if I pressed my face against the glass and craned my neck, which rewards me with view of 1\/3 of the pool. I plod back down to the check in counter, ask them about the whole fiasco but am told firmly that it is truly the fountain view. I contemplate changing to another room but at that point, I was a broken woman so I just went back upstairs (after flashing my hotel car at the elevator bouncer for the 5th time) and watched a Say Yes to the Dress marathon.

There is complimentary valet parking - the staff varies and some do not look happy even when given money. And when it gets busy, they drive in a way that looks like they're one inch away from a car accident. I tipped $2 every time I wanted my car (normally I would walk but I was with family members that couldn't walk that far or fast) so I think I spent at least $12 on parking alone.

The final ""F You"" to me by this hotel was the room itself. You think it being new and all, it would be clean and nice. HAHAHAHA NOPE. The sofa was creaky and very worn and dirty looking like it had been around for decades. And there was a huge, dangerous crack in the glass wall of the shower that would cut you if you accidentally brushed against it. 

Overall I just did not have a fun time at Vdara.",4,1,0

-First of all, there is no self park and to even FIND the location was a task for us Vdara newbs. We drove around and around in circles after missing the tiny sign 3 times lol. On top of that, a very unhelpful lady on the driveway told us self parking was on las vegas blvd all the while never glancing at us and playing on her phone the whole time. So not knowing that she meant the Aria self parking we drove around again until we self googled and realized there is NO SELF PARKING! Only comped valet!

But the experience with the valet service ruined the entire stay at Vdara. Sure it looks like they hustle to get your car, uses the sir and ma'am, and open the car doors for you as they should. But thats the easy stuff. The challenges of your job come when problems arise and how you deal with it. 

We waited TWO hours for them to find our car. TWO hours!!! That is the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard. An hour of patiently waiting went by before we confronted the manager about the wait only to hear, ""It's really busy, your car will turn up soon."" ARE YOU FLIPPIN' KIDDING ME!?! What kind of manager are you!?! Our friends who were with us got their cars 45 min ago and thats the answer you gave me? It took them TWO hours of us waiting before saying that ""We lost your car.""

They were so much more concerned about getting their tips they kept putting us off. They should have had at least one guy keep looking until they found it or came to the conclusion that it was lost and do something about it then. That determination wouldn't have taken 2 hours. We saw the same guy who was suppose to be looking for our car come back and forth with other people's car. Tips.. All he was concerned about. Learn something about customer service. And you might want to send that manager to management training.

The hotel is beautiful: very modern, sleek design, beautifully decorated inside. And no casino means no lingering cigarette odors.

The room is really nice. King size bed, pull-out sofabed, a kitchenette with a fridge, microwave, even countertop burners (the hotel will provide pots and pans if asked). The bathroom is almost as big as the room itself. It has both a large bathtub and a standing shower.

The pool is small and pretty standard. There are several cabanas that can be reserved ahead of time, but there are plenty of lounge chairs for everyone's use. 

What knocks my rating down for Vdara are small things which I think a high end hotel such as this one should be able to fix easily. No iPod dock and poor lighting in the rest of the room other than the bathroom. The fridge was not cold enough even though it was set to high: we had to keep our drinks cold in an ice bath. The showerhead had absolutely no pressure. And while the queen size bed was extremely comfortable, the pull-out bed was probably the worst pull-out bed I have had the misfortune of sleeping on. No pull-out bed is comfortable, but this was just bad. Saggy in the middle, and the wire springs poked EVERYWHERE. Sleeping on the floor may have been a better option.

The mandatory $20 resort fee covers free wi-fi in the rooms, use of the pool, and complimentary water bottles each day, among other things. Items\/services requested from housekeeping takes a while to get to your room, but it doesn't mean they're ignoring you: it's because with so many guests, they're usually bombarded with requests, so be patient.

Vdara is conveniently connected to the Bellagio via an overheard walkway, and a tram connects Vdara\/Bellagio with Aria and Crystals mall, as well as Monte Carlo hotel.

Despite its shortcomings, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",0,0,0

1. The sofa bed was broken. We found at about 8 PM. It was never fixed. On the plus side, the hotel gave us another room while they are trying to fix the problem. However, the time that it took them to fix the problem (and the lack of initiative from the management) was disappointing. We had to call several times.

2. The new room has broken bed (on the left side). The support was broken.

3. There was a half-eaten open ice cream in the freezer (seriously?)

4. They compensated us one night. So, the bill was rather low (the only reason that this is a 2-star review).

Other than that, the hotel is modern. The view is awesome and it is relatively clean. I will give Vdara a try in the future. Hopefully, I can upgrade this review.",4,1,1

This hotel is actually pretty good compared to most Vegas hotels. I normally stay at slightly-lower tier hotels like Paris or Flamingo, but for some reason during the weekend of Feb 16-18, rates here were cheaper than those hotels.

Everyone here was friendly- from the valet and bell carrier outside, the woman (Amanda) at the front desk, the baggage carrier inside, to the room service- I had no problems or second-thoughts tipping them.

The room itself was very nice. As their lowest tiered room (the Deluxe Suite), it is very nicely done with a kitchenette, queen-size sofa bed in addition to the king-size bed, and a nicely done bathroom, I was very pleased with everything about this room except one thing.

The only problem I had with the room was the connectivity panel for the TV. My friends and I were trying to play music from our iPods through the speaker system on the TV via USB, but for some reason, the TV wasn't reading the iPod, even after having gone through the instruction on the TV on how to access the connectivity panel. We were also disappointed with the music system in the room. There was an alarm clock with and AUX attachment, but the sound quality was poor. I expected something better when other hotels offer sound systems with built-in iPod docks that sound better.

I normally don't even bother with hotel amenities other than the pool, but this time I used the fitness center. Free for resort guests, their gym is actually pretty nice. The weightlifting area is pretty small with only two benches, but there were hardly any people there in the first place, except for this one guy. He gave me a weird feeling, and he would randomly sing parts of whatever song he was listening to on his headphones. I can't be too sure, but I think he was also giving me a look. Having had the weird feeling, I avoided eye contact altogether. All I could do was look at my friend who instantly knew what I was thinking.

Overall, this hotel is great. The sound system was just something minor, but I had no problem with everything else.",2,3,1

This room could easily fit more than four people since our room had a king size bed and a pull out couch. This place is also CLEAN, a very important factor in my stay. No, its not the most convenient place to stay since you have to walk through other hotels in the strip but I think it all depends on what kind of person you are and what kind of noise level you're looking for.

I just called to book my transportation and was told that last year, since at the time of the booked, this service was not available, they cannot provide it to me. I find it amazing that after spending close to $1400 for 2 nights in their hotel, Vdara cannot so much as offer a ride from the airport. There are so many establishments, with STELLAR service that goes above and beyond. If you can stay anywhere else, do.

This being my first (but not the only!) trip to Las Vegas, rest assured I will be coming back and hands down, Vdara will be THE PLACE I'll stay. I can't think of a better hotel that offers non-gaming and non-smoking to its guests.

Pulled infront and was quickly greeted by a valet for hotel parking. Theres a massive metal structure outside that reminded me of a transformer, this blew my mind and made me very excited to see what i had instore. This hotel sits across the the aria, is not directly on the las vegas strip which made it the perfect place to relax away from the hustle and bustle of las vegas. This hotel has no casino but a lovely bar, eatery, spa, gym, and starbucks Inside. The decor is super artsy and modern with alot of wood on the walls making is a little darker with beautiful chandeliers. This place was fancy! The strip was easy to access, and easy to get away from.

My boyfriend did an amazing job in choosing our Vdara suite. It was unvelievable! This was the nicest hotel experience ever. The setup was studio like, a one bedroom design making you feel at home the second you walk in. The room comes with AC like every hotel in las vegas. Let me help you paint a picture. Walking from the front door your welcomed by a beautiful kitchen with a sink, pantry, fridge, cooktop, and a lovely dining area for 4. Take 10 paces from there you walk into a large living room area with a pull out queen size sofa bed, table, 2 lounge chairs, desk, and flatscreen tv hanging on a built in wall divider. Take 8 paces to the left you are now in the bedroom with a large king size bed with the coziest bedding with two bedside tables, his and hers lamps mounted above head and another flat screen mounted on the other side of the room divider. Open the large screen like sliding door with frosted glass next to the closet and you have an extravagent spa-like bathoom with a soaking tub, standing shower room enclosed in glass, toilet and sink with backlit vanity mirrors. Did I mention the amazing panoramic views through their expansive picture windows (amazing at night with all the vegas lighting), they even came with its own mechanical shade system! Allowing you to control the amount of light you wanted to allow into the room. Housekeeping kept the room stocked with towels and toiletries. The staff were all very freindly and helpful. I didn't want to leave this hotel, I wanted to live there.

The fridge, if I remember, was filled with drinks, and you were not allowed to put things in there because there was some weight system that indicated whether you took out a drink or not.  So in other words, you cannot use the fridge even to put your leftovers.

Room was spacious and the pool was nice.  Yes, there is a reflection bouncing off of Aria during a big chunk of the afternoon.  I would suggest swimming in the morning to beat the crowds and for a quiet setting.  Plus, the pool gets murkier in the afternoon...if you know what I mean.

You really can't ask for a more convenient location minus the premium pricing.  You're a small walk from Aria, City Center and the Cosmopolitan.  The hotel lobby connects you to a passageway to the Bellagio and to the tram that connects you to the west MGM properties.  We ended up just valeting our car once and walked during our entire stay there.

The market pantry is very convenient.  It's got foods to take back up to your room, frozen foods for that microwave in your room,  offers coffee, pastries and a fulfilling breakfast.  The oatmeal and omelettes were perfect for my wife and me just before checking out.  You can dine in the pantry as an alternative to breakfast buffets.

I had not been to Las Vegas since the City Center was built, so it was amazing to see all the new buildings that sprouted up.  The Vdara is located behind the City Center and off to the backside of the Bellagio.  The hotel itself is modern.  I stayed in a Deluxe suite (read: cheapest room) but there was still a view of the Bellagio fountains.  It has a kitchenette, living room and king sized bed.  The bedroom is not truly separate, but there is a wall unit that divides the space for some privacy.  The nightstands had a funky design, but I think that caused it to keep sliding open, especially once you put something in there.  The room was clean and the cleaning staff did a good job cleaning it daily.  There is a button by the door to signal if you want privacy or the room clean, no more door tags!  

Getting around the strip does require some walking.  There is a convenient walkway between the Vdara lobby and the Bellagio tower.  You need to factor in time when walking from the hotel to the strip.  There may be other ways to get around, but that was the most convenient (and air conditioned!).  

The pool area is pretty small compared to most other Vegas strip hotels.  Don't pick this hotel if the pool is important to you.  I didn't witness the Death Ray, I went at 9am to avoid it.  The chairs had umbrellas near by, so there was some shade--I can't say whether the Death Ray would penetrate them.  The fitness area was nice, but they didn't have cleaning wipes for the equipment.

Check out was easy.  There is the $20 resort fee each day which gets you use of the facilities or 2 very expensive bottles of water in your mini-fridge.  More water is in the fitness center.

Pros:
- Centrally located to just about every other Strip property. The Bellagio is adjacent and easy to get to, and Planet Hollywood\/Caesars\/Paris\/Cosmopolitan are all within a 10 minute walk.
- The cafe downstairs serves decent food, including grab to go options, at reasonable prices.
- You can get from the front door to your room elevator in about 30 seconds, unlike just about every other Strip property where you have to navigate the casino for several minutes. (Vdara has no casino.)
- Uber and Lyft pickup is conveniently in the main valet area, which itself is next the registration desk area. (Some hotels put these all in different places.) UberX to\/from airport was about $12.
- Security checks that you have a key when you go to the elevator, so it's pretty safe.
- Rooms are larger than standard hotel rooms (but don't think suite means much more spacious than a large hotel room).
- View of the Bellagio fountain (for the rooms that face that way) is better than a lot of Bellagio rooms.
- Plenty of outlets near the bed.
- Awesome light thing at the door to signal do not disturb or housekeeping needed. This should exist at every hotel.
- Valets are very quick.
- Sometimes had to wait for an elevator at peak times but usually not much of a wait.
- Business center is near registration and packages were in my hand within an hour of delivery - again unlike other Strip properties where you had to trek through miles of hallways to retrieve it.
- Quiet, business like hotel - not a more typical rowdy Vegas place.

Cons:
- The booking website is confusing about the different kinds of rooms. There must be twenty different combinations of view, suite, and size with undescriptive names, and although I've booked a dozen times I always struggle with figuring out which is what.
- The path to the Strip could be more direct. You can get to the Cosmo very easily but the sidewalk is then blocked off to further down to the Strip. So you have to navigate through the Cosmo, or go a different indirect route via the Bellagio, to get to the Strip. It's frustrating because it's a straight shot down the street but you have to walk in traffic to do it.
- No coffee maker in room.
- The shower head is not adjustable and is set for someone over 6 feet tall. I'm shorter than that so have to sort of press against the wall.
- I'm MLife Platinum and have gotten very inconsistent stuff for that. Sometimes I get the resort fee waived without needing to ask, sometimes I have to ask and get it waived, and sometimes I ask and don't get it. I've stopped asking the front desk what platinums have access to because they never know. Other properties are now giving platinums a letter with this info at check in but I've never gotten it at the Vdara.

Fixing those cons would make the Vdara perfect but I still rate it 4 out of 5 and it's my go to Vegas stay.",0,0,0

Positives:
Rooms were nice and modern with a great view.
Bathroom had a huge, soaking tub.
Convenient location, close to many restaurants and shops.
Starbucks inside near the lobby!
They are dog friendly (I later found out) and even have a dog park on the premises.

Negatives:
The pool was just too small and boring.
The market restaurant near the lobby had the worst customer service and wait time ever.",2,0,1

Booked a two night stay at a regular suite and upon checking in, was upgraded by the nice gentleman working to a corner suite room. What a gorgeous room it was. Though the room lacked a big living room, it had a kitchen, washer\/dryer, fridge, microwave, king sized bed with queen size fold out in the living room. and a nice sized restroom with window views all around. Definitely one of the better hotels in Vegas I've stayed at and I've stayed at most of the hotels on the strip. If you're looking for a quiet upscale hotel that's cigarette free, stay at Vdara!

This was my first visit to Vdara, and I left largely impressed. Very nice, new hotel in a convenient location that enables you to walk to a lot of places. That's good because when you stay here, you will need to walk to a lot of places. 

On the plus side: 

No casino - means you skip long walks from the reception to the elevator towers.

Great rooms - had a regular suite, which rocked...two tvs, mini-kitchen, sitting area, bedroom, big bathroom. My suite had a great view of the Bellagio fountain, which I would recommend requesting versus the view of the pool.

On the minus side:

Very limited food choices on-site. Expect to go off-campus for anything more than snacks or a simple lunch. We did eat one meal at the pool-side cafe, which was good, but it's tough to mess up a breakfast burrito. Good news is you can walk next door to either Cosmopolitan, Bellagio or Aria and be surrounded with great restaurants. Very easy to get to these other locales. 

Small pool. For a hotel of this size, the pool is small. We were still able to find seats at the pool at 10am on a Saturday, which as most of you know is next to impossible at the party hotels. That being said, the reason we were able to find seats is this is NOT a party pool. Good crowd, not too old, not too many kids, but not a party pool.  But the pool is functional and you can get some good sun and chill. 

The ""death ray."" This is not fantasy. There really is a death ray at the pool. Seriously, for about a 30-minute period sometime between 1pm and 2pm when the sun reflects just right off the glass walls of the hotel, it's like a laser burning you. We saw heat waves off the umbrellas and heard them literally sizzling. However, it only lasts a short while and the pool has rules about the sun umbrellas needing to be up until after 2pm. So don't worry about it and stay under the umbrellas, unless you want to be the next rotisserie chicken...

All in all, I think Vdara is perhaps one of the best values on the strip for location, newness, and the rooms. Fantastic rooms. Just plan your pool parties and meals accordingly and you'll have a great time.",1,0,0

Seemed like a smoking deal, but after taxes and fees from Piceline - it came to $94.  Then the hotel tacks on a resort fee - of course.  All of this is to be expected, just a friendly 'buyer beware.'

Pros: 
- Located close to Aria and Cosmo (shows, food, gambling, etc.)
- Great rooms with kitchenettes (think of Vdara as the Residence Inn of City Center)
-Well decorated

Cons:
-Not the best value in the star range if you don't need the kitchenette.  I'd reccommend 'THE HOTEL' or one of the Towers (Planet Holleywood Towers, Hard Rock Towers, etc.)
-See below...

When I checked in I was given a handicap room without being told it was one (which I didn't appreciate).  My room featured a huge stain in the middle of the carpet and a shower door that allowed water to leak out even when shut completely.  I reported the shower issue, they sent engineering up, but the problem remained.

So when checking out I very calmly (really) showed the manager a video of the water streaming out under the shower door and expressed my interest in making sure no one else had to deal with this.  She was mildly apologetic and offered to waive the daily resort fee.  I negotiated a $50 credit at the cafe and called it a day.

So in my opinion, not the best customer service (at least for escalations or issues).  I am pretty easy and travel a lot.  So every once and awhile I get to deal with issues.  The manager on duty got a C- in my book.  I was so polite, friendly, fact-based, etc. - and got offered a free resort credit.  Kind of disappointed!",1,2,0

Check-in\/Check out was quick, organized and easy. Stayed in a deluxe suite, which was large enough for 2 people. There is a small kitchenette that includes a fridge and a stovetop.

Pool area is fairly small, but still nice. The bar\/cabanas were closed for winter. Not a lot in terms of dining at the Vdara. You can get food at the lobby bar. There's also a small market and a Starbucks in the hotel. But for any real dining, you are better off going to the Aria next door.

Vdara is part of the MGM conglomerate, which includes Aria, Bellagio, MGM Grand, etc. So, entertainment and dining across those properties is easily put on the room bill. We had a $50 food and drink credit-- and they wound up comping our food at Julian Serrano next door in the Aria--which came to about $65.

Parking is really easy, should you have a car. Valet is free and quick.

I've stayed here twice, each stay 4+ days. 

I simply love this hotel. It is non smoking, no casino, not many children, and just fresh, clean, and spacious. Both stays were for edc so the city and vdara were well prepared for the huge number of travelers. 

The rooms are all suites so that increases the square footage for your stay... if you're staying longer than 2-3 days, you'll love the extra space, especially in the room and bathrooms which are huge. Awesome kitchen area with 4 seats and a table to hang out, buy food, heat up left overs etc. We bought food and drinks and chilled after we got home from edc at 7am... so it's just super convenient.

Automatic shades are bomb. Bed is comfy, bathroom is clean, spacious, modern. Staff has always been nice towards me and helpful. The free gym is sufficient and the pool is on the smaller side but this is a boutique'ish hotel, so if you want day parties head to another casino. 

Speaking of casinos... everyone knows Asians have gambling problems so not having a casino downstairs really saved me (and my friends\/family)money my last two times here. My first time in Vegas I loss badly.

Once you walk in, you're greeted by a non smoking lobby that smells BEAUTIFUL. Literally, I love the smell of this place. I went to cosmopolitan and it was horrible... cigarette smoke fighting with the hotels scent and the underground'ish valet area with car fumes.

The cafe is actually pretty good and not that overpriced, you're not completely off the strip, but it's still new vegas. Friendly servers there. Valet is pretty good but I assume they hired extra for edc weekend. 

Overall, I will probably always stay here when I goto Vegas.",1,0,0

Every staff member we encountered was on top of their game and a did a great job of making us feel welcomed and appreciated.

One of the best things about this hotel is that when you walk in, you aren't slapped in the face with the smell of cigarettes.  Why?  Because it's a non-smoking hotel.  It's also a non-gambling hotel which means it's quiet when you walk in.  Ahhhh.  

For me, the goodness mostly ends there.  The pool leaves A LOT to be desired.  The dining options are EXTREMELY limited and the restroom (inside the room itself), couldn't be any closer to the bed if the designers tried.

The room was larger than most standard Vegas rooms (except for The Palazzo, ahem) because it also boasts a small kitchen which can be useful, I guess.  The living room area was small and the couch was very uncomfortable.  Actually, the bedroom and living room are basically just one big room with a TV wall unit separating the two.  

The biggest plus for the room was that the bed was super comfortable.  And like I mentioned earlier, I have to take away points for the location of the restroom.  Forget the fact that it has one of those frosted glass doors so if you go in there in the middle of the night, the bedroom still gets illuminated if you turn on the light in the bathroom.  Dumb design. Oh, the decorators also need a little schooling on blackout shades because what they had in these rooms certainly did not fit the bill.  Sure they made the room darkER, but that's about it.  There was no blackout to be found.

Overall, it was a pretty hotel in a great location with great access to the Bellagio, but I can't say that I would ever choose to stay there in the future.

All the rooms are suites with a kitchenette, dining room, living room and large bathroom. Though, there are no rooms with 2 beds so if you have more than two people they will be sleeping on the fold out couch in the living room. 

There is no casino and no smoking (thank goodness!) which I think is why this hotel was a little more quiet and relaxing than others. I never heard drunk people in the hallways or slamming doors at all hours. 

If you are planning on relaxing by the pool you can reserve your lounge chair online ahead of time (for a small fee) and if you are with a large group you can all enter the same group name to insure all your chairs are together. Our group of 10 was able to lounge together right by the pool all afternoon. There is no way we would have found that many chairs together, much less poolside.

I was part of a large group of very well-traveled friends ranging in age from mid 30s on up who came for a combined bachelor\/bachelorette weekend. I mention our ages to establish we were not just some young punks checking in. In total there were about 15 of us. I booked my room directly through the hotel some booked their room through a deal offered on travel zoo\/Jet. I will warn anyone thinking of staying because of an advertised deal on Groupon, Travel Zoo, Living Social etc. Don't do it! This hotel has an obvious attitude toward those guests who book through these discount sites. Several Rooms were booked as well as one what they call a ""penthouse suite"" for our bride and groom. This room is in no way what anyone would consider a ""Penthouse"" It is a basic 2 bedroom suite with a very small living room. The only thing I can say was deluxe about this room is it did have a full kitchen and full size refrigerator but who in the world is coming to Vegas to cook?  If you are one of the rare individuals looking to make dinner in Vegas I guess this would be the room for you. But if your are looking for something ""Penthouse"" to house a group of friends for meet ups, drinks etc. you are S.O.L.  Because I booked with the hotel directly my room was ready at check in time. Because some of our friends booked through travel zoo their rooms were not ready until hours and I mean hours waited past normal check in time. One of the rooms not ready was the so called penthouse suite. The front desk staff and management just threw up their hands saying there was nothing they could do about the room not being ready because it was booked through Travel Zoo\/Jet and basically said it in a condescending manner like how dare you book through a discount site. Ultimately it should never matter how a guest comes to you once they are in your hotel. Because our bride and groom  and some of the wedding party could not get into their rooms to get ready for already made dinner plans we were late to our dinner by an hour and half. Not once did the hotel offer them ""any"" vacant room to get ready in while the penthouse was being cleaned knowing we had reservations. Not once did they offer to buy the bride and groom a drink while they waited. Not once did they offer any other services at a comp. These are indeed viable options to sometimes unavoidable room delays that has nothing to do with changing the travel zoo room rate which apparently is a never to be broken commandment read by Moses himself. It made the group of us feel like they were indeed actually punishing my friends for booking through a discount site. Finally they get their room. Only to find out the hotel lost the brides luggage. Seriously Vdara? The bride herself had to come down to the luggage room to locate her own bag which was sitting on a chair in their storage room. Again what did she get for the trouble? A great big shrug from the staff.  I could really go on forever at the problem after problem encountered at this hotel and the overall attitude of not giving a flying fruitcake by the hotel management. But I will finish with a summary of the most ridiculous points.

*Master Switch-If you don't hit this switch located in the doorway none of the lights in your room will work. 

*Dusty-The room furnishing are very modern but our room was extremely dusty.

*Mini bar fridge-I would have gladly paid the overpriced mini bar charge for a bottle of water. But I couldn't because it locked me out. It opened once upon arrival and then locked me out the entire rest of our stay for who knows what reason.

* The blackout shade-They have these fancy shades that are open and closed by a switch on the wall. It's not one continuous shade it's in portions so all the places that don't connect let in the bright Las Vegas sunshine starting at dawn. 

* The pantry\/restaurant\/gift shop- This is the only place in the hotel to buy food\/drink or necessities so it's very busy but not staffed appropriately and has one register for all. Therefore you will wait a long very long time.

*Do not bring professional type cameras. A photographer was hired for one hour to take pictures of our group to commemorate the occasion. The hotel shut us down like we were trying to film a porno in the lobby the security came at us extremely rude which was not necessary.

*Do not have anyone leave anything for you at the front desk. We did a burlesque lesson as a group and the instructor dropped off a gift for the bride. A msg was left in her room that she had a package waiting for her downstairs. When she went to retrieve it they had lost it. Then questioned her as if she was lying about someone leaving a msg. After about an hour they finally found her package.

So to sum up my review Vdara don't do it. Literally stay anywhere else. The back seat of your friends car would provide better customer service.",2,1,1

*Very confusing to know where to park?  There is no self park unless you want to park at the ARIA which is very far away from the hotel if you are hauling luggage.  They do have valet which we don't mind.  We love valet but I know not everyone does.  To get to Valet is confusing too. Go into the CRystals entrance not the ARIA.  You would have to drive in a circle.  For first timers... its confusing.  The second time not so much.  
  
*The pool is small compare to other pools in Vegas.  It was kind of overcrowded and I think it was because of the size.  More like family oriented instead of party crowd.  

*Our fridge wouldn't cool.  That sucked we complained about that but they didn't really fix it. 

*The bed was too firm.  I was kind of dissapointed in this because the ARIA beds are the best that I ever slept in.  My husband said it was the same but I don't think it was.

*The front desk told us our resort fee was ""taken care of.""  When I hear that I think they aren't going to charge us for it but to our suprise they did... $25 each night.


Now... things that were GREAT at the VDARA.

*The smell. As soon as you walk in there is such a pleasant smell.  I love it!

*The room.  We paid $75\/night in priceline for a couple of weekday nights.  It was a great suite.  The view was awesome (Belagio side... we could see the fountains).   It was clean, it was modern, two flat screens. Perfect. 

*The service was awesome as soon as we called for something they would be right up and then followed up with a phone call.  Hardly any wait too. 

*The Gym... great.  I loved their elliptical machine and they had clean towels and water ready at the machine.

One thing that did bother me was there were no pots or pans or even silverware in the unit. Not even a  coffee maker. This seemed odd to me considering it has a fully functional kitchen but you had no way of using it. I was informed that IF I wanted a coffee maker there would be an additional $20 per day charge to the room. Even with Starbucks coffee costing $4.75 a cup this wouldn't be feasible for me to do. I personally felt this was a bit of price gouging. I mean why give someone a fully functional kitchen and then charge them for the things they would need to use it?

However, my experience with the hotel policy & customer service was horrible. I drove from LA this Saturday for a one night stay to Vegas, Vdara. Unfortunately due to the extreme weather, my overheated car broke down in the middle of the freeway. I explained this situation to the front desk and asked if I could cancel my reservation of the 2 suites that I had booked. They noted to me that it was too late for me to cancel and receive a refund (which I had already somewhat figured they were going to say), and that on top of being incapable of receiving a refund, I was going to be charged a duplicate amount of my hotel reservation as a result of a no show. That's ridiculous! I've never heard of a no show being a duplicate fee of the amount I had paid. It's usually at the most $50 or a low percentage from the booking amount. With that said, I decided to tow my car to get it fixed in Vegas instead of LA in order to avoid the no show charge. I arrived to Vdara after paying a unanimous towing fee, and stood first in the mobile check-in line (I had already checked in & received my room numbers through my phone). For a good 10 minutes, nobody bothered to assist me & when I finally did receive assistance, the employee noted me that the mobile check-in was closed. (They left the line opened & didn't block off the section, so I guess they were just expecting me to just automatically know it was closed?..) Anyways, finally received assistance & checked in to my suite. I left my luggages with the bell boy, so the first thing I wanted to do was call the luggage\/bell desk. That's when I noticed that our phone in the room was broken without a dial tone. I had to manually search for Vdara numbers on my cell phone in order to finally get connected with the bell desk. Had to use this irritating method a few times in order to ask for simple requests. Next day, just as I had done mobile check in, I did mobile check out in order to avoid the long line. About a few hours later, I received invoice summaries for the 2 suites we stayed at. For one of the suites, they charged me an additional $30.00 as a result of: Refreshment Center. I neither opened nor drank any of the drinks provided in the room, but just simply placed some of them above the fridge in original order, in order to use the fridge space for personal items. Overall from checking in to checking out, my experience was bothersome. I've stayed at majority of the hotels on the strip and had great assistance and service, but this one was by far the worst.",0,0,0

The room itself was pretty nice, hence the upgraded rating. However, the rating reflects service and accommodations. When I checked in, they did not give me any information about the hotel, other than the temporary charge on my card for the deposit. There is NO self-parking for the hotel (there is complimentary valet only). I didn't want to valet because I wanted easy access to my car. The other best option was to park at Bellagio and walk over (they are connected), but the walk sucks when you have your luggage with you.

Called down to the front desk for a few items: a blanket, toothbrush, shampoo\/conditioner. The guy on the phone responded with a sarcastic ""and would you like a side of fries with that?""..................seriously now? Is that a ""5-star"" hotel response? And they ended up bringing two scope instead of the shampoo\/conditioner. Didn't bother correcting them...

Like I said, the room itself is good...if you're planning on using the sleeper sofa, don't. It's crap. The kitchen was great though (you need to bring your own utensils and kitchen items). 

Would I return to Vdara? Maybe......if I was desperate for a kitchen again. Otherwise, given the poor service and far parking, probably not.",0,0,0

Our room was pretty nice for only $125 a night. It's located in between aria & cosmopolitan & there is no casino in the hotel itself but it's walking distance to all the other hotels on the strip if you're looking to gamble. My friend & I went to marquee during the night that we were there which was perfect because it was walking distance to cosmopolitan. There was a set of stairs right next to the lobby driveway to the hotel that we could just walk down & be right at Cosmo. The room also had a pretty nice view of the strip where we could even see the water show at bellagio. It is pretty much in the center of the strip so we didn't really have to cab it anywhere -- everything was walking distance & convenient to get to. I would definitely stay here again.,0,0,0

We booked a studio parlor suite through the Mlife website and we were more than pleased with our choice in room and hotel. The entrance to Vdara is off of Harmon so you avoid the mess and delays on the strip. The hotel is spotless from the lobby, to the cafe, Starbucks, bar\/lounge and everything else in between the ground level and your room. Our studio parlor suite was on the 53rd floor. I requested a high floor room and it had a partial view of the Bellagio water fountain so that was great. I appreciated Mike? (Filipino gentleman) at concierge ensuring that the room we requested was the one we were given. We were real happy with our stay from the beginning to check-out.

The room was great. It was worth every penny. It had a 2 stove top Gaggenau burner, Bosch microwave, 2 sided mini refrigerator, table for 2, living area with its own 42"" Phillips LED... And on the other side of the room divider separating the living area from the bed (king) area was an identical LED screen. The bed was super comfortable with plenty of pillows. The bathroom was very spacious with a big tub, small closet, rolling towel valet, single sink (wish it was two) with plenty of counter space and roomy glass stand up shower with a mini bench in it. The provided Vive toiletries were nice. They were mild and came in handy. Oh and the closet in the sleeping area... it was HUGE. As it should be. That's what I'm talking about. It's the little things and Vdara got it all right. The automatic sheer and blackout shades go up and down or all at once at the push of a button. The master control for all of the lights was also key.

One added plus of staying here is the peace and quiet of the Vdara not having a casino in the lobby. While that may be a negative to some, it's definitely a plus for me. And besides, Aria is a short walk outside from the lobby. 2-3 mins, tops? Maybe less.. And the walkway by the Starbucks leads right to the Bellagio and the tram that will take you to Monte Carlo or Crystals mall. Vdara being central like that was a great plus for us. 

And of course I always review the valet at each Vegas hotel I stay in. The Vdara valet staff is very courteous and professional. They welcome you back, they open the door for your passengers as well and you can call down ahead so your car will be waiting when you get downstairs.

Vdara. 5 stars... easy. One of my favorite Vegas hotels by far. I look forward to staying there again.",3,1,3

Vdara isn't exactly on the Strip but it's very close to it. It is connected to Bellagio so you can easily get on the Strip that way. A lot of people prefer this because it's less congested but getting to the Strip will take some walking, which I didn't mind. 

On the outside, Vdara looks very sleek and modern and I was impressed. But the inside is SO. BORING. It's got the worst lobby ever; no defining features or statues. Casars has statues and cool architecture, Bellagio has the glass flower petals, but Vdara just a check in\/out area and looks like a typical hotel. Also the lobby smells like RAID. Yes Raid the insect killing spray. I'd rather smell the sweatiness of all the humanity walking the Strip than endure Vdara's smell. The lobby also only contains 1 bar and 2 restaurants, so it's pretty barren. Plus there's NO CASINO. Yes it's a major hotel with no casino. In Las Vegas. Let that sink in...

The best part of Vdara is definitely the rooms, which look very chique like the homes you would find on HGTV or something. It was very spacious and everything was clean. The bathrooms were also very nice with plenty of towels. I liked how the door numbers were digital and you can change the light on the door to indicate if you want room service to come by and clean or not. 

I would say that my stay at Vdara was average overall. If you just want to stay in Vegas and don't really care where you sleep, Vdara is fine. But if you're going to soak in the hotel, casino, and strip experience, book one of the many hotels on the Strip.",0,0,0

Check-in was smooth from the get go.  Our bags were taken by the bellmen.  The front desk clerk was friendly, and can I just say that the lobby area smells amazing!?  I don't know what they put in the air, but it is great.

Our bags beat us to our room as the bellmen was waiting for us when we got there.  He then proceeded to show us around our suite and answer any question I had.  We had the panoramic suite and the view was amazing.  Overall, the room was great.  Full kitchen, w\/d, USB media center to plug in your iPods and other gadgets for charging.  Great his and her robes and slippers.  Outstanding Aveda products to use throughout the bathroom.

Here are my few complaints.  The layout of the electrical switches was terrible.  They were all over the place and not where you would expect.  And when you have a panoramic view suite, you have a lot of windows which equals a lot of shades and blackout curtains to get down.  We were all over the place trying to get that handled.  In addition there is one switch for a the mirror lights, and the mirror is on two sides in the bathroom.  Just inconvenient.   If anyone knows the study of Human Factors, you know it was definitely not considered when designing this room.  Second, there is no door to the toilet area.  The bathroom is a very open concept, which I am cool with, but as much as I love my boyfriend, I don't want to watch him go to the bathroom while I am in the closet or doing my make-up.  Third, the table and cabinets in the kitchen  were already showing wear.  This hotel is pretty new and that surprised me.  

Overall, the suite, view, and service was amazing.  Its definitely a great location and nice to have the option of a non-gambling, non-smoking hotel in the heart of the strip.  See a separate review for the spa.",0,0,0

Great kitchen with absolutely no kitchen supplies no dishes nothing to wash with totally useless unless you call down for plates but that all you get!  The worst think was no coffee maker so I tried to call but the phone did not work!  Finally got the front desk and they stated they do not provide one unless you pay $20.00 extra a day needless to say I was mad.  Then when we checked in the we gave them our credit card and told them to not to use the other one because it was our debit card for our checking account,  guess what they put a hold of over a thousand dollars on both cards, over drafted our account and could not correct it until the next day because it was after 5 pm and the guy was gone!  Very mad they didn't seem to care at all!  Was not corrected until I walked downstairs and demanded it be fixed now!  The lights in the room need to be turned off in the entry way which is weird and a tripping hazard!  I would not stay here again ever!!!

you walk into the lobby and the hotel smells soo good..not being a fan of cigarette smoke or gambling, this non-gaming non-smoking hotel was the perfect choice for me..the suite was spacious (and had a view of the bellagio water show), king size bed and pillows were comfy, and the amenities were nice (aveda!).. they even have a kitchenette, fridge, dining table and living room (so you have two tv's) with a pull out sofa..oh, i loved that you only had to hold up the room key for the door to open.. great for those people that party hardy and cant stick the key in the hole at any other place..

yes, they only have one bar and a cafe but who cares.. you're only steps away from the rest of city center to grab a bite in a restaurant or for a night out, if you're too lazy to go out further on the strip..

This was the first time we've stayed at the Vdara, we normally stay at The Delano or the Palazzo but we really wanted the view that the Vdara offers and the view was absolutely breathtaking. 

I did however want to express some issues we did have with our stay. When we checked in and went to our room we were in love with everything, I went to set my purse on the yellow chair in the sitting area when I noticed it was covered in hair and dirt. We ended up just pushing the chair into the corner so we didn't have to sit on it, I did take a picture of it for your reference. We were determined to not let something like hair and dirt ruin our getaway and we are not complainers. We went out that night to see a show and when we returned my husband went to shower, he noticed there was a dirty towel in the closet in the bathroom he let me know I said it must have been missed by housekeeping. At this point it was 2am there was no way I was going to worry about calling housekeeping and we didn't want to be moved to another room since we were right next door to my aunt who also came with us for the trip. After he showered he went to use one of the towels which had a big brown stain on it, at least I hope it was a stain. :-) I was starting to wonder if the room really was cleaned or just quickly gone through as we also found trash in the closet. 

We really didn't want to cause issues and as I stated earlier my aunt was in the room next door and I did not want to be moved further away from her since she is in her early 70s.

We checked out the morning of the 6th, checkout was easy which we loved the valet brought the car around quickly and we were on the road after we grabbed some Starbucks. When we got to Barstow I realized I had forgotten my Samsung phone charger plugged into the left side of bed behind the tablet. When I got home I called to see if I could pay to have it mailed back to me, they transferred me to lost and found and I talked to Dustin. I let him know we had just checked out of room 28.028 that morning and explained where I left my phone charger and asked him if there was anyway I could pay to have it mailed back. His response was ""well it'd have to be turned in first"" and kind of laughed which made me feel like okay so the housekeeping doesn't turn in items guests have mistakenly left behind. Then he said he'd call me if anything popped up. I just thought the way he spoke to me was a little rude and condescending, he never called back to let me know if housekeeping turned it in or not. I understand it was only a $40.00 phone charger but there should be a standard level of respect given when a guest calls. I get the feeling it was never even looked into. 

Im just not sure if we'll be coming back.",2,0,0

We were traveling as a group for a work convention and got 8 studio parlor suites. Check-in was a breeze and the girl who helped us was so friendly and helpful...I wish I remembered her name!

The studio parlor suite is pretty big! Upon entering there is a small dining table and kitchen with a small stove, sink, refrigerator and microwave.  Note that the kitchen is not stocked but they can bring dishes up upon request. I bought some milk and cereal for early morning breakfast and they happily brought up utensils and cereal bowls for me. Past the dining area is a living room area with a couch, chair, coffee table and flat screen TV. On the opposite side of the TV divider is a large king bed with yet another TV! Finally, the bathroom...so spacious and clean! The bathroom has a shower and an extra large soaking tub. Luckily, we were upgraded to a fountain view and could enjoy the nightly show at the Bellagio!

The mandatory nightly resort fee (which all strip hotels have) includes your standard WIFI, newspaper (in business center), boarding pass printing (business center), access to the fitness room, two water bottles daily, and nightly turn down service (upon request). 

Vdara is a much smaller hotel than your average Vegas strip hotel, but I like that about it. There is a Starbucks downstairs as well as a bar, and Market Cafe. I believe they also offer room service, but I did not dine at the Vdara. Vdara is a non-smoking hotel with no casino. I love that the whole hotel is non-smoking! The Aria is just a short 1 minute walk away if you want to eat breakfast in the Aria Cafe or gamble in their casino. There is also a bridge to the Bellagio. We walked over after dinner to enjoy the Bellagio gardens.  There is no parking garage at the Vdara so you will have to valet your car. Overall, the valet was pretty quick in bringing our car over and we didn't have to wait too long. 

The only reason why I didn't give Vdara a 5-star review is because their fitness center is too small. When I went down at 6:15 in the morning it was packed! There were no empty machines and I was not about to wait in line for a machine to open up. A hotel of this size needs a little bigger fitness center. Other than being too small it was adequate. Standard treadmills, elliptical machines, a weight area and storage lockers are provided. 

Overall, we were all very happy with our stay at Vdara. Everyone we encountered was very friendly and courteous. Express check-out can be done in your room on the TV. I hope to stay at Vdara again soon. The non-smoking hotel is a nice break from the rest of Vegas!",5,1,2

With luck on our side, we were able to secure a room at the Vdara through a corporate discount, resulting in a deal that I didn't even think was possible at a nice hotel in Vegas during a summer weekend.  The rooms looked great on Yelp and I was just thrilled to not be staying at Circus Circus again, miles away from anything but the scorching Vegas heat.

Upon arrival, we were greeted with complimentary valet, perfect for someone who cannot stand the concept of valets (me!).  We then went inside where we experienced possibly the simplest check-in I have experienced in my life.  Despite being about 4 hours early for check in time, we were able to be checked in right away and immediately went upstairs, where we called to have our luggage brought up.  The room was spectacular, with the queen-sized pull out couch possibly more comfortable than our bed (not a knock on our bed).  Spacious, a mini kitchen, reading lights by the bed, a seated shower, nice tub, expansive bathroom.  What more could you ask for!

The lobby had a nice bar, where the bartenders remembered our drink orders after the first visit.  The pool was also enjoyable and not as crowded as those at some of the casino hotels, in which you question if you are swimming in a higher percentage of water or sweat.  The fact that it is a non-gaming hotel makes it a little less crazy as others and the location makes it easy to get to anything you need situated about 30 seconds from the Vdara and a walkway away from the Bellagio.  Being in the middle of the strip was also very convenient, allowing us to get wherever we needed with ease.

All in all a great experience, and further punctuated by the fact that they were very accommodating in allowing us to extend our stay, despite initially being full that day.",4,0,2

I was really impressed with Vdara. The check in line was a lot shorter than Cosmo, which was good because I really wanted to get into my hotel room because I needed to nap after a long day of drinking haha. There's no casino here. I'm not too sure if I like that so much because I'm a huge slot machine fan! 

We got the Vdara suite. It was awesome! The king size bed felt so good to sleep on! The pull out bed however was horrible. You might as well sleep on the floor. I think that pull out bed is way too old and they really need to replace it. My group had two rooms and both the pull out couches were bad. Trust me, you might as well sleep on the floor. 

The bathroom was probably my favorite! It has a tub!! It became very useful after a night of clubbing. We would come back and turn it on and soak our feet in it while eating our left over Earls sandwiches. Yup this is what I called living the life haha jk. 

Another thing I really liked about Vdara is that there's absolutely no line for the taxi! When I stayed at Cosmo, the taxi line was ridiculously long! But Vdara is a lot different, I only waited 5 minute max for a taxi line.

I would definitely stay at Vdara again. I think it's worth the money and it's super close to Cosmo, Aria, and Planet Hollywood. What more do you need besides Earls and Fat Tuesdays when you're in Vegas? Haha.",1,1,0

A really nice clerk gave us a view room overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  The room is tastefully done, the panoramic view was made way cooler with the high-tech electric blinds.  The elevators were really quick, the pool area got to be a little crowded, but not uncomfortably so....really more of an intimate feel than crowded.  The $28\/day resort fee is ridiculous (minus one star)....especially for no in-room coffee maker!  Oh, and no alarm clock either....weird.

But after staying at the Vdara, I am pretty sold on the concept of it. I love the thought of being able to relax and have some quiet time after a night of being out on the town or walking around the strip during the day. Plus, my boyfriend and I couldn't resist a total of $250 for a weekend stay (Fri-Sun). Thanks Expedia!

Everything about the Vdara is amazing. Sure, there's nothing to do there and it can be dead in the lobby but you just gotta make the most of what you got around the area. Sure, there are not many options to eat\/drink inside the Vdara (all they have are the Silk Room and Bar Vdara). That's why we made sure we had leftovers from Earl of Sandwich at Miracle Mile and utilized the refrigerator & microwave in the kitchen.

2 LCD TVs, one in the living room area and one in the bedroom area, and with HDTV, too! Really loved the layout of the room. The kitchen sure comes in handy when you stock up on alcohol, mixers, and food for the weekend and need somewhere to put everything. I really liked that the shower had a little ledge for shampoos, conditioners, body wash, etc. b\/c it hella annoys me when I have to put my travel bottles on the shower floor and gotta bend over for them. Also makes shaving easier too haha. And the evening view is gorgeous! If you end up with a north facing room, you can see Rio, Palms, and maybe even the Bellagio water show, and the Paris Eiffel Tower. 

If you're interested in hitting up The Bank for clubbing, make a stop there during the day and ask for free (for girls) and reduced (for guys) admission passes. But also see if you can get a business card because in turn, the Vdara concierge can give you VIP admission passes. Thanks Kenny!

We opted to not have maid service for Sat. and we thought it was awesome that we received a voice msg, asking if we needed new towels or anything since we didn't have maid service. Wow!

Make sure you have a credit card or else it'll cost you $200 for the security deposit to put your debit card on file. Sure, that $200 is refunded after you leave but I'm sure you'd love to save yourself the trouble.",4,1,3

Never see people mention housekeeping. I found them to be awesome. After first night came back from strip to find toiletries we left on sink organized perfectly and my iPhone cords all wrapped up nice. Maybe it's just me but I thought it was cool. Once you figure easy to go north or south on strip by cutting through aria or bellagio. Only 3 minor negatives that keep it from 5 out of 5

- checkin process was bungled and frustrating. Got email for online checkin which I did. 5 days later my rooms still not ready . Ended up going to front desk to inquire and got keys and they'd call us in hour with room number or leave message. Well they called in hour, didn't leave message and when my wife returned call they said no one from vdara had called. Psst vdara if you reply to this review like you have to many, iPhones have caller ID ya you did. 

- if your going to offer ability to cook you should have a trash\/waste basket that fits more than 3 things. We personally didn't cook but brought back late night stuff a couple times and there's basically no where to put trash in kitchen short of teeny tiny waste basket unless you use bathroom which ain't much bigger. But who puts food in bathroom trash??

- we only got out free water bottles one time. Literature seemed to indicate that should've been daily.

Checking in was very easy and the lady was able to let me check in early. We got the deluxe suite, which was the lowest room they have but it way better than expected. It came with an mini kitchen, mini dining table, a living room, bedroom, and bathroom.   

I love sleeping on the bed. It was so comfortable! It made me not want to leave the hotel room. The bathroom itself was gorgeous! I was able to take a bath in their bath tub which was awesome. Only down fall is the $33 resort fee that you pay each day.

What saved the ranking from being lower was the fabulous staff, courteous manager and bell woman.  They also gave me a $100 food and beverage credit and 3pm late checkout.

When I checked in, I paid a $20-25 per day use fee for certain amenities to include WiFi or direct connection. When I logged in, to call home via Skype, my connection was pixelated and choppy and it finally locked up. I was having flashbacks to the old dial-up days. I complained to the front desk and they referred me to Internet support. They also discounted my first day for the trouble. I am here for a week....in work mode. I called the Internet support folks and they had me run Speedtest.net to get a measurement. It was rated as a letter grade of ""F"" comparing to other hotels in the area. The technician advised that this speed was normal and was not surprised. I am now told if I pay and ""additional fee"", they can give me faster service. I am very surprised at all this.

**UPDATE**

Dining experience in the Vdara ""Market Cafe"" quickly went awry when my wife and daughter ate breakfast on 16 May 2013. This horrible customer experience was caused by what appeared to be a mop string embedded in my daughter's eggs. It seemed to take an eternity to resolve by staff with my wife's and daughter's insistence that this was not normal. They were given a $50.00 gift certificate to buy more Vdara ""FOOD"" and a bowl (about the size of a dessert dish) of fruit I wouldn't give to a monkey. As ""consolation"", the food service manager told us the string was actually used to tie off sausage......whatever...

Let's start with 

The Bad:

- Booked a Penthouse Suite, confirmed with concierge and everything. But when we  arrived at the front desk they ""were sorry to inform you but the room was overbooked"".  (you mean, you gave my room away?).   The Manager\/Supervisor - Arome said our suite wouldn't be available until the next day, so they will put us in a smaller room for the first night (at a reduced rate).   After we complained a bit, Arome decided to put us in the Hospitality Suite - (yes which was eventually bigger), but we had to check out, and re check in the next day, and wait while the room was clean.  A bit of an inconvenience

- Limo service that was prearranged with my booking of the hotel.  Picked us up from the Airport as planned -Cool - check. However, my ride back to the airport was a different story.  6:55am flight out on Monday Morning, my limo was no where to be found.  Even after I called the front desk and ""Brittany"" confirmed with me that they would be there at 5:15am.  After waiting until 5:25am, I called front desk again, Brittany said the driver was on his way back from the airport and it would be another 5-6 minutes.   Another 10 minutes has passed and still no ride.  so I called ""Brittany"" asking what the problem was, but she said he was just on his way.  We ended up taking a taxi over instead.  Ok, at this point I didn't want to miss my flight.

- I'm only listing the major disruptions I had, not the minor ones.  I'd be hear all day.  But ultimately, I think they can get a better handle on customer service.  Despite their attempts to rectify the situation, I never received a call about my 2nd night room being ready.  They promised me a call twice. and each time I went to the front desk, they would take forever to find my reservation. Kyle and Steve both helped me at the front desk. Although Steve was doing a good job... no negative points for him

*** I'm not really sure if the managers ever read this, or if they really care.  I can picture Arome saying ""well I gave him a bigger room"".   But you know what, it's principal, and call me crazy but... when people pay for something, they should get what they paid for, bottom line. ****

And now... The Good:

- Modern nice hotel, rooms are spacious, beds are comfortable
- Inexpensive for larger room suites, compared to high brand name casinos.
- Relaxing and quiet environment if you really want to avoid crazy party goers.

*** Overall - I probably wouldn't stay at this hotel again nor would I recommend it to a friend.  I've been to Vegas countless times, and this is probably the most inconvenienced I've ever been.  Customer service is everything to me, and If I'm paying for a nice stay, I'd like things to go as planned.",7,1,0

We had a room on the 47th floor with a fabulous view of the Bellagio fountains, and the strip.  The view alone was worth the price ($149\/night), but once you factor in the lovely room, nice bathroom, separate sleeping\/sitting areas, and the kitchenette, it was an absolute steal at that price.

I liked that there is no casino in the Vdara as it kept a very nice low-key vibe to the place.  And the Aria is literally a 1-minute walk away, and has a lovely casino and every other amenity you could want or need.  Although the little cafe in the Vdara lobby is very well stocked, and is a great spot to grab some breakfast or a snack to keep in your room.

The pool at Vdara was nice ... not as lushly landscaped as the one at the Aria, but again, very low-key which was fine by me.  We used the work-out facilities, and they are nothing extraordinary (especially compared to the work-out room at Aria, which we also used), but perfectly fine.  Can't comment on the spa, as we went to the one next door at Aria (which was really nice).

Booked a city-corner suite and got one (upgrade trick did not work), and the first night we were given ""the only available"" suite at 6th floor, facing the pool. I would say if it's in the summer, the view must be good, but for winter..... Anyway, the front desk girl was willing to help out so she checked with the manager and offered some credit and put me on the list to move to higher floor city-corner. I had to move on the 2nd day to a much higher floor and man, day and night difference. From the other side of the building, we had the Bellaggio fountain view and could see the mountains etc. No ""strip view"" per se, since everything else is pretty much blocked by the Cosmopolitan. Anyway, suite was spacious with 2-sink bathroom, had kitchen range, microwave, fridge and even washer and dryer.

Enough for the room, as for the location, it's not really ideal. The hotel is barely a hotel, nothing more, so if you are for the entertainment, you need to go out to other hotel\/casino. It's connected to Bellagio via a sky bridge, and you will need to walk for a good 15-20 min to reach the connection to Balllys and Caesars. And if you want to walk along Las Vegas Blvd, then you have to walk another block towards Hamon Ave. So it's a lot of vein walking. The hotel itself has only a full size restaurant Silk Road, a market cafe, a starbucks and one tiny lounge bar, that's it, no theater, no casino, no night clubs. You will be surprised by its small size (due to the narrow lot it was built on) if you have stayed at other venues before. My 2 cents, if you want a good and quiet rest in suites, stay at Vdara; otherwise choose others.",1,0,0

When we needed it housekeeping was johnny on the spot and friendly with large smiles even after noticing the numerous bottles of alcohol and shot glasses strewn around the two suites and inevitably the mess that would most likely result from our celebration.

Also, our fun Vdara cafe wasn't open at all so I wasn't able to get my Benedict and coffee like always. I am unsure what they are doing there right now.

Not only was it located in close proximity to the Strip, but it is one of the only smoke-free hotels around and that was important to all of us.

Upon entering the lobby, we were instantly struck by the fact that the Vdara has no casino. That can be a plus or a minus for you, so take it as you will. The front desk staff were friendly and incredibly helpful. We were travelling in two couples and, though we had booked separately, Vdara was able to put us in adjacent rooms on the same floor. Bonus points!

The rooms in particular are spacious by hotel standards and very well-appointed.  Entering through the kitchenette, the room opens up to include a dinette area, roomy couch with a flat screen TV and an ahhhh-mazing king-sized bed. Near the bed is the ensuite equipped with a sink, major counter space and even a deep soaker tub.

While most of our time was spent exploring Las Vegas, the Vdara proved to be a restful place to recharge - and in a bed that induces heavenly sleeps! It's a quiet hotel, far enough from the Strip but close enough with access through the Cosmpolitan or Bellagio hotels. Though the pool was closed for renovations, we were able to use the Aria's pools (across the rotunda) for no charge and enjoyed every minute of them.

The Vdara no doubt impressed us and was a wise choise for our accommodation. Though the Vdara is a very nice hotel, I doubt we'll stay there on our next visit... and not because it's not a great hotel, but because the Strip has so many other hotels that exude far more excitement and Vegas-esque character than the Vdara.",2,0,0

Pros-
BRAND NEW
NON SMOKING
NO CASINO
SMELLS AMAZING throughout hotel 
FREE VALET
VERY CHIC DECOR IN ROOM\/LOBBY
2 GIANT FLAT SCREENS IN ROOM
GREAT PRICES

Cons-
RIDICULOUS TIME TO CHECK IN\/OUT (45 min) 
LEFT A NOTE FOR MANAGER TO CALL- NO RESPONSE
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE  
NO CLOSE LATE NIGHT DINING BESIDES ROOM SERVICE
REALLY CONFUSING TO FIND... 

You have to go as if you are going to Aria and then go across Harmon to get there... took us like 20min to find even using GPS... taking Vdara drive off of Harmon takes you to the employee part ... very counterintuitive... 

Lots of quirks to be worked out but for the price I would stay again since I like the location, non smoking, views, and laid back atmosphere... I think by the next time I go to vegas they will have their ish figured out...and if not- I'll let you guys know! :)",0,0,0

Don't stress!  If you have an itch to gamble, Bellagio's casino is no more than a five minute walk away.  That's the same walk you'd be making if you were staying at the Bellagio anyway so don't complain.

A hotel with no casino, I would expect some sort of spectacular feature but nope--Vdara is pretty boring. The lobby is small and has a strange perfumy smell. You have to walk through the Bellagio or Aria to access the strip. 

The room itself could hardly be described as a ""suite"". The only indication that it was a suite and not a regular bedroom was the divider between the bed and the ""living room area"". I've stayed in a suite in Caeser's Palace before which was much bigger (with two beds) and nicer! I will say the window blinds and the view from my room was breathtaking, however. The hallways and elevators are also pretty cool. Very modern-artsy.

Pros: ???

Cons:

- no self-parking....which would be okay, except the valet returned my car with my bumper hanging off the left side.  What's REALLY shady about it is that they just left my car parked in front of the hotel.  There was no valet attendant waiting by the car.......!!!  Called hotel security....waited a good 45 minutes for them to come.  It's been more than two weeks and still no response :(

- OH and if you're going to check out at the normal time, it's going to take 30 min to 1 hour for the valet to bring your car...so be prepared to wait.

- if you call  housekeeping for anything...you are most not likely going to receive it on your first try.  i called housekeeping 4 times in two days and never got what i needed.  

- the kitchen is not stocked with any kind of utensils or plates so the kitchen is completely useless.  

-  bathroom is right next (two feet) from the bed...so you can hear everything.  

- the advertised black out curtains are not in fact black out.  

- don't expect the front desk to help you with anything and expect a long wait for check-in and check-out.

For a little more a night, I would much rather stay at the Venetian (or if I had to stay in the City Center, Aria).

This is the SLOWEST hotel on the planet. We checked in on a Tuesday and it took us over an hour to get checked in. No one seems to be doing anything helpful and the employees just didn't seem to know anything about the hotel.

After finally getting checked in, we went up to our room and the bed was filthy (makeup all over the white sheets). We called the front-desk to get the sheets changed and NO ONE answers the phone at this hotel! I was on wait for over 30min until someone finally answered. After we talked, the front desk promised someone would be sent up to change the sheets---an hour later..nothing!

The pool sucks. It's so tiny and not something you would expect from Vegas. And the deadly 'death ray' that comes off the hotel is not a lie. I could not lay out for more than 5 min without feeling like my skin was being burnt off.

Cabs! Another nightmare. It's impossible to get a cab here. We waited for 20 minutes in this long line that was not moving, and eventually went over to Aria to get a cab. If the cabbies ever venture up to the City Center (they hate to), Vdara is their last stop b\/c they all go to Aria first...such a joke

There's nothing in this hotel. No casino, no restaurants, no pool-life. I do give it 3 stars because the rooms were nice and spacious, but that's about it. Don't waste your $$ here..the Cosmopolitan is wayyyy nicer with better restaurants and the Aria has a way better pool.",0,0,0

The rooms are very nicely appointed and have fridges, stove tops and microwaves.  So if you're going to be in town for a while and like to be able to heat up some left overs, or maybe you need to be able to prepare your own food, then this is the place.  They also have a cafe\/market downstairs that has food items like a grocery store you can pick up for later in your stay. 

The location is a little rough if you plan on doing any touristy activities.  You do have a bit of access to the Bellagio, but you're so far off the strip that you've either got to take the monorail to the Monte Carlo, or you're gonna be in for quite the hike.  Gamblers in the group will have to huff it to the Aria across the way or next door to Bellagio.  The pool is just nothing really special and sort of small when you've seen some of the offerings at places like Mandalay Bay or the MGM.  

But if the room is your main focus, you won't be disappointed here.  I didn't go to gamble, and I've been to Vegas too much to get touristy, so I loved my stay at the vdara.",0,0,0

The only good experience I had was that we were able to check-in earlier than 3 pm (around 1 pm). And that no one smoked in the hotel or lobby. But that's about it.

The bad experiences:
1. My room's shades kept going up and down by itself... in the middle of the night! Needless to say, I did not get a good night's sleep for two nights straight. I called the front desk after the first night and they sent someone up to take a look at it. The guy said we were out of batteries and switched a battery for us. The second night, it happened again! They sent another guy up to take a look at it and he said that he had never heard of such thing before. His options for us were to either switch rooms (which was not worth it because we were only going to be there for one more night and moving everything is a hassle; they were not going to give us a room upgrade or anything) or disconnect the switch to the blinds and just leave them down, which is what we opted for because I really wanted to sleep! So that was that, I did not get any views after that fiasco.

2. The resort fee is $25\/night. The resort fee includes 2 bottles of water per day, which we never got. I had to call housekeeping to complain about it before I got some water. Frustrating. If I pay for something, I expect to get it, especially for the price I'm paying to stay at this hotel.

3. The internet was terrible. It would disconnect once I put my phone down for 5 minutes and I had to reconnect every time I wanted to use it again. 

Probably would not stay here again unless it were free.",6,2,0

I can't stand smoking. It makes my eyes red and makes my hair smell. So when I was told we were staying here for a girls weekend, I was so happy. 

Vdara is right next to Aria and walking distance to the main strip. You are literally close to everything. There is a tram that goes to the Bellagio and you are literally right across the street from the Miracle Mile Mall. 

The rooms are modern, new and spacious. We took advantage of the pull out sofa to accommodate 3 girls. Housekeeping kindly gave us sheets and pillows for that. The bathroom is spacious! Imagine 3 girls trying to shower, shave and do make up at the same time. There is a huge tub and a nice sized TV, which we used to watch the football game. 

Downstairs in the lobby you will find a Starbucks and Market\/Restaurant. The market has snacks, drinks, take away sandwiches as well as a sit down area if you wish to order from the waiters. A little bit on the slow side but it does the trick if you are in a pinch and do not feel like leaving the hotel. The bar is located right across. Not huge, but simple and has ample TVs for anyone who wants to watch sports. 

Best part about this hotel is that it is pet friendly and does not have a loud\/noisy casino. Vegas is filled with casinos. It's nice to go back to a quiet hotel and not have to deal with the riff raft.

The trip from the airport was a troublesome. they had the marathon running the night I arrived. So, the shuttle driver tells me and this couple, which they were staying at Cosmo, that he was dropping us off at Planet Hollywood Towers and we would have to walk from there. So after the, I figured a good mile hike across the pedestrian bridge, Crystals and Aria, I arrive at Vdara tired as hell. Most complain about having to wide their way through the ropes at check in. I would have done this with no problems. No organization what so ever at Vdara. 2 people at the check in desk. People are just walking up and cutting in front of me and others who are waiting for the desk clerk to wave us over. Thought since I was nice and patient, I thought the clerk would at least offer an upgrade, which I would have taken, but no. She offers it to the man next to me who doesn't speak any English. So after getting my keys, I head straight upstairs and realize what view I was getting from the curve in the hallway. Got me a nice glimpse of the backside of Aria all the way down to Mandalay Bay and THE Hotel. Unpack, plug my phone in, and jump in the shower so I can go to dinner next door at Cosmo. Water pressure? What water pressure? Flamingo has better water pressure than these guys. I know its eco-friendly, but come on. Small cramped bathroom, especially the toilet. Shallow sink, so be careful when turning the water on or you will splash everywhere. Housekeeping never replenished my toiletries in the 3 nights I was there. I know it was a short stay, but I would like enough soap and shampoo to make it through the visit. The bed was very comfortable. TV worked just fine. Security checks every night at the elevators which is very nice. The best part of the hotel? The hotel bar, Bar Vdara. And the drink of choice was the Black Dragon. The bartender told me he has seen people just sit there all night and down those drinks. It was very delicious and I could see how you could just sit back and down those all day and night.

Being that it was one of the hotels that shared space in City Center, my only preconception I had of this place is that it was gonna be nice...and it was. This resort is smaller than a lot of the other heavy hitters on the strip, (i.e. Bellagio, Venetian, Wynn, and Encore) but the stay here was just as pleasant and luxurious. First important thing to know about this hotel is that it doesn't have a casino and has a strict no smoking policy. Fine by me...when I come stumbling into my hotel completely hammered drunk at 5am, the last thing I need to see and hear are flashing lights and sirens sounding off. Moreover, it is nice to return to a hotel that is well ventilated and not suffocating. 

I had a corner view suite on the 49th floor. It was a spacious 811 sq ft with an awesome panoramic view of the Bellagio fountains. It also had floor to ceiling windows with electronic blinds. Other cool room amenities included 2 large flat screen tvs, a coffee maker, and iPhone\/iPod ready entertainment center. Although for this it was not an iPod dock like they provide at other hotels. Instead, you have to go down to the front desk and check out an audio component cable to connect your iPhone to the entertainment system. And the hotel will charge you a fee of $10 if you happen to lose or damage it. 

The pool was very nice and tasteful and not littered with annoying douchebag type people that you might frequent at the more popular adult pool parties such as WET, Rehab, or TAO beach. It to me had a nice ""couples"" type of ambiance to it, where you could bring your partner and not have to worry about her being hit on every 5 seconds. All in all, my stay here was quite enjoyable and pleasant. And for the price I paid, you would be hard pressed to find a better deal. I will most definitely consider Vdara again for my accommodations when I visit Vegas again in the future.",5,2,0

Pros
-Fantastic clean rooms with a great view. They still have some of the best rooms on the strip.
-Friendly Staff

Cons
-The Cafe needs some serious help. There is ALWAYS a huge line to get breakfast and a wait for your food. Much rather walk somewhere else (like the Aria or Cosmo) to get faster service. It's just a reminder this hotel was built originally as condos not to have the capacity as a major Vegas hotel
-The staff is extremely slow to respond. 30-45 minutes on hold to talk to someone at the front desk, 1 hour wait for Valet, 1 hour wait to get extra SHAMPOO, and 1 hour wait to get extra COFFEE (both separate occasions).

Call front desk 3 times in 30min no tech people coming to fix the issue. There was no offer of assistant to come by and ck out the situation, as well no offer to switch room for us on the spot. They did mention they can give us $50 spa credit... Like that's going to be usful. Finally at 5am we got fed up and tell them don't bother. There's a tub that has hot water we can get by. The next day although we do have  do-not-disturb sign out, the maid still ring the bell want to clean our room... People in this hotel really know how to make their guess angery!  :(

The window shades is very modern goes up and down with a touch of button. On the button it says ""BLACKOUT SHADE"". So I thought, oh, that's nice... Well, just like the other reviewer mentioned, there's huge gap between the shades so it is not blackout at all. So bring your sleeping eye mask if you like to sleep in the dark.

There is no restaurant or buffet in the hotel, the closest one is around 10-15 min away (Aria or Crystal). Their web site says it's 2 min walk, it's just not true. Room service is very limited in menu, good maybe for breakfast only. 

There is kitchenette, but it's pretty useless, there is no kitchen utensils at all, nothing! You can order something calling to room service, but takes for while to deliver it. We waited for 40 min to had wine opener delivered in our room.

I love the pure chic, no casino hotel feel. No smoking which is awesome. Fresh scent always. The spa is no Wynn but its really okay. The pool is small and nice. Drinks on the pool can take up to 20 minutes to arrive. 
Its awesome now that they allow dogs.
Even though its a pet friendly hotel, you can't sit or lounge with your dog. You can only pass through the lobby. Dog park is tiny, but does the job well.

Let's start with the hassles\/disappointments:
- yea, you read it elsewhere, and I'll note it again: finding the place can be a bit time-consuming.  Once we did find the entrance, we did appreciate the ""airport-style"" curb\/entrance design.  You basically drive up an on-ramp that curves into the backside of Aria, and then continue past it to Vdara
- you can't get a roll-away bed sent to your room -- they only have couch sofas that you can pull out.  You can call room service and have them bring up a very thin cotton-top and sheets for the sofa bed though... but you will definitely feel springs digging into your back.  Well, I guess you don't have to worry about that too much if it's just your leech of a friend who is crashing at your place.
- the ""rooftop"" pool is on the 3rd floor... I didn't personally go, but my brother said it was ""alright.""

Now the positive stuff:
- Checked in on July 30, 2010.. was very quiet at the hotel, with no line at all.  I would venture to guess that Aria, having a casino, draws most of the guests that want to stay at the new city center.  I would also guess that since it is less packed, there were more open rooms... which was why we got a free upgrade to a corner-suite.
- I didn't realize how awesome the corner-suite was until the bellhop offered to give us a tour of the place... all around the perimeter you get an amazing view of the strip.  There is a full kitchen with dining table, fridge, freezer, microwave, dishwasher... you can also call room service for them to bring up plates\/utensils.  There is also a freakin mini washer\/dryer (it's in a cabinet, so don't go thinking it's an ugly, clunky machine sittin in your room).  The living room had a giant tv that had my name displayed in the top corner -- a nice, welcome touch.  The living room and bedroom are separated by a sliding door that can be locked.  There's another big TV to enjoy from the great bed (though, nothing outstanding for very new hotel).  The bathroom has 2 sinks, a tub with an amazing view of the city, and a 2-person shower.  The toilet isn't in its own enclosed space, which doesn't (or does it) allow the bathroom to be shared.  The bathroom has another entrance from the kitchen, so remember to lock both doors if you don't want someone walking in on you.

Seriously, the room was like an apartment.  I did order room service to enjoy a burger, but I was disappointed.  For $20, it's worth a very occasional splurge to eat in bed though =)

Oh, and there is a walkway leading to Bellagio that makes it convenient when you want to avoid the blistering summer sun.

First off, it's located right next to Aria. My friend and I got a bit lost trying to find the hotel and self parking lot. Turns out they don't have one. It's all VALET. Don't worry, it's complimentary, but I still tip though. The only problem I have with this is when you just wanna drop off your stuff for like 15 minutes, they still have to valet your car. So after you drop off your stuff, you are going to have to wait another 15 minutes for them to get your car. They wouldn't even let it sit on the sideline where all the other nice cars are. Plus, the line to leave on Sunday morning is ridiculous. It took over 30 mins for me to get my car. 

As for the room. I had two different friends stay here at the same time. One of them had the regular suite, with the king size bed and a killer view of the lake and strip. The other one had the corner suite, and that was just as good too. So much room and space. It also had a pull out couch which was very useful. 

The hotel is legitly just a HOTEL. Which has some good and bad points for me.

It is a hotel that put you at the midst of actions and still provides an escape from all the noisy casinos and cigar polluted air.

Room (4.5\/5 Stars) - The deluxe room is a pretty spacious suite with a decent size kitchenette and separate dining area. Microwave comes in handle at times but I wish they put a coffee maker there as well. Decor are modern and chic. Appliances are new but the cabinets seem a bit flimsy. Some already have dents and scratches. With the convertible queen size sofa bed in the living room and a king size bed, this room could fit 4 people. I like how the living and sleeping area are sectioned by the back to back LCD TVs. Bathroom is bright and roomy with a tub and a shower. The tub even has a shower head! What more can you ask for? Well...maybe a bit more counter top space. The sliding door for the bathroom is a bit hard to operate.

Location (4\/5 Stars) - Vdara is technically slightly off the strip but still very accessible. It is connected to Bellagio and is a short walk from the sister hotel Aria. I love the fact that I don't have to walk through any casino area to get on the strip. You could also use the monorail that takes you to Aria\/Crystal and Monte Carlo.

Service (5\/5 Stars) - Staff was courteous and service was almost flawless. My only complaint is that it took a while for the bell service to bring my luggage to my room.

Property Amenities (3.5\/5 Stars) - There are only one restaurants (limited hours) and one bar at this hotel. Although restaurants in Aria and Bellagio are still fairly accessible.

Overall a great place to stay and I would recommend Vdara to anyone who wouldn't mind a slightly different Vegas hotel experience.",3,0,3

If you want various restaurant options within your hotel, then Vdara is not for you. Vdara is probably one of the smallest hotels on the strip; they don't have a casino, and they only have one bar, one restaurant, and one mini cafe\/market (open until 8pm only). 

With that said, if you're looking for a luxurious home-away-from home in the heart of Sin City at a reasonable price, then Vdara is definitely the place for you. We didn't know that their rooms were all suites until we walked into our Vdara Suite to find a full kitchen, a washer and a dryer, a spacious living room, and a separate bedroom and bathroom. I'd never needed a microwave in my hotel room, but after staying at Vdara, I don't know how I ever survived without one. No more food gone to waste - simply keep it in the fridge and heat it up when you're hungry again. Also, the gigantic refrigerator eliminated the need for us to fill our bathtub with ice and use it as a cooler for our drinks - sweet! 

Housekeeping at Vdara is amazing. They did all of the usual things, but they also folded our clothes, lined up our shoes in a row, and basically lined up anything and everything they could see. We felt like our mothers had secretly gone in and cleaned up after us. Thank you!

Again, if you want the convenience of having everything Vegas has to offer right when you walk out of the elevator, then Vdara wouldn't be the best choice. However, if you're willing to walk through the hallway to Bellagio, across the roundabout to Aria, or down the sidewalk to Cosmopolitan, then definitely give this place a try!

Our room had a water leakage issue on our first night. We promptly switched to another room. Despite there was some Friday afternoon check-in madness, we were pleased the Service Man promptly put our request to get a new room for us. While I wish I could get an upgrade since we had to move things by ourselves (running out of bellmen to assist us since 4:30-5PM seemed to be a peak check-in time), I appreciated their speedy response and their effort to accommodate us!

While we all joked about the annoying staff member asking us to show our room key as we enter into the elevator lobby area, my husband and I appreciated such arrangement from the bottom of our hearts - the last thing we want to see is a random girl knocking our doors and asking for services. Call me old fashion - but I really feel safe and secure in this property. ha! 

I love the first room that we stayed (it's bigger than the 2nd room that we were placed). But both rooms were beautiful. I made our own simple breakfast in our suite after requesting kitchenware and cooking utensils. While there won't be enough equipment to make the most complicated meals, a pot and a pan is all you need to make a simple meal~~ And we keep on thinking that this place would be perfect if we return to vegas with our babies\/toddlers because of the kitchen, great sound isolation, and its location! Further, everyone we had met at this hotel were super friendly and helpful.

In my opinion their is no need to stay in the penthouse, save yourself $150\/night and stay in the corner suite.  The corner suite view is just ok but the view is 180 degrees.

As I am writing this, we're getting ready to leave for our fourth stay at Vdara this year.  It all started a few years ago when we were looking for a mini-vacation and were torn between Vdara and Aria.  We went with Vdara because it's nonsmoking.  We haven't looked back.  Prior to Vdara opening, we enjoyed THEhotel at Mandalay Bay but it's too far south on the strip for us.  

It was a little confusing the first time around to find the valet but we simply followed the signs and found ourselves in front of the hotel.  (We did do our research ahead of time and found out that Vdara did not have a parking lot so we had two options: park a little further away at Bellagio or Aria or valet.)  We ended up using valet our entire stay.  I have to admit that having to valet each time is a little annoying but it's still pretty inconvenient at hotels with parking structures.  Ever try to find your way out of the Miracle Mile shops to get to the Planet Hollywood parking structure or walk through the cobblestones at Paris?  Most people don't have cars when they visit Vegas.  We always rent one because we enjoy getting off the strip.

For the reviewer that said there's no do not disturb sign.  The do not disturb is built into the electronic panel near the door. The entire suite is controlled by these electronic panels placed throughout the suite.  It's not as complicated when you're staying in a regular suite but when you stay in one of the larger suites, you end up running around the suite trying to figure out which panels control which portion of which shade.  

When we got married in May, we (and most of our bridal party and family) stayed at Vdara even though our wedding was actually off the strip in Summerilin.  My room blocks were set up about a year before the wedding so were were able to lock in great rates.  The prices jumped through the roof after the Mayweather fight was announced.  We've always stayed on the Bellagio fountain view side so we don't know how the views are from a different side of the hotel.  We did stay in a panoramic suite once that had a partial Aria view but it was only partial.  The amenities in the larger suites are a bit nicer than the regular suite (full fridge, washer\/dryer, Keurig coffee brewer...) but we have been perfectly happy with the amenities of the regular suite.  For our wedding stay, we stocked the fridge full with alcoholic beverages, juices, Keurig k-cups, and other snacks for our family and friends to stop by in the days leading to the wedding.  I did a tour of the rooms before booking the suite because I was looking for a particular layout.  I wanted the vanity for hair and makeup.  I ended up booking the corner suite.

The only thing I'm not entirely happy about is the fact that they've changed from using Aveda toiletries to their own brand.  I loved collecting the little bottles of rosemary mint shampoos.  But it's pretty minor. 

Since discovering Vdara, I've stayed at other hotels a few times.  (Not by choice.  I was going with a group of girls so we stayed at the same hotel that everyone else selected.)  Each time I stay at a different hotel and each time I walk through the lobby of Bellagio, I am reminded of how much I hate having to walk through the crowded casino to find the elevators.  I get so turned around so I end up spending 15 minutes walking around in a circle. My husband stayed at the Cosmo for his bachelor party and he said he preferred Vdara.

We're not the type that use hotel staff services very often.  We travel with very few bags so we never use services of the bellhop.  We don't order room services.  We don't ask for additional towels.  During our wedding we did have to call for assistance for many things.  First I rented a full size SUV to drive all my wedding items to Vegas.  The fiance flew in two days after I arrived.  When I got to valet, I needed help with two wedding dresses, two rehearsal dinner dresses, 40+ out of town gift bags, bridal party gift bags, cork board for my escort cards, personalized water bottles for our in-room refrigerator, plus a multitude of wedding items.  To top it all off, the following day I came back with a few cases of beer, alcoholic beverages, mixers, macarons for the favors...the bell desk helped us with all these items.  We also had to call down for room service the third day there because fiance was hungry since he didn't eat the night before and immediately went out drinking.  Since we brought a lot of snacks and food into the room, we went through a lot of dishes, glasses, and flatware.  We ran the dishwasher and then discovered it was broken.  The engineer could not fix the dishwasher so he sent housekeeping with additional dishes, flatware, and glasses for us to use throughout our stay.  I felt bad for not washing them and just letting the dirty dishes pile up.  We also had a lot of trash.  The staff did a great job and we made sure we tipped well.",0,0,0

I got a great vacation package on Orbitz and was on a hunt for a casino\/smoke-free hotel for my mother and me. A big part of my decision rested on yelp reviews, and I am so glad it was true to what I read.

At check-in, I asked if I could get a room with a view of the Bellagio fountains. The lady at the desk got me the next standard suite right next to the premium view rooms (a $20-a-day upgrade would have gotten me that room) with a great view of the fountains and the rest of Las Vegas. 

The room was spacious! I loved the kitchenette, my mother hung out at the living room area and she complemented how big the bathroom was. The bed was soft and comfy, and house-keeping regularly made up the rooms and organized the scattered bottles\/clothes neatly. 

If you want something special for your bath in the tub, I recommend grabbing your foam bath solutions\/bath bombs\/bath oils outside as the Vdara does not have them en-suite and the hotel spa will run you a fortune for their bath solutions. 

The only star missing was due to their odd service about tea. Yep, tea. Calling the front desk got a keurig-style coffee maker and coffee cups to our room, but when I asked for tea they said they had none. A second call had the front desk clerk double-checking and he scrounged 4 green tea cups for me! I was delighted for the next 2 days - until I ran out on the 2nd last night. I tried asking the front desk and this time they insisted they had none. The staff who brought up the extra coffee found one green tea and two black teas for me though! He earned a handsome tip.

Vdara is a smoke-free hotel also, which is really nice. Once you open the front doors to the lobby, you get a nice whiff of the fragrance that is pumped through the vents of the hotel. I heard you can buy the fragrance also in the Spa & Salon. 

Check-in seemed to go smoothly. They have these nice floral displays by the front desk in these round bowl vases. We got the Executive Corner Suite, which was really nice!  Had a small dining area and kitchenette along with a stack-able washer and dryer and a small powder room. Our room was located on the 5th floor only and we had a view of the tram...not the most nicest view. I thought maybe since we had a bigger suite we'd be higher up. The bed was very comfortable to stay in and i slept like a baby every night! The main bathroom was abnormally large with a lot of extra space. It did have a double vanity which was nice. I was impressed by how modern the unlocking of the door was...just rub the room card against the designated area on the door and it unlocks. And instead of a Do Not Disturb sign that hangs on the front door handle, all you do is push a button from the inside. Same goes if you want maid service...just push a button. I guess the newer Hotels are becoming more modern with this type of stuff.

I did use the Spa and Salon service while we were here, thanks to my hubby!  The staff is very friendly. They have multiple services to choose from. I suggest you make an appointment in advanced. There are some services they only do on certain days so if you call ahead you can make sure the service you want is available. For the Spa area, they take you to an upstairs area and supply you with a plush robe and sandals to wear and a locker for your personal items. This is the same robe that is in the room closets also. You have full access to all the amenities there till the Spa closes which is wonderful! They have a main lounge area with a TV, variety of nuts to eat, tea, and water.  There is also a jacuzzi\/sauna area, shower, and multiple vanities with hair products to use. For the massages, they take you to another area where the massage rooms are and another lounge area, which was co-ed. They had a meditation room that you can use after your massage  with these chaise lounge chairs to lay in which had a wall fountain. The music playing was very serene. Now for my massage! The masseuse was very friendly and asked a few times if everything was okay for me. She always called me by name too. The massage itself was so relaxing, that i was very close to falling asleep!! I believe my masseuse's name was Nniya. (not sure on spelling) :)

After my massage i changed back into my regular clothes and went downstairs to the Salon area to get a blowout for my hair. Teddy was there to do my hair. First was the washing...which she made sure my hair was nice and clean. Then to the chair for the styling. I wanted loose curls and she did a great job! She curled my hair while blow drying it and using hair brushes as my curlers. No curling iron needed. I've never seen this done before and was surprised how great my hair turned out! She was friendly and made you feel very comfortable.

Didn't have any of the food from the Market Cafe, but we did eat from Bar Vdara. the beef sliders and fries were really yummy and the cocktail, Grown Up Grape Soda was delicious!!

Here are some of the Pro's and Con's i had about Vdara:

Pro's 
- Center of the strip and close to lots of great restaurants and shops.
- Spa and Salon were nice
- Bed was comfortable
- Kitchenette, washer and dryer in the room
- Smoke-free
- 2 bottles of water are supplied for you each day with maid service. (although they didn't give us any on the last maid service there)


Con's
- The hotel lobby needs another small store for mainly toiletries and other stuff. The Market Cafe had a small wall of these but it's mainly a restaurant and what they had was very limited. 
- The black out curtains are not really ""black out curtains"". Its a digital shade that comes down, but it doesn't cover the ends of the window seal so there's gaps on each end of each window which lets enough light in to wake you up!",3,0,0
367261,4X4wfgrrbC38gZCz1XfRmg,C9aipyN2JvkWWjMRRWFB2g,WYw3Uf56DT5IwpaLNnCH5Q,2,2012-11-25,"Vdara is just... not as luxurious or nice or accessible as other high end hotels on the strip. The last time I came to Vegas, I stayed in Encore in a suite that was about the same size as the standard suite at Wynn, and even though Vdara is newer, it lacked in the small touches that made Wynn awesome. 

Vdara is like when you rent an apartment that was designed to look nice on the outside but when you actually start living in it, everything becomes a bit unworkable or unpleasant. Since Wynn is my standard now, and Wynn is where I will stay if I ever want to stay in a suite again (which is absolutely possible), I will compare it to Wynn below.

Refrigerator: Vdara has a TINY TINY fridge you can use for your perishables\/desserts\/leftovers. HOWEVER. It is like a third the depth of a normal cube refrigerator you find in dorm rooms. Totally unworkable, annoying, and kind of defeats the purpose. No freezer at all. Wynn, however, does not have ANY fridge. Point Vdara.

Kitchen: Vdara has a tiny kitchenette in their standard rooms. We decided to buy breakfast food and we brought a hot water kettle and french press with us to save on the exorbitantly high coffee prices others have complained about. We also got the cooking supplies, which in theory are great. However, its really hard to cook for yourself when they provide you the bare minimum utensils, and you forgot your seasonings and there are no kitchen towels or other amenities to help you other than what they bring. No sponge to clean up after yourself (we used a washcloth from the bathroom or paper napkins). Additionally, the kitchen only has a tiny trash bin, which is unlined, and the tile is VERY loud if you drop anything on it. Just... unworkable. However, Wynn doesn't have a kitchen. Reluctant point to Vdara. It seems clear that Vdara doesn't really want you to use the kitchen. They kept pushing things on us when we asked for kitchen supplies (such as room service).

Distance from the strip: Vdara and Aria tout their prime location on the strip in city center, however, I would venture to say that it will take anyone who is walking at a fast pace (we both are fast walkers) at LEAST fifteen, if not twenty minutes just to reach one of the bridges across the strip. Let alone, anywhere other than Vdara or Aria (Bellagio is attached to Vdara, but to get there is still a trek, and you are FAR from the strip). Wynn was a much shorter walk down. The only concern is that Wynn isn't in the middle of the strip. However, we didn't have to leave our room 40 minutes ahead of time to get somewhere we wanted to go (either by foot or by car, see below), so point Wynn.

Parking distance: It took just as long to get to our car (because Vdara doesn't have its own self-park garage and we don't want to pay tips for valet parking every time we get our car--which is often) as it took to get to the strip. We found ourselves DREADING going anywhere, and I had to discard my cute shoes because my feet were killing me after the first night here. I didn't discover that valet parking was complimentary until looking at a review to the right. No one told us. Wynn was NORMAL. You park, get into the building, walk a few hundred feet, hit your elevator, and then go to your room. Point Wynn.

Techy Things in the Suite:  Both Wynn and Vdara have switches to open and close the shades. However, Wynn's also include a do not disturb\/maid service request button (to show on the outside of the suite) conveniently located next to the bed. Vdara's are all near the kitchen, a good fifteen feet away from the bed. Wynn's includes extra light switches too. You can get in bed, press your buttons, and not leave again. In Vdara, you have to get out of bed and walk fifteen feet to turn off the lights next to the bed, to open or close the shades. You have to walk to the DOOR (twenty-five feet away) in order to turn on the do not disturb. This is what I was referring to when I talked about being like an apartment designed by someone who never has to use it. Point Wynn.

Power outlets in convenient locations: I like to have my phone next to me when I sleep, especially because I need white noise to sleep away from home. Imagine my surprise in Vdara when I literally COULD NOT find an outlet closer than the bathroom (ten feet away) for my phone, or about ten feet away on the other side under the window... No outlets next to the bed. Motel 6 has outlets next to the bed. WTF Vdara? Wynn obviously has these. Point Wynn.

Customer Service: Both places had lots of really nice people working in housekeeping and customer service. Vdara made several errors sending people to our suite when we didn't ask. Housekeeping was VERY aggressive, but that's better than ignoring. Points? Even.

altogether, given the hassle of getting to the strip, the pushing to spend more money, and the not-well-thought out amenities, I vote Wynn all the way. Hearing delivery noises in the mornings also sucked. I won't be coming back to Vdara.",2,2,0

I was a little nervous to stay here.  I read the yelp reviews about the service and the location and I was concerned.  Yelp, for the first time, you let me down.

The room:  The room was about 550 square feet.  The space was well used, big enough for a kitchenette, a full sized couch, and large closet.  The bathroom was roomy.  The decor of the room was modern, yet simple.  The bed was nice and firm, which is a huge plus for me as my back usually aches from overly soft Vegas beds.  All the rooms are smoke free, which is a huge reason we stayed here.

Location:  The hotel doesn't have any strip frontage.  I assume if you are driving here, the lone curvy on ramp is hard to find.  To get to the hotel from the Strip, you have to walk through the Bellagio (shorter) and the Monte Carlo.  Which way you choose would depend on which way on the strip you want to go.  The walk from the from entrance of the Bellagio to the Vdara elevators takes about five minutes if you are moving briskly.  It is much quieter than your average hotel, so take that as a plus or minus based on your needs.  For me it was a plus.

Staff:  The staff couldn't have been nicer.  When we arrived, a bellwoman gave us the layout, including the quickest way to the strip.  Our luggage was checked at the curb and we were on our way in five minutes.  There wasn't a line at the front desk when we returned two hours before scheduled check in.  No problem about the time, the clerk said and we were checked in within another five minutes.  Once inside the room, we had to call the bell desk for a bags.  Somehow they arrived in five minutes (getting a theme here).  By comparison, last time I stayed in the Bellagio, it took something like 20 minutes to get my bags.  I was able to check out through the TV and then a call to the front desk, in under five minutes.  All those interactions are good for even a small hotel, but fantastic for a midsized hotel like Vdara.

Overall:  We had excellent service in a quiet smoke free room with a longer than average walk from the strip.  Assuming that the price stays competitive (it was only slightly more expensive for us than the Luxor and a few hundred dollars less than Ceasars for three nights) it will be the first place we check next time we go to Vegas.",3,0,1

It seems a little tucked away, but your actually a skywalk away from Bellagio. There is no casino floor, but with that you get rid of a lot of drunk old people smoking 24\/7 which I welcome with open arms.

Price was super reasonable with the recent slump in tourism. 

Bar was kind of shitty. Vodka tonics were coming as Vodka sodas the entire trip. But relaxing area, and some snacks while you drink which come complimentary. I'm a sucker for those kind of things.

Shout out to Bank of America for putting a hold on my debit card for unusual activity and making my check-in last half an hour. I really needed that after an eight hour drive. If you use a debit card, they take a $300 deposit (understandable) that you obviously get back upon check out.

Vdara is awesome. The rooms are huge with great views and dual HD TVs. The pool is nice too. It closes by 7 PM but by that time everyone's getting ready to start their night. You can never start too early. Probably my only complaint was the lack of restaurants. There's a small bar and a cafe on the lobby floor, that's it. The cafe didn't really look appealing, so most of the time we went to Aria or somewhere on the strip.

It is a short walk into the Bellagio from here and The Cosmopolitan is also nearby as is Aria. But the room!!! The room was very clean, sleek, modern and very spacious. I had a ""Premium View Room"" which was given to me when I asked the clerk for a high floor with a view of the Bellagio fountains. She whispered that she would put me on the 51st floor in a premium view room, I was so happy I tipped her $20. The room had AMAZING views! Panoramic view from the mountains to strip to actually seeing planes make their approach to McCarran. One might say you don't go to Vegas to stay in the room but this room kind of makes you want to stay in it!

The bed is SUPER comfortable, I want to find the mattress brand and type and buy one for home! The view was amazing. We initially had a stopped up bathroom toilet and we called for service and it was resolved within 45 minutes. We also had no problems getting Housekeeping as I have heard others say but then we never called later than 2 PM.

I asked the front desk girl about a room, which was $139.  Ok, thats pretty good but there are rooms all over this city, and that didn't seem like it was the best they could do.  I inquired about a complimentary upgrade.  After a brief and muted phone call, she offered us a Vdara suite, which was twice the size of a regular room, and had a full sized kitchen.  This is what I'm talking about.  Even though we didn't spend any real time in the room, it is always nice to feel like you're getting a deal!

The room, amazing, with a nice view of the pool from the living room.  We later learned that these rooms were designed to be condos, but with the economy and all...  We didn't use the washer and dryer.

The pool was understated compared with some of the over the top pools on the strip (and off strip Hardrock and Palms!!) but you could get your drink on and keep cool.

I heard the spa was amazing.  Maybe next time.  I heard the food was amazing, definitely next time.  The convenience to Bellagio and Aria were appreciated as well.

Check in was great. I checked in early and my room wasn't ready. No big deal - I said I would wait if I could have a high floor. I got that and a view of the fountains!
First night was great. Don't bother bringing shampoo - theirs is amazing! You do have to request a robe to be brought up though. I would have expected it. Next morning I am ready for a cup of coffee and realize there is no coffee maker in the room. Even the Holiday Inn has a coffee maker! My coworker had the same dissapointment. Apparently that's an additional $20 fee. Bummer but I'll survive (there is a Starbucks in the lobby)
Flashfoward to that night. After some dinner drinks and gambling (loosing money) I am eating leftover pizza in my kitchen area. I drop the pizza on the counter. Normally I would clean it up myself - I'm not a diva - but there are no paper towels or dish cloth. No big deal I leave the mess. Next day off to work I go. Come back and it is still on the counter (white counter easy to see). I wipe it up with a bathroom towel. This is when I notice my kitchen trash (tiny and full) still hasn't been taken out. 
My coworker also had an issue with her room. They came in, took her towels, didn't replace them of make the bed. It's like they don't finish a room.
The following night they cleaned up everything but took all my glasses (which were dirty) but never left more. I could have cleaned them but the kitchen has no dish soap, towels, etc

I think my favorite part is that it is a non-smoking hotel, in a land of dirty, stinky, smokey hotels and casinos. It smelled like a spa, which was a breath of fresh air, literally. Plus you can get to the Belliago through a walkway if you want to gamble at all hours of the night, without walking outside. 

The room we were in was nice, king size bed, really nice bathroom with huge tub and small kitchen area with Keurig coffee maker. I loved the aveda products in the bathroom.

They have great smoothies at the pool and private cabanas with dipping pools, if you are willing to fork over some of your winnings : ) 

The only downsides for me were the ""resort fee"" that I read about in reviews before we went (I wish it was just included in the price of the room) and that we seemed to get lost in the City Center area every time we attempted to walk back to our hotel.

Yes the rooms are nice and the amenities are convenient (like the kitchenette) but the customer service can definitely improve.  I loved the bell desk service and the valet but we did not have a very enjoyable stay. 

Our room kept having this clicking sound that kept us up all night.  We tried turning off the AC since it seemed to be coming from the vent but that didn't fix the problem.  We tried looking in the closet, opening and closing doors, etc etc etc and it persisted.  Finally we just fell asleep since we were too exhausted to complain to the front desk.  

The next day we decided to ask to be switched to another room.  The rude front desk lady said nothing was available (and this was SUNDAY aka the day everyone checks out).  She promised somebody from maintenance would come up to check the problem and IF there was something wrong THEN we would be moved to another room.  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  We waited and waited and nobody came up.  Finally the bf called again and this time a nice gentleman upgraded our room and waived our resort fee.  Yes I appreciated this greatly but would have been happier if they had just comped one night of our stay.  

I do think this hotel is beautiful but honestly I'd rather stay somewhere with a casino. And of course our stay wasn't that great because of a bad stroke of luck and a very moody person at the front desk.

They had a walkway to the Bellagio so it was near everything but felt a little distanced. 

When I checked in they convinced me to upgrade my room to a corner suite and I was able to check in 4 hours before check in time. The corner suite was beautiful with plenty of space and a great view of the strip. It took a bit for me to figure out how to get the blinds open (button by the door). The bathroom was my favorite part with a huge soaking tub overlooking the strip and plenty of space for the boyfriend and I to spread out. 

The cons? It was not quite at the level you would hope for at the price. After the first night we only received 3 glasses per night in the living room and none in the bathroom. I think they thought there were 3 of us since I called down to get a robe and slippers that would fit me (the ladies one was a bit small). There was no coffee maker and nothing in the room in the way of flatware or utensils. Which I wouldn't expect from other hotels but we had a full kitchen in our room and nothing to work with. I felt like I was calling down to housekeeping all the time which interfered with relaxing in my room. 

I did enjoy the easy check out using the link they emailed me. I was able to check out at 10:59 (ie right before the mandatory time of 11) without waiting in line. It was weird that housekeeping knocked on our door around 9am to ask how long we were going to be there. I have the room until 11 let me enjoy my robe and slippers a little longer!

1) Upon driving to Vdara (if you've ever stayed there), it is a bit difficult to locate its front entrance.  Yes, it's on Harmon Avenue, but once you've figured out that you have to drive 'up' the driveway and loop around via facade of the Aria, you finally get to the 'hotel.'

2) They do not have any self-parking, which is great\/fine, but of course this immediately sets the expectation.  Complimentary valet should only be the beginning of the seamless experience you 'should' have.  

3) The front desk attendant whom assisted us seemed to be more concerned with exposing her beauty regimen all over the front counter where her computer is situated.  This should have been the red flag to let us know that the employees of the Vdara are more concerned with their lip gloss application, versus the paying guests of the so-called 'hotel.'

4) I get it, the Vdara was suppose to be a condo building, but given the mortgage crisis, they had to convert the property to a hotel.  It would have been all said and done, if they followed through with the vision.  What hotel on earth only has 1 bed in EVERY room?  With three guests, we had a Queen bed with a pull-out sofa bed.  Good luck on finding any guest who is willing to be a returning guest and sleep on a sofa conversion again.  If you're going to be a hotel, make the investment on getting some double beds into your suites.  

5)  Upon entering the room, the room was clean and modern.  (Give the 'hotel' another 6 months and the beige carpet will turn into a deep brown color.  Good luck on steam cleaning those carpets on a regular basis.)  Nothing to really complain about on the room... we head out for a long joyous evening around the town.

6)  Returning to the room at around 1am, we are all quite exhausted and want to call it an evening.  That's tough when the room is not stocked with any sheets or pillows for the sofa bed.  Vdara, if you're depending on your sofa beds to fully substitute a bed, make sure you have the sheets and pillows already in the room.  Who on earth wants to call and request them at 1am?  Additionally, if they already knew there would be 3 occupants, its a no brainer to already have the sheets\/pillows in the room.  

7)  We had then made a request for some champagne flutes and bowls to be sent to our room.  (i.e. we were out in the town during the day and wanted to return to our room to have a couple glasses of champagne with some snacks.  Thus, we called the 'hotel' to send up some flutes and bowls to our room, so that we could immediately take in the wonderful view of the hotel room.)  6 hours later, we return to our room with no champagne flutes, nor any bowls.  We called the front desk, and there was no apology for the delay.  Of course, we wait in excess of 30 min.  Unacceptable in my opinion.

8)  As a no gaming hotel, no restaurant, at least keep your mini convenient store open 24hrs.  What good is it to have a kitchen in your room with a refrigerator, when you close your lobby grocery store?  (Also note, dinnerware and utensils are upon request only.)

9)  I can not remember during any of my travels where a hotel secures their iron to the ironing board via bungee cord.  Your guest don't want to steal them, and if they did, just charge it on the room.  Having your irons closely secured to the ironing board is just plain stupid.

10)  On one of the days we were there, we decided to go sit by the pool.  Who wants to do that if the bar is not even open?  If you're going to open the pool area, you should open the pool bar.

I know, I sound like a tough one to please, but really, much of this is a no brainer in operating a '5-star hotel'.  Vdara, decide on what you want to be: a Condo building, or a Hotel?  You shouldn't advertise yourself as a hotel, but keep the service level of a Condo with HOA fees.

In all, I would have rather stayed at the decrepit Circus Circus Hotel.  At least they are not posing to be a 5 star (Orbitz rating) hotel.  I'll pass on this one.  Next time I'll stay at the Cosmopolitan.

I would like to give them 1 star, but I'll rate the Vdara with 2, given the rooms were nice (for now).

My suggestion:  If you're looking to stay at a full-service hotel, don't stay at the Vdara.",6,1,0

We had stayed here the previous season so we were upgraded from a one bedroom to two bedroom immediately. 

It is nice to stay at a place that does not have a casino so it is quiet and there is a lot less foot traffic inside. My only gripe is the long walk back from the strip. Either go through the Cosmopolitan or criss-cross back and forth on Harmon. Oh well, that is tge price you pay for a quiet retreat.

The room was beautiful with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountain. The bed was very comfortable and I loved the tall glass shower and the deep bath tub. The Aveda shampoos and plush robes were a nice addition!! 

We stayed at the Flamingo the night before, and this was quite a step up! The only thing the Flamingo does better is its location on the Strip. The poor Vdara is buried up in the new City Center and while I loved being so close to Aria and it's brunch, I dont think this part of vegas is as happening as the Strip. 

I loved that we stayed somewhere without a Casino--it was a nice break for my wallet!!

LITERALLY months! my girlfriends & i were coming from all over the united states to meet up. (turns out, half of my gf's are flakes & it turned out only being 3 of us!!). anyway, we all wanted to get away & have a little fun & relaxation. vegas? relax? yeah, thats what i thought too. so i booked our rooms at vdara because it was a non gaming non smoking hotel with a spa. uh, yes please! 
once i got off the shuttle from hell (freon had all leaked out & the driver didnt tell us until we were on our way that we were without ac!), i walked into the hotel & i think i heard the angels singing! this place is amazing. calm, relaxed, kind of an art deco thing going on all over the place. (the restaurant looked a little out of place, but whatever.)
check in was a breeze. unfortunately there wasnt any upgrades available since there was a conference that checked in that morning. (the girl helping the person next to me told that guy the same thing so im thinking theyre telling the truth.). i forgot to tell my credit card company that i was leaving the state, so when the girl helping me swiped my card, she told me in a low voice that it was declined. (there werent very many people around, but she still took the courtesy to do that. very cool.) anyway, she gave me the option of using another card or cash. THEN she mentioned to me in that same low voice ""if you use cash, you get it right back when you check out, rather than waiting two weeks before showing up on your card again!"" SOLD-i used cash, called the credit card company from my room, and used that for dinner that night instead! 
finally got into my room. it was AWESOME. its HUGE w\/ a small kitchenette (no oven, but there is a microwave, stovetop, & mini fridge). i really liked the size of the bathroom. with three girls staying there, we had PLENTY of room & werent tripping all over each other. there was a pull out sofa which house keeping turned out for us every night & folded back up every morning. it was actually reasonably comfortable considering it was a sofa bed. 
the view wasnt of the bellagio fountains, but it was still amazing. it was the backside of some of the other hotels & the mountains in the background. SO pretty.
i fell in love with the shower. theres an adjustable shower head (it has a rain shower setting & goes to a massage setting.) and it was about as big as the half bath in my house!
the housekeeping staff was AWESOME. everytime we left, we came back to a tidy\/clean room. 
the gym was kind of small, but really, how many people are gonna go to the gym at any one time while in vegas? it was really nice though. it syncs up with the nike+ running system on the treadmills. it also has small tv screens that you can watch while running. there were also some other machines, but i didnt really use them. HINT: if you run out of bottled water in your room, theres PLENTY in the gym! you wont have to go buy any. 
use the walkway to bellagio to get to the strip. its the quickest way! in a couple of minutes youll be back to the hustle & bustle of vegas!

overall everything was AWESOME. i absolutely loved it. im thinking this trip should be an annual thing....",1,0,1

My buddies and I stayed at Vdara for my bachelor party and really enjoyed our stay at the hotel. I knew going in there was no casino or restaurants in the building, but that was fine with the group because weren't big on gambling, and we're not afraid to walk around and find new places to eat. There is also only valet, and no self-parking like other hotels...heads up! If I remember right, my friend said the valet was free for guests.
After being hungover from the night before, we arrived pretty early (11am), and luckily 1 of our rooms was ready so we could drop our stuff and seek food. As soon as we walked into the lobby area, we could tell this place was going to be different...no smoking or stale casino air! Instead it smelled great, and new. The front desk service was the best any of us had ever seen. Check in was quick, we were upgraded on that room for free as well. It might have helped we were a bachelor party but nonetheless we were taken care of, which was cool.
My best man booked us a City Corner suite w\/ an adjoining regular room, and we were very impressed. I had the master bedroom in the main suite, and had the sickest view of city center, all of Bellagio's property including their fountain show and lake, and the wide open area NW and west of the strip (Rio's area)! Literally the entire wall of my room (bathroom included!) was a full-on big window...so cool, especially at night. Also included was a full on kitchen (no plates or silverware) w\/ Keurig coffee maker (nice touch), 4 flat screens, nice amenities, and full all in one media center box (which was good because they didn't have any ipod docking stations, but could hook up to this and play through the flat screen). The bathrooms were the nicest I had experienced in Vegas. 
The concierge was amazing as well with very friendly and humorous service, as we got some help w\/ club info and other details. The only thing I would say that was kind of weird, was they tacked on a ""Resort Fee"" (?) of $20-ish a day for wi-fi, and phone charges, etc. (my friend told us about it later on). There was absolutely no noise whatsoever...not even a vacuum or talking cleaning crew in the morning, which was nice. There is a small store\/market in the lobby that actually had some pretty good sandwiches and snacks. The valet team was great as well. We were all very happy with the stay, experience, and hotel.

This trip, I was pregnant. Thus, I wanted a place on the strip, but without cigarette smoke or a casino.  This delivered. The amenities were lovely. Nice linens, a pleasant, modern style, a mini kitchen, so you can reheat and store leftovers (which was ideal for us).  We got room service as we had a food credit there, and it was quite good.  Chicken tenders that were crisp and flavorful, and onion soup that I suppose could have been a touch less salty, but it was tasty and hot.  Our room had two flatscreen tvs, in a fairly small space, and a nice view, which was a partial view of the Bellagio fountains.  

The Vdara is connected to the Aria and Bellagio, so for most of our activities, we didn't even have to step foot on the strip, unless we wanted to. I'm a fan of that as well. The lobby was very mellow and quiet, and because there are no major activities there, you get an instant sense of calm when you walk in. That's just not the norm for Vegas, and it's quite comforting.

The hotel bar is almost non-existent, and almost always deserted, and they have a restaurant downstairs called silkwood or silkworm or something like that... and in the 56 hours I was in Vegas I saw nobody in there.

Don't get me wrong, the Vdarra is a great alternative option for accommodations on The Strip.  I like how this hotel doesn't have a casino and is smoke free.  My room was upgraded to an executive suite which included a washer\/dryer, kitchen, king sized bed and a couch that converted into a mattress.  It was perfect for my group of friends and I to rest comfortably.  One thing that bugged me about the suite was that you can smell a hint of mildew (?) in the air.  Luckily it wasn't too strong and was easy to cover up with an air freshener.

The pool area was fine. I'm in the minority of those who doesn't like to tan my skin to death so it would have been nice if there were shaded areas to lounge around in.  

We also were not aware that the Vdarra charges a $22.40 front desk fee after our stay.  One of my girls called to inquire why we were charged for that.  The reason was that this covered the use of the pool and spa, water bottles and phone usage (which we all didn't take advantage of minus the pool).

I was okay with that until the invited guest check in host said that the suites were pre assigned to guests already who booked in advance.

Also, there was one person in line ahead of me in the invited guest check in line and the regular line moved much faster, helping around 10 people before I was helped.
Another complaint was I was not given my spa passes until the last day, which I had to ask for and was not able to use. I asked if one of the other guests that were staying at the Vdara could use it and I was told ""No"" because I had to be present. I was just very unsatisfied and disappointed about everything there.   
I was given 2 rooms on the same floor but it took over two hours before the problem was resolved. I was given 2 champagne bottles and a $25 room credit for each room.

So, decided to go to Vegas for the weekend and stay here since I had heard much hype of this hotel. We started with the Deluxe suite which was reasonably priced but then we wanted to upgrade, they did not have the Vdara suite available but offered us an Executive Suite. Upon our entrance to the suite, we had found the bed unmade, looked exactly like someone just crawled out of bed. Since we were anxious to get out on the vegas strip, we called the front desk to ask for the bed to be made BUT as we started to really think about it.....was the room really clean??? Really made us not want to stay in that room. So we called for another room, since they had no more rooms available we were forced to downgrade our room, but we figured that was better than sleeping in a dirty room. 

We were promised the Executive Suite next day at noon but when next day noon cames along, the room was not ready for us. Not only was it not ready for us but they promised it at 3 so we went out and explored vegas for a bit, came back at around 6 only to find that our key to the room, WITH ALL our stuff in there to not work. We went to the front desk for them to only give us another key for the SAME room because the room we had been waiting for all day still was NOT cleaned because they cleaning staff was backed up. We came back into our original room which was at least clean but found that they had left a cleaning spray bottle in our room labeled ""water"" I really hope that's not all they clean with!! We also still found food in the refrigerator from past guests, not sure how long ago because the room seemed to have been cleaned twice from my stay but the fridge did not seem to have been cleaned during my time! So beware if you are staying there and want to store food in the fridge. 

We actually did not get our room until 9pm which was a complete disappointment but still trying to be optimistic, we were excited to check it out and still enjoy our Vegas trip! But WOW, when we got to the new room, there was a hole in the wall which we called the front desk to notify them (just in case they thought it was us and charged us) but they were already aware of it! Not only that but one of the sinks in the bathroom was leaking!!! Good thing there were two sinks in that restroom. Everything just seemed to have gone worse and worse for Vdara. We were checking out the next day anyway so did not really get a chance to enjoy the room due to all of the waiting. I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED on my experience with Vdara. 

They compensated us $100 to use at Vdara so we used it for room service. The first night after coming back from Surrender at Encore, we decided to order food, their late night menu did not have very many choices so we just went with Quesadillas and fried rice. How could you go wrong with that? YUP! They went very wrong!! The Quesadillas were made with cheap cheese, but the fried rice is what disappointed me the most. I could barely chew the rice because it practically was not cooked! Not sure what kind of style they were trying to go for but the food is definitely not worth a try! To use up the rest of the hundred, we ordered room service the next day as well to try the day menu. There were a lot more choices, the wings and steak we ordered were okay. Definitely not worth the price....$40 steak. WOW. DO NOT try the food!! You are better off anywhere else but here. 

Like I said before, I expected much more from Vdara. Especially if they are trying to be a ""5 star hotel."" Its not worth the grief to stay there. I feel like Vdara took a lot of time away from my Vegas trip. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone, this hotel is as wrong as it gets! Their cleaning crew seems to be having very many problems, they really just need to get their act together for the better of the hotel. Front desk clerks, even management needs to be changed. They honestly do not even deserve one star!",4,1,0

The view from the suite was amazing, I could see the entire strip, including overlooking the Bellagio fountains. The room itself was so luxurious that I couldn't believe I got to stay there.

I stayed here on two separate occasions in the same week. I packed once for both trips and just left my luggage with the bell desk in between my stays. I flew back a day later and retrieved my luggage without any issue.

The rooms come with, at minimum, a mini-fridge. Couches are pull-outs. The rooms are pretty spacious.

It is very modern in design, they have a perfume\/air freshener that they pump into all the public spaces which makes a pleasant change to the smoke you can smell in other\/older casino's.

The rooms are pretty spacious, all of them have pretty much a full kitchen (and I think laundry!)  We try and stop by a grocery store to pick up some wine, cheese & crackers - but the kitchen is also excellent for all the leftovers you will have from all the restaurants you will be visiting.

I think we stayed in a standard room the first time we tried Vdara, but on our second visit we saw ""City View Corner Suites"" and would highly recommend them - they don't typically have a view of the Strip (but we have been to Vegas enough times that isn't a big deal any more), but they are much larger, and have a lot of glass - so the light & views (even of the back of the strip & the Interstate) are pretty amazing.

The first time we stayed there the cafe didn't have many choices, but since they have expanded it along with a small selection of snacks (pretty pricey, but more convenient than going out to a grocery store).

The pool is large, but can get busy - as well as the music being way too loud sometimes! - the cocktails they serve are very good.

The fitness center is pretty large, they have something like 6 or 8 treadmills, some free weights and about 6 or 8 fixed weight machines - it does get busy in here though.

This is now our ""go to"" place to stay in Vegas (we have tried Bellagio, Wynn, Paris) and if the thought of not having to walk through a smokey & loud casino to get to your room is appealing you should definitely check this place out.

The valet parking is 10 steps from the front desk, so you again don't have a long walk to get your car.

It's centrally located, and is connected to the Bellagio by a covered walkway. It's also right next to Aria. I don't get the people who complained about it taking forever to get to the strip. Yeah, it took a few minutes, but I can imagine it would take the same amount of time if you were staying in a casino by the time you walk through it to get outside.

Kitchen has a keurig coffee maker with coffee enough for two people. We called for more, and they brought some, no extra charge. The fridge had two vdara water bottles. When we called for the coffee, they even gave us extra water bottles too, no extra charge.

We had to call twice for extra bed linens and for the sofa bed to be made up. But the lady who came to do the sofa bed was very nice. 

We wanted to check out the spa and called for specials for hotel guests- that was a bust. No discounts, no specials, no nada! The spa was VERY pricey.

The hotel doesn't boast the best restaurants or clubs, but it is known for its spa and low key vibe. 

Compared to all the other hotels, the air quality was not only smoke free, but actually fragrant! Yep, they were actually blowing in scented air- smelled like candy. Mmm candy...

The room I stayed in boasted a magnificent view of the strip. It was wonderfully clean, beautifully decorated, and spacious. The moment I walked in, I was instantly at ease. With most of the hotels in Vegas you can't avoid 'casino' smell. You know, booze, smokes, and someone else's left over good times (ewww). This place, however, was clean. I'm pretty sensitive to casino air, so when I relaxed comfortably in my room hack free and sans bloodshot eyes, I was ecstatic.

I've stayed at vdara twice now and have been impressed on both occasions. 

* STUDIO SUITE *
On my first stay at Vdara, I decided to book two adjacent rooms for my birthday so my friends could stay in my room and my other friend could have her friends in hers. I loved my experience here but I will admit that even having 4 people with the extended sofa bed does get a little crowded, despite it being almost 600 square feet. 

* EXECUTIVE CORNER SUITE *
On my second stay here we celebrated our friend's birthday and decided to go big! We booked the adjacent studio suite next to it to fit more guests and even though it was a long walk to the end of the hall, the view was AMAZING! The room itself was amazing! One bedroom suite with 1 bathroom that connects from the bedroom and the dining area as well. You also get a full-size refrigerator and kitchenette at your disposal. My only gripe here is that the hallway to the dining area is pretty tight, but other than that I loved my stay. 

* PARKING *
Probably one of the most annoying things about Vdara is that it's tucked away between (and behind) Aria and Cosmopolitan. They do not have their own self parking structure so you're forced to do valet. On the times that I've stayed here, it was still complimentary, but I believe with the new parking rates only gold members get complimentary. 

Because it's valet-only, expect to wait several minutes for your vehicle to arrive, especially during peak hours aka check in and check out. 

* GETTING AROUND *
Because Vdara is conveniently located near everything, it's just about walking distance to your destination! You can utilize the tram that stops at City Center Aria to Bellagio hotel (and Monte Carlo alternatively), or you can access a bridge by foot that will take you into Bellagio's casino level as well. You can also opt to walk to the street to access Cosmopolitan.

I've stayed in the Deluxe Suite, corner Business Suite (Rm 6002) and Vdara Suite (Rm 43010).

The Business Suite and Vdara Suite are basically the same except that the view from the business suite that we were in was the Aria Shuttle (looks like the Disneyland monorail). The view at our Vdara Suite was pretty nice, we could see the strip, including the bellagio water show.

List of things that impressed me:
- kitchen sink\/stove\/cabinetry
- separate door for the bedroom
- pull out sofa, dining table
- full sized stainless steel refrigerator
- electronic blackout curtains\/shades
- washer\/dryer set
- bathtub
- 2 free water bottles per night

List of things we needed to call for:
- extra towels
- setting up the pullout sofa
- detergent
- pots\/pans\/cookware
- extra soap

Convenience Store
The walk to the nearest convenience store is a few minutes away. Around the roundabout to Aria and through Aria's entrance, you'll immediate see ""Elements"" which is Aria's 24\/hr convenience store.

Cosmopolitan
We found that walking outside alongside cosmopolitan was the quickest way to get there. It beats walking through Aria, then the mall, then over the bridge.

Earl of Sandwiches
Again, walking right alongside the Cosmopolitan hotel was the quickest way to get to Earl of Sandwiches.

Planet Hollywood vs Vdara - Go Vdara
If your decision is to either stay at Planet Hollywood or Vdara, I would probably stay at Vdara based on the quality of the room that you get for the price. No, it doesnt have a casino, but think of that as a good thing, for most.

Customer Service
The front desk was extremely attentive to our needs. Housekeeping was fairly quick, with the exception of check-in times. Make sure to request that your sofa bed get done when the sun is down, you'll get a lot quicker service this way. Be nice to your housekeeping lady that fixes up your room because most likely, she'll be the one fixing up your room the next day as well, tip her the first day at minimum.

Late Night Munchies
Sorry, no late night munchies at Vdara except for room service, you'll have to walk to Aria for that.

Cafe Downstairs
The food takes about 20 minutes to get, so you'll have to be patient. Luckily, I was working on my laptop using my tethered internet, so it was a pleasant time while I was there.

Free Wifi (512kbps included)
Don't expect fast internet, it's slow, for free. Fast if you pay? I'm not sure, I didn't rely on their internet, I just tethered.

AT&T iPhone 5 Reception
The reception is good when you're on the lower floors. I had LTE on the lower floors. However, up on the 43rd floor, it took forever for pages to load while browsing. Reception was also a bit choppy for the people I was talking to on the phone. It's not the hotel's fault, it's just that I was too high up.

Pool
Don't expect much, it's a little pool with a bunch of seats to lay down on. They provide towels. They check your room key before letting you enter. There's a large rectangular spa as well. The music is ok, could be louder and more modern selection.

In short, my stay was great.",6,1,1

We had a rental for the first 24 hours while we were in town and the valet was always quick and easy to use. After that we used Uber and the pick-up spot was well-marked.

Our room was a corner suite, Bellagio side on the 50th floor. The view was fantastic! This also meant that we had only one neighbor and the shared wall was the kitchen, shower\/bathtub side of the room so there was next to no sound transfer. 

The bedroom is surrounded by the bath and living rooms so in there, the most you'll hear is the ""thunder"" from the Bellagio fountains. From the living room, I'd sometimes hear someone else's door close but that was it.

The room was clean on the whole. Our fridge worked great. I appreciated having a make-up vanity but do wish it had been on the window side because natural light is better.  

And yes, the automatic window shades are pretty cool. They do a great job blocking out the strip lights at night but it would be nice if they had less gaps for those days when you're trying to take a day-time nap.

We stayed in mid-June with a killer deal from Hotwire ($89\/night!!). My boyfriend tried the ""sandwich trick"" (look it up if you don't know what this is - it's totally worth it) and we were upgraded to a suite with a view of the Bellagio fountains on the 52nd floor. Even though for a suite it was very small, they utilize the space very well. The room was spotless, the bed comfortable, and the bathroom was extremely spacious!! Not to mention the Aveda bathroom products! 

It's a non-smoking, non-gambling hotel, so it's definitely not for everyone. But for people like us that need some time away from the smoke-filled rooms, half naked women dancing on tables, and the everlasting DINGDINGDINGs of the slot machines, it was perfect. The staff is extremely courteous and responds quickly to requests (we called to ask for sheets for the sofabed and they were here within minutes). Plus, even though the whole CityCenter is a bit far from the strip, the Vdara has a walkway that connects to the Bellagio for easy access to the center of the strip.

At 6:30 I finally got annoyed and asked what was the deal with my room. They said I wouldn't be able to stay in that room because of the same freaking stain! They couldn't have told me that 2.5 hours before?! So annoying. Anyways we were put on the 30th floor so it was definitely not the view I was expecting.

Notice I said ""hotel"" and not ""casino"" that's because this is hotel\/spa only w no casino which is a huge plus because it means this is a smoke free facility!!! If you really have that itch to gamble because u can't sleep in the middle of the night Aria is literally across the way and Cosmopolitan as well as Bellagio are about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Booked this hotel through my CC for my 3rd anniversary and I'm happy I did. When I first arrived I had a regular ""suite"" and I asked the helpful lady at check in if there was any possible upgrades since I was here for a special occasion, she simply said ""let me check for you"" and a minute later she said ""how does a corner suite on a high floor with a view of the strip and the Bellagio fountain sound?"" Obviously I said ""it sounds amazing"". When we got up to the room and opened the doors first thing we noticed was the wrap around windows that gave us an amazing view of the strip N a clear view of the Bellagio fountains. Then I realized it felt like I was walking into a really expensive apartment that you see on TV. Had a dinner table for 4. A washer dryer couch with a pull out bed a mini kitchen with full size fridge and a bathroom. Now let's talk about the bedroom, if laying on the bed you can see out to Bellagio the Venetian the palazzo n other hotels on the strip it was relaxing. The master bathroom was pretty big, I was initially upset because there was no tv in the bathroom but what made up for it was the view, once again the Bellagio fountains. Haha.

The parking is ridiculous because it's valet only. But let's get back to the room I got My key went upstairs walking to my room and was pretty impressed at the beginning then went into the restroom and noticed some streaks on my toilet if you know what I mean I mediately called housekeeping who never came. Saturday comes around and I call for housekeeping again in the morning went down to the pool around 11 AM came back up at two housekeeping still haven't came into my room nor the toilet from Friday so again I call and I will also go downstairs to talk to the hotel manager who assures me that housekeeping will clean my room today but it's already 8 PM and I said OK we're about to head out so it would be nice to come to a clean room. We get back in from Saturday night and the room still has not been clean.
Yo go back downstairs and the Manager tells me that housekeeping said someone was sleeping so they couldn't clean it. No one wast sleeping we were all out. Sunday morning comes around and we walked to the Bellagio and I make a sports bet. $100 on a three-leg parlay to win $462 I get back to my room which is still dirty by the way I place my sports ticket on the table as I always do so when I get back I can check my games. We go downstairs for about four hours go swimming have lunch decide to come back upstairs and what do you know the room is clean but now my ticket is gone and it's already a winner I have to make a claim and was told I would get some kind of response from their risk management which was closed on Sunday but I was told they were going to get a hold of me on Sunday which they didn't nor did they Monday.
I've never spent this much on a hotel and I wish it would've been a better bachelor weekend for me but this hotel really made it one of the worst stays in Vegas.

The Vdara gives you a great sense of luxury and comfort from the very start. The hotel offers free valet and we gave the bell hop's all our luggage including drinks and food and they brought it up to the rooms on their own. 

The room itself was extremely spacious. We fit a group of 9 into the space with ease. Anything we needed was brought up. From silverware to cleaning. 

The rooms were cleaned in the morning and again touched up around 6 pm. This ensured that we never ran out of supplies. 

The beds were extremely comfortable and each living space offered a separate climate control. Bath was large enough for our larger males to use with comfort. At the end of the trip this hotel offered complimentary limo service back to the airport. 

I found several deals on Groupon for similar rooms. Would come back. Downside is no on site casino,  but Aria is within 3 minutes of walking from the front desk.",6,0,2

Pros: 
1. Rooms are pretty spacious, I was able to accommodate my whole party 
2. Having the ability to get extra room keys with no problem
3. Non-smoking which was heaven for me since I have asthma 
4. Housekeeping provided us with as many towels\/linens\/blankets as we needed 
5. 5 minute walk from Marquee dayclub\/nightclub

Cons: 
1. Finding the valet area was a nightmare, all three cars got lost in the process. 
2. Only valet parking service is offered by the hotel, making it pretty inconvenient when we were in a rush to go somewhere
3. No pedestrian walkways\/ sidewalks around the actual hotel itself. Any time we wanted to get on the actual strip we had to either walk through Aria or Cosmopolitan.

The suite and penthouse were like small apartments\/condos, which made the stay homey and feel extremely luxurious. The only cons would be the lack of restaurants, casinos, and plazas within the hotel, but a 5 minute walk could take you to The Strip or Bellagio (which is connected to Vdara).

We always think about staying somewhere else, but end up here. Two things I like about the Vdara, that may be a reason why some wouldn't want to stay here. One: No smoking. I don't smoke. With so much smoke everywhere in Vegas it's nice to come back to the hotel away from it. Two: no casino. I'm not a huge gambler. I like coming back after a night out and it's an easy trip up to my room. Now if one you smoke or two you are an avid gambler, this may be a disappointment  to you. 

Upon driving up to the hotel, the gentleman out front begin the awesome service that the Vdara offers. The bellman start by helping you unload your car to be brought to your room when you are ready. The valet then takes your car and you are set for check in. The wait to check in is not long. After a long drive it's nice for such a simple process of getting up to your room.

The rooms themselves are beautiful with wonderful views. We have been lucky enough to have views of the Bellagio fountains. All rooms are suites. The room this year that we had was the executive sweet. We had a living room, full kitchen with dining area, one and a half baths and a separate bedroom. Don't forget the in room washer and dryer. It was basically a small apartment. 

Also the fitness center is very nice. My husband enjoys the spa area after a night of drinking. I usually enjoy either one of their facials or massages. Both well worth the money. 

It is a short walk to the Aria and the Cosmopolitan for your gambling needs.  

Most likely we will stay here again next year.... Just can't beat it.",4,0,2

For a 5-star hotel, Vdara was a mixed bag.  It is definitely a good price for such a high-quality hotel.  The front desk was cheerful and accomodating, and when I got to the rooms (which I think are all suites?) i was very impressed with the kitchenette\/living room\/bedroom layout.  The bathroom was clean and very spacious with a nice deep tub and separate shower.  Unfortunately the towels weren't stocked as well as I'd have liked, there was only 1 face towel.  Also, the previous reviews mentioning getting anything from housekeeping is true: I waited 20 minutes for a corkscrew before calling again and waiting another 15 after that; they blamed it on a malfunctioning elevator.  I also tried out the room service which was very professional and tasty to boot.  I went over to the Aria to gamble a little but was disappointed they don't even bother to track table game players wagering less than $25 a hand.  Guess I'm just spoiled by Reno; next time I'll ante up and see what I get for my paltry action, if anything.

Called for extra sheets and it took more than 30 minutes for housekeeping to come up. The water pressure in the shower was poor and for a place that wants to market itself as a high end hotel, this is not acceptable. There is a $22.40 resort fee every day, which includes WiFi so I guess I paid $22.40 for WiFi daily. The exterior already had broken glass\/plastic on the floor above us that we could see from the window. The sofa bed is not comfortable.

Check-in was easy as was check-out. There is no casino, which can be either good or bad depending on your personal preferences. Also there isn't really a restaurant but the deli does sell bottled drinks and alcohol. If you want to walk to another casino, you can walk mostly indoors to the Bellagio, which is a plus, but if you want to go to the Cosmopolitan, you have to walk outside and down the stairs then across the driveway leading to the hotel.

Pros - Great views, modern attractive suites, comfortable bed, excellent spa, easy to get to room (compared to other Vegas Hotels).  Nice soaking tubs that fill up fast.

Cons - Hit or miss service, below average valet service, pull out bed as bad as they get.

The rooms are clean, comfortable, quite and attractive.  The panoramic suites have great views of the city - the city corner suites aren't quite as nice but still have good views.  The spa at the hotel is one of the best anywhere.  There is no casino in the hotel (which is actually a plus for me) so it is easy to get to your room without walking through 500 yards of smoke before making it to the elevators.  There is a short walkway that connects the hotel to the Bellagio and the Aria is about 100 yards away for gambling and better food.  

If you have a car you will be required to use the valet service, which is horrible at this hotel.  On our last trip we were there 5 days and when we tried to call down to have them bring out our car they never answered the phone.  One time we wanted to run across to the Aria Hotel to grab a quick coffee and asked went to the valet desk to ask them to bring out our car so we could pick it up in 20 minutes - they refused.  When we checked out of the hotel we brought our baggage and valet claims to the bell desk, who told us we couldn't give them to the desk and had to go flag down someone outside.  Bottom line is that the employees weren't helpful - especially for a hotel that wants to be upscale.  We never waited less than 10 - 15 minutes for them to bring out our car.  The good news is that if you don't drive to the hotel you can bypass the valet.  

Housekeeping was generally good and the staff was friendly.  The only exceptions were occasionally (3 times during a 5 day stay) they would show up at our room to bring us things we didn't order.  This really wasn't a big deal except one time someone at hotel called after we explained that we didn't order any plates and in a demanding voice wanted to know exactly what we ordered.  ""Nothing"" we explained again - it was really weird.",0,0,0

I know, you're probably thinking, "" you were in Vegas what were you doing in your room?"" I'm not much of a gambler and my knees\/back are ache all the time due to being an idiot when I was in my twenties.  I was also out in vegas for a friends wedding, enough with the excuses though.

The room itself has to be one of the best hotel rooms I've stayed in.  The room and bathroom were huge and it even had a cook top, fridge, and small sink.  It is also just far enough from the main strip that I could see it but didn't have to deal with the nightly rowdiness. 

Now I'm thinking that most people who go to Vegas go to gamble or see shows.  That is where the Vdara was great to stay in for me.  The Vdara doesn't have a casino attached to it but the Aria and the Cosmopolitan are literally the next buildings over.  So if I did want to spend a few dollar I could have just walked over, my knees would have hated me but hey you only live once.  If I wanted to see a show the Main strip wasn't more that a tram ride or 10 minute walk as well. 

There is a Starbucks, nice little bar, and separate restaurant\/store on the first floor.  All of which while great, pale in comparison to the great eats in Vegas.

If you're headed to Vegas to hang out and don't want to deal with children running around or the annoying smut peddlers I suggest you check in to the Vdara.",0,0,0

Though we booked from an external travel site as a part of a package, don't be misled by the ""upgraded view.""

[You guessed it gentle reader ! ]  Morning of, Desk Agent #1 @ hotel--""you are confirmed for 'pool view,' that is all your reservation guarantees, cannot offer you more.""  
Wife--""but we don't arrive until midnight.""  She is given number for ""external reservations agent.""
Agent #2 --""Sure, no prob, you are confirmed for a Fountain view. Enjoy your stay.""

Arrive on delayed flight @ 1am Las Vegas time [You guessed it !, dang, you're good, reader!]     Desk Agent:  ""So sorry, we could not confirm that preference for your booking. But you do have a pool view!""  [pool view= overlooking taxi pull up of Aria, & if lean face against window, can see pool sitting in its vacant, winter glory.]  

Wrapping up the long part:  they did move us to Fountain view on floor #31 (Room 31-008) the next day.  Completely worth the move!  Views= incredible @ a fraction of the price of a Cosmopolitan fountain terrace room.

STAFF OTHERWISE:  Elevator guys, business center attendant, doormen, front desk, & taxi stand guy are all very pleasant to deal with.  

ROOM LAYOUT & FEATURES:  Other reviews are accurate--bed is comfy, tv is good, bathroom is spacious, in-room art is pleasant. Blackout shades are far from it, but we mostly slept in the 2-9a range, not living la vida loca, so we were ok.

HOUSEKEEPING:  Rooms both clean. Daily service was poor. Didn't pick up glasses in room (cough:::carried over from another resort); left us without a single hand towel when making up room after Day #2. Wife called requesting turndown service on Day #1 @630 pm, told ""sorry, need to request before 5"" !!

SHOWERHEADS:  Oh yes, believe those other reviews.  This place boasts its ""green"" qualifications.  Why would anyone think they would stop short of small-capacity toilets, and restrictive-flow shower heads ?  This is not the rainforest shower you were hoping to wash away all the tension in your life.  It's true... you're going to have to work at removing the conditioner in your hair.  Wife took all baths, with exception of a single shower to wash hair, during our stay.

WALKING TO OTHER RESORTS:  Aria is easy, stay left of the taxi stand, take the sidewalk; don't go right, you'll have to walk right through the middle of the driveway around taxi traffic!  Bellagio likewise is just a short walk way & you're there coming into the conference area, shops, garden, past front desk to the casino floor.  Cosmo was clearly re-planned when MGM sold it off.  You have to work to get there!  Best route: to the left by the taxi stand, down the outdoor staircase (you're then walking briefly through the service alley!) into the street level parking \/ taxi entrance to the floor of Cosmo (highly recommend the Chandelier Bar & Wicked Spoon buffet there).

THE VERDICT:  Since I started writing this review, I've changed from 4* to 3* back to 4* and finally *3.  You'll see what I mean when you stay.  Proximity to City Center\/ Bellagio \/ Cosmo & the possible view of fountains (but see above!) are awesome.  Stayed here after Encore & Wynn last 2 visits.  It's not in the same bracket as those.  We're unlikely to stay here again because of the choices available (and because I am a Steve Wynn nut).  But if you find good rate, when they're not full from conventions, book here with confidence.",2,3,0

The cleaning service was spot on: they thoroughly cleaned everything and even organized our belongings in the bathroom. The front desk was amazing too. They answered every question we had and were courteous and polite. This hotel is the sister hotel of the Aria, and doesn't have a casino. It's connected to the Bellagio hotel through an outdoor walkway and you can also access the tram  from this hotel. It's right by the Paris hotel and across the street from the Miracle Mile Shops.

The room layout was not what the front desk rep described and was not very intimate or private.

Too far to walk to anywhere good and I miss having a casino right there. Aria and bellagio are nearby, but neither of these are great places to gamble if you are a low roller like me.

A couple of positive notes: the beds are great, the tub is nice (but is smaller than it looks and fills up fast), the little fridge and kitchen area are nice and the elevators are fast. We are on the 50th floor and have a great view, but can hear the freeway pretty loudly. Also the blackout curtains are pretty useless. The toiletries are ok, kinda generic looking, but according to the literature placed in the bathroom, they are ""specially formulated"". They work ok and smell vaguely of baby shampoo.

We stayed in the executive corner suite and it was perfect. Our room was definitely impressive. It was very quiet and peaceful. We had 1 full bathroom attached to our bedroom- bath tub, shower and two vanity sinks, a second mini guest bathroom near the entrance of the room, a huge living room area, four person dining table, washer\/dryer, built in security box, a kitchen in a separate room and a small office work area. 

I loved the convenience of the washing and drying machine, we were able to do all our laundry before leaving-saves us the trouble of having to do it back home. The full kitchen was perfect as it allowed us to warm up our leftover food easily. The kitchen included a Keurig machine, a dish washer, microwave oven, stove and huge refrigerator\/freezer. The hotel is valet only and it saves us the time to drive around and look for parking, it only takes us less than 2 minutes to drop our car off at the valet line and head straight to our room.

Security here is good as well, your room cards will be checked before you enter the room elevators and enter the pool area. Housekeeping staff did a very nice job cleaning our room everyday, check in staff was nice and pool attendants were very attentive.

We were on the 35th floor with gorgeous views of the Rio in the distance. Luckily for me, my room mates were quite the partiers and clubbers, so I got to sleep in one of the beds for both nights I was there.

The Vdara hotel was as amazing as it is. Its quite sqanky as it was luxurious. Its connected to the Bellagio, so you can manuevor in between the hotels. There is the tram to go to the Monte Carlo from the Vdara, so that was a free option for me.

Originally this started as a relaxing\/peaceful solo birthday trip and I wanted a hotel that reflected just that. After 2 people hopped on the bandwagon it turned into a girlfriends trip. Keep in mind that all 3 of us are laid back easy breezy type of people so there wasn't a need to change hotels. From booking the hotel (through MLife) to the checking in, process was super duper easy. At check in I was afraid to try the $20 trick so I just casually asked if there was any complimentary upgrades and was upgraded from a regular city view room to a room on the 43rd floor with a Bellagio fountain\/high roller\/Paris view which was awesome. Then I asked the check in clerk was it ok for me to tip him because I wasnt sure if it was appropriate or not and he said ""only if you want to"" so I gave him the $20. For some reason, those check-in people just look too poised\/immaculate to accept tips...IMO. Anyway, up to the room we go after presenting the elevator attendant our room key (already I feel safe). Ok, I havent traveled in 2 years and the last time I checked into a hotel I had to swipe a room key, well at the Vdara you just wave the room key in front of the would be key hole...I love it, its the smallest things that mean so much to me lol. As soon as I opened the door I was wishing I had brought the boyfriend along. Lets just say we probably wouldnt have left the room. Wall to wall windows with excellent views of the bellagio fountain and paris hotel. Deep jacuzzi like tub, perfect for bubble baths and separate stand alone shower. For some reason housekeeping kept bringing just 1 washcloth and about 6 towels. That wasn't a problem though because when we called they were there in less than five minutes. And housekeeping did come daily (without request) but prior to my stay and reading countless reviews, I read that they only come upon request. Bed a little to soft for my liking but nothing to complain about. Blackout shades and curtains work by some remote thingy on the wall which was cute but that got old after the first day. Returning to the hotel after a drunken night you can forget about closing the shades. Even though this hotel sits off of the strip a little I loved the fact that when returning to the hotel at the end of a long hot Vegas day of walking and touring you don't have to wrestle through a smokey, crowded and loud casino constantly saying excuse me and dodging people with club passes just to get to your room. And if all of that tickles your fancy at any point of your stay just walk across the roundabout to Vdara's sister the Aria and get your fix which I did. Glad I did too because I won $542.26+$89.05 Because this hotel is off the strip, other than staying there, it's no other reason for outsiders to be there. Hence the peacefulness and relaxation.
For some reason 2 of the things that stuck out to me the most was, 1 when my girlfriend went down the hall to get some ice she left the door cracked, within 30 seconds of her being gone a hotel employee knocked on the door to make sure we were ok and if we were aware that the door was open. I told you I felt safe. And 2, the tv had my name on it lol. I told you it's the little things that mean so much to me:)

My assistant booked a stay here for business, and did it on Hotwire.  In general, when booking a 5-star Hotel using their service I'm usually fine with her doing it and don't care.  In this case, I was livid.  A Hotel with no casino in Vegas?  Blasphemy.  A Hotel not directly on the strip?  Well my God I might as well have booked in LA and driven to the strip.  A Hotel with no club?  Impossible.

In fact I was so pissed I got on the phone with them and, ""blah blah blah, I'll never use your service again, you are the worst thing to happen to humanity, etc, etc; insert some tears and expletives; blah blah blah"".......and still stuck there.

Then post stay, revert back to paragraph 1.  Not the first time nor the last I've made a horses a*s out of my self and then had to admit it later in my own mind.

I absolutely loved the Hotel.  The rooms are modern and gorgeous.  The pool and spa areas are excellent.  And ultimately not having a Casino there when you are Zombie walking back to your room is not only refreshing, but probably saved me more money than I care to admit in not wasting money at tables in a state where you have no business even being awake.  No smoke, no noise, no nonsense.  No getting sucked back in for multiple more cocktails you don't need.  It's like an island respite in the middle of the madness, which was just really, really refreshing.

And my concern of it being in ""Antarctica""?  Its a 2 second walk from Aria.  Also getting cabs\/transpo out was a breeze, as you don't have a million wastoids in line from the casino.

Cons:
Only complaint I have is how ridiculous the parking situation can be. If you are like my boyfriend who doesn't use valet parking for anything then you won't like the parking situation. The closest self parking lot was at the Aria. I think we paid roughly $45 (left the car there until we checked out) the 3 days we stayed at Vdara. 

Pros:
I booked through the hotel website which gave me the option of paying for early check-in. I did, also you can do mobile check-in through this up to 24 hours prior to your arrival. I checked in on my phone around midnight the Friday we were arriving. We left LA area around 3:30 am arrived in Las Vegas around 7 am. After breakfast we walked around one of the hotels and I got an email that our room was ready it was already 9 am at this point. Not bad.

Arrived at check out desk they have a separate line for mobile check-in don't have to wait as long. Check in was easy!

The room was absolutely perfect, the view was amazing. We got the Fountain View Suite.

I wasn't planning on checking out late on that Sunday but we called that same morning and asked if we could and they said no problem just added the additional charge. Late check out is 2 pm. Which was awesome considering the night before we were out until 5 am!",0,0,0

It has the best smelling carpet of any hotel I've ever been in, like they must shampoo their carpet everyday. The rooms are spacy. We had a corner suite, it was about 850 sq. feet. More than enough room for 4 dudes. The room itself is luxurious. The complimentary shampoo and soap is specially made from Australia, had to google that. This place is located in the middle of the strip, behind the Cosmopolitan. There are back entry into the Bellagio and a tram that will take you to Aria and Monte Carlo. You can also walk to the Aria. Vdara has a nice gym, it's small but gets the job done. Pool is basic, nothing special.

Just a few knocks on this place. Parking is ship (don't wanna curse). You can either self park in Aria for 10 dollars a day. Or you can pay for valet 18 dollars a day. The self park is at Aria and I would consider that pretty far walking to Vdara, like 5-10 minutes maybe. Can we call an engineering flaw? The valet parking is no good, why pay 18 dollars a day for probably the slowest valet service on the Strip. Their valet is just incredibly unorganized. Maybe they have a contract with Payless Car Rental, who knows.     

Haters gonna hate. There's no casino or club in Vdara. As a young club rat, I was not a fan that I had to walk to Aria to follow my dreams of winning 100 million dollars and bad itch (rap song quote). Because that's all we really want in life right? 

Vdara is extremely classy and puts a nice calm resort in the middle of the strip. That's a good contrast to the craziness of Vegas.",2,2,2

I have stayed in many hotels in Vegas, and this is the worst experience by far.  Upon arrival we had to wait almost 20min to check in.  It was 9pm on a Friday night and they only had one person working at the front desk.  I prepaid for my room before my arrival and upon check-in she informed me that I had to pay an additional $18.00 plus tax per night for some BS resort fee.  

I am not usually a person who complains and I am usually easy to please, BUT there are so many more things that made my experience an unpleasant one.

1. The room was very small and cluttered with too much furniture (Not what was posted on the site in square footage)

2. The water pressure sucks.

3. Every time I wanted my car from valet I would call in advance to request it and no one would answer the phone, I had to call multiple times in a row.

4. The same goes for customer service at the front desk (no one would answer the phone), poor customer service skills and not accommodating to your concerns.

5. They have a full kitchen minus the oven but it seems to me they do not want you to use it since there is no cookware, utensils, glasses, or plates. Just 2 coffee cups.

6. The AC\/Heat in the room did not work properly.  I am in my late 20's and it seemed like I was having hot flashes because their climate control is messed up.

7. Back to the BS resort fee, it is suppose to cover the daily paper, bottled water ,and coffee but no one brought those items to my room each day I was there (3 nights).

8. The day I checked out I noticed that there was a big scratch on my BMW and it was not there when I got there, so I had informed the valet and he told us we would have to speak with security and file a report.  It took over 35 min for the security guard to show up!!

Needless to say I WILL NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN!!!",7,1,1

One thing to note about staying here is that there is no casino below. So it was nice to return to our room with it not being too noisy or busy with people.

The service here is unparalleled...you'll feel well taken care of the moment you walk in. They have one of the nicest, most accommodating staffs of anywhere I've ever stayed and I love the robes and slippers that come with the rooms. I feel spoiled when I stay here. They also don't allow smoking anywhere in the building except outside near the valet and it's super clean feeling inside as a result. 
During the summer season their pool is beautiful too - on the smaller side compared to some of the bigger hotels but still beautiful and there's a big hot pool as well. They've got a great fresh food bar and snack shop downstairs too, complete with boars head snacks, sandwiches, etc. and a fairly large cold section for alcohol.

It was nice to be able to have a mini fridge in the room without having to pay $$ per day! 

It was also nice to be self contained, although I'm not sure who would really use the rest of the kitchen whilst in Vegas..?!

I really liked the large windows and electronic blackout blinds. We had a nice view overlooking the Vdara pool and the Aria across the road.

My one complaint would be that there is no indoor walkway to the other casinos. It might sound lazy but it is a luxury to avoid walking outside in the 115F desert heat to get to a casino or nice restaurant- especially if you sweat lots in the heat (!)",2,4,2

Vdara itself has many positives in its favor and I would certainly stay here again. For one, its small (that's a good thing). No one wants to go schleping across a huge smoke filled casino in an attempt to find room elevators. The pleasant Vdara lobby (complete with a small cafe, bar (with a fantastic outdoor patio), and Starbucks) is perfect in size. I can glide right up to reception and than walk a few feet to the room elevators- perfect. Oh and there's no smoking in this joint. Yippee!! I can breath. I also appreciated that the hotel wasn't one giant ice box. Thank you for keeping the hotel at a reasonable temp. 

As for the rooms- I'm not sure why they wasted space on a full kitchen. You can bake a cake in your room if you so desire, although barely any pots are provided making the whole kitchen area confusing. I suppose for longer term business stays (I'm sorry you're stuck in Vegas for a prolonged business trip) it would be helpful, but I imagine most people stock the fridge with booze and ignore the cooking range. Perhaps this was originally imagined as condos that never came to fruition? At any rate, it was just weird. The bed was comfy, however there are no rooms with 2 queen beds. You have a king bed and a pullout couch, which can be converted into a bed. To my dismay I slept in the pullout couch for one night, and although it was rather creaky, it turned out to be surprisingly comfortable. 

I didn't make it to the pool (boo- all day conference and pool closes by 6pm or so), but I did book a facial (will write a separate review). Last thing- it was pretty convenient to some larger casinos- super close to Bellagio (including its tram), Aria and Cosmo. Vdara may not be the super high end Mandarin experience, but I much prefer this kind of place rather than a smoky cavernous casino to go traipsing around in. Would definitely stay here again.",4,2,2

I had the opportunity to use their online concierge system. It was very easy to setup deliveries before arriving at the hotel. The flowers and appetizers were waiting in the room when we arrived.

There were a lot of cabinets and storage spaces. In general, it was well designed and everything seemed to be where you wanted it and expected to find it.

This is a small issue, but for a luxury hotel I did expect more ""luxurious"" towels. They lacked a lot of ""fluff"" as if they were well used...clean but well used.

It is a very tall hotel so I was concerned that there would be a lot of time spent waiting for the elevators. This was never the case. They usually arrived pretty quickly, not only in the lobby but on your floor. Be aware, if you do have a room on one of the higher floors, the elevator can get you. It goes fast, and sometimes your ears may actually pop.

I really liked that it didn't have a casino. As a result, the hotel was missing all of the related casino traffic. But even if casinos are your thing, it is a quick walk to the other casinos.

Room - I reserved 2 fountain view suites and requested it to be on the same floor and high floor. They were able to give me a room that is next to each other but not as high as I wanted it to be. Still pleased that they were able to accommodate my main request was for it to be on the same floor. 

Room was very spacious and clean. Great view of the city and the strip. It becomes better at night when it becomes more lively. My parents loved the view.  They were also happy with the kitchen area. 

Food - Not a lot of food options from their menu but enough for us to select items that we like. I wanted to try their breakfast menu but the majority wanted to eat outside. 

Service - Front desk were very friendly along with the concierge. The people who delivered our food were very engaging. The only problem that I thought was an issue was when we arrived we had to check in our bags as our rooms were not ready. We went outside and handed our bags to the bell boy. And he then stated that he will take care of the bags but he will not be the one who will deliver it to our room.. he was basically trying to ask for tips which made it really uncomfortable. I'm a good tipper but asking for one and making it feel like I'm obligated to give is just not right. So when we checked out we had to check in our bags again as our flight was that evening. I saw him again, made eye contact but he asked his coworker, Josue, to like basically approach  us. Lol that guy basically refused to assist us. Luckily, Josue, was very friendly and made us laugh so therefore I tipped him $10 bucks. He provided great service and did not ask for a tip. Anyways, there was another yelper that also had the same experience with the bell boy that is asking for tips. That's not good. Manager that is in charge of that department should bring that issue that they shouldn't ask for tips.

We really enjoyed our stay at the Vdara hotel.  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating to our every request.  I LOVED the fact that it is a non-smoking and non-gambling hotel.  Sometimes I just need to get away from all the smoke (so stinky) and noise.  We were there for 5 days\/4 nights (for both business & pleasure) and if I was in any other hotel, I think it would have been too long.  

PROs:
*Great spot - centrally located on the strip, easy to get to everything from Bellagio, Cosmopolitan to Aria and shopping.  
*Beautiful Hotel, modern\/contemporary design
*Super comfortable beds
*Non-smoking
*Quiet lobby
*View from our corner suite was AMAZING! We could see the Bellagio Fountains and it felt like our room(s) were all-windows on one side.  
*Our suite had a washer\/dryer and beautiful kitchen with upscale appliances.  This was great as my kids came a little later and not having to drag them out for breakfast and snacks was ideal.
*Kitchen had full-refrigerator, dishwasher, coffee maker, range and microwave.
*Elevators were FAST! 
*FREE Wi-Fi (at least in your room) - although it seemed like we were limited on our phones (Facebook was almost impossible to get)
*The blackout shades or shade only options were really nice, especially if some in your party tend to like to sleep in during the day.  
*Awesome bathrooms - very large tub and shower with seat
*Staff was cordial (front desk & housekeeping, especially)

CONs:  
*Very limited options for food on-site.  You really have to either order room service or walk over to Aria.  The little snack bar downstairs felt more like a school cafeteria with over-priced snacks.
*The pool was nothing grand, which was a bit disappointing for Vegas.  Although I will say - I was pleasantly surprised that they had a lifeguard on duty (as small as it was).  Towels were readily available and the smoothie bar was nice.  
*In order to use the little pool (and I mean LITTLE, as in - ideal for toddlers), you had to rent a cabana.  
*Limited staff available at the Concierge Desk - every time I went down there, there was only 1 person to help and a line of folks need help.  I think only 1x did I go and there were two people staffing the area.  
*Valet parking ONLY - it gets old feeling like you have to tip them EVERY time...and even when you just need to run up to your room for 5 minutes to grab something - they still park your car, even though they say they'll hold it for you.
*If your window faces ANY of your neighbors, USE YOUR SHADES!  I didn't realize they weren't tinted enough and YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH THEM!  I'm sure our neighbors saw us at some point in our underwear!  It wasn't until one night I was coming out of the kitchen, I could see our neighbors closing their shades! 
*Would not recommend adults sleeping on the sofa beds!  Super uncomfortable.  That's just the nature of sofa beds, though - right?

Great place to stay if you have family and need the extra in-room amenities.  If you're there for a weekend with your spouse or friends and wanna party - you're probably better suited to stay where you play (Ceasar's or Venitian) and can just stumble up to your room at 5am. ;o)",2,0,1

This hotel is so clean, absolutely beautiful, and very spacious.  We had a stunning view of the Bellagio.  This hotel has a bar downstairs and I had the best strawberry mojito.  We ran out of time so never had the chance to dip in the pool.

Two things negative about this hotel: parking is valet only which is very inconvenient and toilet paper holder is broken. The best thing to do is park in Bellagio if you don't mind walking which we did almost every day. If it wasn't for the parking, I would give this hotel five stars.",0,0,0

My friends and I got a suite (which our weekend was around $500-$600 for 2 nights).  We were luckily given a small upgrade with a beautiful view and even though the suite wasn't humongous, the view was pretty nice and the amenities were all solid.  My only complaints in the room would be that our refrigerator bottom was falling off and that the outer restroom in the living room lacked much in terms of handles and a shower.  Otherwise, the overall room was solid.  Service was also usually on point unless you're looking for something in the late evening in which it seems that housekeeping is busy beyond belief.  

You also have to note that this hotel doesn't have a casino which has its own pros\/cons.  Perhaps the best aspect about Vdara though comes with the location.  You're literally a 5-minute walk away from Aria and Bellagio and the cab rides will be a quick hop to most of the hotels for less than $10.  There's even a tram to go to Crystals and other nearby venues too which is always a plus.  

One last tricky part is the parking.  When you come up past the Cosmo entrance, you'll see a sign pointing up towards Aria\/Vdara.  Keep on following it up the ramp and then staying on your left to see another ramp going towards Vdara past Aria.  Tricky for first-timers but not too bad once you figure it out.

The service was stellar and they even sent champagne up to celebrate the 21st birthdays in our group.

It's also pretty loud at night. Somehow the outside noise comes through as a rumble of some sort and the bed was not comfortable. The room was dusty and had obvious signs of wear and tear. For the price we paid, the room was not impressive at all. 

By the time we checked in, the fountain show was finished for the night so the view was not what we were expecting. We asked to pay for an upgraded\/ larger room but were told they were sold out.

Unfortunately, that's the case with its counterpart, Cosmopolitan, as you would have to fork out an extra $50 (that's Blackjack money) for that same view. And wow, what a view you get with that view. The first few steps that my friends took were hilarious because they never actually experienced having stairs in a hotel room, never mind that it was on the 56th floor. The view provided almost a 360 view of the entire Las Vegas skyline, which is well worth every bit of money I poured into staying at this hotel!

With enough room to fit at least ten people, the master bedroom suite contains a panoramic view of the strip which, accompanied by the amazing oversized tub and dual showers, makes showering such an entertaining process. All the blinds and shades are motorized and controlled from a panel, so you can control how much light and view you want, although I highly suggest leaving them all open. Trust me, the view itself is worth the price.  Amenities like the enclosed kitchen area with a full size fridge, Keurig coffee cups, four bottles of chilled water, welcome amenity gift (we've been receiving a variety of fruit bowls to my surprise) and even jelly beans as a way to appeal to our sweet tooth. In addition, you get a stovetop, an oven, a microwave, dishwasher, , sink and oh what's this? Some rooms actually will provide a washer and dryer so you can wash those bathing suits and go down and play some more!

We had the 9 of us and yet the 2-Bedroom Penthouse Suite could have easily fit doubled that if we wanted to. The room size, combined with the service and styling could very well eclipse its counterparts , and you pay WAY LESS than say the Bellagio and Aria suites. There's no problem with connecting to any of the hotels around you at the Vdara is linked to the Aria, Bellagio and the Cosmo, all big names on the strip.

Service at the Vdara was excellent as usual. Our internet was incredibly spotty during our first night at 55019 and the manager was quick to waive the fee and provide an additional compensation to make sure we were well suited into the next day. Even though CES has just barely finished, they still managed to make sure we had all we needed. Actually, even room service made me feel like they actually liked working there, compared to say the Bellagio or Venetian, where service is sometimes a bit...lacking. Room service made sure we had all we wanted from towels to comforters to shampoo to water, it was all sent within 20 minutes. 

Indeed, we may have very well shot to the very top with this penthouse suite. This ranks pretty highly on my list of hotels; although the view wasn't as nice as say our previous stay at 55004, just having stairs in your room made this such a ridiculous place to stay. The loft layout made the suite bigger and wider than what the pictures produced. What makes Vdara stand out is the very same reason why people don't really stay at Vdara. It was modeled after a luxury condo, and thus the environment felt like one. To me, that's the best environment for a place like Vegas. You could easily fool some random group of hotties into believing you're a super high roller with money just floating in the bathtub. Well then again, just saying Penthouse Suite and you've caught the attention of a lot of people...

Of course, having the penthouse suite package meant all of us were going to hit up the ESPA at Vdara, where we happy men happily went to on a Saturday morning albeit the lack of sleep the night before. Having the spa was such a treat as we were able to wind down and enjoy some man talks and some hilarious moments at the Sauna and the Steam Room, along with the lavish eucalyptus mint towels to freshen up those facial pores. If you have time, go and just spend one to two hours there. Your body will thank you for it.  

In closing, Vdara is still one of the top hotels on the strip, with an impressive list of suites and amenities that make them a top choice for consumers to relax and enjoy. Its modern, sleek and sophisticated design combined with its location and lack of a casino may very well be for those who want to a more quite atmosphere but yet want the unforgettable attractions of Las Vegas within walking distance. 

So in essence, come and experience the Vdara yourself! I think this amazing resort is STILL the best bang for your buck at the Vegas Strip. Book a stay and see for yourself.

I ended up booking the Vdara Suite.  Our one bedroom suite had a king sized bed, and a pullout queen sized sofa in the living room.  We had a kitchen with a refrigerator, stove, microwave and dishwasher.  There was also a washer and dryer.  Our suite came with a huge bathroom and another half bath.  The large bathroom came in handy since we had five girls trying to get ready at the same time.

Since our trip was in January, it wasn't pool weather, so we booked a spa day instead.  A 50 minute Swedish massage was $130.  I made an appointment for me and my girl friend at 10am.  Since we went all out the night before, I learned that I will never book a spa appointment that early again in Vegas.  The spa was nice.  There were lots of amenities including a redwood sauna, eucalyptus steam room, and a hot plunge pool.  Since we were way too dehydrated, we skipped all of that stuff and just hung out in the relaxation lounge.  

There is no casino in this hotel, but that was ok since I was just there for a fun filled weekend of partying.  But since there was no casino, the hotel also lacked dining options.  There is a cafe downstairs where you can grab a quick bite, or you can order room service.  For other options, you have to walk across to Aria or head to the Cosmopolitan.

The room is very contemporary, the bed is really comfortable.  The soak tub was really nice, there was a nice view of the strip as you soaked in the tub.  Overall the room was very comfy.  

What I did not like was the pool, the glare from Aria and Vdara itself was blinding.  I could hardly open my eyes while I was there.  I had to leave after a few minutes because my eyes were starting to hurt.  The pool was really small, could no way accommodate all the guests of the hotel.  

The staff were okay, not the friendliest, they just did their job, did not really go the extra mile to make you feel welcome.

The room was more comfortable than a standard hotel room.  The layout is more of a studio than a hotel room.  It has a small kitchen with stove tops and fridge and a small dining area.  So if you want to stay in and not eat out, you can heat something up in your room.  

Gym and internet were also included -- unlike other hotels where they charge $25 for gym and $15 for internet per laptop.  

I didn't give this place a 5 star because of its slight distance from the Strip.  It is connected to the Bellagio and there is a tram to Monte Carlo but you can't just walk out the front door and be on the Strip.",0,0,0

Pros:
- THE BEDS FEEL LIKE CLOUDS! I came here with a group of 9 and of course, girls got the beds while guys got the sofa bed. My friend jumped on the bed and raved about how it felt like sleeping on a cloud, while my other guy friend jumped onto the sofa bed and complained that it bruised his ribs...So, if you're coming with a big group. CLAIM THE BED! It's amazing

- kitchen area! I love the kitchen area and the huge fridge! Perfect for all your drinks (if you know what I mean) It's perfect for pregaming and hanging out. LOVE! 

- NO SMOKING! OMG, this is probably one of the kickers for me. I hate walking around the casinos and getting second hand smoke and this hotel has neither of them! No casino and no smokers! It's basically my vegas heaven. 

- SUPER CLOSE TO COSMO! Ok, What's the next best thing to staying at the cosmo? Staying at a hotel within walking distance of the cosmo!! It's sooooo convenient, seriously walking distance. 

- FREE VALET!!

Cons: 
- Very quiet. I always feel bad coming back super late just because I feel like I'm going to wake someone. 

- Parking. I still don't know where it is and I've been here 3 times now? BUT FREE VALET!

City Corner Suite \/ 24th Floor:  Outstanding!  The largest, best appointed hotel I have had the pleasure of staying in. Fantastic view of the Bellagio Fountains.  Our floor had an excellent view, but higher floors would be even more dramatic.

Amenities:  
Full Kitchen: with four burner electric cook-top, full size refrigerator, Kuerig coffee maker, sink with garbage disposal and dishwasher.  There is a washer \/ dryer in the hallway.  The dryer was not vented properly and essentially did not work properly.  Note:  You can call the front desk for laundry soap and they will bring it up to your room.  They will also bring cooking equipment if you request it.

Living Room with sleeper sofa and 42"" flatscreen TV.  Note, there is an A\/V panel in the cabnet below the living room TV.  This will allow you to hook up your digital devices to the TV via HDMI or RCA cables.  

Dressing Room with large closet, safe and a dressing table \/ mirror.

Bathroom with a huge soaker tub and shower with glass surround.  

Bedroom with 42"" flatscreen TV and a king size bed.  The reception for the TV was excellent.

Location:  Set off the strip to the south of Bellagio.  There is a wonky tram that runs from the Bellagio to the Crystals shopping center, but you essentially have to walk from Vdara to Bellagio to board the tram.  Like most things in Vegas, the idea of the tram is excellent, but the execution falls short.

Vdara is also across the street from The Cosmopolitan.  It is a somewhat confusing walk to get to this casino, even though it is next door.

Service \/ House Keeping:  The service fails to live up to the fantastic facilities at this hotel.  The front desk was not especially friendly during check-in and not responsive to our requests for room service.  Keep in mind there is a steep $20\/Day resort fee.  The service is why my rating is no higher than three stars. 

When we arrived there were hand prints on the windows and spots on the tile floors.  Most of this dirt stayed with us for our 4 night stay.  

We also had issues with housekeeping not providing refills for our Kuerig coffee machine.  We had to track down housekeepers on our floor and ask for more packs of caffeinated coffee.  

Price:  We had a fantastic price for our room ~$120 \/ night + fees.  We would definitely go back.  All rooms are suites and we did see a smaller room.  It did not have a separate kitchen \/ living room and it does not have a the washer \/ dryer.",2,0,0

The Good. The rooms are beautiful and spacious, very clean, and come with kitchenettes (microwave, fridge, small range).  Our room (the cheapest category) was on the 37th floor and had a beautiful view of Bellagio fountains & Paris.  The lobby area is beautiful and clean.  The hotel is non-gaming and totally smoke free, which is the big reason we picked it.  There is no smoke stench in the room at all and we all felt like it was a calm, quiet, nice-smelling oasis from the rest if the strip.  The pool is not huge or fancy by Vegas standards but is good-size for a hotel pool and was WARM - we went swimming in late December!  Nice daybeds and cabanas.  The hotel is close to both Aria and Bellagio which have lots of food and entertainment options.  There is free wifi (well, included in resort fee) which worked pretty well.  The gym was really nice but quite crowded.  The Vdara Market Cafe in lobby is convenient for a quick bite and has pretty decent albeit croissants and other breakfast\/snack items.  The rooms are the most soundproof hotel rooms I've ever stayed in; we never heard a soul.   

The Bad.  Our main problem was with the service, particularly with housekeeping.  Although the rooms come with kitchenettes, they don't include any plates, glasses, cutlery etc and you have to call and request it.  The first night my mom requested some and they did not bring it to her before she went to bed (several hours later).  They did leave it outside her room as requested, so she could have dishes as soon as she woke up.  Our first full day, although we were out of the rooms most of the day, neither of our two rooms got made up.  This was not a big deal, except my husband and I needed new towels and water bottles and my parents needed water bottles and clean dishes.  My mom called around 6 pm and requested what they needed and they told her they would be there by 8 at the latest (my parents go to bed early and were also coming from Central Time two hours ahead, so it was important that it be done on time).   An hour or so later, my husband called with our request.  He was on hold with housekeeping for 15-20 minutes but when he finally got through they brought up our towels and water bottles fairly promptly (within 30 mins).  When the guy came to our room I told him my parents had called quite awhile ago and were still waiting, he basically said that someone else would come and there wasn't anything he could do about it.  Super helpful.  

Finally, just before 8, a housekeeper showed up and said she would come back soon.  She finally came back closer to 8:30.  That was bad enough, but the absolutely ridiculous thing was that she took close to an hour to clean my parents room (so it was finally clean 1.5 hrs after they were promised it would be) and another hour to clean ours.  We thought it was taking so long because they were washing dishes, but when my parents finally got back in their room all the dishes were gone!! Fortunately she was still cleaning our room so my mom stopped her and at least got clean mugs - she had no other dishes though.  They also took about an hour to clean our room and we didn't get in it until close to 10:30.  I'm not sure how on earth it takes 1  hour to clean a hotel room, especially when there are no dishes to be washed or anything.  The only thing they had to do was make up the bed and pick up towels off the floor - not sure how that can possibly take more than 20 minutes or so.

To be fair, all of the problems with housekeeping happened on Christmas Day and they may have been understaffed. But we all found it odd and very frustrating that there are no dishes in the rooms AND it takes hours to get them from housekeeping. 

The other really annoying thing about the Vdara is that the parking is valet only, no self park.  Although the valet is ""complimentary"" you have to tip every time they bring your car up, so its not really free.   You also have to wait for them to bring your to you.  We regularly waited 15-20 minutes and calling ahead for the car did not work.  Although they don't really advertise this, you can also self-park in Aria's garage, but this means that in addition to walking 10+ minutes to the hotel, you also have no choice but to exit the garage onto the strip, with its absolutely horrific traffic.  If you valet at the Vdara, you can exit onto a side street and get right onto the highway without going on the strip.  So although both options are fairly inconvenient, the self-park is definitely worse.

Overall, I do recommend the hotel especially if you don't smoke and are looking for a quieter Vegas experience but if you have a car and\/or want to cook any food or hot beverages in your room, ask for things well in advance and prepare to wait.",1,0,0

Vdara is a very upscale hotel with excellent customer service. I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and I really didn't want to ever check out. You must keep in mind that this hotel is simple so no casino or clubs. It's fairly quite here but if your looking for some excitement then go right over to Cosmo hotel or Aria hotel. Both hotels are super close. 

My friends and I came to Vegas for my friend's 21st birthday and at first we reserved a one bed room suite with one king bed and a pull out sofia bed. Since it was four of us we thought that was perfect. But we got there and they upgraded up to the Hospitality Suite which is a two bed penthouse for FREE! We walked in and was in heaven. Everything was so elegant and classy. Very modern and upscale. Our penthouse was huge about 1,300 square feet with two master bed rooms with 2 bathroom and 1 restroom for guests. We had a living with a 42"" flat screen tv. A fully equipped gourmet kitchen with a dish washer. We had a washer and dryer and iron with iron board. Nice robes and slippers for all of us. The water here is so fresh that you'll probably never drink arrow head water again LOL. Each room had a 42"" flat screen tv while the restrooms had a 13"" flat screen tv and countless channels. The showers had glass doors and a sitting area inside. The tub was huge and was perfect for soaking. The views in the living and bed rooms were incredible. Their were king beds in both rooms and nice fluffy pillows. There service is a little slow and I don't mean in time LOL. We called the front for a sharp knife and after it was confirmed that they were going to bring it, they kept calling to ask if we needed anything else :-\/ like no we're fine. & then we came back from the mall and took a nap and house keeping came in our room and woke my friend up to ask if she needed anything LOL. When my friend told me this I was in tears! So funny but scary as well. That's all I can think of as far as the hotel go and customer service. 

We had one friend who was staying in another penthouse here and his layout was a little different then ours but still nice. The penthouse is good for having guest over. We had some drinks at our friend's penthouse and we met some other guest here who were awesome and we had drinks and room service over there. We didn't get back to our penthouse till 6:30am it was that much fun here.

I'll get right to the point.   The place is in City Center which is a new section of Las Vegas which is a little bit away from the ""CENTER"" of things (intersection of Flamingo and Las Vegas BLVD).    

They reel you in with the amazing rates of $130 to $140 per night and then you get gouged on everything.   So in reality it's more like $250\/night  $300\/night Hotel.    The rooms are great - I would say almost fantastic, but holy crap.....  I ordered a simple club sandwhich and a coke...   cha ching!! ---  $32 later.. and the thing was so small I was still hungry afterwards.  

YOu want coffee??   kablang!!!!!!!!!!!!    Get ready for this...   $10.50 for a cup of coffee... across the street at ARIA... $8.50 for a large Latte. Want that extra shot of expresso?   That'll be an extra $2.00!!!!!!!!!

What the?    So......   I'm  borderline about to change my rating to a 2, but I'll keep at 3 just because it is a clean and very nice place.   

Oh...  A glass of Pinott Griggio.. $16
A Mohito $14

Be ready to drop some cash..and yeah I know it's Vegas..but I've stayed closer to the action down by Ceasars Palace and I'm going to tell you ... it wasn't this expensive.   For crying out loud.. I was in the Venetian and beers were $3.00 for a full bottle...  here they're $7.00

So you know what........the more I write and think about it.. it's a freaking 2 now.

I'm not a cheap person, but I really do feel like they go out of their way to gauge the crap out of people.    The VDARA doesn't even have a Casino in it, and maybe there's my answer to why everything is so outrageously pricey.

For crying out loud, I needed a simple long sleeved T-shirt..
Guess how much that was going to be.......???   Hmmmm... $67

Really?  My feet hurt... you think maybe between the over priced drinks and the 1\/2 a club sandwhich and the fact that everything is so far away...someone would come to my room and give me a foot rub.

The fact that this is a non-gaming property puts its above the others and the fact that you don't smell that horrible stench of cigarette\/cigar smoke when you get back to your room is even better! Don't get me wrong I love a little gambling here and there but it's a hop skip and a jump to get over to the tables if desired when staying at Vdara! The valet employees are all very fast and efficient! The front desk employees are all professional and pleasant to deal with when checking in\/out! The rooms are AMAZING!

My bf and I stayed here over Labor Day and booked through Hotwire.com for about $150\/night (5 star hotel - Strip South).  

Check-in was a breeze...Maria at the front desk was super sweet and she definitely accommodated us.  We got a room overlooking the pool and City Center which was amazing at night because of all the lights.  Upon entering the room we were really surprised of how big, modern and nice the rooms were.  There was a small kitchenette as you enter with a small dining table.  I loved how one wall was just windows.  There is a nice living area with a good size sofa and table.

The bathroom was really nice with a soaking tub, stand up shower (good water pressure, however no more Aveda products) and plenty of counter space.  The bed was super comfy and I really liked the pillows and mattress.  

Every person who works at the Vdara was extremely helpful, housekeeping was quick when asking for slippers and towels.

I'm not a gambler nor a smoker, so I liked the fact that Vdara did not have either. We chilled at the pool on Sunday...they had a DJ set up and the waitresses were really attentive and quick.  All the chairs had umbrellas to help with the hot hot heat of Vegas.

I loved the location of this hotel...just a quick walk over to the Cosmopolitan and Bellagio (my two favorite hotels).  Also, they have a tram to get around City Center.

I highly recommend this hotel because service is really what I appreciated.  Everyone from the valet guys, front desk, cafe staff etc., were really nice and helpful.  I will definitely be staying here again!",3,1,2

Also if you stand too close to the frosted glass door everyone can see you. There's also not enough choices for food but the Aria is close enough to use their restaurants. The bed is super comfortable but I probably wouldn't return.,0,0,0

Vdara is located at the city center and sandwiched between Bellagio and Aria. I love that it's smoke free but the layout of the room feels a little tight. The little kitchen would be useful if you are staying more than a couple of days but the fridge might be a little small if you want to do any cooking at all. They have the most comfy bathrobes here!

Vdara is located in the city center which is by far the most convenient location you can ever be in the strip.  It's practically next door to the Aria which is easily accessible to Monte Carlo on one side and the Bellagio on the other.  There is a tram that you can take for free to go from one end to the other.
The best thing about the Vdara Hotel & Spa is that it is not a casino hotel, so you would come out of your room and not be bothered by cigarette smoke and most importantly drunk and loud people.  Vdara is elegant and sophisticated.

The parking lot is very confusing to find! It's like a maze to get to the parking area.

When I got inside with my friends, I was very excited to let them know that I had a ""buy one get one free"" buffet that I wanted to use from playing myVegas. They told me that they didn't have a buffet. They also told me that they did not have an MLife?!? Then why the hell are they are affiliated with myVegas? Whoever I spoke to, didn't know what the hell was going on. They made me walk to Aria, which was the ""closest"" area to redeem my points. Unnecessarily, walked over there. I told them what happened, and they gave a look of confusion themself. They told me that Vdara has an MLife and that they couldn't redeem my buy one get one free buffet for Vdara, which I already knew. But, because Vdara told me to go to Aria, I did so. 

So, I had to go back to the Vdara, talk to them and go through the whole process again, because again they didn't know what the hell I was talking about, so I had to walk back to Aria for a second time and explain to them what was going on, again...

Aria told me that I couldn't redeem my buffet points at any of the hotels at the time, because it was Labor Day weekend. That was understandable. But for Vdara to tell me that they did not have an MLife and could not redeem my points for their buffet, is stupid. Again, then why would they be affiliated with myVegas? It doesn't make sense.

Vdara showed me a very bad first impression & I don't think I would go back there again. Looks like they wont be makng any money from me, EVER. Waste of time for me. The only reason why I gave it three stars, is because it is a really nice hotel, that is it!",2,0,0

So it's one of the new city centre hotels, along with the mandarin oriental,  aria and maybe one or two others which I can't remember . ( either a fail on my part for not remembering, or on theirs for opening so many at the same time)

The name. I mean, come on. What committee designed this one? Sounds more like a genital wart cream than a 5 star spa. 

Arriving by car is not as difficult as others would let you believe.  Off Harmon, you drive in and have to drop it at a free valet service. Yes, you can park it at ARIA next door for free but don't begrudge the valet a buck. 

Check in is easy and fairly well staffed. there is a resort fee, which they tell you about which includes wifi and gym entrance. The lobby is a banana shape and there was building works going on with a restaurant.

The room. A modern  suite with a  view of the bellagio fountains. A separate bedroom, with lounge and kitchenette. And here's where it gets interesting. 

When opening the door to the bathroom, you can see right through to where a person would be sitting on the toilet. The weird thing is that there was room for a separate door which hasn't been put in for whatever reason.

The main lounge has a wonderful array of plugs for multimedia recharging as well as the ability to play iPods\/pads on the tv. And the TV had an amazing array of channels. The kitchenette is actually quite quality except that there were no pots\/pans . You had to call down for them ( more tipping, I guess)

There was a coffee maker but no coffee.( Sort of like the strip club of coffee makers; look but don't touch)

The sofa was pretty without being comfortable and when folded out, was perhaps the most uncomfortable sofa bed I've felt. Happily, my kids slept there, not me.

Final piece de resistance in the rooms that the room overlaps another on a corner,melting you see the naked guy in the next room drinking his coffee and looking back at you. Just weird. As my miss us put it, it was a hotel designed by someone used to building offices notmhotels.

Positives were the spa was lovely with a well equipped gym. The pool is open in winter weather permitting, but closed on the days we came . 

It is a non casino hotel,  so it is very useful to go there with kids. Also the kitchen can save in terms of food costs. 

Getting there on foot can be difficult, but there is an excellent monorail to the shopping centre. And the Bellagio is a 5 minute walk away. 

Will I stay there again? At a lower price point, as I feel I'm getting more of a Renaissance experience as opposed to a hotel one. And I look forward to the restaurant being open.

This is a great place if you want to be in a nice hotel but want to be a little away from the strip and it does not have a casino in it. Although Aria, right next door, has a casino if you want to gamble a little. 

This hotel has great rooms. My favorite was the panoramic suite. Absolutely love seeing all of the outside lights from every angle. They have great bathrooms with a sexy shower and standalone tub. It definitely has Vegas written all over it without the trashiness :)

The bars and lounges on the main floor are a great place to unwind and they have an awesome store with travel necessities as well as clothing and gifts. Its an very large, upscale store. They also have a cafe and dessert bar.  The room service was also prompt and delicious.

Also checked out the spa last time I was here. We booked a couples massage and it was one of the best massages I've had. Interesting doing a couples massage too, as I had never done that. Thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience.

The bar and restaurant were ideal for a quick or late night snack, however menu the selection has fallen off this year for breakfast. The Aria might be better for a quick breakfast. Having traveled to LV may times, this is a hotel where you do not have to hike a mile to get to your room thru a smoke filled Casino. As a M Life member I get to see a lot of MGM locations and the Vdara surpasses all of my expectation. Deserve a 4 star recommendation! PS I even enjoyed the pool for some R&R.

Told me to call a 1800 number and that MAYBE they would remove it. Needless to say I filed a claim with my bank. This hotel could care less about making things right for its guests. If you stay here be wary about the business center because they'll scam you out of your money. Most hotels I've been to don't even charge for printing...  Also bartender accused my boyfriend of stealing a bottle of liquor when the price tag was still on it. No he just brought his bottle down because he hadn't been served in 25 minutes.

This nonsmoking, non-gambling hotel located behind the Bellagio has the great advantage of being quiet. 

If you don't want quiet and you want to party all through the night in a drunken stupor, Vdara is not for you. 

If you want a Vegas escape within a pocket of Vegas, Vdara will do nicely. 

The hotel rooms are large and spacious with an offset kitchenette that is ideal for morning risers who do not want to disturb their company. The entire hotel is very modern style, heavy in wood, simplistic lines, no frills. The only colors beyond the dark wood tones are black, white, and grey. Normally, not a huge fan, but after a full day of Vegas overstimulation the muted tones are a welcome relief. 

The bathroom was large with a fantastic shower that had only one drawback. I'm short and found the high shower head impossible to reach to adjust without climbing onto the marble bench within the shower. I'm sure a call to the front desk would have changed it for me, but it seemed like too much hassle for a short stay. The bathtub was equally large and reminded me of a huge cappuccino cup. Tall, straight edges with a unique drain I've never seen before. It was very relaxing, though with the tall flat sides I easily misjudged how far I could fill it without sloshing water from the sides when moving. I admit, it was a mini pool by the time I filled it! But truly delightful. 

The bed was comfortable and the couch relaxing. Temperature controls were easily adjusted and the electronic blinds were a great touch. The blackout shades are truly as good as they come. Never heard anyone on my floor or anyone outside of the room. It was amazingly quiet. 

Gone are the typical ""Do Not Disturb"" sign replaced with electronic controls. Each room features a lit doorbell and when you press ""Do Not Disturb"" it turns red and if you press ""Housekeeping"" it turns green. When in neither state it glows blue.

I do like the innovative way in which you can open and close your blinds, except one of ours was stuck and didn't work at all so I think with technology comes some challenges. It was also confusing getting our room cleaned, apparently we have to press some buttons and someone accidentally pressed the do not disturb. Although I like this idea, haha I still like the traditional door tag a little better.

The bed was comfortable, the shower was good but for a lot of girls and only one shower with a bathroom that does not have a door? Even if I'm staying with a significant other I don't want to use the toilet in front of them. How weird!

If you are looking for a hotel that is smoke free, has all the modern amenities and modern atmosphere but with no smokey casino, a place that allows for easy checkin (if you stay at the sister hotel Aria you'll wait 30 min in a long line to check in) is close to everything, allows you to take advantage of most amenities at the Aria and Cosmopolitan then the Vdara is for you! 
 
If you need to check in earlier than 3pm and want a good floor, then use the VIP concierge check in ( select it at the time of booking for extra $50) and you will get a really nice meet and greet when you arrive and can check in much much earlier to a better floor.

The Starbucks and the small market are very reasonable. For $40, you get full access to the Aria spa and fitness amenities which are superior. But if you don't want to spend the extra then the Vdara spa and fitness are fine.

Vdara is part of M life so don't forget to get your M points. We booked a junior suite at Vdara which was less expensive than other hotels but just as good.

If you want an early check in, the earliest they have it is at 8:00am and it's complimentary!

The entrance is pretty simple to find, it's right next to the cosmo.  Parking is only Valet but it's def worth it since they find your car in about 2-3 minutes.  As soon as we got there, we felt welcomed.  All the staff is really nice and helpful.

There were only 2 staff at the check in so it took us about 5 - 10 minutes to get helped but it was worth the wait.  The casino smelled cleaned and new since it is a non smoking and non gambling casino. The check in and elevators are right near each other so you don't have to go crazy trying to find both like the Venetian.

We upgraded our room for $20 more to a City Corner Suite on the 46th floor and my oh my was it worth every penny.  I hate elevators because some feel like they're about to break but the elevators here are so smooth that you don't even feel like your moving. 

Our suite was HUGE with a BEAUTIFUL view!  We could see the strip, the bellagio fountains and all the back side too.  The whole suite just wrapped around with windows with beautiful views.  

They have 2 restrooms, a kitchen table, full kitchen with huge refrigerator, (the microwave is also an oven)  we took a pizza and cooked it (yummy)  living room was cute and comfy, the bedroom was spacious with the bed that felt like if you were floating on a cloud.  The main restroom had a nice big tub for 2 people with 2 separate sinks, toilet and shower.  Just lift the curtains up and relax on the tub for an amazing view of the strip :)

The decor was absolutely amazing, the color, the structure.  Amazing.  I would love a home like this one day and I also hope to stay at this hotel more often because it def blew me away :)",0,0,0

Pros
1. No gambling, no smoking area! ( great for families w kids) 
2. Comfortable bed 
3. Modern style room
4. Great location! Not too far from the strip
5. Kitchen and decent size refrigerator.

I loved this place before and I loved it even more after this past stay.  I checked in and Angela was superb at the front desk and was able to score me a room on the 52nd floor!  

The room I got this time had the divider wall between the living room and the bed, which is the style I like.  The comfortable bed made it easy to sleep in the two nights I was there.  All the same amenities as last time were there (two fridges, one a mini bar and one empty sans two complimentary bottles of water).  

I used the spa and also had a wonderful personalized 80 min massage.  The men's spa itself was small but nice.  There was a small lounge with a TV, tea, snacks (banana chips, dried fruits), and fruit infused water.  The vanity area had grooming needs for men.  A little further down is the restroom and showers.  In the back is the steam room, dry sauna, and hot tub.  I was the only one in there during that time so it was nice to have it all to myself for about 30 minutes.  The hot tub had this awesome mini waterfall flowing water to the tub.  The steam room itself....I'm not sure if there was supposed to have eucalyptus but I didn't smell it.  It smelled of wood...not too pleasant.

I believe my therapist's name was Lisa, who was a great conversationalist and masseuse.  

The gym itself was good for a hotel.  I wish there were more weight options or an area for more dedicated upper back and shoulders.  They had a stretch rack which I ended up using to do some pull-ups but a dedicated pull-up bar would have been nice.  

The best thing I liked about Vdara is the simplicity.  It's like the eye of the storm of Vegas hotels.  No casino, no smoking, no stress, little noise.  If you want a tranquil, relaxing hotel, I would suggest this spot.

To reiterate, there is no self-parking, valet only.  The only self-park option is to park at Aria and either hoof it or take the tram (complimentary) to the Vdara\/Bellagio stop.",2,1,3

Anyway...they lost our reservation. Took the desk clerk 20 minutes to find it. It's a good thing we brought our documentation. Our room wasn't ready so the desk clerk explained to us that we could not check in and would have to wait an hour. My wife objected and replied, ""I'm not waiting in that line again."" The clerk took down our cell numbers and said she'd call us when the room was ready. The red flag began to make it's appearance. 

Go to the bellhop desk so they can hold our bags. ""You have to take your bags to the guys outside and they'll hold it for you."" What? Why is there a bellhop desk inside if we have to go outside?

Of course, our genius clerk DID NOT call us when our room was ready. We had to call them. So, we finally get to check in and were obviously distraught. The new desk clerk was actually very nice and handed us a Cinco De Mayo flyer for ""special"" appetizers and drinks at the pool.

We checked in, the room was nice. It overlooked the Bellagio and her fountains. The closet doors, when open, block the walk way. That seemed strange and inconvenient. If you like brain teasers, you'll have fun trying to figure out the room controls. Anyway, the room reminded me of TheHotel lite.

Off to the pool for some quesadillas. Settled into our poolside space and spent 20 minutes trying to flag down a server. Finally got to place our order...""The kitchen is closed."" LOL, after all the promotion the nice desk clerk did for the Cinco De Mayo pool party, he forgot about the kitchen hours. 15 minutes later, our waitress shows up with the drink and I'm waving to her as she walks by. A few minutes later, she finds me, ""If you saw me why didn't you say anything."" Wow, really?

One of the towels in our room had orange-red stains on it. Nice. There's no bottle opener, so be prepared to bring one. There is a wine cork opener, I used that to loosen up my beer cap (No it wasn't a twisty). I can say that the wine pricing at their general store is pretty good.

There seems to be heat lamps in the elevators.

Check out: The iPad person does some work. For some reason, the ropes that organize the check in check out line were gone. We create a makeshift line where 2 other parties line up behind us. The thought is, we get the next available clerk. There were 3 desk clerks working. HOWEVER, the iPad person tells everyone to make 3 lines. Wait a minute, if my clerk takes awhile, the people behind me can get helped before me? Didn't happen to us, but I watched a poor sod get jumped over twice by people who were behind him, and the iPad person directed them to the speedy clerk line.

We won't be staying there again. Never had these issues at the Wynn, Venetian, Aria, or Mandalay (The Hotel).",6,2,1

The hotel does not have a self-parking garage so you will have to valet it each time you arrive\/leave.  We arrived a couple of hours before check-in time, but they allowed us to check-in early which was nice.  The thing that was most unique about the hotel was that they don't have a casino inside so it's ""kid friendly"" if you're sensitive to that type of stuff.  

The room was nice and modern with plenty of space for the two of us.  Our room had a small kitchen with a two burner stove, fridge, sink and small dining table for four.  There was a sofa and flat screen t.v. in the living room area and on the other side was our bed and another flat screen t.v.  The bathroom was a good size, but I did notice the water does not keep it's temperature well.  It goes from cold to extremely hot when trying to adjust the temp slightly.

We had a great view of the Bellagio fountain as well as the Eiffel tower, but I did notice we could hear the freeway noise a bit from our room so not sure if I'll choose that side again.  Now for the bad part.

The e-mail promotion we booked our reservations through said that there was a $50 daily resort credit.  The Vdara Resort Credit can be used towards: Spa & Salon Vdara, Bar Vdara, Market Café, and In-Room Dining.  That was word for word of what the actual e-mail said.  My husband also went up to the counter to find out exactly what we could use the credit for just to be sure and the person behind the counter said that we could use it at the market cafe.  So, we bought goods from the market cafe both days for a total of $100 that we were supposed to get a credit for when checking out.  Turns out, the credit is only valid for ""behind the counter goods"" in the market and NOT for anything else in the store.  The e-mail didn't specify that nor did the person working at the check-in desk?!  After much arguing we ended up paying a portion of the $100, which still made me mad because we felt deceived.  It was a sour ending to what was a really great trip to Vegas and I don't think we'll be staying there in the future.",0,0,0

I am your guest at room 270XX with my husband staying since this Tue and will be leaving today. Yesterday after we came back for dinner at Adir and went to Bar Vdara for a drink. We were standing at the entrance and waiting to be seat.  No waitress came over to us even it was not many guest at the bar. There was a bartender pointed us the way and told us to seat ourselves while I could see there were several waitresses standing behind him doing nothing.

My husband saw a waitress brought a drink to the table behind me and she even looked at him but still didn't come over or say anything to us. We stayed another two minutes and waiting to order some drinks. After several minutes, still no one came over. My husband said this was ridicious and we left. Then we got some drink and cake at the market located across the bar. We had a very bad experience at your bar and would like to report to the management since I believe the management should know about their poor service to their guest and someone need to deal with it.

4 stars only because it wasn't up to par. I'm not a stickler on hotels but expect the necessities to be there. 
So description for the studio suite says there is a fridge. I get to the room and one side of the fridge was locked. I'm not sure if that is supposed to happen, no matter, I only need one side to work. Open the other side and it did not feel cold at all. Literally well like it was not on. Felt the inside walls of the fridge and it felt maybe 5 degrees cooler than the room temp. Ok maybe it's hard to perceive temperature by just feeling. I put a water bottle in and check back in 3 hours. Still warm. It literally took an entire night till the bottle got slightly cold. So I guess there is a fridge but don't expect it to work like a normal one I guess. 

Next pet peeve was the lack of tissues. Our tissue box had 3 tissues in it. Once again that is fine, I'll just call the front desk and ask them to bring more up. While I'm at it, I'll ask about the fridge too, maybe I didn't flip a switch or it just performs very very sluggishly. I call the front desk....10 mins on hold with no answer. Gave up and just lived with these things. 

Other things to note, everything is as described by other reviews and the hotel website. 
Valet is $18 for 24 hours so that sucks. 
You can't walk from vdara out to the strip just on the side walk. You either have to walk to aria then out. Or walk to Cosmo, through their parking lot and then out.

Shortly after booking the hotel, I sent some emails to the property stating that my newlywed wife and myself would be staying at the Vdara for our honeymoon, and that 1. she had recently had a 2nd surgery on her ankle, could we please have a room close to the elevator as it would be much easier on her, and 2. if at all possible, could we halve a bottle of champagne awaiting our arrival, as it was our honeymoon.  Shortly after, I received an email stating that we had been upgraded to a lake view (Bellagio water show is the lake view), and that they would in fact try to accommodate the champagne greeting in room upon arrival.  Great!! I was ready for a 5 star review before we set foot in the place.  Fast forward to check in time, midnight june 29th. Upon check in, it was clear there was a problem the way the front desk guy was whispering into the phone with (im assuming room service). After about 10 minutes, it was clear the aforementioned upgrade (which we definitely didn't expect, total bonus), did not happen. That's ok. But the room was basically as far away as possible from the elevator as possible. Usually we don't care, but months after a 2nd surgery, a handicapped placard and such, please give us a regular room near the elevator. But we were told we could unpack, and maybe the next day we could re-pack and get a different room. This was our honeymoon with a technically handicapped person, so thanks but no thanks. Guys, imagine dealing with that after you were bragging to your newlywed about how the Vdara had hooked it up for us. Also, no champagne, so needless to say, no honeymoon magic for this guy that night!!  FF to the next day. We get a call from housekeeping saying that they had 2 bottles of champagne, and some chocolate covered strawberries too. Told us they delivered it to the wrong room (assuming the lake view suite we didn't get), sorry. OK not bad at all, but sometimes the damage has already been done. Guys with upset newlyweds who are handicapped (however few of there are of you can understand!!). So that was a very nice gesture. Told them in email I would gladly pay for it, but they did it for free, albeit a day late (again on our only honeymoon ever!!) so that's good on them. FF to the final answer.I would give the hotel a 4.5 overall. Very nice, clean, great rooms, friendly staff. But as I sit here in NY today, a few days after the honeymoon, lets say the honeymoon is over!! I myself would go there again, but that choice has been taken out of my hands now!

The room was really cute with a pool view. Nice little kitchenette with a microwave, stove, sink and mini fridge. Beautiful bathroom with a nice full size tub. 
The only problem with this place besides the fact that there was no casino downstairs and that the room service closed at 10 and there was no where to eat downstairs was that the fridge didn't work and water pressure for the shower was too low and the sink was clogged... Oh wait there is more, pool area is too small. They don't have enough lawn chairs. And the drink service was too slow.

Place is modern, simple and cute but not worth it. Especially if you're planning on going to places around the street.
Plan on taking the cab everywhere and be ready for a fee for each night you're there for. As everyone said, you have to ask for the kitchen stuff and they will definitely clean your room everyday. There's no "" do not disturb"" sign. 

So the best way to get to the strip is to walk towards bellagio especially when its like 108 degrees outside. Instead of going outside to the front you'll go over a bridge and into the a lobby\/empty entrances and just follow the hallway. You'll stay cool, plus its a better easier than walking towards cosmo!

Booked ourselves a nice 1 bedroom corner suite with the works! Meaning we had our own kitchen to cook all our clean meals for the entire 3.5 days we were staying. And you can just call housekeeping with the push of your hotel phone button and they bring you all your kitchenette needs right away (pots, pans, cutting board, knife, place settings, etc). And if you leave your dishes dirty through the night (not that I would ever do that, I love washing dishes!), the next morning, the housecleaning crew actually takes all the dirty ish outta the kitchen and you can call for a brand new set of stuff. Pretty insane! 

I absolutely LOVE the customer service here. It's definitely top notch. You get free valet service if you're staying there and their valet guys are always very QUICK. Most of the time our car would be parked out front for us.

I also love the fact that it's a non-smoking hotel. Unless you really crave lung cancer, then walk your booty over to Aria (which is connected to Vdara) and suck in all that mcnasty casino air.

The bed and pillows were soooo comfy, it was like sleeping on clouds each night. Our friend who slept on the pullout couch had no complaints and he slept like a baby even when we were gettin our freak ON in the bedroom. ;) I love the modern shower and tub too!

My bf and I had recently stayed here looking to try something different after reading it was quiet, smoke-free and had no casinos in the lobby area.  It's always nice to come back to some place quiet after going around the strip and whatnot.  You won't find a big crowd of people around the lobby area and it's connected to Aria and Bellagio, which is so much better than walking outside in the scorching heat.  

Valet and the staff were really nice and friendly.  Our suite had a kitchen, spacious bathroom and an ample amount of space.  It doesn't look as nice as other hotels in comparison but that's just my personal opinion.  

There really are no restaurants here so you COULD go to the small lobby and visit their market\/cafe that closes at 10 pm on weekdays and midnight during weekends.  They also have this small area for their bar but there are other places to go for a drink that seems more social.  We never went to these places Vdara offered because Bellagio is right next door!

This hotel is more quiet than other hotels since it doesn't have a casino.  It does, however, have a lobby bar, a place to get small snacks, and a Starbucks.

The rooms are gorgeous with amazing views.  My friend and I had a room on the 29th floor with views of Las Vegas Strip South.  The room had a small kitchen with a sink, 2-heater stovetop, a microwave, a mini-bar, and a small refrigerator.  Along with the king-size bed, there was also a sofabed that is fairly comfortable.  The bathroom had a stand-up shower and a jacuzzi tub.

The room service wasn't all that great.  The maid came to our room but it was still early and we were still asleep\/getting ready, so we asked her to come back later.  She never came, for two days, until we called up the housekeeping department and asked if someone could come service our rooms since we were out of towels and toiletries.  What they used to clean the room had a vinegar smell to it that made me so nauseous, so it's wise to not be in the room when they are cleaning!

Other than the lack of housekeeping service, Vdara is a beautiful and well kept hotel, and I would definitely recommend it.

I sort of want to  leave it at that, but I guess it requires an explanation.  To be fair, if this were not a Vegas hotel, maybe the service would get better grades but Vegas is all about customer service and Vdara is severely lacking.
The hotel does look stunning.  If you want to stay in a fancy new suite and have some impressive pictures to show your friends, you will succeed.  It is super cheap for what you get out of the room.

Service Issue A
We were there for a trade show, which lined up with valentines day (my wife and I own a store together), so I ordered flowers and champagne which were to be there upon arrival.  The flowers made it, the champagne (which I had already paid for) did not.  This was a problem, as we arrived at 12:30 (3:30 EST) AM.  So my wife wanted to crash, but I had this other part of the surprise that had not shown up yet.  I snuck into the bathroom to call the front desk, who kept transferring me to room service, who kept not answering.  Finally I told the front desk to just take care of it and, after an hour and a half of keeping my wife awake, champagne arrived.

Service Issue B
Our coffee pot was busted.  This wouldn't be a huge deal if there were a coffee shop on site (I know, the bar sells coffee, but a real coffee shop) but like any time we required service all week, it took over an hour and three phone calls to get someone to the room.

Service Issue C
The rooms come with a kitchen, but no silverware or dishes.  On our way up to the room we tried to pick up two spoons which they refused to give us any other way than by room service.  My problem with this was two fold.  One, I did not want to tip someone to take me two spoons when I was standing at the counter the spoons were behind.  Two, I knew It was going to take at least an hour and three phone calls.  Problem two was, in fact, a reality.

It is quite a hike to get here from the strip.  The tram doesn't do anything, you have to walk so far through crystals to get to it that you're better off just walking through Aria.  It is not too bad going through the Bellagio.

I liked the fact that it was non gaming, being there for a show, but doubtful that we would stay here again.",4,0,0

I love that it's a non-smoking hotel so no nasty cigarette smoke congestion when you enter. The lobby area is open, organized, has an ample amount of comfy seating, several charging stations and it smells like a spa. There is a nice bar, deli\/market and a Starbucks just as you enter the hotel. I like the really close proximity to Aria and Cosmopolitan. Another nice perk is the easy access walkway to Bellagio and the free tram to Aria and the newly renovated Monte Carlo and New York New York hotels. I appreciate that there is a security guard posted near the elevators to help keep out the riffraff. There are 12 elevators split between the two guest entrance areas. The hallways are clean, kept and wider than most hotels. I've only stayed in the Executive Corner Suites so this part of the review is only based on my experience with this particular room. The room is really spacious with over 800 square feet to roam around in. The rooms are clean, open, tastefully decorated and configured nicely to where you don't feel cramped. A nice work desk with a view has come in handy on a few occasions. There is a stacked washer and dryer, a full kitchen with high-end stainless steel appliances and a dining table that seats four. The full-size refrigerator\/freezer has an ice maker and a water dispenser inside. There are flatscreen TVs in the living room and bedroom. I appreciate the heavy locking door that separates the bedroom from the living room for extra privacy. I love that each window section has both automatic curtains and blackout shades. The queen sized bed is comfortable. There is a pull out sofa sleeper in case you need it. There is a 1\/2 bath near the entrance and a huge full bathroom in the bedroom. The full bathroom has a big tub with a nice view and a large, separate walk-in shower. Nice added touch with the dual sinks. The room is stocked with plenty of towels, Kleenex, toiletries, slippers and a few small bottles of complimentary water. There are plenty of outlets throughout the room in case you need to charge electronics.

Housekeeping are great. They go about their duties with less noise.. barely knew they were next door or across the hall. They did a great job in our room. 

Spa staff? oh yes! :-) My massage therapist, Ivy was Awesome!! Also the ladies that receive you and maintain the spa are friendly and great. It also helps that the spa accepts spafinder certificates.

I would recommend this hotel for those who want a relaxing getaway but also want that vegas vibe on a part time basis! 

We booked a weekday 2 night Zarkana Package for 350 plus fees and tax. Our seats were 10 seats back from the stage. Nice!!

Thank you Vdara staff.. a hotel can look luxurious and beautiful, but it is the staff that reflects its true facade.",0,0,0

I stayed here for two nights with friends and my husband on a Thursday and Friday night. We had two corner suites between the five of us.

Pros:
+ Our suite was huge!  It was large enough that two people couple easily live there because it's the same size as most regular one bedroom apartments.
+ The views were amazing.  Amazing!
+ Everything was clean.  The towels were fresh, the linens, felt perfect, and the kitchen and bathroom were spotless.
+ The elevators are super quick.
+ Checking in was a breeze.
+ Valet is free (but tipping is always nice) and the bell hops brought up our bags within minutes of calling for them
+ Blackout curtains-- sleeping in is not a problem
+ Super quite-- an extra plus if you're there not to party or if you're sleeping in after partying
+ Smoke free-- clean air and healthy lungs! :)
+ The bartenders at the bar downstairs are such chill, super nice, and have some really good tips.
+ A small shop to buy food and drinks downstairs
+ No casino in this hotel [OMG where will you ever find somewhere to gamble at?! Oh wait, it's everywhere else...]
+ Price: at least the weekend we were here, it was only about $30 more a night to stay here in a suite versus staying at much older and not as nice casinos

Cons: 
- Checkout was a mess because their system was down (so no checking out from the TV in the from); but my husband is a smart guy, so instead of waiting in the long line, he called from the lobby and checked out right away while we watched everyone else in line.
- No casino in this hotel [OMG where am I going to gamble?! Oh wait, there are casinos everywhere else...]

Side notes:
+ I called housekeeping to request more toiletries from the hotel and they brought up about a two weeks supply for me.  Awesome.
+ Bellagio and Aria are all a three minute walk away!",0,0,0

Rooms are modern and extremely comfortable. Marketplace in the lobby is perfect for a quick breakfast. Small pool means that its easy to relax without the masses of people at the larger hotels.

The location is pretty centrally located and isn't too far off the main road.  Besides its awesome modern interior everything else falls short.  

My boyfriend and I arrived early, around 11am and planned on leaving our bags with the front desk until check in at 3pm.  The line, whether it was suppose to be one or three, took forever to move.  When we finally were able to speak to the front desk they found a room for us, 4 hours early!  Yay!  This was going to be a good start to our stay here, so I thought.

Our room was not cleaned.  We called down to the front desk and explained what happened and housekeeping, who was already in the hall wondered why the room was even given to us.  After leaving to get some lunch we returned to a nice, clean room.  Leaving again to watch some shows we returned to our room late, tired and needing a shower.  Our room key didn't work!  After calling down to the front desk, we were transferred to security who was suppose to come right up.  We waited about ten minutes and resorted to sitting on the floor exhausted and continued to wait for about 30 mins.  A nice security lady finally came and also asked if we had asked for an extended stay.  Extended stay?  We just checked in that day!  

After a not so great experience with the hotel, we also noticed that the mini bar was missing a bottle of liquor.  I called down to the front desk and informed them so I wouldn't get charged.  Thank goodness I didn't but I also noticed that the next day, after housekeeping, they had still not restocked the mini bar.  

FYI:  If you stay here, there are no options for food after 8pm, besides room service.  The ""market"" down in the lobby is a joke and closes at 8pm.  We paid $8 for a fruit and ice smoothie, dumb us.  We ended up walking over to Bellagio for a meal.

For Vegas, hotels can not afford to make these operational mistakes.  There are too many hotel options and the competition alone should push Vdara to run a tighter ship.",2,0,0

We stayed in the penthouse suite, it was about half the size of the bellagio's. Yes, I realize that the Vdara is about half the price of the Bellagio, but I digress. 

The hotel is new and clean. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The room is clean and modern. I love the fact that they have a full sized refrigerator for booze and left overs. The bed is relatively comfortable, the windows are really dirty.

They also don't have complimentary tea bags or coffee. If we wanted something to drink, we'd have to go all the way down to the lobby (The Marketplace) to get overpriced drinks. 
The wi-fi is also terrifyingly slow. The Vdara purports itself to be a ""hi-tech hotel"", but its not THAT special, electronic wise. 

Otherwise, this casino-free hotel is GREAT! It is a nice alternative to other casino hotels, to those who don't gamble\/smoke and come to Vegas for shopping and sight seeing. Vdara seems like its pet-friendly too! I might bring my dog next time. 

The Cosmopolitan is right next to the Vdara, making it easy to access to the closest casino and restaurants like The Henry on foot, without taking out our car.  I wish they had an actual bridge across the two, but I guess The two different companies don't want to merge for their own sake....

The bathtub is very nice! Very clean room with lots of lighting from the abundant lighting and natural lights from huge window-walls. Automatic blinds and two TVs, one on each side of the wall for the main bed and the sofa bed (for our suite).

Upsides:
-Nonsmoking. It was perfect since I was in Vegas celebrating our anniversary and was on the tail end of a cold. The air here was still super dry but housekeeping was nice enough to send up a humidifier for me.
-Service was prompt! We checked in super early and they told us to eat lunch and come back so by 1PM we already had a lovely suite to hang out in.
-Clean! Cleanliness is super important.... and the carpets in the room and the bathrooms were uber clean. I think CSI and their black light would be impressed.
-Free Valet! Don't forget to tip the guys!

Downsides:
-Valet department couldn't find our car = 15 minute wait while the guy drove around the parking structure in someone else's car looking for our car.
-Only one ""snackbar\/grocery"" + bar instead of a full fledged restaurant
-Stupid roundabout circular driveway was confusing since the signs sucked!!
-Only one sink. SERIOUSLY!? They have this huge counter space and only one sink. All the other resorts I've stayed at had at least two sinks!!! I know.... something small to gripe about but I tend to take over an entire sink and I don't like sharing. I'm an only child.

Sign up for the MGM rewards card... they'll send you lots of hotel rates that are on sale. We got this for $120 a night plus $20 dollars of resort credit. We used it on buying chocolate covered strawberries and a lox bagel downstairs.

I've been curious about it, and the City Center in general, even though I love both my mainstays, The Delano and The Bellagio. I may have a new favorite, however, at least if I can always get the corner suite upgrade!

The lobby is smaller than the usual Strip hotel, given it has no casino. But it is a very nice place to hang out, with a great bar\/lounge area, an outside patio and a few other places to hang out. Check-in was a breeze and everyone, from Valet to Bellman to the person behind the front desk, were wonderful. 

I was on a high floor, in a corner suite. I'd been offered the upgrade via email after I made a reservation. This ""room"" is incredible. Think of a big square with 4 quadrants... kitchen, living room, bedroom and bathroom. There is a long windowed hallway from the door leading into the square.

As it is a corner room there are windows everywhere! I was on the backside... the other side must be incredible, looking directly onto the Strip. But this was wonderful as well, as I could still see most of the hotels at various places, and I could see the Bellagio fountains from the bathroom. And the sunset each evening was stunning. 

The bed was incredibly comfy and the bathroom huge and inviting. I used the kitchen each morning for breakfast. You have to call down for everything but they brought up pots and pans and plates quickly. I agree with others that paying for the Keurig is silly. I brought a small coffee maker of my own. 

All told, it was an almost perfect experience and I will stay here again and again. (I come to Vegas at least twice a year, usually.) Given there is no casino, it is not as 'happening' as other hotels, but for many this is a great perk. And the Aria is a two minute walk away, maximum, and the Cosmo close as well. 

My one 'complaint' was with the Valet. NOT the people who work there. These men and women were working hard, seriously. They simply did not seem to have enough people, so it took forever to get your car. And for some odd reason, unlike every other hotel I've been to, they won't let you call ahead for the car. You have to go down there and stand in line to give them your ticket, then you have a long wait for the car.

Otherwise, though, top notch all around and I can't wait to go back. I stayed in the room much more than usual on a Vegas trip... I did not want to leave!",0,0,0

When we first arrived the gentleman at the checkin desk was very friendly and helpful. He allowed us to have late check out which was at 1pm. I understand that this is also based on availability. When booking the room we asked that we be able to see the Bellagio fountain, and were told yes- no problem, but the gentleman was up front at checkin, and told us that Cosmo is blocking and no matter what we will not be able to see much.

First time staying at Vdara, I got the city corner suite with city view. It's slightly cheaper than the fountain view (facing the strip and Bellagio fountain). Every room has a small kitchen, even the studio suite has a mini fridge, stove, and dishwasher. You can have your room cleaned every morning during your stay while you get ready for Vegas festivities. Majority of the rooms have a living room and dining room! If you get the corner suite, it's pretty spacey but it only has one bathroom where the vdara suite is less spacey but has two bathrooms.

Vdara used to do complimentary valet parking in the past but during my recent stay they charge you $18 dollars a day. Their valet is super slow but you can opt for self parking $10 a day if you want.

Downside is the walk to the strip. It's not a far walk just a lot of roundabouts to get to the strip. You would have to walk through Bellagio which is connected to Aria\/Vdara to get out to the strip. I also don't recommend the food downstairs because it's overpriced and you're better off buying groceries and cooking in your hotel room for the most simplest meal.

Location: The location of the hotel is okay, it's a bit more to walk around the Aria or the Bellagio since it's not located right on the strip. I don't mind walking but if it's 109 degrees outside, I do mind.

Hotel: Hotel itself  is pretty modern, however lacks some amenities. The cafe on the ground floor was the only thing you can get food-wise, and it lacked selection. Lobby was pretty small and filled up quickly. Pool was the tiniest thing and closed early (I think 8pm). 

Staff: They weren't the nicest or the sweetest staff. We informed them that I would be celebrating my 30th birthday prior to arrival, yet there was not upgrades or champagne or treats in our room. Also, biggest ""weird"" thing that happened was the housekeepers came into our room twice without knocking to see if we were in!!!! WTF?!?! Who does that? Good thing we weren't doing anything funny or naked!! Who just goes into people's rooms without knocking or announcing themselves as housekeeping?! Totally rude and uncalled for. 

Room: We got a room on the 8th floor facing the Aria and the pool. It was okay at most. I would've liked to face the Bellagio or the strip, but sadly we didn't get a room like that. On Expedia we booked a ""city view"" room.....hardly a city view from the 8th floor.

Check-in\/out: We got to the hotel around 9:30am and if we wanted to do an early check-in, it would've cost an extra $30. Check-in began at 10am, so we waited till then. Also, we decided to extend our check-out. Good to know that that is even possible. As a courtesy, they let you stay till 12 noon. For another $30, you can stay till 3pm. Several times though, the housekeeping staff knocked on our doors asking us when we were leaving. And once, the housekeeper just barged in. HELLO?!?! Can you freaking confirm with the front desk when we are checking out?! Where's the communication?

Other than that, room was clean. Bathroom was great with the separate tub and glass enclosed shower. Plentiful amount of towels and pillows as well. Not too many channels on TV though. Definitely a really low-key hotel and quiet. If you want a night life at the actual hotel, this isn't the place.",4,4,3

Came here with my family for the sema show. They had a special of 2 nights with 2 free spa massage passes for about $600 including wifi and $50 in room dining.

The rooms are all king size with sofa bed unless you upgrade. The bed was too soft and felt like an old run down bed with nice sheets. The sofa bed was horrible, springs about to come out and break your back. We had to call housekeeping to give us some kind of options since the sofa bed was really bad. Apparently they knew this sofa bed is bad because they were prepared in having bedding put on top of the sofa bed. So it wasn't as bad when you slept there. The bed felt too soft, it felt like a really old bed, the springs were just way too soft. 

The bathroom and tv's were decent. They give slippers if you ask the housekeeping which was nice. The rooms in Vdara are more for business people since it has a few tables to do some work. 

Went to try the pool and there was news about how the sun rays reflected off their buildings and to the people in the pool area. I had forgotten about this news when I sat across the building in the pool area and felt like I was getting burned. It was a different kind of burn from the sun, this felt like you were in the oven and your skin was literally in heat. That was a big negative. I moved to face the sun and the sun's direct rays were better than sitting away from it getting the sun's reflections from the buildings. 

The cafe in Vdara was pretty good. Got the burger and wrap. Was pretty good.",3,1,0

Just got back from my 3-day vacation at the marvelous Vdara. They were running a special on their deluxe suite which dropped the price dramatically. Watch out for internet specials they often have on their website. I just have to say that from the time we arrived at this hotel, up until we checked out, we have received nothing but the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE and CARE....

Valet was fast and easy, and when you enter in this hotel, you smell nothing but fresh flowers! We had 5 people ask us if we needed help with our bags even though we insisted in carrying it ourselves. Got upgraded to a deluxe suite with a view! The hotel room itself is amazing. Up to date furnishings with a contemporary feel. We were on the 35th floor with the marvelous partial view of the city, mountains, and Bellagio fountains. Separate tub and stand up shower. TWO HDTV's, FREE internet, media hub, and electric shades and curtains! The customer service and personality of this hotel is AMAZING. Ordered room service and they set up our food in our kitchen table for us. There was never a wait for extra towels, coffee, water, or anything we needed. Even though this is a non-gambling a hotel, you are in walking distance of Aria (which is another beautiful marvel in City Center) and also Bellagio. We had no problems driving to reach other casinos as Vdara is right on the strip and central enough that you can go just about anywhere. The valet service is fast and free! Just give them a tip ($2.00 would suffice) 

If I had to make one complaint it would have to be the issue of finding this hotel. There is still construction going on at the City Center so be careful when reaching this destination. It can be tricky! 

If you are looking to be rowdy and run wild where you are staying THIS IS NOT THE HOTEL FOR YOU. There are no drunk hooligans running a muck in the hotel lobby or gamblers blowing smoke in the air. This is an escape from the Vegas chaos. An oasis with comfort and style. But still close enough to be able to do all those ""wild"" things that people usually do in Sin City.",1,0,1

Ok first the good: 
-If you don't like the casino, and all the smoking, and packed lobby, this is the place for you. Since Vdara doesn't have a casino or anything except for a restaurant and bar on the ground floor, there's very little traffic and it's easy to get in and out of your hotel.
-Aria is right across the way so that if you did want to gamble, shop, or eat some dessert or something different, it's just a walk away. No need to get your car out of the garage.
-We stayed in the Vdara one bedroom suite and it was ample space with a kitchen with table that seats 4. Includes a mini fridge. The sofa turns out into a queen sleeper. Housekeeping will come turn it down and make the bed for you. Overall, the room was pretty nice. 

Now for the bad:
-the bathroom: the toilet wasn't in a separate closet, there was only one sink, and those doors sucked. It was a pain to open and close. 
-housekeeping was very slow. We called for extra towels. That took an hour.
-room service dining: the food was actually pretty good but it took 1.5 hours for the food to get to our room. We regretted not running across to Aria for something or even on the strip because it took so long.
-spa: my friend made an appointment but then cancelled it right away and they still charged it on the room. Big problem at checkout. They wanted my friend to make an appeal when she didn't even have the service done! we got the money back, but not that day. horrible! 
-parking: you can only valet your car. they have a parking garage but you can't park it yourself. This can be a good thing, except if they scratch your car because they aren't responsible for it. 
-it can be really confusing at first to get to vdara. It's so easy to end up at aria or the underground garage, so read the signs carefully because it's really confusing how they set up all of that. 
-the pool was really small. I expected something much larger and more than one pool. And they closed the pool at 8pm!!! Who does that??? It was freaking springtime and it was hot and we couldn't even go for a nice jacuzzi dip late at night.

So I would never personally stay here again. For that service and room, I'd rather stay at the Hilton Garden Inn.",1,1,1

I flew in first to Vegas before the rest of my group and was given the option of pre-checking in to our rooms. The time was 1:30PM. Since I understand that check-in time is not until 3PM, I was willing to wait until then. the receptionist pre-checked me in, asked for a credit card for the Resort Fee\/Security Hold, and made me sign the forms. With booking the room, we had requested that the two rooms we booked would be next to each other. The receptionist saw this note and confirmed the request with me. She told me the suite was ready but the other room next to it was not. I told her I didn't mind waiting since I was ""early"" anyways and it wasn't 3PM yet so we'd rather wait and have the rooms next to each other. She gave me a number and said to check back around 2:30-3PM to see if the room was ready, but she assured me that with pre-checking in, the room should be ready by then because the staff knows I'm already here. She kindly gave me a key to go to the pool to lounge and wait in the meantime, which was great.

Come 3PM, when my entire group arrived, we all checked in with the receptionist and they said another hr before the rooms were ready. We waited and waited in the lobby. Apparently, the suite now was still noted as ""dirty"" on the system. We waited and waited...it was 5PM...we asked to be let up into the other room while we wait for the suite next door to be cleaned. So image 15 of us jammed into one room. before we were let into the room, the receptionist asked for a credit card for the credit card\/resort fee. I informed her that I was here since 1PM and I had already given my card for the room and signed the forms. She said there was no credit card on file. So with that, my friend gave them a card and signed the exact form (this will be relevant later). we went up to one of the rooms and waited some more. it was almost 6:30-7PM when we saw house keeping. We asked when the room would be ready and to our surprise, she said it had been ready since 2PM. WE WERE FURIOUS. This my friend, is HORRIBLE communication between their staff.

The customer service here was extremely poor. Any requests were not  acknowledged until MANY hours later. I can't imagine with just hospitality being their only service (no casino, etc.), they would be on top of it but they were not on many levels. Taxi service was horrible. One taxi would come every 15-20minutes. When we checked out, we told them about our experience and with that, all they could say was sorry and ""what do you want me to do about it."" It is very sad, how little they care about customer satisfaction. At other hotels (specifically Wynn\/Encore), they will give you some form of credit or compensation. Here, it's almost as if they don't even want you to come back. Take it or leave it pretty much.

A week later, my card and my friend's card were both charged. Excuse me but doesn't this fucking hotel know how do anything right?? My card was ""not on file"" but somehow I received the charge. from the beginning to the very end, nothing but FAILURE on their part as a Hotel.

I'm only speaking of my (our) stay...

The room we had was one of their regular suits facing the strip, it was beautiful as it looks right down at the Bellagio fountains and further down the strip. Now, the rooms that face the Aria don't have this view so take that into consideration. 

The room: Huge, clean, modern, and comfy. You have a couch, office desk, kitchen desk, and a coffee table... Come on! It's not just for sleeping in, you can invite a bunch of people over and stay up and drink hang out very comfortably. 

The service: Top notch. We've stayed at the Andaz in Maui and that place is all about their service, and Vdara came pretty close to that level. When we came into our room, we noticed our bed sheets had some small stains. No big deal it can happen... soon as I called room service, they were up within a few minutes changing the entire set very apologetically. Appreciate the response and care.

They provide complimentary robes and slippers if you ask. Very nice.

You're literally a 5 minute away from the Aria hotel\/casino - convenient.

The cafe downstairs is delicious if we weren't set on exploring we could have had breakfast there 3 times.

It is catered more to families, so no smoking and there were the occasional rug rats running around... but we were fine with it.

Overall, fantastic experience: The price is very competitive with near by suites, great view (possibly)  and their attention to service can't be appreciated enough. Will gladly stay here again. 5 Stars.",1,0,0

Pro's:  very classy, clean lobby\/check-in area, you get the whole Feng Shui post-modern Asian vibe from the moment you walk in, with a faint unobjectionable scent in the air that is certainly an improvement over the musty smoke odor in most casino hotels on the Strip.  The room\/suite is equally welcoming and clean, bed very comfortable and the AC functioned nearly flawlessly at 68 degrees, perfect as I was a day-sleeper between a stretch of night shifts at my job.  Bathrooms are gorgeous, too; I had a couple of friends from Germany staying at the Flamingo, and the young lady in the party practically wanted to defect from her stay there, to crash on the pullout sofa-bed in my suite.  Cons:  they seem to be having issues with the call valet system.... on most occasions, it was worthless to call down to have the car waiting, and when you did go down, had to wait upwards of 10 minutes for your car.  Don't get me wrong, the staff are very professional, and they [mostly] seem to be trying, but it was a minor frustration when time was an element, and you need to be somewhere.  Also the chain of communication between the front desk and housekeeping was a little lacking; I called down to ask for extra glasses on 2 occasions.. once it took nearly an hour, and the second time the wine glasses I asked for never appeared; and yes, the ""do not disturb"" light button was off.  Another lapse regarding repeated requests for a set of silverware; first request went unfulfilled, and second time I got a full set of pots, pans, and non-stick cookware, as if they were trying to kill a fly with an elephant gun, and throw anything I could have wanted at me, to quell any more ""petty"" requests; this was a minor annoyance.

Generally the staff was otherwise very pleasant and accommodating, and there were no really major lapses; I'd definitely go back, as it's a great respite and alternative to the mind-numbing chaos of many of the strip hotels, and was a great value with the summer promotional rate.",0,0,0

What sold us on booking was the location, very central to everything; amenities; and pet-friendliness. Upon checking in I informed the front desk that I had an emotional support animal- no problemo! they got me in a suite right away. The process for check-in was so easy and fast none of those huge waiting lines like at other resorts\/casinos. The gentleman that assisted us provided us with great customer service and even upgraded us to a higher floor for a better view. We loved that they have a dog park right across the way with a nice walking garden adjacent to it. Our pup had a great time! The suite was huge! The bedding was very comfortable and the size of the bathroom and kitchenette were great. The wall to wall window view was amazing. I also appreciated that as soon as I called house keeping to let them know we would be taking our dog out of the suite, they let us know that someone would be there to do house keeping right away (and they did! took about 30-45 minutes!) nothing like at other hotels where they tell us it will probably take 1-2 hours. We also appreciated that there was a security guard present at the guest elevators for safety purposes.

I complained and was given a $75 resort credit that never showed up on my bill.

All the pictures on the website showed a Keurig machine in the room. Upon arrival, no Keurig. Called the desk and was told the Keurig would be $20\/night!

The t.v had fingerprints on it with food. Tables weren't wiped down. Still covered in oils from food and finger prints.  The bedding had minimal grey stains on it. But the issue was that someone had smoked in the bathroom. We are not smokers and hate the smell. Things like this should've been checked out before a guest is set in a room. They did make it right and gave us another room with a nice view. But again fingerprints on walls and doors. Just bugs me, cause we like coming here for it's clean standards. What caused a issue for me though is the parking situation. My fiancé never loses things. He's super organized. I think they forgot to give us our ticket back. We couldn't find our ticket for the valet. So when we went to get our car we figured it's no big deal. This is a serious issue for them. Since we lost it, we needed proof the vehicle belonged to us. The car is registered in his moms name but same address and same last name. Like I understand the fear of people stealing cars but they need to reword on how to explain this to paying customers. They made us feel like criminals. I am on vacation and don't need the stress of how am I going to get home. We drove here. I don't know what we would have done if they didn't give us our car back. The fear of no way home is not right. The people upstairs need to re fraise it so we don't feel this way. They did get management to help fix the issue but left a bad taste in my mouth.  We are not criminals we are paying customers....At check out they never gave us a option to express our experience. So here's your 3 star review.

I have been to Vegas a few times, stayed in Palazzo, Bellagio, Venetian - those are way better...
We decided to give Vdara a try...booked a suite. We gave our luggage to the bell-boy who was to bring it up to our room immediately once we checked in and called for it. Well - it took them almost 50 minutes to send our luggage up. 
Our room was equipped with a kitchenette, but no mugs, not pots no pans...one has to call for it. Ok, so we called for two mugs, and an hour later we got them!! Also, there is no coffee machine in a kitchen - even a regular Holiday Inn comes with one!! You would imagine the service of a five star to be a little more quick and better!!
The room was alright, although it was a suite it was not big enough for 4 people. It can get crowded. There was no bathrobe provided nor any slippers. (Which is something which has been provided to me by most five-stars in Vegas), our trashcan in the bathroom already had trash in it!!! We needed more towels, so called for a few, go figure, it took them an hour to send those up!! 
There is no cafe to eat in the hotel, just a tiny market place which shuts early- so no late night snacking.
Location of the hotel is so-so it's quite a walk and can get confusing.

We wanted to be off the strip but not directly on it. Also, I didn't want to stay in a place that housed a casino, mostly because of all that smoke- I hate it. Vdara meets both qualifications.

They have a driveway entrance for all guests with an area just for Lyft\/Uber which I thought was very clever. The lobby is gorgeous and they have this really neat outdoor area featuring greenery which is a nice retreat from the high city life. Their lobby also has a Starbucks and little market\/eating area.

Our room was gorgeous!!! I cannot rave about it enough. We upgraded for a Bellagio fountain view which I suggest you do, too. Stunning. The shades are electronically controlled which was cool to watch.

The bathrooms are nicely appointed and the room is decorated nicely, too. They feature stove tops, microwaves, and fridges which is great if you take home food or drinks.

Probably one of the coolest things is this hotel directly connects to the Bellagio via a skybridge and right next door is the Cosmopolitan. So no matter where you want to go, you're within short walking distance. I'd definitely return here if we visit Vegas again.",3,0,2

There weren't too many people in line it's just that there isn't even enough room at the check in desk to hold enough employees to check us in. I'm sure this is because this hotel was originally built to be a condo. I think that has led to many of the cons I have about this hotel. The lobby was also hot the whole time we stayed at the hotel. Usually hotels are pretty cold. 

My bf and I were staying at Vdara for a romantic getaway. You would think that a nice quiet hotel would be good for us, but it was just tooo quiet! It was also difficult staying there because they had only one restaurant and it was only open for breakfast and lunch. I've heard it's closed since then. I'm not sure if there is anything there now. The hotel is also so far from everything. It even felt far just to get to Aria. 

Our hotel and room were nice and clean. Everything had a modern look to it, but for being a nice hotel, the furnishings seemed kinda chintzy like I could easily break it by accident. It was also really weird that there was a kitchenette but no utensils or dishes to use. We got a crazy, good deal on the hotel, but for the normal price I don't think it would be worth it. 

We wanted to go in the pool because the news about the death ray the hotel bldg creates on their pool, but didn't get to. I heard they had fixed it somehow. The staff was helpful and nice. Vdara isn't a bad hotel, but it's just not for me.",1,0,0

We arrived at 1:15 pm after a 4 1\/2 hour road trip to a suite that wasn't ready.  They were apologetic and said our suite would be ready within an hour.  After calling management they confirmed that the suite was vacated, just needed to be cleaned.  They supposedly put a ""rush"" on the cleaning and told us they'd call us as soon as it was ready.  We sat around for another hour and half in the small lobby but never got a call.  The main reason for our trip to Vegas was our son's basketball tournament.  I specifically mentioned the need to have him changed and at the Convention Center by 3pm before his first game.  They told me he could change in the bathrooms in the lobby if need be.  By 3 pm the room was still not ready (which happens to be their official check-in time).  Frustrated, I spoke to a manager who offered sympathy and to downgrade us to a lower level suite, reducing our nightly charge by $50.  I specifically booked the corner Executive Suite due to the layout and had the option to book the basic Vdara suite that was being offered,  much cheaper than the $50\/night they were offering!  Typically when hotels mess up, they don't offer downgrades......but usually an upgrade!  I refused and told them we were sticking with the original room type we booked.  We left for the game, he changed in car and we received the call at 4:30 pm that our room was finally ready!  When we got back to the hotel at 5:30, and into our room we called for our luggage to be brought up.  That took another full hour!!!! I've never been in a hotel in Vegas where there's so much chaos in the small lobby, from valet to front desk!!! Nice staff but definitely under-staffed! We typically stay at the Wynn or Encore but because of our 2 teenage boys we decided to stay in a larger room and a hotel without a casino.  Big mistake! After all the inconveniences, they offered to waive our resort fee.  Knocking off $30\/night when you're paying about $400 a night is ridiculous.  Not impressed one bit with the way they handled this situation.  We definitely won't be back.",2,1,0

The hotel is smaller than the other resorts around which makes it quicker to check in and also short walks to the elevators.  Great trendy decor throughout the hotel.  We had a corner suite on the 5th floor.  Had a great view of the street and city center complex.  Staff was friendly and service was fast.  Fridge and Kurig coffee maker were a plus.  Only downside to this hotel is it is on the backside of city center and getting to the strip is a bit of a chore.  Not having a casino was not a big deal as Aria was a 2 minute walk away.  My only complaint that takes away a star is the AC in my room.  No matter what I set it to it never got cooler than 74.  We had two other guests that were with us and their rooms would cool down into the 60's.  It may have been that having large windows on 3 sides of our room and that they faced towards the west caused the room not to cool properly.  Might be something they should look at.  Also a fan in the bedroom would have been nice to.  Overall I would definitely return to this hotel.,2,0,0

The good:

- They are located right in the middle of the strip. Bellagio, Aria and Caesar Palace are all a short walking distance from the Vdara. They have a free tram that takes you to Monte Carlo if you decide to venture out towards that direction

- Customer service was awesome. Staff was courteous and quick. They always addressed me by my last name, which I found a bit weird at first but i quickly grew fond of it and it made me feel like someone important. 

- In room dining was quick and the presentation of the food was nice. The person that brought our food arrived in less than 20 minutes and he actually set up all the plates and utensils for us. On-top of that, he also brought a vase with roses in them... brownie points. 

- The hotel room itself was clean and spacious. 

- It's a non-smoking hotel so none of that smoggy cigarette filled air.


The bad:

- Valet parking only. No self-park.

- No casino.

- One eatery and one bar located inside the hotel.

Prices are reasonable for the suite, and also when you walk out of the hotel. Aria is just right there, at first I was pretty disappointed because there wasn't going to be any casinos at this hotel, but I found out Aria was like a 2 minute walk.

The elevators are split so that floors above 28 (I think?) are in a different bank of elevators on the other side.  Makes for efficient access, you don't have to wait forever for an elevator.  You also have to show your room key on the ground floor which prevents random stragglers from being disruptive on the floors or pool.

The spa is pricey, even for Vegas.  You can get a quality massage on the strip for less than the posted prices at Vdara.

I didn't have a problem with the wind at the pool, it actually would've been nice since it was over 110 degrees lol.  It's true that it is not super chlorinated, but that means it can feel kind of lotion-y.  The drinks are good too, I'd recommend the mango margarita.  There are several rows of beach chairs and I never had a problem finding some real estate under an umbrella.  I didn't check what the rates for the cabana were, but the music selection was awesome and loud enough to be fun but not so loud that you couldn't have a conversation or read a book.

Lastly the room was superb.  I didn't feel grody walking around on the carpet in my bare feet and I love the minimalist design of the bathroom.  I also like that the shower has a seat and the deep tub.  Having a tv on each side of the suite is kind of pointless; their relative proximity and lack of walls make it impossible to watch two different things at the same time.  Lastly, I haven't seen anyone mention the sheets but holy cow!  They have to be like 5000 thread count.  They felt amazing.

I didn't try the food with so many options close by (walkway to Bellagio and sidewalk to Aria) but it's worth noting that you can get pretty far along the strip without having to venture outside too far, particularly useful when it is, as I mentioned, over 110 degrees the whole weekend.  I would definitely stay here again even though it does not have a gym.  If you're looking for a smoke-free stay with out the bells, whistles, and flashing lights that's still close enough to the excitement, stay here.",5,0,2

averaging to 3\/5 stars. 

For the holidays, i came to vdara with my family. I was excited. I heard great things about Vdara and was totally down for something fancy, and experienced some ups and downs. 

THE GOOD:
1.) Chic and modern rooms. They look nice, prim, and hip! 
2.) Kitchen with stove, microwave, and fridge. For some reason our fridge had two opening doors, but one of the doors was locked, giving us a tiny space for fridge. Kind of annoying, but no bigs.
3.) remote controlled blinds and shades for windows. You feel pretty damn fancy and upscale with that shizz. 
4.) bathrooms are very nice. 
5.) Basically the feel of the room, even the most basic room, feels fancy and nice! 
6.) NO CASINOS and no smoking. So none of that headache, weaving in and out of slots and tables and all that las vegas madness you see everywhere. 

THE BAD (or annoying):
1.) You need your key at all times to enter the hotel rooms. There are people checking at the elevators to see if you have a key, which makes bringing guests into a room quite a hassle. 

THE UGLY:
1.) MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!! (SEE A, B, and C)

        A.) We had two rooms reserved. Our check in time was 3pm. At 3 pm, one of the rooms was not ready. Guess when they were ready. at 9pm!!!!!! YES, you read that right! 9 FREAKING PM!!!! Rather than providing us with a discount, they offered $60 room service credit, which we weren't even really interested in. AND guess what? After all that extra time, the room had trash still in it. It was not clean. WTF

       B.) We had no body come into clean our rooms during our 2 night stay. 

       C.) We needed extra bedding, and requested face-to-face at the front desk for it. They said that the would expedite our request. 30 minutes later...nothing. We called the front desk Guess what they said? Some BS story about how they are understaffed. That is NOT our problem! Plus this was a day or two after Jan 1, how they heck are they understaffed and not prepared for a large influx of people during the holidays? and when we asked for an ETA...guess what they said? Oh..THERE IS NO ETA! They could not give us an estimated time of arrival of when they could bring us bedding. we were exhausted and were basically waiting on that to sleep! It took 45 minutes for the bedding to arrive. So much for expediting. We also asked front desk for another item, which took about 30 minutes to arrive. 

2.) There were trashbags at all times in the hallway. It's kind of annoying to walk down the halls of a seemingly nice hotel, with trash bags filled with trash lining the hallway.

CONCLUSION
Basically the bad stained my experience of what could have been a good one! the rooms were nice, but when you get crappy service along with that...it kind of poos poos on your experience.",4,1,0

Room service was also very quick given the amount of food we ordered our first night.

The hotel tries the wellness angle, where it's non-smoking, doesn't have a casino, and even allows dogs in some rooms\/floors.  It's next to Aria, which is set back off The Strip more than you'd think from a map or pictures.  Like Aria, Vdara too pipes in a smell throughout, but it's more floral than Aria's vanilla.  

The pool is (or was, as they've since added more umbrellas for coverage) infamous for their ""death ray"", which has been known to literally melt plastic with its intensity.  

Officially, there are dining places in the Vdara, but they're more in the ""grab a snack"" category than the restaurant category.  Vdara's website refers you to Aria for actual meals.  

For the wellness minded person who isn't in Las Vegas to gamble and was sort of dragged along by his\/her friends - or for those who can't travel without their dog -  Vdara is your place.  

If you're like me though, and you were just trying Vdara to try it or because you found a good rate, not having any sort of casino is too much of a deal breaker.  I thought Aria being next door would be fine, but it'll still take you a 10 minute walk to get to a machine or table because they're deceptively farther away than you might think.

If you want to stay in a new, modern hotel at a decent price stay here. If you want action, casinos, shops, and restaurants find another hotel. Vdara is basically a no frills hotel. It's really nice, if you just need a place to sleep.

The only food option is the sandwich shop. For all other options, you have to walk over to Aria or trek to Bellagio via the connecting bridge.

If you check out after 11am, expect to pay half the nightly rate for that night. Make sure you get up early to check out.

We were actually only like 5 rooms down the hall from our other friends who got the bigger suite, which included a kitchen and table. 

For our room, it had a standard queen size bed, but also a couch that pulled out to a pretty big full size bed. The bathroom was a decent size. It had a separate shower, along with another shower\/bed combo on the other side. The only downside was that the sink was clogged and broken, but it didn't take long for us to have someone come up and get it fixed for us. My friends' room down the hall from us, had a living room with a pull out couch, a kitchen area with a stove, microwave, and fridge, a separate bedroom with a queen size bed, a full size bathroom with the separate shower area and a bath\/shower combo, along with a small bathroom near the kitchen\/entrance area.

Another annoying thing that happened was that our keys wouldn't work at times. I think we had to go to the front desk 2-3 times to get new keys. Anyways, I didn't really go anywhere else besides the rooms to be honest. It seemed like an okay place. I appreciated the maid service we had though. They were very thorough - especially since one of the boys made the unfortunate mistake of not being able to hold his liquor and making a mess in both bathrooms in the big room. 

Overall, I personally wouldn't book a room here. My friends like it because it's close to The Cosmopolitan, which includes Marquee, a club we most likely will go to during our trip there. And also the fact that for the price you pay, you can get a suite with a kitchen. I'm a bit more partial to Encore to be honest. I'll shell out a couple hundred for Encore any day of the week.",2,2,2

I stayed here for a friend's bachelorette so we decided to amp it up by getting a suite-style room with a kitchen, dining table, spa bathroom, and a living room. I think all the rooms are suite-style but you can get as luxurious as having a 2-bedroom suite. But the best part is we scored an amazing deal for that weekend, plus some $50 hotel credit to use.  Unlike many Vegas hotels, this one does not have a casino, which is nice in a way because it doesn't have that smokey and grimey smell. Every time you walk in, this place smells like a spa and after all, it is a spa hotel.  The only issue I have is that there are not many restaurant options in the hotel and it's not connected (via bridge walkway) to many other hotels except for Bellagio or to the actual Vegas strip. The hotel is not on the strip but close enough that you can walk to other hotels. But when it's 100+ degrees outside, the last thing you want to think of is walking in that heat. 
As for service, the staff are very accommodating. We had four girls in a one king size room with a pull-out futon bed. They offered us a mattress pad and extra linens to cover the futon so it's more comfortable even though I thought the futon itself was too ""springy"" in general. Other than that, I slept comfortably well. They even provided pots, pans, and dish detergent when requested since we had a kitchen. They use k-cups for coffee but you need to request the coffee maker from housekeeping as it's not readily provided in the room.  Other than that, it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants a more relaxing experience at Vegas.",2,0,0

The soaking tub has a great view of the city and I used it twice a day.

Upon check-in, my wife and I were given a view upgrade due to it being our 7 year anniversary. We very much appreciated this. However, Vadara charged my debit card an unexpected additional $100.00 that im supposed to get back within 5 to 10 days. My wife and I saved for several months to fly to Las Vegas for a vacation and the missing $100.00 put limitations on what we could do.  I talked to the concierge about this but there was nothing they could do for me. The room was very nice and clean (aside from a layer of dust covering the tv and dresser). We especially enjoyed the deep soaker tub and separate shower. 
   The second problem I encountered at Vadara was the housekeeping services, we slept in one morning and had the ""Do not disturb"" option illuminated on the door, when we eventually left for the day we illuminated the ""Request cleaning services"" option. We then returned to the room roughly 4 hours later expecting to relax but the room remained un-cleaned. Im unsure if they were just too busy to get around to it or if the illumination on the door simply wasn't working properly. Yet it kind of ruined the relaxing mood we were in, I had to call down to housekeeping and have them send someone up, which they did another few hours later. I don't mean to sound like a spoiled brat who wants my room cleaned immediately, but we were paying close to $150.00 a night to stay at Vadara so the expectations were naturally higher. 
   The third problem I had was with drinks at the pool. I had flown to Las Vegas with drinks in my check-in luggage in an attempt to avoid paying for overpriced beer at the pool side. I called the Spa in advance to ask if I was allowed to bring my own alcoholic beverages to which they replied ""yes, as long as they are not glass"", as I entered the pool area I was stopped by the staff and told I couldn't bring outside drinks, when I informed them of my previous call they allowed it but made it seem like they were doing me a favor. While they were polite it was very embarrassing being stopped by them and having other people look at me as though I got caught trying to get away with something sneaky, I called in advance as a way to avoid this but it still happened. Moreover, the pool closes at 7:00 PM for some weird reason, I was looking forward to swimming at night but couldn't. 
    While I enjoyed my experience there I probably would not return to Vadara, with so many luxurious hotels in Las Vegas I don't see any reason to visit the same one twice. I also couldn't recommend Vadara to anyone who is looking to stay at a hotel in the $150.00 range because there are so many other options out there, most of which get better reviews.",0,0,0

For whatever reason I was hesitant about the parking situation - only valet parking option - but it turned out to be fine. The guys were quick about getting our cars and there was never a long line. The check in process took a while because understandably a lot of people were there mid-afternoon Friday. Luckily we were update to get a complimentary ""upgrade"" to a corner suite which wasn't that big of a deal to me (and knowing how much it costed it's a slight perk from what we had). The view was pretty and the room is spacious. I really like that there's a bathroom in the kitchen\/living room as well as the master bath.

Tip: check out people's Youtube videos to get an idea of what the rooms look like. It really helped us pick the right room here. Also, if you sign up for their email list and\/or like their Facebook page, you'll get great deals. We were able to get a 20% discount and 2 free Aria buffets.",4,0,0

The room was spacious and well decorated. The room's color scheme was very complimentary and modern. The bed was comfortable. My only complaint is that they only had down like filled pillows. I prefer foam pillows. The furniture was comfortable. The bathroom was spacious. We did not have any issue with noise, with the exception of the loud patron walking down the hall and yelling at his friends. We had a lakeside view  room and could see the Bellagio fountains.

I agree with the reviewer that articulated the relaxing atmosphere of the hotel. I loved the fresh orchids at the front desk. It's a nice change from the hustle and bustle of other hotels. Which, by the way, you can access by walking a few hundred feet to Aria.The hotel has a chic, spa-like vibe throughout.

The restaurant (only one) has very limited hours. Room service is available 24 hours.

The entire staff was friendly and helpful. Both bellman were exceptionally friendly and helpful, as were the employees that checked us in and out.

The rooms are amazing, and the room I stayed in had a view of the Bellagio water show as well as the strip. The amenities are great, and the bathroom is what I imagine my bathroom makeover would look like, haha.

I ordered room service twice during my stay, and the food was beyond what I had expected. The presentation, and the flavors were very close to fine dining. As you can imagine the prices are up there, but I felt you get what you pay for.

I stayed at the Vdara between June 10th and 13th, 2017. The person that checked me in was wonderful. I believe her name was Vea. The check in experience was easy and fast. Unfortunately, after spending a night in our room we noticed that our headboard had white stains all over it. It appeared to possibly be hair product, but it had not been cleaned and wasn't what I expected from such a nice room and hotel. I called the front desk at 6pm and an associate told me she would call for housekeeping to clean the headboard. She asked if I needed anything and I asked for water. The water was brought up quickly, but housekeeping hadn't shown up yet. I left the ""Do Not Disturb"" light off, so they knew they could enter. When I returned at midnight, the headboard still hadn't been cleaned. I called the front desk again and the person said they would send housekeeping up. I waited an hour and a half, but housekeeping did not come so I went to sleep. I called the front desk the following morning to ask for the headboard to be cleaned a third time. I was informed at this point that no one would have been able to help me the prior night because the ""utility"" cleaning crew didn't start until 9am and I should have been informed of this the prior night. I walked down and spoke to the manager at the front desk (I believe her name was Shaleen) about the issues up to this point so that I could ensure the cleaning was taken care of. The manager was great and my experience with her was excellent. She moved me to a different (nicer) room for the final night of my stay and was very kind. Unfortunately, when I got to that room it was also dirty. Specifically, the trash can was completely full of someone else's food and drink garbage, the ceiling had something on it, and the headboard had the same issue (maybe it's a cleaning product issue?). I've included pictures of all of the things I'm mentioning here, and I have to say I'm pretty disappointed in Vdara. I expected more for the cost and promoted quality.

Personally, I like the idea of a smoke-free environment and not having to deal with large crowds or a confusing lobby layout if i'm just trying to go home from the day's activities\/night out. Aria is literally just 200 feet over next door with all the tables, slots, restaurants, lounges and clubs for that. +1 star. 

Cons: 
  For such a huge 5-star hotel, their check-in process was below average. We called in at 10am to see how early we could check-in. Early check-in opens at 1pm. We showed up at 1:30 after a long road trip but were told that the room wouldn't be ready until 3pm. 3pm was the guaranteed time. That's 1 hour later than most hotels on the strip. Luckily we could leave our bags with the hotel in exchange for stub and we're allowed access to the pool. We go to the front desk at 330pm, and the room still isn't ready. THATS BS. They tell us to come back within the hour and give us 2 free drinks at the bar by the pool side. By this time, we are quite honestly quite inebriated so the extra comped drinks send us over the edge and we are in a happy drunken state with no room. We come back down to the front desk from the pool and try to check-in. This time the room is ready so that's cool. But the nice girl behind counter doesn't even voluntarily offer us anything to cure the inconvenience.We gave her hella shit and got upgraded 2x over to a corner city suite on the 50th floor and $50 of credit good for anything. That really amped things up coz the views from the room were breathtaking and the room itself had a kitchen, washer\/dryer, a living room, gorgeous bedroom, huge walk-in master's bathroom, and a second bathroom in the common space area. HMMmm..another thing, no ipod dock station. I thought most hotels would have this by now. Instead they gave us an audio cord that plugs into the TV. If we didn't get comped, this might have been a deal breaker so im giving it minus 1.5 stars, for epic failing at such an impt part of the check-in process. 
   This hotel has the potential to be a legit 5 star experience but i don't think its quite up there yet. It only opened 6 months ago and maybe the staff is still quite inexperienced and operations arent as smoothas they are supposed to be.

I think the hotel is conveniently located near lots of attractions such as the Bellagio fountains,  Bellagio Conservatory and botanical garden, Paris hotel's Eiffel Tower, Venetian's Gondola ride, Mirage's Volcano show to New York New York. I liked how Vdara was connected by a short bridge to the Bellagio which was super convenient without having to walk outside in the sun. 
Our room on the 41st floor overlooked the front of the hotel so we didn't get to see the Bellagio fountains but we had a million dollar view at night from our window. We got to see the Luxor hotel's Pyramid and the night light of the hotels around. 

The Vdara hotel has a Starbucks, a bar and market cafe. There were ample taxis, Lyft and uber outside of the hotel waiting. Our check-in and check-out was super quick unlike the long line we saw at the Bellagio's front desk. The front desk staff was courteous and friendly.

The Wifi was free and decent. There were always a lot of people in the lobby area getting their work done. 

The only thing refraining me from giving this hotel a 5 star was the sink in our bathroom which drained pretty slow but we didn't complain either.

Although fairly useless to have such amenities for our short weekend stay, I can see how this would be excellent for a longer term stay. 

However, some of the fanciness seems cosmetic as you start to realize the workmanship quality and service is sorely lacking. We actually had a large piece of crown molding just fall off the wall when we opened the blinds. This was hanging over the bed and had nails sticking out of it.

Also, although the main bed is extremely comfy - the pullout bed is wildly uncomfortable. I've rarely been at a hotel without the option of double beds. I didn't think this would be an issue because I've been on many sofa beds in my life and although they aren't great, they usually are tolerable. This was like lying on a bed of nails. Ridiculous for a ""fancy"" hotel - they surely must hear this complaint on a daily basis. Also, when we informed them we were going to be needing use of the pullout bed, instead of making it up for us, they just left a pile of sheets on the sofa. Seriously? How much per night to make my own bed?

When we brought up the piece of molding falling off and the sofa bed, we were met with apathy. No apology. No ""we'll get right on that"". More of a shrug and a we'll get to it when we get to it. No here's a free room upgrade or coupon\/voucher for something. The girl at desk actually seemed annoyed we were bringing up totally valid issues of comfort and safety. 

They eventually fixed the molding (doubt it was a permanent fix and likely more of a glue job) and added extra cushioning to bed after numerous requests. But it was not a painless experience and a supposedly fancy hotel should really know better how to treat a customer.

Also, no self parking (valet only). I avoid valet when possible as I simply don't like strangers driving my car. So basically we ended up parking in Aria and going through insane series of elevators, stairs, trams, walkways, etc each time we wanted to go from car to room. Just a hassle when there is so many hotels in town with easy self parking that won't require an epic journey or to have valet retrieve your vehicle every time you need to get to car and back. This wouldn't be an issue for someone flying in, but if you're driving in, avoid for sure!

So yes, on the surface seems like a really nice place. And maybe it is if you don't have your own car, only need 1 bed, or need a place with a kitchen. Or maybe you're someone that hates smoke so much they do not want to stay in any hotel with a casino. But if none of those things sound like you, there is a ton of better options.",3,1,0

- The rooms were very nice and luxurious. The bed were comfy and the showers were hot.

- We got a room with the strip and bellagio fountain view for free. (Call in a day advance and ask for it, they will leave a note so when you check in, the front desk will see that note when they assign your room.)

- The house cleaning service was very prompt and detailed. Left the room around 11 for the pool, came back in an hour or 2 and the room was cleaned. 

- AC was super cold
- Bellboy brought our stuff up in 5 minutes.
- 2-3 minute walk to Aria, Cosmo, City Center, and Bellagio, Monte Carlo
- 10 minute walk to Caesers, Harrahs, Venetian, Mirage
- No casinos, Smoke-Free
- The pool was nice and wasnt crowded on a weekend morning.

Cons:

- Fridge did not work at all, asked for it to be fixed, no one came. Luckily, we were next to the ice room.
- $20 per day resort fee. 
- $100\/night deposit with a Debit card or $130\/night deposit with a credit card.
- Both my room keys failed, took security 20 minutes to come up and open my door.
- Bathroom door wont lock

Vdara seems like a 4 star hotel when you initially walk in, however you soon realize that this hotel is not all that it seems.  

The service is a solid three.  Nobody was rude, everyone was friendly and helpful, but there were instances where it lacked precision, poise and confidence.  An example of this would be with the concierge.  I called them to ask about about having a messenger pick up a BB Tour charger and deliver to the suite.  Over the phone, he was very helpful and said that I should come downstairs to check their chargers to see if any one of them worked.  I don't mean to sound like a princess, but I honestly did NOT want to walk my lazy ass downstairs.  I had  been working all day setting up our booth for a trade show and just wanted someone to come up and show me the chargers so I can pick the one that fits and put my feet up and RELAX.  So I walk my lazy butt downstairs to the concierge and find her helping another guest.  I wait for 5 minutes and can't wait longer so walk over to the front desk and they of course tell me to go back to the concierge.  I'm back in line behind the same couple asking all sorts of questions about some show seating.  I wait another 5 minutes and the concierge looks over to me says that she will be awhile and asks me what I needed in a slight annoyed and definitely hurried fashion.  I tell her another concierge told me to come down to pick up a charger.  She then literally dumps a bunch of chargers my way and tells me to choose one.  By this time I'm feeling like I interrupted Mommy and Daddy at a really busy time.  WTF!!!  Anyways, none of the chargers fit so I walked my ass to the business center as a just in case and surely they had one that fit.  Initially they told me to leave my phone there while it was being charged, but I asked if I could take the charger up to my room, since I needed my phone for business.  They said no problem and I gave them my room number and happily left that I didn't have to pay for a brand new one.
When I got back to my room later that evening, I had a message from the business center saying that if I wanted to keep the charger for the duration of my stay, they would charge me $5 a day.  I still don't know how I really feel about that.  I screwed up and forgot my charger, but I just don't feel good about it.

The rooms are nice.  It seems impressive, but again it's an illusion.  For example, the sunken in oval bath tub is nice.  Visually it looks porcelain, but it's plastic.  The LIGHTS!!!  WTF is up with the lights.  The switch turned on the ALL the lights, but you couldn't turn on the side lamps  by the couches unless the main lights were on.  It was weird.  They do have a kitchen and I guess it would be useful if you were cooking, but didn't need any utensils or plates or even kitchenware to cook your food in.  This is HIGH CLASS CAVE MAN LIVING!!  Seriously, what were they thinking!!  Who is gonna book room at a nice hotel and bring all the kitchenware with them??!!  The place just didn't make sense!

Housekeeping is a 3 at best.  They came and cleaned the rooms, but our tub was dirty.  We had a epsom salt bath the night before and when we got back to our room, we realized that the tub was still had epsom salt stuck to the bottom of it.  The Q-tips and cotton balls weren't replaced and the toiletry in the shower wasn't put away.  All the other housekeeping service did this in every other hotel we stayed in including MGM, Wynn, and Luxor.

The ONE restaurant that VDARA has is NOT open for dinner.  I can understand why.  The restaurant is just entirely BORING!  They probably can't afford to leave it open, since there may be all of 2 tables booked for the entire place.  

The BEST thing about Vdara was the spa.  We booked a couple's massage and our masseuse were fantastic.  Really enjoyed that!!

All in all, this hotel is for guests who are in Vegas strictly for business.  If you want pleasure with your business go somewhere else.  If a non-gaming hotel is what your looking for, Four Seasons may be in order!

i guess you get what you pay for.  The rooms are pretty cheap for what you get.",4,2,0

Bellagio is right next door and it's connected via a bridge so you can lose your money that way; I sure did =,( Best part of the spacious room was the kitchenette. Boy did it come in handy. What's better than left over Firefly food after a night of drinking?

There were some minor ""flaws,"" I will say. The refrigerator was tiny. It wasn't deep at all so we had to turn our to-go box vertically to be able to close the door shut. The blackout shades don't really live up to it's name. The edges of the shades don't meet the wall so light still creeps through.

https:\/\/youtu.be\/w5U3sAbTFW0

A decently priced modern hotel right next to Bellagio.

This is my review for the Vdara Las Vegas hotel.

If you were like me a few days ago, you might be considering Vdara because of the relatively lower prices for a 5-star hotel, but worried if it's a good hotel.

I've lost a lot of money to Las Vegas in the last 15 years and let me tell you my thoughts.

Vdara is part of MLife Rewards program.  Sign up if you haven't yet so you can get a discount rate for your room and also earn points for staying there.

There is no casino at Vdara, but It's connected to Bellagio and Aria.  You can walk over to the Aria casino in 3 minutes or walk to the Bellagio gardens in 10 minutes.   Also since it's not that popular of a destination, it makes it easy to get a taxi and there's a clear sign for Lyft pickup.  I prefer staying here over crowded casino resorts since it's a nice quiet place to return after a long day.

First thing I noticed when I arrived to Vdara is that they don't have self-parking.
They do offer free valet which means you need to tip them $2-$5 each time you drop off and pick up.
This is convenient, but I was left waiting for about 10 minutes on a busy night.
If you want to self park, you can self-park at Bellagio and walk over which is going to take about 10 minutes

Check-in was quick and very friendly.  Jane at the front was amazingly nice!  Thank you!

They will provide 2 free small bottles of water for every night.  Water downstairs is going to cost you over $5. Even Starbucks Ethos water is $5.50.

They do have the bare essentials downstairs.  A cafe, a bar, a Starbucks.

OK!  Now onto the room.  The City Corner Suite!

When you enter, you have a dining room.
Then you go in to the living room which has a pull out bed.
Then you have the bedroom where you get a nice view because of the corner suite!
Then you have the bathroom.

Let's get the boring living room out of the way first.
It has a sofa with a queen-size pullout bed.
The TV is about 46""
Comes with some modern looking lamps and two glass tables.

You won't be spending much time in here, but there are sliding glass doors to the bedroom where you'll be spending most of your time.

Now, the bedroom.  I loooved the view.  The windows that span across two walls made me feel like a king.  I actually flipped the chair to face the outside and just enjoyed the view like batman did in the dark knight.

I loved setting up my laptop and just enjoying the view.
It made me feel like I owned the hotels.

Ok enough of about the views.
The Shades and the Blackout shades come up and down with a switch.
The bed was very soft and above average.  Similar to Wynn and Encore quality.
There's also another TV in the bedroom.
I was on the 23rd floor and I could hear the freeway.  They become white noise when you're sleeping, but definitely stay in higher floors if you can.

The bathroom also shares the view of the outside so you can relax in their modern hot tub and enjoy the view.  I'm not a tub type of person but I switched off the lights and enjoyed the hot tub with a view every night I was here.

You get a big mirror with built in lights that make you look pretty.
You get one of those magnifying mirrors so you can see all your pores.

A walkin shower.  water was always hot and had plenty of pressure.  Shampoo, Conditioner, Body Soap, Body Lotion is provided.

The bathroom has doors, but the actual toilet doesn't.  Every noise you make in the toilet will echo throughout the bathroom.

Other than that, you get your usual bath robe, slippers you can take home, and a small safe.

Ok, now the dining room!
This is the first hotel room I've had a washer and a dryer.  Bosch brand too.  This is great!  I can bring a pair of clothes and I can just wash them every night.  The only problem is that there's no detergent or softener.  It looked like these were never used and I'm not surprised.

Now the cooktop.  Great!  I can make eggs in the morning or warm up my left over.  Where's the cookware?  You need to request it from the front desk.

There is a Bosch microwave, mini bar, a sink with garbage disposal, a Kitchenaid giant fridge, a dishwasher, but realistically, you'll only be using the microwave.

There're 2 utencils, 2 cups and no dishes so make sure you get what you need from the restaurants.

The pool was under renovation while I visited so I'd assume it'll be nice by the time you watch this.

Service was very friendly.  I clogged the bathroom and they came up with a plunger in 3 minutes.

Overall, I think Vdara is a great value and I'd recommend it.
If it's significantly cheaper than Aria, I'd say go Vdara.",5,5,4

Well.... we had our bubbles burst when we arrived. We did NOT get adjoining rooms (bummer) and the rooms were significantly smaller than we anticipated. 

We knew since it was non-gaming, non smoking it would be a more chill environment , but for most of the weekend the hotel was soo quiet! I kinda longed for the sound of a ringing slot machine by the end of the trip. I think we missed out on the pizazz of Vegas lol.  We also had to call down to the front desk for everything we needed.... shower caps, dishes (for the kitchenette) and sufficient washcloths (there was only 1 in the bathroom). 

Once we got over a few of the disappointments we did enjoy the rest of our stay. the Vdara is right across from the Aria which has all of the typical Large Vegas hotel\/casino amenities (food, dancing, etc). We walked to the Cosmopolitan as well and didn't need a cab the entire trip! The city center was well built with easy access to Bellagio and Monte Carlo. Our favorite part of the trip was the day at the Vdara pool. We had a cabana (reasonably priced) which was wonderful. We had our own TV, cabana boy AND a fridge stocked with soda and snacks.

In this Las Vegas hotel that advertises that it's on the strip. We even had to go to another hotel to pick up a hotel shuttle. Stay away from this MGM property. I'm guessing they are in the process of closing it based on the way they staff their facility.

There aren't any restaurants. No casino. It's super quiet!!! The rooms are very clean and set up is nice.

No, not a hotel guest's visit, but a simple walkthrough with a visit to their spa. Okay, first and foremost I have to say that this is probably one of the nicest, if not THE nicest looking hotels I've ever seen. It's so very sleek, so very chic, it feels like the only other hotel out there that can compare to the Vdara is the Aria right next door.

Vdara is home to the very popular Silk Road restaurant. Unfortunately it wasn't open when we were there as I would have loved to try it.

What was open however was their award winning spa which my girlfriend and I were lucky enough to receive a couples massage at. Look at my review for that event coming soon. 

So if it wasn't enough to host the spa and the restaurant along with some of the nicest rooms and suites the Strip has to offer, the Vdara is also right next door the Crystals Mall which has the highest of the high end shopping. 

If the rooms weren't so damn expensive, I'd love to book a stay here. I guess that's what makes this place exclusive though. No ghetto blasters here. It's all three piece suits and cocktail dresses as far as the eye can see.",0,0,0

The next day, I had forgotten about the disturbance, until I saw a strange looking bug crawling on the bed.  I immediately thought bed bugs and Googled bed bug history at Vdara.  They have had incidences reported online.  So I called the front desk to ask that someone please come and inspect to confirm or deny if it was bedbugs.  No one ever came and 30 minutes later, they wanted us to go downstairs so they can switch our rooms.  That was the nonchalant attitude we received the rest of the night. They refused to talk to us until a bed bug test was done.  The next day, the test turned out to be negative for bed bugs.  But, we searched online and found that it was a huge tick instead!!

I echo much of what Jaime wrote...and I find myself in the odd position of cautiously recommending this hotel, while never wanting to stay here again. 

The pros: 
- The kitchenette means you can save money; not just by cooking (if you're ambitious), but by heating up left-overs (thanks, giant Vegas portions!) from one meal and making it your next. It's about a 15 minute walk to the CVS for basics; I saw some families hopping into a cab to a local grocery store. 

- Resort fee is a pain but it equals gym (modern; TVs on cardio equip; free water) + wifi, so is cheaper than at other hotels. 

- Very tranquil -- no smoke, no blaring rock music, etc. 


The CONS:
- Eco-friendly is great, but realize that this comes at the expense of a shower with virtually no water pressure and lighting in the room that has an unappealing, harsh glare. 

- The ""market"" downstairs is ""meh"", but the part I found ridiculous is that it closes AT EIGHT PM. Hope you did all your shopping early, otherwise it's off to CVS for you!

- While the Vdara touts the kitchenette as a key selling point, it's almost like they DON'T actually want you to use it. You have to call housekeeping to get anything, and you need to be patient and persistent.  I called and asked for 4 plates, 4 mugs, and a frying pan. OVER AN HOUR later, a nice young man delivered 2 bowls (which I didn't ask for) and none of the other items I asked for. After two more requests for things (where I got a few more things but not all that I asked for) -- I sort of gave up. 

- Also, the fridge is VERY tiny. Like small dorm fridges; it was VERY hard to fit anything (e.g. a quart of milk) in there. 

- There is no guidance as to what we, as guests, are supposed to do with dirty dishes. One day, housekeeping cleaned them....the next day, they didn't. I'm happy to wash my own dishes, but just let me know if I'm supposed to, (and a little sponge and a little detergent would be great at that point). I have a lot of respect for housekeeping employees, so I was a little stressed about: ""If I leave the dishes in the sink, is that offensive? Or am I supposed to do that????"".  Am I supposed to use the shampoo and a towel from the bathroom to wash dishes? Why is there no guidance? There's no list of which items are available, etc. In sum: it's all very disorganized and it really does feel like they sort of wish you wouldn't actually use the kitchen. 

- There is NO COFFEE MAKER  in the room. Bring instant coffee like starbucks via or tea. I never did get the mugs I asked for, so I heated water up in the microwave in the glass from the bathroom, dumped my Via or tea-bag in, and waited for it to cool a little to drink it. 

- This final point may not matter at all to many of you, but for me it was a big bummer. The ""black-out"" shades have gaps of several inches between them, and also don't extend past the bottom of the waist-high window. The net result of this is that EVERY MORNING I was awakened at 6 a.m. as bright sunlight burst through these gaps and lit up the room. What's the point of having so-called ""black-out"" shades if they don't truly black-out diddly squat???   Reviewer Jaime -- I'm with you on this one. I like to sleep in when in Vegas and being awakened at SIX AM every morning by the sun really ruined it. 



In sum, I'd recommend the Vdara but with some big caveats. And, while I'd cautiously recommend it, I can never, ever stay here again due to the inability to get a full night's sleep. They might as well put a rooster in every room (how eco-friendly would THAT be?)  :)",3,0,0

The front desk lady was first - she just pissed me and my husband off.  Then the horrible room service we had and so many other things.  The two gentlemen in the business center were extremely cool, helpful and just awesome.  Which these two could train the front desk ladies.

Front Desk experience - We got to Vegas on sunday morning and went straight to our hotel. The lady at the front desk was a little snarky. Let me first say - my husband called ahead of time, twice actually, and explained it was our anniversary and special and could we please have a room with a strip view. He was told yes, it will be taken care of, we have a strip view. - So we give her our names and she says check-in isnt available until 11 or 12, and come back then - Just her tone and wording was so rude.  We ask snootypants if the room is a strip view - she says no its a pool view. Nicely my husband explains he called ahead and was told he did have a strip view. Attitude chick responds to us like this ""again, there is nothing I can do until 11 or 12, I suggest you come back then"" which we were fine with - just not fine with the tude on this girl.  So we decided to go to the Wynn buffet for breakfast.  After breakfast it was time for check-in.  We get back and hope we dont get the same chick, but we did. When we go to check in with snooty witch is a little bit less bitchy and immediately tells us there are only rooms with partial strip views available and not the one we requested and would this be ok, well of course its not. So politely we ask how long it would be to wait for a room with a full view. She picks up the phone - asks someone to release the rooms, and then books a full view room. Now let me ask...why the heck didnt she just do that in the first place? We get to our room finally and its a room with a strip\/fountain view. This was awesome. Last time I felt like I didnt get to enjoy the fountains, and now I get to see as many shows as I want. Perfect - the snarky one came thru for us in the end but only with us having to get irritated - not a good way to start out our stay.  To the left you see the Palms, Rio and the mountain range. My husband loved waking up and seeing the golden shine the mountains had in the morning.  To the right we had a view of the Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel tower and flamingo.  

Room - Do be careful if you take a bath - its a little tricky to get out of the tub, I almost fell twice.  Also if you move in the tub water spills over the sides constantly.  I loved the bed and the decor - the pillows and bedding were great - good night sleep.  We did have the same problem as some have mentioned with the TV - if you do something in the guide it freezes, beware.  It happened to us three times.  It wasnt the same thing, one time we just pulled up the guide and it froze.  The blackout shades I agree with someone that said they arent really blackout - they have gaps that shine right in your eyes when you are in bed - and the room was soooo freaking dusty.  

Room Service - $70 for the worst breakfast we ever had - a burrito and eggs benedict (with pork chops, not ham - beware), chocolate crossaints and orange juice and milk - $70??? oh my and dont have the potatoes,  so gross, I mean really just nasty.  Tasted like oil paste.  And they messed up my order, so I got to watch my husband eat breakfast on our anniversary, then he got to watch me once they finally brought me the right meal.  I complained because I was so pissed this is the way our anniversary started, and we were given 4 chocolate covered strawberries.  hmm - not worth it, wish I had breakfast anywhere else but here.  

Overall obviously we will not be staying here again.  I could have dealt with the bad room service - but the attitude we received just sealed the deal that we will not go back here.",3,0,0

This hotel is amazing. I absolutely hate the smell of all casinos it's disgusting, but when you walk in the vdara it smells SOO good. It is a stark contrast to most hotels in Vegas. 
There is only valet parking, but they are extremely fast. It was seriously the best service, I wish I remembered the name of this particular valet guy, but he went above and beyond all expectations. He got our car in 5 minutes or less and had the hotel send a complimentary fruit bowl to our room and on our last night he had them send up champagne and chocolate covered strawberries!!!! 
The gym facility is beautiful, and the pool is great even though it was crowded.
Vdara is a bit pricey on the weekends, but well worth it. If you are looking to ""do Vegas differently"" and stay away from casinos and the hustle and bustle of the strip, this is the perfect place.",1,0,0

So I decided to splurge. I got the two bedroom penthouse. This includes a limo to pick you up and take you back to the airport. When we arrived our chauffeur was there. A nice car and a nice chauffeur. When we arrived we went to invited guests check in. The man that assisted us was very nice. What I didn't understand was that they knew we were coming in their limo. Why didn't they have our room ready? They said they would call us when it was ready. We went to lunch and no call. So we went back and the room was ready. Not sure why no call. We go to our room and it was the most disgusting room I've ever been in. The windows were so dirty we couldn't see out of them. Then we found out it was a handicapped room. We felt so sorry for a handicapped person having to stay in this room. I called the front desk and they said that they would get us another room. They said we could wait in this room and when it was ready they would let us know. They sent us up some fruit and water. We waited over an hour. I called down to the front desk and the room was ready. Again no phone call liked told. We went to our room and what a difference. The room was spectacular. Wall to wall windows in every room. When you are paying a high price for a room this is the room you expect. I didn't want to leave the hotel room. Everything is so clean and neat. Just like the first time I stayed here. It looks brand new. The beds are so soft and the sheets are thick and smell so good. I have stayed in the Executive suite, two bedroom loft and now the two bedroom penthouse. They are all great rooms. They don't have a casino and the one complaint I have with the hotel is the walk to the strip. It's very dangerous and just doesn't look good. They should have built a walkway to the strip and The Cosmo hotel. It's not the cheapest hotel on the strip. But if you like a nice room I would go the extra bucks and get this hotel room. Just don't get the handicapped room.",1,0,1

The room was very spacious and comfortable and the setup was really nice. I liked the kitchenette and mini fridge in the room.

I didn't know until after we had booked our room that they didn't have a casino and I wasn't sure how I felt about this because I've never stayed at a casino-less hotel in Vegas, but I actually realized that I liked this so much better because it's an easy quick walk to the guest elevators and I don't need to take a long windy walk through the casinos. It's so convenient and if you do want to gamble, you can go to Vdara's sister hotel, Aria, which is right next door.

Another major plus about Vdara is that our Uber rides picked us up and dropped us off right at the valet. Some other hotels require that you go to a specific spot in the guest parking structure and I can imagine this is probably very annoying.

I recommend this hotel if you're not big on gambling. I'll be back, Vdara!",1,0,0

When we walked into our room at the Vdara I was expecting to be ""wow'ed"", but I was so disappointed.  Another reviewer mentioned that the furniture was very Ikea-like.  I agree 100%.  It really appeared as though the designers were on a budget when they designed our room.  

Our only problem with staff was when we came back into our room in the evening and noticed that the housekeeping staff forgot to leave us cups and an ice bag.  Not a big deal, they were very quick to get us some after we called downstairs.

My boyfriend had booked this hotel for a two-night stay this past weekend. We were extremely excited and couldn't wait to live in luxury for a couple of days. Unfortunately, we have never been so disappointed, EVER. 

We reserved a suite. When I say that, you think grand and lavish, correct? We did, too. What we got, though, was a studio sized room, a tiny bathroom with an even tinier shower and bath-tub, and a kitchen that served no purpose. The suite was very modern and sleek, but it was extremely unpolished and, imo, very poorly designed. The edges scratched us, the bathroom door was so hard to close because it was so stiff, the floor stained from water (WATER!), and the bathroom counter stained from my Bare Escentuals powdered makeup that I spilled. That shit is all-natural, so I know it wasn't my fault. To add to the list of negatives, there was no hot or cold water. Luke-warm the whole way, baby! We had ignored the small tub, but we couldn't ignore the fact that there was no hot water and so little water pressure that the sink overflowed without intervals of being turned off. Oh, and how about waking up in the middle of the night to use the restroom but finding that the door had somehow locked itself from the inside? How about going to turn on the lights to figure it out, but having none of the lights work? After we had found ONE small lamp that worked and a quarter to open the bathroom door, I had definitely had enough. 

Keep in mind that this was ALL on top of my biggest issue: allergies. My allergies are bad, but they were unbearable in this suite. I had turned off the AC and fans to prevent my allergies from acting up, but that didn't even work. I was up all night, every night. It honestly ruined my trip. I still can't figure out what it was, though, about the room. As soon as we left the room and hotel, everything was fine. 

Yes, make sure to leave the hotel because Vdara has nothing to do. It is the quieter hotel when compared to Aria. We often found ourselves going to the Bellagio next door, which was a good idea because we couldn't even stand to hang out at the Vdara pool with their $5 cup of sodas. (Even the bartender chuckled about how ridiculous the pricing was).

Take this review to heart and don't think I am only whining or complaining. I do all of that, of course, but this is still an honest review. My boyfriend never complains, but he was fed up with this hotel as well. Moreover, he developed allergies while staying at Vdara!

My experience with Vdara was horrible. The only things I enjoyed here were the view (from the 48th floor, helicopters were flying by our windows!) and quality time with the bf. I wouldn't come back.  So maybe they aren't entirely finished with all of the building and construction and that there is so much more to come and look forward to?!!? Well, maybe they shouldn't open it up to guests until then.",5,2,1

This seemed odd for a penthouse booking as we expected to be given a priority in check-in at the very least and we have seen other reviewers who had the two-bedroom Penthouse and they were offered priority check in, upgraded rooms with views of Bellagio lake, etc. We were offered none of that even though we had requested it months in advance. When we finally got up to the desk to pre-register we were told that the room was not ready, but that we could go ahead and check in and they would call us as soon as the room was ready which they expected to be within about two hours.
So we went to find a place for lunch. By the time we finished lunch it was about 2:00 and we had expected to hear something by then, but we did not, so we called to see if the room was ready. We could not get an answer as to whether or not the room was ready and all that they could tell us is that someone from housekeeping would be tracked down and we would receive a call back as soon as they could get a status. Over 30 minutes passed, so now it was 2:30, and we still had not gotten even a call back to update us as to the status of the room. We called twice between 2:30 and 3:00 from the lobby and were told the same thing, that no one from housekeeping could be reached and that the room was still not ready. We sat in the lobby watching other people check in, go to their rooms and come back down and leave, all the while we sat waiting with no answers and no one trying to resolve the problem. No remedies were offered at all...we were just left in limbo sitting in the lobby.
Finally, at 3:15 out of desperation we got back in the check-in line, waited for another 15 minutes in line, and then when we finally got up to the desk and stated that we had been waiting and that it was now past check-in time, the lady got on the phone trying to get someone from housekeeping to get a status. She told us no one was answering and then she left the counter and said she'd be right back. We have no idea where she went, but she was gone for a long period of time, and finally at somewhere between 3:30 and 3:45 while we were still standing at the counter waiting for her to come back and tell us what was happening, our phone rang and it was housekeeping saying that the room was finally ready, at which point the lady at the desk reappeared. All this time nothing was offered to us, like some complimentary coffee at Starbucks, a couple of drinks in the Vdara bar while we waited, Nothing! This was a completely unacceptable course of events.
The people working the front desk have a very snobbish attitude and really don't seem to care about guests. Most of them don't appear to be experienced enough to work in a luxury hotel.
Why weren't we ever upgraded to a strip view especially when we were not even put in our room until well past check in time? Why didn't anyone take control of the situation and try to resolve it? Why not have us sit and wait in the Vdara Bar having cocktails and snacks to make it an enjoyable experience?
By the time we got to the room and had our luggage brought up, it was well past 4:00. When we finally got to the room it did not have a view of the strip as we had requested. Basically we were looking at and hearing the highway. We could not believe it as we paid for an eight night stay at a Premium 5-Star Hotel Penthouse Suite and spent a significant amount of money to stay in this Penthouse Suite. We have received better accommodations and service at much lower priced hotels in Las Vegas, such as The Signature where we actually had a strip view and a balcony, and were also accommodated on an early check-in with no problems within a reasonable amount of time of arriving. We had to call three days in a row asking for coffee and water, as we were only provided the bare minimum of water and decaffeinated coffee instead of regular coffee. The first time we asked for coffee we were told that there were only three regular caffeinated Keurig coffees left, so we were given the last three. Wow, running out of regular coffee?
They also will bring you an arrival gift - Ours was a bowl with four tiny pieces of rotten fruit versus the Signature, where our gift was a large basket of fruit and a bottle of champagne.
We observed housekeeping cleaning rooms as late as 5:00 pm, when the turn-down service was shortly after that...just didn't make sense. There were days we left by 9:00 am and turned on the housekeeping light so they could come in and clean, and we would come back late in the afternoon (3 - 5 p.m.) and things still were not done.  This was a $5,000 mistake!",1,0,0

Its a gorgeous hotel and the suites\/room was amazing. We booked a corner city suite and had 10 girls staying there for a bachelorette party. It was great in size and we all pretty much had a place to sleep. Major plus was that there is a 1\/2 bath located in the living room area. Very handy with that many girls getting ready for a night out in LV. I would def recommend this hotel. 

My biggest grip would be that the only place to eat in the hotel (market place??) was very expensive. A cup of good old orange juice was $6!!! And considering you have a bit of a walk to the next closest hotel (Aria and or Cosmo) you are not left with much choice other then to pay the high price of food in the hotel. 

Second biggest problem was at night you have to show your room key to the elevator door man before being able to head up to your room for the night. While I understand the security reasons for doing this, it was VERY inconvenient when you are traveling with such a large party and all coming and going at different times. Needless to say you need to plan ahead for that!

All in all it's a beautiful and very modern looking hotel but if you plan to be out in the nightlife\/exploring LV frequently you might want something not so enclosed in the new city center.",0,0,0

It was a peaceful hotel with a contemporary look and feel. The rooms were wonderful. The bathroom was even better. It was  large and clean. Everything looked new. The rooms came with these amazing robes. It was high quality material and felt so good against the skin. I didn't want to take it off! 

The room I stayed in had a comfortable king size bed, with high quality linen. There were two TVs, one in the bedroom area and one in the living room area. I liked the fact that they provide you with the auxiliary cord to connect your Ipod to the TV. 

Room service was prompt. Every time we called for something, it came quickly. The staff were extremely nice and helpful. 

The location is nice because you can walk to the two newest hotels in Vegas, Cosmo and Aria. You can also walk to Bellagio and a bunch of older hotels as well. Just like most hotels in Vegas, the Vdara is so big, you can easily get lost in there. The pool was tranquil. The music wasn't loud and it was just perfect to relax. Only problem with Vdara is that the entrance is kind of confusing and hard to locate. If you're unfamiliar with the new City Center.

Everything here is so modern that if you want your room cleaned you have to press a light (which is hard to see) and the hotel should probably mention this which is why another reviewer likely didn't get cleaning service. Yes there are some oddities - the kitchen I think is more meant to be looked at than used but the free water is great and the rooms are large and very very clean. Our suite had 2 flat screen TVs - one in the bedroom and one in the living room and although the pullout couch is uncomfortable and doesn't ""come with"" linens the hotel will make it up very promptly as a bed if requested. The soaking tub was to die for I think I took two baths a day even though I felt a bit guilty being in the desert I couldn't resist. And I can't forget to mention the free valet parking! I think the thing that really distinguishes this hotel and which will most definitely bring us back is the lack of a smoky casino. If you want to be around drunk people chain smoking as you walk through your lobby every day go next door to Aria or anywhere else on the strip.

My first trip to Vegas (on marathon weekend) was a mixed bag. Robert Klein at Suncoast (in Summerlin, a 50 buck cab ride each way if you tip) was great. I've met so many people from all over America, including a lovely couple from Kentucky with three girls and a couple grandkids and a British couple (both engineers) with whom I planned to meet yesterday but couldn't because the Strip was closed. 

This is THE BEST hotel room of its kind I've ever been. You can't compare hotels like the W or Vdara to Ritz Carlton\/Four Seasons traditional upscale resorts, but for this style of hotel, it's without question the best I've ever stayed. 

But I have never been to a W that could compare to the beauty of this room, 75 feet larger than the studio I live 3 months a year in Manhattan. The kitchen and bathroom impart an instant sense of well-being. I truly do not want to leave and feel gypped because I checked in at 12:39. 

It's the best bed, the best linens and the best view. I would not change a thing in this brilliantly designed and decorated room except for this really ugly green leaf picture above the desk. That's bizarre and out of place.

At the pool, which is stunning and enormous though a bit too warm at 84 degrees for real exercise, all I could think about was how my life would be complete if someday I cold afford 570 feet like this on the Upper East Side. 

The Vdara doesn't have its own casino and restaurants: you walk to the next place over--the Aria--for food and gambling. But this is like the non-Las Vegas Vegas resort. The bimbo factor is extremely low. Women look like professionals, except of course what I was told had to be hookers in the City Bar and on one couch going to the elevators. The two women were clownish with bad platinum extensions, horrific footwear (pink rhinestone platform heels about 6 or 7 inches) and fake tits which looked like they were made of steel. 

City Bar played SUCH great 1980s and 1990s music. No music in the Vdara is loud and I think if you're a mature 30-year-old or middle-aged (45 and up), this has to be the best game in town. 

Note: If you book through Travelzoo, they give you a not good room. In the words of the terrific man at the desk who took pity on me as I arrived like something the cat dragged in at 12:39 AM, you get the ""suckiest room we have."" Ha. But he gave me a room on the 6th floor and without the deal, it would have been 119 plus 25 resort fee. I paid 79 and 25. 

But even at 150\/nt, it's a steal! It's  my DREAM APARTMENT (other than the unfortunate an inescapable fact that it's in Vegas and not CA\/NY). 

Room service is predictably pricey. Market Cafe is not good: see my review this morning on the worst cup of coffee I've had in a restaurant or hotel in all my life and the deplorable service and high prices. But this is a minor problem. I'm sure there are other places to get coffee and Starbucks Via would be fine. You could come here and write, read, reflect in peace and use the kitchen to stock up on Whole Foods or the equivalent, making it a modestly-priced luxurious escape. 

I am in love and do NOT want to go back to CA at 8:35 PM. I could get so much reading and writing done here. I'd unplug and take a break in the pool and resume work. It may sound odd to come to Vegas to work (write), but I would love to bring 6 books here and catch up on reading.

Valet, check in, & check out the spot. Checking in is weird because they told us we couldn't carry our own bags to our room! WTH??? LOOK WE NEED OUR LIQUOR ASAP!!! LOL Anywho, the front desk staff was nice, there weren't many customers checking in at the time so I walked up & it took about 5mins. 

The rooms were BEAUTIFUL!!! Nice apartment\/condo style rooms. We got a 38th floor room so our view was EVERYTHING!!! The blinds were operated by an electrical switch which was Uber cool. Room was clean & fully stocked. Every time we called for room service they were pretty prompt. 

Only issues were with valet, they get busy Saturday night & Sunday morning it's PACKED to check out. Security at night ask for room keys which is a pain on the ass when your carrying shit in!!! 

Check out was also painless & quick. Nathan was the clerk he was nice & offered transportation options which was nice.

We arrived at 1am on a Monday and realized we didn't pack toothpaste.  Called the front desk and were told it would be right up.  Didn't realize it would take more than 35 minutes for them to be ""right up"".  If it was a busy weekend I would understand, but it was a dead Monday morning.

Resort fees... one of the most dishonest business practices ever.  These 'resort fees' should have already been included in the high price of booking this hotel.  They display a dishonest price when booking and then slap you with these fees which are nothing more than to be used to generate more revenue and to display a lower room price.  I will never return to a hotel nor ever recommend anyone to a hotel that charges a resort fee (and a high fee for this mater).  $18 + 12% tax.

Aria (which probably has some resort fees too now that I think about it since it owns Vdara) had some nice front desk staff, so does MGM signature.  The front desk staff at Vdara are definitely not the best.  They must have put out their worst staff for the weekday mornings.  I've just gotten off the phone with a Vdara front desk worker who was so rude that I had to come on here and write up this review (and I don't review often...).

Good
Nice bed and pillows.  
View was nice---facing Bellagio
Room was clean on day 1
Customer service...mixed... so\/so at best.
Non smoking or gambling hotel.

Bad
1st... we were there to enjoy Las Vegas... and we did...so... not really hung up on the room but there were issues. 

Left room on day 2 @ 0700 requested the room be cleaned... back to the room at 1530 and no maid service... not cool. 
Broken phone
Fridge didn't cool
Shower pressure was almost like pouring out a bottle of water.. if that much pressure. Really low... made getting a shower a PITA! 
Overpowering potpourri smell in the entire hotel.
Iron was chained to the ironing board... 1st time I had seen this...even in low budget hotels I've never seen it.  Maybe there is an iron thief in the building? 
Noise from the room above... 
Electrical outlets did not work (3x)



Conclusion.... 
We will not stay at the Vdara  again...  it's touted as a upscale hotel but it's smoke and mirrors... it's a 3 star place.

It's modern, relatively clean and best of all, quiet, which is not so easy to find in Vegas. However, there were too many 'accidents' for me to become a big fan.


So, on the plus side, as I mentioned above:

+ It's a pretty new building, so everything is in good condition and looks nice. There is no colorful sculptures or decorations, like in other hotels, it's less artsy and flashy and more modern and minimalist. After spending few hours in other hotels here and there I definitely can say that I prefer it that way.

+ The cleaning service was great. The maids never bothered you if you didn't want cleaning. And if you did they were always done before you were back to the room, even if you only went out for an hour. Great organization! And I love the button system.

+ There is no casino there, therefore there is also no noise, no smoke smell and no drunk people. And the nearest casino is right in the building in front of Vdara, so no loss :)

+ Market Cafe Vdara - great breakfast spot on the ground level

+ It's pet friendly.

+ The poll is also ok. Not fabulous or anything, rather on a small side, but no crowds and a lot of deck chairs.



However:

- There was mold on the back of my hairdryer. Luckily I noticed it before I used it and I got a new one quickly, but still, they should check on such things. Blah, disgusting!

- Light went out in the whole suite after I switched it on. I had to wait a few hours before someone came. He was very nice and solve the problem quickly though.

- There was dust on all the furniture just a few hours after cleaning, even with windows closed, so not a great place for allergy sufferers.

- They canceled the possibility to charge bills to our room and when asked why, they had no idea at all. However, it was quickly rectified.

- In comparison with other hotels, Vdara's infrastructure is poor at best. There is one small cafe, Starbucks and a drink bar. And that's it. No shops, no restaurants.

- The prices for cosmetics and treatments in SPA are very high, but their quality mediocre.


All in all, I will probably try another hotel if I ever go back, but that one is not a bad choice.",7,1,3

Room itself...spacious, clean, quiet, and damn what a view.  I had the view of the backside of the hotel and freeway but still one damn nice view it was. Bed was the most comfortable bed I've slept in in a looooong time.  And the bathroom...love.  HUGE tub to take a bubble bath (which I did..SCORE!) and a nice shower.  PLUS, enough space for two girls to get ready in the bathroom comfortably. LOL.  

So few things...no real restaurants here but they have a bar, a place to get food a la carte, and room service.  Not bad to me.  I tried foods in all areas and was very surprised that food was pretty good.  The bar had amazing drinks as well.  It can get crowded and busy since there's only one bar in the hotel (besides the pool) which is understandable.  But every drink that I had there was delightful and refreshing.  Brandie is your girl to go to...(check my review for Bar Vdara).

The pool isn't ginormous but it's a good size.  Not very deep (which I like since I can't swim) but like the hotel itself it was a very ""chill"" crowd.  Don't expect a party scene here.  Some families were there but they were in certain areas of the pool which didn't bother my time there at all.  

I even had time to go to the Spa which I wished I had more time to go to next time I come.  It's immaculate and has everything you need.  Get a massage and treat yourself if you can here.  It's well worth it in my opinion.

This is my first time staying here and would LOVE to come here again and again.  I don't gamble and don't really smoke so this place was just right for me.

We were very excited to stay in the new City Center, and a non-gaming hotel at that.  We arrived around 9 and had to wait to check in (only one person working the front desk).  We waited about 10 minutes to check in, but the girl at the desk was very friendly, so not a huge deal.  The room (25th Floor) was lovely, though small, with a kitchenette and fridge (have to say, the fridge was nice--big enough to store the drinks that we bought from the CVS).  The coolest thing about the room was the electric shade (sheer and blackout), so we played with those a lot.  The bed stands out--it was heavenly....SO Soft, and the PILLOWS!  Unbelievable.  The decor was nice, particularly the room signs and the handy little light system at the door that let you push a button to get a do not disturb light or a housekeeping light on your doorbell.  
That being said, there were no amenities in the hotel--there was one restaurant that only served (a very expensive) breakfast and lunch.  Room service was plastic-wrapped food that you heated up in the microwave.  It was also a haul to the strip, and you had to go to the Monte Carlo to find any affordable places to eat.

ROOM:
My room was beautiful, and HUGE. I had an enormous (presumably king size) bed, and I heard the, yes, sofa in an adjoined ""room"" divided from the bed area by the TV floor-to-ceiling cabinet, and the desk. There was a kitchen area also, even with a cooktop, though I did not see any cookware, and, there was no grocery type store that i saw near the hotel. A Walgreen's that was supposedly nearby, but which took me hours to get to, going through the Cosmopolitan casino, which I heard took another fellow at the hotel, about the same amount of time to find. The room had free wifi, which was good. POOL: Its pool was closed for the week I was there, which I'd have appreciated knowing before I reserved a room there. There was also no sign at the pool area saying it was closed. I found this out while 2 other people were trying to get into the pool area as I was, by visiting the concierge who told me it was closed for the week. I let him know there was no sign there. I was able to use the pool area in its sister hotel Aria for the week, but that cut out on my lunch time taking 15-ish minutes to walk back and forth for my lunch hours at the conference, not great.

CONCIERGE:
I was here while the bull riding championships were in town, which I have always wanted to see. So I asked the concierge if tickets were easy to get, and was told they were sold out and I'd need to go through a ticket broker and they were really expensive, which seems like an odd thing for a concierge to say to a hotel guest, versus getting the price for me and offering to get the tickets for me. Later, another guest told me there were plenty of tickets, and they were ""cheap,"" so I am not sure what was true, and sadly to me, I didn't see this event I'd always wanted to go to for amusement. It always cracks me up watching it on TV.  ;)

FOOD:
The hotel has some food at the bar, and a deli type place where you can get decent and expensive breakfasts and other meals, and it also has plenty of takeout options. You are able to get any of their foods as take out. I saw an older gentleman in a suit at a table, receive his breakfast in a takeout box, saw him explain he was eating in (and he was seated at a table), and saw the server bring him a plate to transfer the food to from his takeout box. I was surprised seeing this given the cost of the entree, that they didn't take it back and plate it for him -- that seemed surprisingly shoddy. 

The quality of the food was fine, not particularly notable for the eggs Benedict. Its breakfast potatoes, while tasty, were not at all crisp, which I like to see in a breakfast potato. The takeout cobb salad was generous though, so that was good. The biscuits and gravy I'd skip, even though usually I love this dish. It featured sausage that was in casing, then cut up which was odd, so that got screwed up in the gravy, and the biscuits were unusual, soaking up the gravy instead of acting how biscuits in gravy normally ""act"". Not sure of the words to use, but that dish I cannot recommend, here. I did not have lunch or dinner here so cannot comment.

There is a Starbucks in the lobby also, and had prices that were okay. I was in a Starbucks in a Hilton in San Diego a few days later, featuring prices about 25% higher, so the prices at the Vdara's Starbucks were decent, for Vegas.

LOCATION:
Overall though, it's a very nice hotel, and I really liked it. A BIG plus; they don't allow smoking here, because they don't have a casino!!  That is pretty huge. All other hotels feature casinos, and this one is adjacent to the Bellagio's casino so it's still closeby if you want to gamble. Their sister hotel, Aria, also has a bunch of other restaurants pretty close, across a giant valet circle drive, about a 5 minute walk away, but has a casino too. And Cosmopolitan hotel \/ casino is about a 6-7 minute walk away, going outside, down stairs or there's an elevator, and walking across its giant circular valet drive, but crossing some treacherous lanes of traffic also -- not friendly to do, but not really far, per se.

I like to travel with my dogs and Vdara advertises being dog friendly. I called them before I made any reservation to get detailed information on their pet policy. 

They told me that they provide dishes and crates for the dogs so I wouldn't have to bring my own. 

I drove there so I could have easily brought my puppy's cage and dishes for my dogs. However, since I was told I wouldn't need either I didn't bring any of them with me. 

After I checked in, exhausted from my long drive 2 tiny crates arrived at my room. The hotel says up to 2 dogs combined weight per room 70lbs. The crates they brought were too tiny for my 43lb Springer and my 30lb puppy could be crammed in but couldn't lay down or sit comfortably. 

They delivered blankets, a bisquit and a room service menu but no baggies as promised and no bowls. So I called downstairs 4 times to get no answer and went down to speak to them finally. I was told they only had paper dishes and no larger crates. 

Obviously the paper dishes are not so reuse able with water and difficult to clean from food too so I had to ask for a new set the following day and didn't even get real dog dishes, no attempt was even made to give a a real bowl from room service. 

Then my second night the puppy got stuck in the tiny crate and suddenly 2 different size larger crates appeared at my door after being told many times that they had nothing larger. 

My dogs were dying of thirst the entire stay and everytime I needed to feed them was a project. This was not relaxing!  It was frustrating and some of the hotel staff were apologetic but most couldn't be bothered helping me with the dogs needs. 

If you can't make proper accommodations you should not call yourself pet friendly!  I was charged a fee for having the pets but not given the necessary accommodations for them as promised. 

Very frustrating. 

I also got no bell service at check out and the valets were not helpful with my bags loading up my car when I had 2 dogs in my hand too.

I had found the Vdara through Expedia, and booked the room via Jet Luxury Resorts http:\/\/www.jetluxuryresorts.com\/ Jet Luxury books blocks of rooms at hotels at a discount. The room we ended up in was an ""owner's suite,"" which we got for about 1\/2 price. I wasn't even looking for that kind of deal, but got it!

Vdara is a posh non-smoking hotel, without a casino, but with a lot of amenities that made our stay enjoyable and relaxing. We had a roomy 600+ sf studio suite which was very comfortable with a separate kitchenette\/dining area. The hotel has a nice bar with a shaded patio that serves small dishes and a cafe serving breakfast and lunch, as well as take-away foods throughout the day. A Starbuck's is on the property.

The Vdara is connected to the Bellagio via a walkway; it took us about 10-15 minutes to get to the Bellagio lobby. This is the best way to get to The Strip from Vdara.

The Aria is across a round-about (where you drive up to both the Vdara and Aria) and took about 5 minutes to walk to and enjoy the casino and several restaurants there (Javier is a top destination!). From the Aria you can get to Crystals shopping and beyond. I found it more confusing getting to The Strip from Aria\/Crystals.

Things to note: The kitchenette we had (and it sounds like it was true for others) had a sink, small fridge, microwave and a 2-burner cooktop. There were drawers and cupboards, but no utensils, plates, coffee maker, tea pot, etc. We just put sodas in the fridge so it wasn't a big deal, but if you want to use the kitchenette, you should bring some paper plates, maybe a mini cutting board and knife, if you want to cut up limes for drinks, and maybe a single cup Keurig, especially if you're driving to LV and can load up, etc. Plastic utensils, napkins, etc. are available in the cafe.

Our suite was on the 5th Floor, which made it convenient to get to the lobby quickly (I wonder if the Jet Luxury owners' suites are on the lower floors?). Ours overlooked the pool through a beautiful wall-sized window. It didn't seem like anyone could look up into our room; there was a gauzy shade that can be closed to let in light (a blackout shade, too.).  If you're on a lower floor, ask to have a room facing the pool, otherwise you might have a view of the monorail tram that goes by one side of the building at roughly the 4th - 6th floor levels. Friends of ours had a room on the 30th floor and could see the Bellagio fountains from there.

We enjoyed our stay at the Vdara, with its friendly, helpful staff, location and cool ambiance, a nice break from the frantic Strip!

Staff is friendly and it's a smoke and casino free environment (if that's what you're looking for).  I stayed in a normal suite and a hospitality suite at the Vdara.  In the normal suite, there's a mini fridge, a cook top and a partition with flat screens between the seating area and bedroom.  It's like a really nice and modern european studio apartment.  

The hospitality suite had 2 rooms (one with a king bed and another with 2 full beds) as well as a pull out sofa bed.  There's a living room area with a full sub zero fridge, cook top and washer and dryer.  Great venue to host a party\/get together.

Location was also great.  Walking distance to the Bellagio and Aria.  Cosmopolitian is actually a pretty short walk as well but ask the bell desk how to get there out from the front.  Otherwise it's a long round about walk.  

I liked the rooms and decor but there were a few negatives.  First, something on the room floors smelled off.  It smells great in the lobby and in the elevators, but on the floors, it was weird.  Second, the line to check in was LONG.  took over 30 minutes to get checked in around 1PM on a Saturday.  Third, we switched rooms to watch the superbowl and I know check in is at 3PM but they literally didn't switch us over until 3 and the game started soon after.  lastly, the wait at the vdara market cafe was horrible.  It took forever to get food\/drinks.  

Overall, great rooms, not so great service.  I'd probably end up going back because of the refridgerators and non-smoking atmosphere, but might check out the cosmopolitan the next time we're in vegas.",0,0,0

-Lack of dining options (however, this did eliminate traffic and noise)
-Distance to the strip, had to go through the Bellagio or Aria to get anywhere (difficult after long, clubbing nights)

With big windows and a gorgeous view, modern decor and furniture picks, a stunning bathroom, and a mini kitchen, I was so in love!

The penthouse was so roomy - two bedrooms (with a bathroom each), a kitchen area with a full sized fridge, and a living room that had a couch that was also a pullout queen sized bed. The decor was similar to that of the deluxe suite, but I remember the bathroom in the deluxe suite being a lot better than the ones in the penthouse. My favorite part of the penthouse was definitely the semi-ceiling-to-floor windows. I say almost because the windows end about two or three feet before it hits the ground, and has enough room for you to sit on the ledge.

We didn't have any problems with the service - they were all pretty nice. When we called for room service, they came pretty quickly with items that we requested. There's also free water bottles (which is always REALLY nice after a night of drinking)! They also have free wifi!

One big complaint about Vdara is that their elevators were pretty horrible. It's not the decor or if they were slow, but rather, it was because it was so hot. There was no ventilation at all!

It was weird because the rooms, hallways, and lobby area were all ACed or had good ventilation, but they probably forgot to install AC into their elevators or something.",6,1,1

Oh, the windows are sooo cool. This super modern room has one of those window curtain things where you push a button...and the curtains raise and shut by themselves, like automatically.

The only reason i didn't give the place 5 stars was because i thought the pool was a little small and crowded. that's all.

The foyer doesn't have the smell of cigarettes nor the clinging and clanging of slot machines. It is an actual hotel only in the midst of Vegas.

It shares an entrance into Aria and Cosmopolitan. Follow the narrow paths that have an arrow pointing to Vdara. The rooms have a modern feel with wood coloring, kitchen and a King sized bed. There is a dining table, powder room, large bathroom with your shower, bathtub, and vanity area. These rooms are big enough for at least 5 people if you use the pull out couch. If you get a room high enough, you can see a great skyline view of the strip.

First things first. Deluxe Suites do not come with robes, ladies CALL FOR HOUSE KEEPING AND THEY WILL BRING YOU A ROBE. The most amazing robe ever. I actually purchased one when i left! 

Second best thing: The HUGE oversized swings outside the lounge. Absolutely amazing to come home on a late night, and relax in this huge swing outside. I absolutely loved it. 

Pros: 
Amazing location. Even from our ""Basic"" room, we had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains on the 33rd floor. 
Room service. SO fast, so efficient. Prices were typical for vegas. They come in and set your little table up for your, they are so professional. I loved it. ORDER THE 4 CHEESE PIZZA! YUMMY!
The automatic Shades & Black Out curtains. SO FUN! I have read complaints about not completely blacking out, but it's pretty damn close. No complaints here.
Room service was amazing everyday. They would tidy up my makeup\/vanity things. tidy up the counters\/tables. It was really nice to come home too! 
Big shower. Nice size tub.
Ask front desk for an iPod cord and they will give you one to hook up to the TV to play your iPhone\/Pod on! WORTH IT!
Everything was so clean and modern. I love that! It is so nice to come home to a nonsmoking non-gaming hotel. ahhh it smells SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD.
Pool is nice - nothing too special. Very mellow though, and I like that. Lots of umbrellas, chairs, loungey type couch things. 
A 2 minute walk to Aria and Bellagio. 
4 Minutes to Monte Carlo. 


Cons: Deathica....oh I mean JESSICA. We had a small issue with her at Check in. Saying I had requested a Top Floor With Bellagio view. NOT TRUE! but she was going to make us pay for the upgrade anyway! BS. After we got that taken care of, things were smooth sailing.

Check in- FAST!

If you're doing the Vegas Strip walk, Vdara is a great place to start. Just head through Bellagio, out the main doors, and there's a water-show there that runs every 15 minutes. The water show looks magnificent when it gets dark, so come early or be prepared to wait. You can access the rest of the strip from where the water-show takes place.

We stayed here for five nights over the Super Bowl weekend, the rooms were outstanding - we stayed in an executive suite that had amazing views of the strip & Bellagio fountains. The rooms are modern, big, with comfy king beds, gorgeous big bathroom with a bath - a beautiful modern room.  The service and house keeping is of a high quality - very clean hotel. My only suggestions would be robes in the bed rooms. The rooms don't have mini bars either - but that didn't bother us. 

The location was perfect for us - it's not on the strip, so it's a bit quieter, but it's very close walking distance to the Cosmo, Bellagio and Aria. 

Next time I am in Vegas - I'll be staying here, it's very well priced and has great facilities! A great find!! Book it now!",0,0,0

A plus, it's a non-smoking hotel and it's close enough to everything that you can hoof it.

The valet is awesome. They have waters for you, as well as a little spot that has air conditioning if it's too hot, and they're efficient where you're not waiting forever for your car. If you need a bellboy, person, girl, hop? (hah what's the PC term now?), they're in abundance and waiting to take your luggage as you check in, and ready to be sent up to your room.

Easy check-in and check-out. You can use your room tv to check out (which was awesome!) Check-in was awesome, since I was able to ask for an upgrade (free) woohoo!! So it was a slightly bigger room and on the corner of the property so you have a fantastic view of something - depending on what part of the area you're in. Plus we got a full refrigerator, microwave, and almost a half kitchen (because there are no stoves), but they have plates, cups, utensils and a coffee maker stocked with coffee. Not that you're gonna be cooking and stuff, but it's great to have all those amenities available. Also, there was a washer and dryer if you feel like doing laundry.

The rooms come with a pull out couch (which was terribly uncomfortable, so some people ended up just sleeping on the floor instead). hehe So sorry peeps! But we had a king sized bed, and a pretty sizable bathroom filled with your normally toiletries, nothing too special. In addition, we had a 1\/2 bathroom in the living room, so sharing the room was a bit more comfortable.

However, when hoofing around Vdara, it's quite a trek, because there is no direct route in there - you have to go through the city center to the aria, then to vdara or from the other side, you enter through the Cosmopolitan. So if you're wanting some exercise, this hotel is perfect. 

The swimming pool is kinda small for such a large hotel, by Vegas standards. We ended up hitting up day clubs instead. :) There's no casino - boo! Overall I wouldn't mind staying here again. We got a pretty decent deal off Jetsetter. It's nice and clean.",6,5,6

So I made line again (takes me 30 mins) and they told me that they forgot to call me. This is ridiculous. I have stayed many hotel buy it was never happened before. Even when we were calling for in-suite dining. It took me to get an assistant about 10 mins. I think they don't have enough people for ensuring great service.

The main problem we encountered was the service provided by the hotel staff. They failed to follow through on anything they promised. That sums it up. I will go into details, but there are a lot of them. 

Found problems with:
- The Valet
- Front Desk
- Bellboy
- Room Service
- Room Quality

The hotel only offers Valet Parking. Not a major problem, unless the hotel has bad service, which it does. 

Valet takes forever!! And if you love your car, you don't want these guys getting behind the wheel. PERIOD.

We had booked a corner suit. Around $350 per night. Check in is at 3pm. We arrived at 4pm. We were told we could have a suit on the 29th floor but if we could wait 2 hours to check in, we could have a room on the 47th floor. We thought it was worth the wait! The front desk told us we would receive a call when our room was ready and we could check it, 2 hours max we were told. 

We had to leave our bags with the bellboy. We would have left them in the car but with it only being valet, that wasn't an option. We handed our bags over and the guy serving us paused before handing us our receipt and said ""unfortunately i only work outside and i don't bring your bags to the room"". After which there was an awkward silence while i waited to be handed the receipt. It wasn't until after that i realized this was an attempt to get tipped. REALLY? You didn't do anything! Since when do you have to tip twice for one service? .. Not a great start.

We eventually went back to the hotel at 8pm, after waiting 4 hours and receiving no phone call. We go to the front desk and are told the 47th room floor isn't ready yet, but there is one on the 29th floor if we didn't want to wait any longer. We're already 4 hours into waiting, hell no, i'm not going to bail out now!

After the front desk being on hold to room service for 20 minutes, we're told our room is ready. When we get to the door, we find them leaving the room. Anyway .. we're in! And the room is amazing! Fantastic views, very modern decor, let the fun begin. 
If only ....

The carpet in the bedroom is soaked through. Wet all over! Like excess water sqelching when you step on it! I call down to the front desk to complain and they offer to move us to a room on the 29th floor. It's now almost 9pm! We waited 5 hours for this room! When the bellboy comes up to drop off our bags, he offers to have extra towels sent up so we can try and mop up a bit. He was a really nice guy, very apologetic and he did make us feel better. The corner suit also comes with a pull out Queen bed which we intended to use. The bellboy tells us we can have the pull out bed made up by room service if we tell him a time.

OK great. We tell him midnight (it's currently 9pm). I figure that's long enough for them to get the job done, even with bad service. WRONG. We come back at 1am and it's not done!! We call to complain AGAIN, go back out to hit the strip, come back at 4am and there is a pillow and a folded sheet on the couch. So after it taking so long, they decided not make it and just drop the linens off .. Why would it take so many hours to drop that off! It does't even take that long to make, never mind drop off. Bad bad bad.

$350+ per night!! For service like that! Insane. The commercials on the hotel TV also advertise how high the hotel standards are and you're urged to ""Raise your expectations"". Seriously though. I didn't even have any expectations and you didn't meet them.

The pull out bed was also solely made of springs. I've used more comfortable beds in hostels i've stayed in, not even exaggerating slightly. Also, the shower looks amazing, its huge. But the water pressure was laughable. 

On a side note: the hotel doesn't have a casino. I learned The Vdara is just an extension of The Aria. So just stay in the Aria, unless they have the same management. I'm not risking The Aria after this experience, but who knows, it surely can't be any worse.",9,3,1

If you want to feel trapped from everything, stay here.  Really confusing driving into the City Center hotels.  Forced Valet, there is no customer self parking.  This gives you an idea of the nickle and dime'ing they do to ya.

Room Service-be prepared for the tip to be added on, + service charge.  A $39 meal quickly becomes a $50 + dollar meal.

In 2 days, we probably spent $100 on just tips because they seem to want to bring everything to you.

Pool is boring with pale people.  The pool hostesses were nice.

Buffet is $40 a person.  WOW what happened to old Vegas prices?

No where really convenient to eat cheaply.  A simple salad with chicken will run you +$20.  

Hotel is very boring with their niche seeming to be folks on work conventions.  

Room had a little kitchen in it which was great for me.  I thought I would start cooking something  but low and behold there was no cookware. You had to request it..which means some sort of charge I am sure.

No hair dryer either folks.  Probably a charge for that.

Valet was great polite and quick

The rooms are quiet.  Beds are cozy.  Kitchenette (not that we used the hotplate!  Lol...  who cooks on vacation?!).  Huge space.   Great views.  Quiet....  :)   oh...  and totally non-smoking which is AWESOME! 

Staff are all really great team members.   I would give them a 5 out of 5........SO FAR.   Depending on how they resolve the matter of my 3 missing pair of socks and underwear I sent to the laundry... I may adjust this.  Need to call them on Monday.

UPDATE:  Just checked my voicemail and they comped me more than enough to pay for the missing items.    Now I have to go back as the items were all originally purchased in Vegas.    Thank you Vdara for not making me have to fight with you on this.   I appreciate your proactivity.

The only things that I could complain about was the weak weak weak shower water pressure.  Pet peve.  Gimme full blast, man.  I can take it.   I might bring a wrench next time and FIX the flow.

It's close to the Cosmopolitan, Aria, and Bellagio with larger rooms for a little less $$. As someone else pointed out, there is currently construction going on that starts at 7 am! We were on the 11th floor and could hear the fork lift moving around wood and dropping pallets loud and clear first thing in the morning. I want to point out that we aren't light sleepers either- we live right near a major airport at home and can sleep through the jets above us any day. This wasn't something easy to ignore and it woke us up bright and early each morning. The annoying part was when we went to the Aria for breakfast to escape the noise (right next door), paid $4 for a croissant and $9 for a breakfast sandwich, but still had front row seats to more loud construction. They're remodeling their lobby FYI. 

Also, the internet in the rooms doesn't work and I spent over 2 hours trying to connect via wifi and LAN to send work emails that I composed on the flight over. Thankfully, it connected for about 3 minutes at one point and sent them, but we never established a connection again and on a side note- the LAN cable was less than 3 feet long, and not located on a desk or usable workspace, so I had to keep my laptop on the chair and sit on the floor to use it. The bad connection was also passed to our iPhones that couldn't get us any internet service in our room so figuring out our day plan was a pain. Also- half of the room is dark because there's no light in the living area for some reason so it's hard to 

We had a $75 resort credit, which was just enough for the two of us to eat breakfast at Jean Phillipe one morning, and then it covered half of the next day. The $22 breakfast buffet at the Aria is...you got it- under construction and closed so you will need to go to another hotel for a buffet. The good news is that the Cosmopolitan has a great brunch buffet until 2pm everyday for $22. You can't use your resort credit, but it's worth it since you'll end up skipping lunch after so much food anyway. 

The spa at Vdara is still expensive, but the least expensive out of the hotels in the area. A 50 min pedicure is $60, where as it's closer to $80 at the Bellagio and Mandalay. The $25 resort fee ($28 after taxes) is a joke since the Internet doesn't work and the pool isn't open this time of year.",1,0,0

You can easily get lost trying to get to the Vdara so prepare to study a map and drive carefully in the multiple circles before finally reaching your destination and drop off to mandatory valet. There is no direct walkway to Vdara so know the tram system and the multiple paths to get in and out of the hotel if you are planning to visit a friend or ultimately stay here. 
 
Upon checking in, you might as well have your key card on display at all times, because they will not let you in the elevators without inspecting it. The elevator was fast but felt sketchy at times. 

Friend was stoked for the automatic blinds that can also black out the room for those who sleep in during the day. A full kitchen with a mini-fridge, stove, oven, microwave, and a table for 4 is provided for those willing to make their own meals. Standing shower with a separated (raised?) tub with a toilet and sink completes the bathroom next to the kitchen. There is no real night stand so we used one of the tables in the ""living"" room as a night stand near an outlet.

It was ridiculously beautiful. When we got there, it was a Saturday around 2pm. We let them know how we were stoked to stay here and how we heard lots of great reviews and how it was my bday! So they got us upgraded and even got us a room with a view! We were lucky enough to check-in early and received a room with a view of the Bellagio fountains (: Thanks front desk!!! Check-in was waaaay easier and faster than I expected. 

The whole time we were there we received nothing but exquisite service. All housekeeping were friendly as well as other staff we encountered like the valet and the bellman. 

Good job management!! 

I picked this hotel on a whim since we cancelled our reservations at another one because of the horror stories lol (not gonna say which hotel)

I didn't mind that it was non-smoking w\/ no casino since I absolutely can't stand smoking and I'm not a huge gambler anyway! BUT if you are into that, just take a 2 minute walk over to the Bellagio or take the tram to Aria! It's really that close, trust me.

Oh and it's literally RIGHT beside the Cosmo too! 

For the whole week we were there, housekeeping did such a great job!! At one point I guess they forgot to take their tip that we left for them but we were able to get ahold of our cleaner and got to give that to her. She was so sweet! I remember how messy and unorganized I left my makeup in the bathroom, but they took the time to tidy it up and even place it on a nice Vdara mat! Towels were constantly changed, beds made, the room clean by 3pm. 

Even at 7pm when we called them to stop by to clean, they did it quite promptly too!

We reached on a thursday and were excited at how it was to check-in. We reached the room and realized we had to call room service for everything - utensils, flatware, even a hair dryer. It seemed the room was well equipped in case you were there for a bachelor party - but not family friendly. The first day went by fine. By some stroke of bad luck we decided to use the pool the next day. The staff was friendly and it was a  lot of fun. Untill later that afternoon when my little one woke up from him nap and his left eye was encrusted with greenish matter.  We cleaned him up, saw it was reddish and so I instantly used some saline solution to help out the poor lad. 3 hours later, nothing. We put a phone call to our nurses line and awaited a response before further action. (This is important as Vdara guest services claims we didn't seek appropriate medical attention). We put the little one to sleep around 8 (we are awful parents for not seeking medical attention, but hey at least we put him to bed on time!). He woke up that morning with is eye even worse. Being the nice human being I am, I called front desk to inform them about the incident and that they should get their pool checked. With a flight to catch, a rental car to return, food to eat and packing to be done in a matter of 2 hours, the Vdara guest services took at least an hour to dispatch security (it was delayed as my husband had taken my son to get some OTC medicines and possibly catch a glimpse of the lion at MGM) 
The security guy was somber and refused to smile or make us feel - 'better'. He took pictures, had me write the incident and then gave us some saline solution and told us to contact the incident line to check on the status. 
Come Monday I call the line and get a voicemail. Of course.... there are so many incidents that they probably don't have the time to answer. I receive a phone call bright and early from their customer relationships person who doesn't start the conversation by 'let me first apologize' or 'how is your son' but with a very business and professional attitude that said 'we ain't going to give you nothing for your trouble, coz it's not our fault'. Yes of course, it's not your fault because my son who's been in pools around the world in the 2.5 years he's been in this world including places in India, France, Germany - but only contracts an eye infection from a pool in a $250 a night hotel! Yes sir - it our fault that in a matter of hours, there was redness, green discharge and an encrusted shut eye- that caused my precious hours of pain and susceptibility to light. 
So I have to hang up on this individual as I am entering my son's day care center and as awful a parent as I am, I prefer not using my cell phone and giving my child 100% of my attention while dropping him off.  With a promise to call her back I get to work, minding my own business, when around 2:30 this Laura person from CHUBB insurance calls me. Her tone is rude right off the bat. Now I know what it feels like to talk to the collection agency. With no prior knowledge, Ms. CHUBB and the Vdara crew think it's perfectly ok to transfer the case and have her call me on my cell phone during work hours. So I decided to indulge and the ordeal starts. She instantly attacks my parenting skills yet again by asking me whether I took my son to the doctor, and what happened, and fact checking things like 'you mentioned you played the dipping game - what does that mean' and 'what was your son doing in the pool for over an hour' and 'why would you keep a toddler out in the pool for so long'. she then offered to compensated me for the cost of medicines and the medical co-pay and when I said I am not interested in a $50 compensation she was surprised that it all only cost that much (What can I say, tech companies these days offer some great benefits and the time I wasted talking to her was worth well over $50)  It all boiled down to the fact that this individual (who I ended up calling a royal b****) wanted to make it amply clear that their client was not negligent and whatever happened to my son while we stayed there was something I made up, or am over reacting to. 
I have seen better customer service in third world countries than at Vdara. Those staid, unconcerned faces and emotionally devoid voices will continue to haunt me for at least a few more hours, after which I will never return to that hotel.

The suite is upscale,  new and nice with the washer and dryer combo. The housekeeping service was very, very poor. We had to request plates, utensils,  towels, shampoos, every time. It was not automatic that they should replenish these items every day. I had to call them every single day. It was really inconvenient.  Each time you called, you will wait for 30 to 45 minutes. So for the shampoo or towel or even the bathrobe that they forgot to replenish, you call and wait. It was the worst housekeeping service I have experienced.",0,0,0

Thank you Louie with room service for helping me with this scary situation. First and foremost I wasn't told while I'm gone my dogs need to be crated or they will be removed from the room to the pound. I found this out once checking in. So had to totally change plans so they weren't crated more then a few hours. They say the dog park is a private walk from room definitely not its through registration and valet so people everywhere. Also I was supposed to have their dog bowls in the room it took 6 calls and 2 hours. Also if u have a small dog like me (5lbs) they can escape because the fence doesn't go to the ground and it's spaced between each bar. Also forget about sleeping in the drapes don't close 100% these are the cracks between each blind from my bed and they were shut all the way. Way too many other better places definitely won't be back.,0,0,0

Good value (on my stay, anyways).  It does have a resort fee, unfortunately, though to their credit they DO throw in a lot.  Missing some details, though, that prevent 5 stars.


Plusses:
* Very good midtown location (City Center);
* Room spacious, modern and nice.  Includes microkitchen.  NICE bathroom.  Exterior and lobby elegant and contemporary;
* Staff put me near the top floor (nice!);
* Nice views;
* Good value (though I'm mid-week.  Prices go up on the weekends or during major events or conferences, but so does the rest of the strip);
* Very good bed.  This is a biggie for me, I'm very picky about my beds;
* Internet access and fitness center included in the resort fee.  Most hotels have lame gyms, but I must admit this one's pretty good.
* Breakfast and lunch buffets included in the resort fee (though it does have a $20 limit);


Minuses:
* Resort fee;
* NO COFFEE MAKER IN THE ROOM; no coffee mugs, either.  Such a simple thing, even most cheap hotels come with one.  Big miss;


Random:
* Valet-only parking.  Overall I don't mind since work pays for my trip and expenses, but I could see how someone who frequently comes and goes would find that annoying;",1,0,0

Just like some other reviewers on here, my family and I were also conveniently upgraded to their ""Signature Vdara"" corner suite on one of the upper most floors with a 270 degree panoramic view. All that glass truly makes a difference at night time. What I heard is that this hotel was originally intended for primarily time-share and rental usage but the demand was not high enough; Therefore the layout of the suite that we stayed in was more conducive to a more permanent stay.. it just didn't flow very well to me. But boy was everything nice. Fixtures, fabrics, and color scheme were all chosen very well. The bed was insanely comfortable too.

Now, I'm kinda worried about what type of room I would be getting if I went back.. it seems quite a few people were lucky enough to get a free upgrade to a nicer room in order to yield the most positive reviews possible since they just opened. But regardless, I can't imagine the other rooms not living up to the standard.

This is a good alternative to staying at Aria because you don't have to deal with the hoards of people and you can still walk over to Aria or use the connecting walkway to Bellagio and be right in the thick of it. I would highly recommend staying here.",3,0,0

I wanted to try out one of the city center places and, Aria didnt have suites

I have to say, the room was pretty nice.

The reasons I am forced to give such a poor review, which I rarely do...

1) We checked in at around 5PM; 20 minutes later someone opens the door and walks in, didnt even knock.. she comes in and looks at something and said she just wanted to look at the room map or something like that! .. for real? what if I was naked? or worse doing something else? 

2) The place has only valet.. which sounded nice at first, but if you forget something in the car, there is no way to go get it.. and of course you have to go downstairs and wait for your car..
3) No coffee machines in the room? After floating in beer all day\/night till 5Am, last thing I want to do is dress up and walk around looking for coffee when I get up. .
4) So I finally force myself to shower and leave the place; I switch on the ""please clean room"" light and leave for the day.. get back at 4PM.. the room is still not clean.. So i had to call the service desk and ask for someone to clean it.
3) Since the lady was cleaning the roomwe go to the pool.. but when we get there, the pool is closed ! at 410PM!!! are you serious? they closed the pool at 4PM...
And that was the whole reason we booked a room at this place..


4) But the worst of all this is, even though it looks like its right next to the strip, its hard to get to from the strip. Mainly because they dont have directions anywhere , even inside Aria, and since they dont have a casino or any restaurants in Vdara, you are forced to go looking for places.. 

Overall, even though the rooms are super cool, staying here was a very painful experience. I give it only one star, and I will NEVER stay here again.. 

Now I know why I love Venetian !!  cant wait to go back there..",3,1,0

I came to a conference over halloween weekend. The conference itself is off the strip but I decided to stay on the strip and just commute to the conference via uber. There were 9 of us (guys and girls) so we decided to get a suite. The total came out to about 115 dollars per person for 2 nights in the panoramic suite. 

This is one of the best rooms I have had while in Vegas. The panoramic suite has large windows that has a gorgeous view of the strip and the guys and girls were able to stay in our separate rooms but also go in and out of each other's rooms easily through the connecting doors. Both sides have a kitchen and a kitchen table as well as a pull out queen sized couch and a king bed on each side. The bathrooms were super nice as well. It has a separate standing shower as well as a tub. Everything was very clean and comfortable and we didn't hear noises from neighbors. 

The service was incredible. After returning from the second day at the conference, the room service people not only cleaned our entire room but also folded the clothes we left behind, lined our heels against the walls, and just made everything look great. When we called for extra towels and sheets, those came very quickly as well. This was a great Vegas hotel experience and I really enjoyed the Vdara. 

It's also walking distance to cosmo which has marquee and is connected to walking bridges that takes you to many other hotels like PH, Aria etc. It's a nice centralized location. Highly recommended!",1,0,1

The reason for this is... Drumroll please - there is no casino. I am not one to like smoky situations, so VDara is very clean and you are able to easily move around the casino without your clothes smelling like smoke when you're arrive to work. I had a conference there and I love staying at the VDara because if you want to have fun and have that party environment you have Aria, the sister casino-right next-door. If you want to be low-key and simply stay at a nice resort, but VDara is perfect for that. Also, the amenities are nice. The pool is not a hip kind of pool party atmosphere it's more for lounging and relaxing. Also the spa is wonderful. I've gone to use the spa amenities and I've also gotten treatment there. Everything is wonderful. But of course on the pricey side... Because it's Vegas. Also The restaurants and Fitness Center are wonderful as well. If you get the chance to stay in a suite, it's very nice because you have a kitchen and a living room and a huge bathroom, and a wonderful bedroom. If you are staying for more than a few days, it's worth it to stay in a suite. Also, the service is pretty great and everything is affordable. I would have review this as five stars but the first time I stayed up with VDara, the woman checked me and was very rude to my fiancé and I. We didn't mind paying the extra $25 or whatever it was to check in early, but she was extremely rude about it and not helpful. I have a big problem when customer service is not great especially when I'm spending a lot of money. If it wasn't for that horrible experience, this would've been five stars.

Setting: Modern with a very pleasant but mysterious aroma that could calm the most anxious of people. 

Directions: Going north on Las Vegas BLVD from the south end, you'll make a left on harmon and go past the cosmopolitan parking garage.  Once you see a ""Katamari"" canoes of various colors you have reached the front entrance where parking is VALET ONLY NO SELF PARKING.

Service: The gentlemen at the front desk was cordial, professional and a bit pompous which I can't blame him for since Vdara is more of the elitist patron. 

Hotel room: I opt for the room with the bellagio fountain show view and I'd say it was worth it.  The room was furnished with up to date furniture and a couch that folded out into a bed.  The main bedroom had a tv as well as the living room area with the couch, so if your significant other is watching PLL in the bed you can migrate to the couch and watch some top gear.

Bathroom: Standing shower with an area to sit down.  Bathtub was large and with the dim lighting you can set in the bathroom, made for soaking tranquil.

I'm a total fan!

Our stay was very reasonably price, especially when splitting the bill between a few girlfriends.  

The hotel's layout is beautiful, simple, but modern, and luxurious without being over the top.

As we all know; Vegas is known for being ""just a tad"" over the top, so it was nice to see something with a little less fluff, and glitter, and a little more genuine class.

I love how the hotel has multiple elevators; a set which attend to the first few levels, and another set which focus their attention to the higher floors.
I think this really cut's down on foot traffic.

The pool is large and very nice, but seems a little too laid back for my appetite.  A hot or scantily clad bikini wouldn't be a bed thing, I mean just because it's not a beach club, doesn't mean the pool crew should look like retirement central.  No offense to the retired community, one day I'll too be lounging in the sun without a care in the world, and unconcerned about my unshaven legs, but today just isn't that day.  

That being said... if your in your 20's and 30's, I'd seriously encourage you to skip the pool.

Ordering food from the room, was definitely an experience.
10 minutes after room-service closed, we ordered some diner.  Yeah... It was close to 3 or 4 am.  None the less, room-service delivered our meal, within the time frame specified.  As if that weren't enough, my mini burgers arrived on a cute little plate with fries and several mini bottles (2"" high) of condiments.  Adorable!

On the downside:  I just wish room-service could have stopped by at least once without having to be called, during our 3 day stay!

First, do yourself a favor and google ""Vdara"" and ""Rude"" and ""Incompetent"".  

Check out the hundreds of results. When two words like that produce copious results from a search-engine, you know it's not an isolated incident.

EDIT: I originally wrote a vaguely negative review after two days here.  Now that I've been here for four days, I have a much better perspective.  

And the situation is a good deal worse than I originally thought.

Summary:  Anyone who has given Vdara more than a one-star rating is, frankly, someone who has never stayed as a guest elsewhere in Las Vegas. Vdara simply does remotely compare to their competition.   

The hotel is at a five-star level in terms of the quality of the room, fit and construction.

The staff, however, is so abysmal...across the board...across the dining department, the housekeeping department, the front desk...it truly defies explanation.  

Or rather, the explanation is simple:

Ownership is tight on money and they've (under-) staffed the place with inexperienced teenagers.  Literally.

So:  If you have no expectations from a hotel other than a bed, you will be happy.

If you want spotty-internet for a $20\/day resort fee, check right in.

If you don't mind every single employee being either a) rude or b) unknowledgeable, then again, this is the place for you.

Want to sit on-hold for room service for 15 solid minutes on a Tuesday night?  Again, Vdara has you covered.

Want to spent 45 minutes discussing paying for an upgraded room, only to learn after 45 minutes that no rooms are in fact available after all?  Vdara is your place.

Honestly, I don't have the energy to detail too much what is wrong with this place, other than simply saying:  the ownership clearly doesn't care about you.  

Try Aria, Cosmopolitan, MGM, Luxor...hell, even the Imperial Palace or Terrible's Casino is staffed with people who could run circles around the kids at Vdara.  It's embarrassing.  

If you are under 25 and have never stayed at a hotel other than a Motel 6 on the turnpike, then you might like Vdara.

If you have even the tiniest experience in travel for business or leisure, and have even the most limited of alternatives to compare this place to...then you will likely be very, very disappointed.  

Really, unless you are a college student on spring break...this place is just plain embarrassing.",2,3,0

I watched the towers of City Center go up little by little and could not wait to see the finished product. My wait was finally over and I decided to surprise my partner with a romantic getaway, complete with a stay at Vdara. 

From the moment we checked in, Vdara's welcoming atmosphere put me at ease.  Unlike many other hotel\/casino combos, Vdara is strictly a non-gaming, non-smoking facility which was a definite selling point when I was booking our suites. As we pulled up to Vdara, the valet service was very  professional and offered their assistance with bags and pointed us in the direction of the lobby for check-in. The lobby was very modern, and surprisingly simple, definitely not your typical Vegas lobby.  Our check-in was painless and the hotel clerk accommodated our request for an upper floor with a view of the Bellagio fountain show. 
     
As we entered our room, I was very impressed. Our suite included a full kitchen, dining room, living room, king size bed, and a beautiful bathroom with a large soaking tub and shower. The simple and modern feel that we got from the lobby was carried into the suite as well. The large windows offered a panoramic view that spanned from  Mt. Charleston to the Bellagio fountain show and beyond! Day or night, the view was simply breathtaking.  

During our stay, we frequented the pool area.  Admittedly so, I was a bit disappointed by the size of the pool, but I got over it quickly, as it seemed to serve its purpose. The service at the pool was great and we felt very special during our three-hour lounge and dip sessions.  I ordered a virgin strawberry lemonade and my partner ordered Vdara's specialty Black Dragon drink.  The strawberry lemonade was your typical icy, sugary concoction, but it hit the spot.  My partner enjoyed the Black Dragon drink and it ended up being his go-to drink for the remainder of our pool sessions.  We also ordered a club sandwich and onion rings to share.  As we gobbled down every bit of it, we looked at each other, mid-chew, and nodded with wide eyes, confirming that we enjoyed it. The prices for both the food and drinks were common for Vegas, but the taste and portion sizes made it money well-spent.
    
What I loved about Vdara is that even though you're around the stimulating sights and sounds of Vegas, you are in a hotel that is tucked away in City Center, while still having easy access to other major hotels, The Strip, and all the glory they have to offer.  After a day of walking around, you come back to Vdara and your ears, eyes, and lungs take a deep sigh of relief from all of the sounds, bright lights, and smoke that Vegas is known for. For these very reasons, Vdara will be my first choice when visiting Vegas again.",5,3,4

We had a gorgeous view, our bed felt like a cloud, the bathroom was large & amazing. Getting to the strip from Vdara was slightly confusing but not a big deal.

The guys were usually really speedy & nice but the one time we needed our car in a timely manner they took almost 20min to get it to us. People who came to retrieve their cars after us were getting them before us which was pretty frustrating. Overall I would highly recommend.

Their standard room is probably a high level room at any other hotel. The staff go out of their way for you and are super friendly; our room had a view of the freeway (eww) so my bf called the front desk and asked if we could get a better view and we were upgraded (for free) to pool view room on the 42nd floor and that room was bigger than our original. 

For some people it might be a negative but I really enjoyed the no casino aspect of vdara. Its soo nice to just walk right up to the elevators and to your room instead of wandering through an endless sea of machines and rude drunk people to find your room tower\/elevator like at other hotels.

But the reason I'm giving only 3 stars is because the Vdara's location SUCKS! Big time! Its such a hassle getting to it! And since its situated behind Aria its a real pain in the ass to even walk onto the strip. Which is something I did not need coming back from the club in heels at 3AM.",2,2,1

Hotel bell staff was helpful and prompt to assist with bags. Hotel staff was friendly, efficient and well articulated. We couldn't check in too early but was able to check in before check in time. 

We left our luggage with the bell desk and came back at the time as promised.

Checkin process was fairly quick. Bell staff was incredibly helpful to get us a few other things. We didn't request for our room to get serviced while staying (being green). 

Room was clean, modern, and spacious. A little kitchenette with a mini bar and an empty mini ridge was provided. Lots of storage drawers and a large closest. Bathroom was large and had a separate bathtub and shower. Both large. Long bathroom counter. Nice double electric curtains to allow a good blackout shade or full view out the window. Soaps and shampoos offered were better than most hotels offer. 

Elevators to rooms were quick. Bathroom and overall make up of the hotel was sleek and inviting. Hotel security was diligent to insure only hotel guests went to the room. The gym was nicer than most that I have seen in Las Vegas. Equipment was well kept and current. Pool is not open year round but I have read some concerns about.

Concierge desk was open. Helpful mostly. Just a little slow.

Good: friendly staff, mostly quick check in and check out, very quiet, and helpful bell staff.
Bad: nothing much more I can.

Five star experience. I would visit again.",6,0,2

Wow! Vdara really wowed me! First off, I love the smell of the hotel when I first walked in. I love that it didn't smell like cigarettes! Also, I came when there was a live performer in the lobby. He sang current songs on the radio, but was very soothing and mellow. Gave the hotel a great, classy vibe! The room was booked through Priceline.com. Paid for a Studio Suite, but at check-in Vdara was nice to give us a complimentary upgrade to a One-bedroom Corner Suite! SWEET! The room was extremely spacious at 800+ sq. ft. has a king size bed and queen size pullout sofa. It has a separate entertainment area with living and dining room. There was a full size kitchen with four-burner electric top, microwave, and a full size refrigerator! There was an in-suite tablet with access to in-room dining, spa requests, pool hours, and many more functions. I'm not a very techie person, but the buttons were clearly labeled and easy to use to open and closed the window blinds. We got a free promo code up to a $20 Uber ride which was awesome! Great location because it was in walking distance to the Cosmo and Planet Hollywood where I spent most of my time dinning and gambling. The best thing about my stay was the super comfy bed, soft pillows, and clean linens!! I felt very spoiled and relaxed! I'm most likely going to suggest to stay at Vdara the next time I'm in Vegas!

Note:
Valet only $25\/day

Since Palazzo and Encore have hit the scene, I no longer need to stay in ""standard"" 500 sq ft rooms.  I'm all about the suites these days!  I stayed at the Vdara city corner suite to get a full 270 degree view of the Strip with a prime viewing spot of the Bellagio fountain show.  The price was very reasonable.  This is somewhat offset by the fact that the hotel seems a bit ""dead"".  There's no casino, the only restaurant there closes at 8pm and the bar is definitely NOT happening.  However, it's a 5 min walk to Aria, Cosmopolitan and Bellagio and a short cab ride everywhere else.  Best part of the room was probably the huge bathroom which also had an amazing view of the strip.

Pros: No casinos, lovely staff, and the rooms are pretty nice. We had a view where we can see the Bellagio fountains. This is a quiet place where you can relax and sleep in with no drunk people waking you up. The kitchen was nice and I was able to store drinks into the fridge.

Cons: The shower pressure in the bathroom sucks and I didn't enjoy it very much because the water temperature changes from freezing cold to boiling hot water. Getting out of the hotel to walk onto the strip was difficult because we almost got ran over a few times. The shower products are mediocre so I bought my own toiletries.

I don't know how it gets bad reviews. service was on point: bell boys were awesome, elevator attendants that check for your key card (aka workers that took our picture every night) awesome, front desk awesome... everything was great!! 

The hotel is tucked away from the strips main street level so be aware of that. If you cut through aria youll end up at Crystals, don't take the tram bc it just takes too long. Even easier, if you take the elevator outside down to street level you can just cross the street and end up at Cosmo. I don't think many ppl know this hence all the complaints. It really isn't a far walk to anything especially considering that there's no casino to navigate through. The employees were nice enough to let us know tips and tricks! 

The room: the suite was just like an apartment. Washer\/Dryer, filtered water in the fridge, dining area, living space, and really nice bedroom\/2 bath. SOOOO FANCY! Three of us slept in the bed and fit comfortably :). Bathtub is a must. I LOVED it! Everything was clean and stocked. We asked for more towels and they were up in less than 15 mins. oh and also the sink space\/mirror allowed me and all my girls to get ready at the same time. hooorah for that. 

Again: NO CASINO. short walk to Aria so don't let that be a deterrant. vibe is classy and quiet.

The lobby is very small, and there are no casinos which is a good and bad thing depending on the guest. I personally loved the smoke-free air. The pool is beautiful too and easy to access even for non-guests since they don't check your room key.

However the service was quite slow when we requested new towels (they kept taking our extras away so we had to request new ones every day) or extra sheets or kitchen utensils. They are probably limited in staffing since it's not a super large hotel. Otherwise I had a great experience here!",0,0,0

I haven't stayed here yet, but I will update this review once my trip comes up!

I play MyVegasSlots to earn rewards so therefore, I had a redemption code for a $75\/night on weekdays for their deluxe suite room. I tried booking it online and a problem occurred (Monday's price was not dropped down to $75 even though its a weekday!) so I called the hotel reservations and Jason was able to fix the error it occurred. Usually on weekends the room costed $272\/night, but I saw the price lowered on the Mlife website and he was able to drop the price down to $244\/night on weekends for me. Booking it over the phone instead of online saved me almost $100!!!! 

I was on the phone with Jason for over 30 minutes and he never got annoyed with all the questions I bombarded him with. He was extremely patient and answered all the questions I had for him regarding my future stay here.

This hotel is right behind Aria & Bellagio so its right in the middle of the strip. Vdara is also a sister hotel of Aria & MGM. Keep in mind that this is a non-smoking hotel and it does not have a casino inside! Perfect for me, since I dislike the casino smell when you walk into other hotels.",6,3,2

It is also within walking distance to PH Earl of Sandwich which is a big plus in my book. 

The pool is very low-key which I don't recommend going to unless you're actively trying to avoid the pool party scene. Oh they also have free wi-fi and a kitchen. Valet only. Don't forget to check out the beautiful Frank Stella painting behind the front desk and contemporary floral arrangements.

The Vdara also is a non-smoking and non-casino hotel, so we didn't have to worry about walking around with our shirts bunched up at our noses.

I just returned from a trip to Vegas to celebrate my 30th birthday and we stayed at Vdara. After living in Las Vegas, this was my first time ever going as a tourist. So, my opinions may be a little biased.
First, there is a certain ""jump for joy"" moment when you walk into a Vegas resort that does not allow smoking. It means you can take a shower, wash your hair, run downstairs for a snack, and return to your room without smelling like cigarettes. Plus 100 points just for that.
We stayed in the basic deluxe suite, but on the 47th level - which promises amazing views no matter which direction you're facing. 
The room was clean, with modern, yet not too trendy, decor. Warning for you coffee drinkers: there is no coffee machine. There is also no hair dryer, but I brought mine, so I don't care!
The suite comes with a small fridge and minibar, and you can request utensils if you need them. 
The bathroom was big enough and had a tub and shower, but lacked any special decor. Oh, and be careful not to slide down in the bathroom - you'll slice your butt on the drain that sits in the middle of the tub.
The bed was beyond comfortable. I laid in it...alot.
In regards to the pool, it's the perfect place for relaxation. The chairs are squeezed in, but if you get there before 9:30am, you're bound to have any spot you want. The demographic here is mostly over 25, so no young, careless, drunk partygoers to worry about.
We rented a cabana for one day, and the service was great. Each cabana comes with a couch, large TV, ceiling fan, 4 sodas, 4 bottles of water, and a bowl with an apple, orange, snack mix, and water mister. They will charge you a restocking fee if you want any more of the above mentioned stuff...unless you order enough food and drink, which we of course did.
I've seen lots of people complain about how ""far"" the resort is from everything, but I disagree. A short walk through a tunnel will bring you to Bellagio, and Aria is straight across from the lobby. The best part of Vdara's location is the only people coming through the doors of your resort are the people that are staying there!
There are only a couple of cons to this amazing resort:
1) the cafe is only open 6am to 8pm. After that, the only real dining option is room service, which I found to be much more expensive than other hotels. Ex: Two eggs, 1 meat, toast, juice is $25. Then they add $5 for delivery. Then you have to pay a tip. Easily $35. 
2)This is a LEED building. That's good. The water pressure is super low in the shower. That's bad.

I love modern and clean and windows and open space. And this weekend when I came they already had up their christmas decor which I also loved! It made me feel so happy!!!!! :D 

The suite opened up and theres the kitchen area with the microwave, sink, refrigerator and stove. (Lets be real we weren't actually gonna cook ) but the fridge is good for storing alchyyy ;)

If you can time it right, you can find some killer deals, and at other times, not so killer deals. It can get pricey, but the value is exceptional if you can score a deal. The valet at one time was free, bye bye free parking. Unfortunately it seems like this will be the trend in Vegas. Paid parking is the future, and it isn't going anywhere. 

Anyways, if you come to Vegas and enjoy having fun, but also need some time away, Vdara is a safe bet. Just don't soil the reputation and bring your ""party"" scene to this sanctuary.

Note, that it's Valet only-and when we checked out @ 11am Valet was Packed! I timed 26 minutes until we received our Car. Aria Casino is a Short walk 50 yards away!

We originally booked the simplest option, the Deluxe Suite, but when we arrived at the hotel, we were offered an upgrade for only $50 - to a Panoramic Suite! We took the offer and were stunned by the amazing 270 degree views from the 38th floor. It was really beautiful at night!

The suite itself was really nice as well - very spacious! There was a TV in the living room and in the bedroom. The bathroom was amazing, haha. You could admire the view outside while soaking in the tub.

A few complaints though:
- The sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable! You're basically sleeping on springs. Might as well sleep on the sofa cushions on the floor.
- The suite wasn't super clean when we first arrived... There was a fine layer of dust all over the cabinets and tables, and we found a green jellybean next to the bed. Bathrobe had a suspicious stain on it, ehh.
- Even though the suite was supposed to be for 4 people, there weren't any pillows or sheets for the pull-out sofa bed... We called the hotel lobby and someone brought some up for us though.
- The sugar & cream packs weren't replaced the second day. I guess black coffee is okay too...
- Wi-Fi isn't free for hotel guests :\

I love that Vdara is a smoke-free hotel! And also that there is no casino in the hotel, so it's pretty peaceful and relaxing after the hustle-bustle of the Strip. The location is actually pretty nice too; it's only a short walk from Vdara through the Bellagio to the Strip (passing by Jean Philippe Patisserie on the way out, so you can stop by for a pastry or crepe! Yum~)

For a family that prefers trying new Vegas restaurants and watching shows to gambling and drinking all day, the Vdara is a perfect fit.",1,0,0

Could check in at 9 am (which was great because I didn't want to drag my luggage around for 7 hours). 
Incredibly clean. 
Very spacious rooms for the price. 
I personally liked the fact that it was a non-smoking, non-gaming establishment because I could avoid eye\/lung irritation and the high foot traffic when I wanted, and when I wanted to indulge, could conveniently walk to Aria or the Bellagio. 
Love love love the tub (great views and large enough to fit almost any size of individual) 
Good place to bring children (though I'm baffled as to why anyone would bring their children to Vegas in the first place) 

Cons: 
Don't be fooled by the employees' appearances. Just because they are in uniform, they are just as big of swindlers as the guys on the street. My father had reserved the same room as my brother and I, but received a room that was 1\/3 x's smaller than either of ours. They tried to tell me it was a corner suite when clearly we had two other rooms to compare it to...it obviously was not. It took my brother, who is a smooth talker, a few hours to get my dad in the correct room...why do you need a smooth talker to obtain the room you paid for in the first place???!!! Also, we were asked if we wanted coffee delivered to the room on the morning we checked out. When we asked how much it would be to have room service deliver coffee,we were intentionally transferred to room service to give us the exact ""room service"" price, they informed us it was $10 for a small. Ok, well on delivery it ended up being $16 something delivered by a real jerk who snottily asks me if I needed change when I gave him a $20. I said no and he left with a $4 tip without a thank you. 
It takes some time to walk anywhere beyond the Bellagio, Cosmo, or Aria. 
The furniture, though it does look nice, is Ikea-ish and from our experience, the higher up your room is, the more chipped\/beat up the furniture is (probably because they are more frequently occupied). 
No close place to purchase food except at the market which charges an arm and leg for EVERYTHING and the restaurant is closed. 

Note: Some people mentioned they were charged for complementary items. It's part of the resort fee that they inform you of when you check in (+ it's on the website and all the other websites you might have made the reservation with). It includes the water, gym access, and internet. Many hotels do this, it's not unusual. 

Advice: Take advantage of the kitchenettes. Purchase some food to put in the fridge. Something we wished we would have done was place an order with Von's a few days ahead to have them deliver groceries on the day of arrival. This would have saved a ton of $.",4,2,1

The lobby was large, definitely gave off a luxury feel. Check-in was quick, and after inquiring about a late check-out, Alyssa, the front desk employee who assisted us, offered a complimentary 12pm checkout instead of 11, since another guest was booked for that room later in the day. Fine by us!

The room itself was just like the photos on their website - very modern furnishings. We were on Floor 20, and while our view did include Lake Bellagio, it was very off to the  end of the window, but nevertheless nice to look at night - didn't have to crane our necks or anything. I was expecting the view to be like that anyway, since Vdara is off the Strip and behind the Cosmopolitan, which dominates better views of the lake than Vdara.

We ordered room service, which promptly arrived in the estimated time. The server was very courteous and chatted with us as he set the kitchenette table with our meal, which was all elegantly plated. I ordered the Cedar Roasted Salmon with beurre blanc, with sides of polenta and butter-poached baby vegetables (it also came with a bread basket). My partner, who is vegetarian, ordered the Vegetarian pizza and Roasted Pita chips with spinach dip. For dessert we both ordered creme brulee. Everything tasted excellent!

The bed was super comfortable, I slept like a baby. Absolutely heard no noise from other rooms, and only one or two occasional noises from people using the elevator, since our room was right off it. I did want to use the shower in the morning, but didn't because I would've had to blow-dry my hair (which they already offer in the vanity drawer) and forgot my heat-protecting styling serum at home. Toiletries provided were shampoo, conditioner, body wash, facial soap, body lotion, and body soap.

Everything was mostly great, but a few things prevented me from giving this a full 5 stars:

- One of the lampshades was very wobbly - found this out by accident when I bumped into it. Are they supposed to be wobbly? Not sure what happened there, but figured for a luxury hotel it would be more secure.

- Robes only available upon request. 

- The toilet paper rod was also strange. Only one end was attached to the wall by design, and it wasn't secure either, so getting toilet paper meant being careful not to tilt the rod and have the roll fall off it. 

- 4 body towels, 2 hand towels, but only 1 face washcloth. 

- Mini-fridge is MUCH TOO SMALL, roughly half of it is usable space. While our dinner was delicious, there was also a lot of food, so storing it in the fridge overnight required re-plating the food on the saucers to fit. 

- The air conditioning system is very dusty. I noticed dust starting to accumulate on the dark surfaces, and floating in the air. That needs to be looked at.

Overall, though, it was a great stay - would've liked to stay here for an extra night, and hopefully will get to do so in the near future.",1,0,0

With view of the front of the strip in the living room, views of the mountains in the bedroom, and views of the bellagio fountains from the bathroom\/soaking tub whats not to love? 

If you can deal with not having a casino then really give this hotel a shot. It is directly connected to the Bellagio and a short walking distance to Aria. A plus side is that the Market Cafe is now open later hours as compared to before. So if you really are thirsty or desire a snack you can get one at 11PM. Also, the pool is a bit smaller than Aria's so be prepared for it to be crowded unless you go early in the morning or evening. They have umbrellas up for use as shade for all chairs so its much appreciated in the hot 100 degree heat. Valet is also pretty efficient. I like being able to just take the elevator down to the lobby and walk up right to valet, rather than walking a mile through a casino to get to valet.

First impressions: beautiful lobby; front-desk girl was flawless. The rest of our hotel experience? God-awful; The Vdara should be embarrassed and ashamed.

They act like being ""eco-friendly"" is a perk. 

--There's no water pressure so it took me a half hour to shower. 
--The maids do not service the rooms.

Boom. That's the definition of eco-friendly.

The hotel maids DID, however, STEAL my cute club clothes hanging in the closet; Lost and Found obviously said they don't have them.

Having a choice between 2 queens or a king is standard in most hotels; Not the Vdara. U get one king unless u pay double the price.

...Did I mention there's no coffee maker? Cuz there's not one ... Imagine that. A 5-Star ""resort"" with no coffee maker. That's a basic amenity, folks.

I had never stepped foot inside the Las vegas City Center since it's completion in 2009 even though I visit the city\/Strip three times a year.

This is a nice hotel for many of the reasons a myriad of other posters have noted (clean, non-smoking, non-gaming, quiet, nice rooms).  

I stayed in the City Corner Suite which has 1 King, a pull out sofa bed, separate shower and bathtub, kitchenette (with stovetop, fridge, microwave), dining table, two flatscreens, and a washer and dryer unit.

The fridge\/freezer has an ice maker, so if you like to relax and get plastered before or after you donate multiple hundreds to the local economy, it's a nice, convenient perk.

The negative regarding the room is that you apparently need to bring all of your own connections to whatever entertainment devices you would like to use, if need be.  I'm assuming the hotel probably has USB cables and audio\/video chords if you ask, but it's odd in this day and age that there isn't some sort of audio-steroe-DVD player in the actual room.  I had my ipod and the girl at the desk told me there was a cable to connect it to the TV in the work desk, but I couldn't tell you where the actual connection was as I looked for a solid 15 minutes (and this was well prior to being plastered).

They also give you a couple Keurig coffee's, but I didn't have a coffee maker in the room.  Again, I'm sure you can get one if you ask.

There are two coffee cups and some random cocktail glasses supplied in the room, but no pots, pans, plates, utensils.

That's just nitpicking there and none of the above comments bothered me at all because, again, it's a nice room, the bed's comfortable and it has a unique layout.

As far as the 'convenience' of the hotel, I find some of the reviews laughable where people say it's off the beaten path and it's confusing to get in and out of.  My guess is that, if you're driving there, it could be a bit challenging, but you just have to take a ramp where the arrows point up to the two hotels (Vdara and Aria).

If you're walking around (like most human beings do who visit this city), you're 8-10 minutes from the Strip if you walk through either the Bellagio or The Cosmopolitan.  The Bellagio is literally connected to Vdara while you have to walk outside, down a flight of stairs and across one lane of traffic to get to The Cosmopolitan.  There's also a tram that's in between the Bellagio and Vdara, but I'm not sure where the hell it goes to.  I think it goes as far south as Monte Carlo, but not positive.

You can reach the southern end of the Strip by walking outside and through the Aria, which is a three minute walk away.  I'd say it will take you twenty minutes to walk from the Vdara Lobby to, say, the NYNY (which I did three times).  So it's really no big deal at all unless you're extremely high maintenance (sorry fellow reviewers).

If you're looking for a change of pace from the regular Strip scene (as I was), give this place a shot.  You could do much, much worse and I thought the $ for the rom type was a very good bargain.",7,0,0

What makes this a superb hotel, at least for me, is that it is a non-smoking and a non-casino hotel. The peace and quiet is a stark contrast to the chaos going on next door - and if you are in the mood for gambling or chaos the Bellagio is a mere 3 minute walk away. 

The rooms are quite large (about 600sf.) and very well appointed, they feature a small kitchen with stovetop and sink (albeit without any pots, pans, silverware or dishes - so not sure what the intent was here), the living room has a small two-person dinner table and a nice living area. The bathroom is larger than most hotels and has a large deep tub in addition to a separate shower. The room itself could be compared to a high rise luxury efficiency - one could stay here long term without ever getting the feeling of being in a hotel.

Breakfast, lunch and dinner can be had at the Market Cafe (a combination of a bistro and convenience store) on the lobby level. The Market Cafe serves a great breakfast and makes some mean sandwiches and desserts. The convenience section has a fair selection of foods and drinks to get you by in a pinch including a limited selection of Dean and Deluca goodies.   

The Pool area located just above the lobby area in the front of the hotel is very nice and has 3-4 pools scattered around. However, as with most hotels in Vegas it is oversaturated with chaise lounges and is more reminiscent of a cruise ship than a hotel. So get there early if you are planning to get a tan.

It seemed to take too long to check in, even though I had confirmed my registration in advance. The clerk insisted on being presented with the same credit card, which I used to preregister. What is the difference? If  another credit card clears,what difference does it make?

I did not like that we were were separated from our luggage; instead of it being sent to the room with us, simultaneously, as there were bellhops available. The valets knew to rush over to our taxi, and  take our luggage when we came out of our taxi. However, I didn't like the fact, that the hotel would not let the taxi driver pull to the extreme right side of the road, adjacent to the hotel. Instead, he had to stop in the middle of the road, and discharge us. It was dangerous to have done so, as my wife uses a wheel transport  chair, and the valet made no effort to make sure  that she was safe, (as there was cross traffic), while I was checking the taxi for luggage, which the driver forgot to bring out. Basically, those so-called valets are just like sharks who circle swimmers, as they can't wait to get their next tip.

As  we were going to the elevators, the hotel clerk told us that the telephones were not working, but would be fixed by the morning. In fact, for our entire four night stay, the telephones did not work. I had to use my cell phone several times to contact the main desk.

The  rug in our room (47-008), was old, and worn, and should have been replaced. Incidentally, the first night that I was there on Nov. 5th, it was difficult if not impossible to sleep, as I heard a car continuously racing around the block, with a loud grating noise. The hotel staff never told us that a racing commercial was being filmed. They could have located our room on the other side of the hotel, away from the area, where the noise was coming from.

There was something wrong with the tv remote control (it may have needed a new battery), as it was difficult to get the tv to come on.

There were no hooks on the bathroom door, to hang up pajamas, or towels. Also, the main clothes closet was not that wide, and there was wasted space on the side.

The so-called cafeteria for breakfast, was one big rip-off. We were charged $58.00 for french toast, eggs, and some blueberry muffins, which tasted terrible. At least, when I stayed in a hotel, in New York City, the breakfast was included. I didn't like the attitude of the hostess, as she tried to tell us where to sit, and didn't like when I told her where I preferred to sit. Also, the waitress seemed to rush us, with our selection. Even when I came back, or ordered food to go for breakfast, it was still expensive.

Incidentally, the V'dara rips guests off pertaining to the drinks (non-alcoholic), in the refrigerator, (orange juice, diet coke, etc.), as well as various snacks, such as Snickers, M & M's, Pringle's Potato snacks. When I asked the person who replenished the snacks how much they were, she told me to see the prices on the tablet in the room. I was shocked when I noted that the prices for those snacks ranged from $7-$8.00, each.  

The V'dara is not in a convenient location. There are other non-smoking hotels, which are closer to the Strip. Incidentally, although the hotel is non-smoking inside, I still had  to walk through cigarette smoke outside,  as the hotel makes no effort, to control smokers outside, who are still on hotel property.

Last, there were no instructions on how to control the heating, fan, and air-conditioning. It took me several nights to figure out how to correctly use those controls. It was either too hot or too cold in the room.

Regarding the plus sides of the V'dara, the elevator service was excellent, as we did not have to wait that long for an elevator. However, there were inconsiderate guests who insisted upon piling in an elevator, and crowd the other occupants, since they were too lazy to wait for the next elevator. In one case, I saw a bellhop racing by us with a luggage cart, and go in an elevator with some  guests. Since I knew that it would be very crowded to squeeze in, I waited patiently for the next one. However, that arrogant and rude bellhop yelled out  in a nasty tone  ""GOING UP"". I shouted back that I would wait for the next elevator.

The workout room was very nice, with very nice treadmills, etc; the pool area was also very nice. However, I was not impressed that the so-called Manager of the hotel never sent me a follow-up response, after I voiced similar concerns on the V'dara's own internal survey. In New York City, when we stayed at a hotel, their staff contacted us by e-mail, after I critiqued that hotel.

In summary, on our next trip to Vegas, we will definitely not stay at the V'dara, even if it was for free!",0,3,0

There is no self parking and I went around 2 before  I gave in to Valet Parking. I then asked for my room but since they didn't have any suite in the category I had paid for I was upgraded to a business or an executive corner suite. I was delighted at this point thinking I had made the right choice. The room however was a disaster. Many of the door knobs would just drop off. The windows were so dirty that the view was of no use. We had to drop the curtains so it wouldn't look dirty. The curtain dropping mechanisms were pretty cool though. There were different settings and switches to move them up and down. That was the highlight of the stay. We went in to the bathroom only to find the bathtub downright dirty. There was a sticky substance all over it. That was not the worst of it. One of the beds had a bedbug crawling over the pillow. When we notified the management, all they said was - we have logged an issue. Thank you for reporting it. Well. Thanks is all well and good but they did not even offer to change the room. I am  not going back again - ever. Expected more from MGM resorts.",0,0,0

Firstly, there is no casino downstairs.  That actually turned out to be a good thing since it wasn't loud, smokey or teeming with bleary eyed drunks and\/or people losing money.  On the contrary, it was quite classy and relaxed inside.

Secondly, the room itself was pretty sweet.  Small kitchenette, 2 large flat screen TVs, SUPER comfy bed, ginormous nice bathroom with separate shower and bathtub.

The amenities were okay.  The gym was pretty nice with lots of complimentary things such as headphones, unlimited waters, towels, etc.  There were a handful of cardio machines, some weight machines, etc.  The pool and area was so-so, but that was alright.  

There is a walkway from the hotel lobby to Bellagio, which is a bit of a walk, but no more than 5 minutes.  You can also access Aria right across the street, but it was a bit frustrating since you have to walk around a circle outside (we all wondered why there wasn't an above ground or underground direct walkway).  

The only thing that was kind of annoying was that there was an awfully strange smell by the entrance of our room, like stinky feet (and no, it wasn't from us).  We were hardly in our room enough during our trip to bother mentioning to the front desk, so I'm not going to make a big deal out of it.

All in all, it is a very nice, modern, clean hotel situated only 5 minutes from all the action of the strip.  It's a great reprieve from the sometimes gaudy, sketchy, smokey environment that you get from other hotel casinos.  Would definitely recommend it to anyone and I would stay again next time I'm in town.",0,0,1

The experience was ok UNTIL - I got charged random charges that they did not explain and when I called to get an explanation I was met by their front desk rep named AUDREY (or AUDRIE) she was short and rude from the beginning. Then she became even more rude when her explanation of the unlawful and unwarranted charges ended up confusing my fiancé and I even more than we already were by her. When I tried to clarify with her and go over WHY they charged an additional $189.65 (which I think we can all agree is cause for concern considering there was no reason for it and the amount was pretty specific) she interrupted me while I was ALREADY speaking and tried to talk over me. When I didn't let her talk over me- she finally kept quiet so I could finish what I was saying. I made sure to pet her know I was done asking my question by ending it with a simple ""please explain"" and she sat in silence for a rude 10 seconds before she began with a completely snotty and self-righteous ""ARE YOU DONE?""  
I couldn't believe how terrible her customer service skills were in its entirety. I could not understand how this girl has a job working the front desk where she has interactions with guests all day!!!! She needs to be fired and\/or retrained severely. Or she needs to get a job where she doesn't have to deal with people since she clearly cannot handle it diplomatically and kindly. I am calling the manager as well- to make an official complaint as well. 

After being rude in her half ass confusing non-explanation - she ended with saying what should've been said in the beginning. That the additional charges will be dropped and refunded. 

On another note- the Vdara has NO right to just go ahead and place significant charges to your account (in addition to payments that you already made for the room and the deposit) without telling you why or at least letting the guest be aware of what the charges are for. 
Also, the valet scratched my new vehicle while in its possession. There were no scratches on it when we gave it to them and in the morning we noticed there was a significantly noticeable set of scratches on the front bumper with red paint which means they hit another car that was obviously red. 

Honestly I  would've given it 1 star but I kindly gave it two because the room itself was decent. 
Overall- I would highly recommend staying somewhere else. There are plenty of amazing other hotels (as I go to Vegas quite often) to stay at with rooms just as nice if not nicer- where you will have a better experience from valet, to front desk. 

AUDREY- you are a terrible representative and Vdara would be justified and would benefit greatly from letting you go. If you do not like to deal with people you should not be in customer service.

Besides that, the service was great!  The best part about the Vdara and the surrounding casinos in the area is its location!  Sandwiched right in the middle of the strip, you have everything you want (two malls, casinos, nightlife, etc) and still retreat to the hotel after you've had your fill and need to replenish your strength (2hr naps suffice) to start the madness all over again.

Valet staff is dope, bell services were dope, housekeeping was dope, room service food was delicious, but we just had an issue with the front desk with our keys.  My brother ended his night early at 2am on one night, and he had to wait an hour downstairs to get back into our room.  Our second issue with front desk was when we were looking for a lost item in the room. We were asked to wait in the lobby while they made the necessary phone call to security to check, the male at the desk never got back to us on our query, even when there no longer were lines of people who needed servicing.  When I had gone back up to the desk and asked the lady working next to him to please follow up, she got us our help in less than 5 minutes.  All this while the first worker was listening, he didn't even bother to acknowledge that he helped me previously.

The panoramic suite that we had was awesome!  I wish it was my apartment, just not in Vegas, if that was the case, I'd probably be in a lot of trouble every weekend, hopefully not every night.  The one other thing I did not like was that the pool was unavailable due to construction the weekend we were there, we should have had some of the hotel fees reflect that.

The convention that I went to Vegas for was next door at the Bellagio.  I had stayed in the Bellagio for the same convention a couple of years ago and was stuck in some faraway wing that I think was further than walking across the connector from Vdara to the Convention area at the Bellagio.  It was actually a joy to NOT be staying in a smoke-filled, noisy casino.  I could walk a few minutes and go to Bellagio, Aria, Cosmo if I wanted that scene or just chill in the calm, quiet, fresh and cool room with a view at the Vdara.   It was cheaper, too!  While my friends were all waiting in a huge line at Bellagio to get a ride to the airport, I was able to just walk outside the Vdara and immediately jump into a cab.  Oh, beware... the cab drivers are often crooks... It shouldn't cost much more than $20 to get to the airport.  I told the guy I knew the best way so don't mess around and it cost me $15 with no traffic.  

Loved the completeness of their housekeeping crew.  Wow!  My room was put back together and then some so that when I returned from a day out, I was welcomed by a fresh room, with all the tiny details put back into place... they wrap the dryer cord around the handle and put it back in the drawer, straighten out any magazines you've looked at, put any cosmetics you have lying about haphazardly all in a row on a small towel on the counter, hang up stuff in the bathroom (I had a shower cap and nightshirt thrown on the tub), line up my extra shoes that I had all over the room, etc.  

The bathtub was fabulous.  I read a book and had a glass of wine (large ledge around tub) in there one night.  So huge, the water runs fast so fills up in no time, and is hot so you can keep the temperature where you want it very easily.  There are dimmer switches on many of the lights in the room.  The shades and blinds are on switches by the door.  

Very ""green"" hotel.  Turn-down service- I only had twice but was surprised that they freshened up the room, gave me two new bottles of water along with a glass on each nightstand, put down a little mat next to the bed on both sides with slippers on it, left a sweet treat, and put away the decorative cover and pillow on the bed.  Quite a surprise.  

The only bummer things were that I couldn't find a plug near the bed to charge my phone, which is what I use as an alarm clock.  Poolside food service was slow, slow, slow.  I couldn't believe how bad they were!  I actually couldn't stand waiting any longer so got up and had them box my lunch ""to go"" when it finally came out.

I booked the ""Vdara Suite"" (800 sq ft vs the 500 sq ft of the regular deluxe room) in February for Memorial Day Weekend (yes..3 freakin months in advance), knowing prices were going to go ridiculously high as MDW got closer. Once arriving on Saturday, after waiting in a ridiculously long and slow moving line in the lobby, I checked-in thinking everything was a-ok. Too bad once I arrived to the room, I was shocked by how small it was. Um...this definitely CANNOT be a suite--one, it only had 1 bathroom, no separate kitchen, and everything was much more cramped than what I remembered in the pictures online. I called the front desk to see if there was a mistake and of course, they put us in the wrong room. 

So giving them the benefit of the doubt and knowing MDW is one of Vegas' busiest weekends, I figured it was a small mistake and they could move us to our actual room quickly. Too bad they end up telling us because it is MDW, they completely sold out of rooms and OVERBOOKED so they had no choice but to DOWNGRADE us into a smaller room. Apparently, hotwire or expedia sold more Vdara rooms than they had available, so in order to accommodate those rooms, they kicked a few of us who  actually BOOKED ON VDARA'S WEBSITE into their regular rooms. 

To compensate for this ""mistake"" they did offer us $100 room service credit and $60 off our two-night stay (which wasn't much of a discount considering we booked it 3 months ahead--so our room was already cheap to begin with and they were going off the current-day rates) but ONLY after we complained and made them realize they put us in the wrong room. To think they weren't even going to tell us they managed to downgrade our reservation, until we walked in and realized something was off about our initial room, is ridiculous.

I don't hold Vdara accountable because the staff took care of the situation very quickly.  Just know that I'm NEVER a fan of bringing any child of any age to Vegas.  Unless you are 21, stay away!!!  The long line moved pretty quickly and we got to the check-in counter around 4ish and were told our room wasn't ready.  WTF?! We had early dinner plans!

I love that there's no casino and thus no smoking, so it actually smells good when you enter. It's much less crazy, and a nice, relaxing retreat from the party of Vegas, yet it's only steps away from it when you want to resume the insanity. It's really the best of both worlds. I love that it's free valet and that you don't have to walk a half hour through a self park garage, through a casino, to get to the reception desk. We had a painless check-in, were given a great room on the 40th floor with awesome views, including the water shows at the Bellagio next door.

The rooms themselves are great. They are spacious, modern, and clean. There was a living room, kitchenette, bedroom, and large bathroom. We didn't use the kitchenette at all, though I guess maybe it would be nice if someone was staying for an extended period of time. It almost seemed unnecessary in Vegas, though. It would probably be helpful for families with babies or small kids. Anyway...the room was great. One thing I thought was odd for a 5-star hotel, was that there were no robes in the room. Not a big deal, but it's something I'd expect from a hotel like this.

The only real negative of the weekend was on Saturday we realized we forgot an important toiletry item and called down to ask if it could be brought up to us. Sure, no problem. We waited for 20 minutes and then called again. They said it would be right up. We waited another 20 minutes - nothing. Finally, we gave up and had to run out to CVS. This was pretty frustrating, again for a 5-star hotel. For this kind of place you would expect much better customer service (ie: not waiting 20 minutes for an item you request, and if they do make an error and need to be called a second time, at that point make sure that the item gets there). This left a bad taste in our mouth. Even when we went out for the night and came back, we were half expecting the item to be in our room when we got there, since we were assured twice it was ""on its way,"" but there was no sign of it. We also had a slightly longer wait than what I would think is normal for our car from the valet when we checked out on Sunday. They don't have the kind of valet where you can call down for your car so it's waiting when you get down there...you have to go down yourself and show the ticket. 

Overall, we really loved how new and clean this hotel was, and how comfortable our room was. That being said, what would have been an excellent stay was put off by the poor customer service. I would consider staying here again if I got a good deal, but I'd be extra sure to bring EVERYTHING I needed because you can't rely on them to bring anything to your room, no matter how long you wait or how many times you call.",4,2,3

I loved the fact that it was a non-smoking property.  I managed to find a deal so the room came out to about $145\/night the last week of December.  

For hotel guests, valet parking is your only option.  But it's free, so it's not a big deal - just make sure you tip the staff.  The valet staff were quick and friendly.  

As other reviewers have said, it's a condo so included is a small kitchenette w\/ a microwave, stove top, sink, fridge, and mini-bar.  You need to call housekeeping to request plates & pots though.  They are a green property so they don't have it available unless it's requested.  This is why they get 4 stars instead of 5.  I made a request but they never delivered it.  I ended up having to toss my leftovers as I did not want to bother with it anymore.

The best part of the room was the soaking bath tub!  I took a bath every night I was there and loved it!  (TIP:  go visit Basin White at the Grand Canal Shoppes and buy a couple bath bombs.)  The bed was super comfy and the shades were nice.  My only other complaint is that there were gaps between the black out shades so that was kinda annoying in the morning.  Other than that, we really enjoyed the room.

There is a walkway that connects Vdara directly to Bellagio so that was very convenient.  You end up being around Jean Phillipe Patisserie so make sure to grab a cute little pastry to eat!

Vdara definitely impressed me so I would stay here again!",3,0,2

First off there is NO CASINO in this hotel so therefore, no nasty smoke smell!! They also have a HUGE gym fully equipped with leg, arm, back machines, free weights, ellipticals, treadmills, and bikes! It closes at 8PM but that's ok because it was hardly ever busy when I went during the late afternoon hours! (2-4PM)

Our room was AMAZING! We didn't opt for the suit but just had a standard deluxe room that came with a mini kitchenette with available refrigerator and stove, king sized bed, huge and GORGEOUS bathroom, nice view of the strip, and a huge couch! 

I literally didn't want to leave this hotel and could picture myself living here foreverrr!! Hehe :) Hotel staff was extremely friendly and even let us check out late (12PM versus 11AM) for FREE!! There are also a lot of small snack stores downstairs with healthy foods and, of course, a Starbucks! 

There's a FREE tram that takes you to Mirage and Aria and Vdara is conveniently connected to Bellagio which is connected to Caesar's Palace.. So you won't have to do a lot of outside walking that deathly Vegas heat!!!  

Overall, A MUST STAY while in Vegas!!!!! Loved it here!!!!",15,3,7

When you're going to Vegas you're hardly going for a cushy bed and a relaxing spa experience. You're pretty much going to test the limits of your liver (in public) and return home with empty pockets. In that respect the Vdara is everything - and more - that you might need from a hotel.

I'm writing this review imagining my hotel needs from a more regular sort of vacation. The Vdara is relatively new and right off the strip, the sister hotel to the more well known Aria. The location is right in the middle of the action, and most large spots are walking distance; the Bellagio is connected in a back passageway. The facilities are clean and modern, and the gym is the best I've seen in a hotel. Iced towels, personal water bottles, any machine you might need, leather seats embroidered with ""The Vdara.""

As for the room, we stayed in a suite. The bed is up to par but the roll it sofa bed is seriously thin and wiry. If you have the misfortune to draw that straw, be sure to call room service and request a mattress pad (or two). The suite comes with a bathroom and a half, with the half bath having no towel rack. How are you supposed to dry your hands? Neither bathroom has a fan. The shower pressure is weak and the hotel shampoo\/conditioner isn't great. Any girl should BYO. It seemed like a strange mix of luxury and flaws, since the suite had all the aforementioned issues while having a fancy Keurig coffee maker, a stove and a jumbo refrigerator complete with ice maker. Not sure how much use you'd get out of that in Vegas, but there you go. Overall the hotel is nice but could use some more thought invested in the utility of their setup.",5,1,0

our corner suite was spacious and was about $200-$250 a night. There was 1 bed room, 1 1\/2 bathrooms, 1 kitchen, 1 living & room. There no smoking inside the hotel so it smells wonderful!

i loved the full bathroom! it had a shower, bathtub, 2 sinks, and a huge mirror. the shower was all glass so you had the view of the city lights while showering!

wifi was free but the Ethernet cord is much faster!

the other thing I liked was that there were 2 elevators. one for bottom half of floors and the other for the top half. convenient!

What I love most about this room is that it is still on the strip, but pushed back a bit which takes you away from all the chaos.  Also this is a non-smoking hotel with no casino.  LOVE THAT!

It is valet-only, but is complimentary.  I did tip them, but at the end of my stay.  The longest you'll wait for your car is about 10 minutes, but I'd say the longest I've ever had to wait even during checkout was 5 minutes.

****PROS:
- Location: Middle of the strip, Bellagio is literally attached to the building. 

- No casino\/smoking (Not sure if this is pro\/con? I don't care either way)

- Door bell to your room! haha

- BEAUTIFUL room. (Deluxe Suite) The whole setup is gorgeous. Walk in from the door with a kitchen, dining table, living room\/bed which is split between a wall with two TV's on each side. There's a window that stretches from each end of the room. The bathroom has a HUGE tub with a shower head AND a separate shower. With GREAT lighting. Also, the bathroom has a magnified mirror for all you beautiful ladies! A blow dryer, cotton, q-tips, wonderful smelling shampoo\/conditioner\/bodywash

- SO MUCH sink space

- Ice machine on every floor

- Friendly staff!

- A safe that is EASY to operate (you know some places are difficult)

- Electric curtains, let's get fancy (which blocked out light pretty well)

- Reading light above bed

- Room service ALWAYS came within reason

- Touch-sensored housekeeping\/do not disturb sign

- Lighting had dimmers

- 35% discount on Zarkana through Vdara



****CONS:
- The bathroom right beside the bedroom?

- NO DISHES? You must call them to bring it up, didn't wait long - but still annoying. Their excuse is they're a ""green"" hotel.

- Fridge is TINY. Cannot even fit doggy bags.

- If you're cheap like me, DO NOT OPEN THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FRIDGE. EVERYTHING IN THERE IS WEIGHED, did you catch that?! EVERYTHING IS WEIGHED, YOU MOVE IT, YOU PAY. I found that out the hard way. And TOLD them to ERASE my charge. Also, I had a water bottle missing, which I told them as well, so you may want to look and see if everything is there. 

- Water pressure in the bathroom sink?

- Bed was SO uncomfortable and the sheets suck - Bad combination, I was freezing my entire sleep.

- Drawer space?? 3 drawers, and a few tiny shelves. Ridiculous.

- Their complimentary waters, I thank you for the miniature bottles that held nothing in it.

- NO coffee maker, but there's coffee mugs..... Ok.

- EXPENSIVE! And for what. This hotel is not that great. Just because they love the earth doesn't mean they should over charge. They love what's in our wallets too.

- Resort fee, see told you they love our money.


Will I stay here again? No absolutely not. It was a nice hotel and all, but if it wasn't for the conference I attended here, you would have never seen me pay that kind of money. Nope. Vdara got lucky.",5,1,0

However, we booked this room to primarily use their pool and jacuzzi, which is part of a $44+ facilities charge. We accepted this fee however we did not know that the pool and jacuzzi would close at 5 pm that night. When we called the hotel around 2 pm that day, the representative did not even mention their early closing hours either. Had we known they would close the facilities so soon, we would have moved on to another place to stay. 

When I went to complain to management, the hotel manager I spoke to looked at me with a condescending Cheshire cat grin (he said he gets a lot of complaints about this fee and it showed) and said that this fee was mandatory for each guest and he could not refund us the resort fee because then it would not be fair to the other guests. I understand that in theory but it's up to other people to complain about this fee if they're upset. This was our problem so we complained. He said he could not reimburse us the resort fee even though there was no open resort to use. He also claimed they notified Hotel Tonight to update their app to include the resort hours. Hotel Tonight responded by saying that they always update new information. I believe Hotel Tonight as we've used this app many times before and have never run into this kind of problem. I think Vdara just never communicated these new rules to them.

It seems odd to me that a respected hotel would close their public-access resort at 5 PM on weekdays. The hotel manager claimed there was not enough staff to manage the resort but when I looked around, there were many people working (even concierge staff to greet and guide guests at the elevators). This is a huge hotel run by MGM, it's hard for me to believe that they had problems filling such positions. Once again, a huge hotel company collects ""resort fees"" from people who aren't even allowed to use it. 

This resort fee also includes wifi, which didn't work well. So we basically got nothing for this fee. 

I have no complaints about the rooms or building. It's a very nice hotel for people like us who don't want to stay in a hotel with casinos and allows smoking. If you're ok with paying close to $50 for a mandatory resort fee and not be able to use it, then that's your own decision. We were not happy with this as there was no resort to use. We should have been told, the 9-5 PM resort hours are ridiculous and this is another way for big hotels in Vegas to collect easy fees that they know people will pay  to stay in Vegas.",2,0,0

The downside, there is nothing to do here. Only some bar and restaurant, but even then it's quite dead at these places. At least it's a walk away from Bellagio or Aria which contains the casino and is smack right in the middle of the strip. I went on a Monday night and it was $130. I wonder how much it is on the weekends.

This hotel is a breath of fresh air in the midst of a hazy cloud of cigarette smoke that is Las Vegas. This city is one of my favorites but is absolutely out of control with second hand smoke. It gets in the air ducts and is sent all throughout the hotels and casino floors. Being a smokeless hotel, Vdara acts as a sanctuary for those who don't smoke, or want to leave the smoking to outside. 

We had a few issues with the room within our first night at the hotel. Phone didn't work, and the microwave oven wasn't working. But, there customer service was top notch and they got us into another room very quickly, with bell service to assist with the transfer. The second room was problem free, and spotless.

Upon arriving we had to go back downstairs to switch rooms because our original room had white stains all over the couch. The room we got next was missing one of its lamps. The lighting in general was too dim (I want my room bright if I need it to be). The shower had soap suds all over, making me wonder if they ever cleaned it. Our fridge was also not working (the side that we needed to use - the $$$ snacks side worked just fine). We requested the front desk to make sure we didn't get charged for swapping the snacks into the non-working half of the fridge so we could store our food in the working half, yet they still managed to stick the charge in there (good thing I checked before leaving). Finally, the valet took 30 minutes to find our car. No idea what happened there, but it kind of summarized our stay at Vdara in general.

Pros:
- New (exterior is nice)
- Non-smoking (no stink)
- No casino (less mayhem \/ lines downstairs)
- Decent view of the Bellagio fountains (had to upgrade one level to get this)
- Located in the center to the strip
- Really close to two major casinos (Cosmo and Aria)

Cons:
- More expensive than other non-casino options on the strip
- Rooms' maintenance seem to be somewhat neglected by the staff
- Pool & jacuzzi close at 5PM

- don't gamble
- like a quiet night after a day of events
- like to avoid crowds and hustle & bustle
- don't smoke

Basically, this place fit our needs. While the hotel offerings are slim compared to the giants on the strip, its proximity to Bellagio, Aria and the City Center tram makes it accessible. For some it might feel out of the way. We saw Vdara as an escape from the craziness of the Vegas scene. We found all of the staff to be helpful, kind and courteous.

Room: We had the executive corner suite and it gave us amazing views in every room. We were able to get a good package deal on Expedia. The flaws were truly minor: a whistling sound from under the door, a dryer that was fussy (but, come on - we had a washer and dryer in our suite!). Overall, the room was pleasantly quiet, bed was comfy, the 2 TVs worked great.  The cleaning staff did a phenomenal job and even went beyond your typical housekeeping work (winding charger cords, placing a towel under our toiletries, etc). We pretty much loved our experience with our Vdara suite.

Spa: Small, but enjoyably so. Again, the courteous staff made the experience lovely. The cost for day use seemed very reasonable for the use we made of it.

Massage: We had the couples massage. I got the deep tissue and my partner got the hot stone. Our massage therapists were very good at their jobs and we were very pleased.

Bar: Excellent cocktails in a relaxed environment.

Market Cafe: Our go-to for a snack or breakfast. Great quality food. Unfortunately, service was lacking in comparison to the rest of the hotel. Though, it might have more to do with the maturity of some of the workers. Also, at one point, three of our credit cards wouldn't compute. But it was a system error, not our cards.

Location\/Transportation: Very easy to get a taxi out front. Very close to the Bellagio\/City Center tram which can drop you off at the Monte Carlo. From there you can cross the street to the Las Vegas Monorail at the MGM Grand. Or from the Crystals stop, you can get to the Blvd for walking or a bus.",0,0,0

One thing I don't miss is the smoke that permeate throughout casino to the hotel reception through to even the non-smoking rooms and the burnt holes in the carpets and sheets. This hotel lobby actually smells nice, like a spa. No lineups at the checkin counter so first impressions great.
To my room, I got the cheapest Deluxe room facing the pool and the colorful art by Nancy Rubins I think. so I have no view of the Bellagio fountain but it's not a horrible view either so I'm happy. Room was close to 600 sq feet (huge). Bed linens were good quality (no cigarette burnt holes, phew), bed itself was a little on the soft side. we have fully stocked minibar, two-burner electric cook top, convection microwave, 42-inch Digital LCD flat-screen television in living and bedroom areas and a laptop-size electronic safe. The automatic roman blinds took maybe a minute to understand how to control (as mentioned by many others the gaps will let the sun permeate into the room so bring your sleeping masks) The thing I had trouble with are the light switches, simply put they are weird. 

Bathroom...wonderful. I love coming back to have a quick soak (nice size bathtub), separate showers. No Aveda products as mentioned, they now have cheap bath products. 

You have to ask house keeping if you need robes, slippers or any utensils for the kitchen. Housekeeping crew left a bad impression on the first day they threw away the conditioner I brought (I left it in the shower). 2nd day they took all our glasses and never replaced them. 3rd day they did not give us our 2 bottles of water included in the resort fee.

Wireless internet worked fine, good reception in our rooms.

If you don't like Valet parking your options would be to park @ Bellagio self park and walk 5 minutes back to the hotel or park @ Cosmopolitan and walk up to Vdara. I think Bellagio is a better option. Quickest way to the strip is if you go through the doors besides Silks, take the stairs down and there is a walkway to the strip or go through the side to Bellagio (longer but mostly indoors)

As for the location, my only complaint is that Vdara has no indoor connecting pathway to nearby casinos. We went during the middle of winter, so we had to endure strong, gusty winds while wearing teeny tiny dresses and heels outside.

The front desk was efficient and accommodating and check-in was a breeze. Our room on the 11th floor looked great but the bed was SO badly broken down I just had to complain. Not to mention the coffee maker I planned on in the room was no longer free and cost $20\/DAY, outrageous for a single cup but I'm sure Starbucks downstairs complained and that's why they were removed.
So the next day when I complained we were moved to another suite on the 27th floor... A corner one with a good view although we were working and the view was not a priority. Teresa at the front desk was gracious and included the coffee maker at no charge for which I was grateful. The new location was a bit smaller with a different layout.

The showers sucked in both rooms because you couldn't adjust the head up or down but just side to side and the new room's shower reeked of sulphur and make my skin break out. But the bed was gloriously fir and comfortable.

Both nice and not so nice.  Vdara hotel is a dream for me. Located just off the Strip, it is one of the newish properties of City Center.  

It's uniqueness is that it does NOT have a casino, which is personally a huge plus!  

Gorgeous new and sleek\/modern architecture, a variety of places to grab food to go or sit to eat, state of the art gym facilities, pool (without music blaring).  I booked my room several months ago on Jetsetter for $159 and have a suite that is triple the size of my apartment with 2 bathrooms, living\/dining, full kitchen.  I love the blackout shades, comfy big beds with white duvets and down pillows.

Service is a little spotty at the restaurants, but that's the only downfall I can seem to find.

I must sound like I'm 90 years old, but there are only so many times you can put up with a smoky casino, the music, crowds, etc.  this hotel is like a slice of heaven just steps away from all of the action.",2,1,5

Something just feels different about this place and I think that is due in part to the fact that there is no casino in the lobby.  Instead, you'll find a great bar, a Starbucks, hotel cafe and super quick and easy access right to the Bellagio!  No more walking out in the heat and the crowds!  The staff is so helpful and polite, and happy to help!  

I have to mention the parking.  How many places will you ever go to that offer FREE valet service?   FREE!!  The valet staff here are impeccable.  Extremely courteous, professional and literally all of them RUNNING back and forth to get cars, load luggage and offer assistance.  Whether it's 9am or 4pm with the crush of everyone checking in, their attitudes and service remain consistent = 100% professional and smiling.  It's pretty impressive and definitely makes you feel like an important and valued guest.

The rooms here are a delight and I haven't had a bad view yet (not to mention a bad price: there are always fantastic deals!).  Whether looking down at the pools and neighboring hotels or the massive expanse of the desert skyline merging into the downtown strip - it's just beautiful.  Everyone knows how the strip lights up at night, now just imagine watching those lights and the Bellagio fountains from your room!  And um, let's talk about those windows - push of a button to go up or down for the privacy shade or blackout shades?  Say what?!  Once again, left feeling valued and important.  Maybe a little like a rockstar.  

I had the 'spa breakfast' delivered to my room in the morning and the server was top shelf.  Not only did he usher the cart into the kitchen area, but completely laid out my place setting to include arranging my plate, silverware, coffee and juice, condiments and ice water!  The night before when I placed my order I requested a muffin from the cafe that was not on the menu and without any hesitation it was added to my order.

I did not visit the pool on this visit but have been before and the service there is also wonderful.  You can order right from the menu and have the food delivered happily to your poolside chair.  

I left the hotel feeling totally pampered and cannot wait to go back!",2,0,0

This trip was different for us because we brought our one year old.  Vdara was at the top of the list because it's smoke-free and no casino.  I came here for a convention and figured to make a family trip out of it.
First of all, I understand that this weekend was HUGE.  Not only were there conventions galore, but also EDC, & the Pacquio\/Bradley match.  Yes, tons of people!  I won't knock the type of people that were at Vdara because it's not their fault.  Let's just say they weren't exactly the baby-friendly crowd...but whatev's.  On the other hand...the pool guy should have been, but wasn't.  As I was checking out the pool, he was quick to mention that ""there aren't a lot of babies at this hotel"".  Um..yeah, I saw quite a few.  I asked how deep is the pool and this smarty pants replied ""as deep as the bottom"".  Helpful, wasn't he?  Jerk.
We arrived at 11am thinking we could check-in early like most hotels.  As I entered the line, I got denied.  System failure = no check in until 3pm.  This to me reads, they weren't prepared for the big weekend and quickly had to turnover rooms.  People were sitting on the floor, hanging out outside (& smoking - gee, that's a funny smoke-free policy.  They make you initial some contract that states there's no smoking inside or in the front entrance.  Vdara needs to keep true to their policy and regulate.)  Bellhop was backed-up.  I understand ""stuff"" happens, but that's when customer service shines...when things go wrong, how do you correct?  An empty ""sorry"" & free water is a cop out.  Figure out a better solution!  I'm not a hotel professional, but I am a guest and those two weren't good enough. This was a hotel situation and your guests were inconvenienced.   
Another downfall was housekeeping.  I left my daughter's spoon out (my bad) on the kitchen table.  For some reason, housekeeping decided to throw it away.  Hey, that's just great!  They cleaned out the microwave, but just stashed the plate back in without aligning it to the wheels.  They did a good job keeping our room clean, but have to pay attention to details!
Last gripe - called and asked what time is check-out and late check-out.  Snippy Answer:  ""Eleven o'clock and we don't have late check-out's at this time.""  I wasn't asking to check out late, I was asking for their times.  But thanks for jumping the gun and assuming.  Such hospitality, eh?
On the plus side, the guys at the valet were super nice and helpful.  Bellhops were extremely gracious.  Room service is superb.
BOTTOM LINE:  Looks can be deceiving.  Just like a pretty girl with a nasty personality.  Would I stay here again?  Probably...err...not.  FAIL.  Major fail.  I should have just spent money on the five star hotel I Yelped a couple years ago.  Nothing can match their service.  Words of advice: Slow down, learn to be more courteous, truly care for your guests, pay attention to details, and fix your computers (or come up with plan B).",4,1,0

Really nice AirBNB home booked, next thing I know my girl switched it up and we're staying here. Been a while since I'd been to Vegas and I'd never heard of the Vdara.
Nice and easy to find to find right next door to Aria. I was disappointed to hear there's no more free parking in Vegas. You'd think at least as a guest at the hotel parking would be included. Nope! $25 a day. At least hide the charge in the fees or something sheesh. 
Nice lobby, only a cafe & Starbucks available. Quick & easy check-in. Nice elevators although one trip down someone threw up in one...sigh. 
The suite was rather nice. Nice kitchen  and small seating area, couple large mirrors a girl can appreciate. Living area included pullout couch, chair, desk and flat screen. The bedroom was seperated by a small wall. Pretty comfy bed and another flat screen. Bluetooth speaker groove or set the mood. The bathroom was probably the best part. Loved the glass shower. Included a seat to just relax. Too busy to use the tub, but it looked nice. Double sink and light up vanity mirror that was perfect for putting on makeup. Theres a full body mirror, but it or the lighting could be better.

Sophisticated appointments and stylish rooms offer a break from the craziness of the Strip, with immediate access to neighboring hotels and casinos. 

We came to the Vdara for New Years Eve 2017 to get a good view of the fireworks, and the Vdara did not disappoint. After booking a Corner Suite Fountain View room on the 53rd floor, we were treated to amazing views of the city from every room in our suite. Although the room was quite spacious, the floor plan was not optimal, cutting up the space with walls and dividers.  This was a minor problem for this particular room, I've stayed in other lower priced rooms that felt more spacious, even though they were much smaller. 

One of the best things about the Vdara is the reasonable options for dining at the hotel. Unlike the other premium properties in this area, the Vdara has a market in the lobby where one can find a wide variety of affordable options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

The staff at the Vdara are top notch. I found every team member to be personable and friendly, ready to go the extra mile to ensure your satisfaction. 

If your coming to Vegas for a convention or business event, you will be well served here at the Vdara. It's close to many convention venues and has everything a business traveler needs at a reasonable price. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my stay at the Vdara and I look forward to returning someday soon.

I think it has great potential. I'm not sure if they were understaffed during the holiday or all the staff are brand new but they really need to get it together. 

What went wrong:
1) The first encounter at check in took a long time. Then we were checked into a room that's already had guests checked on the same day. We had two rooms. I called the front desk from the other room and was told they will upgrade us due to the confusion but when I went down to get the key, the promise was not documented and not set up. We ended up waiting another 30 mins at the front desk trying to figure this out with a ""not so friendly"" front desk guy. He seemed annoyed that we are asking for this. He finally set up the new room for us but when I got back up to the room, the TV won't turn on saying I'm not checked in to the room. I ended up having to call front desk Again and after talking to the manager, I was able to get everything straighten out. This whole process took at least 2 hours. 
- the manager was nice about accommodating us and compensating us for all this mess including upgrading our room and waving the resort fee.

2) We literally had to call house keeping 4 times PER ROOM to get extra blankets. Waited at least an hour per room to get what we needed. Finally had to escalate it to the manager again to get something as simple as blankets. 

3) The dog crate was the same ordeal but took 2 calls instead of 4. 

4) The main reason for trying out vdara is for our dogs. We wanted to enjoy the holidays with our dogs and Vdara is a great dog friendly hotel. They provided a dog park next to the hotel, blankets for your dog, a dog cookie, dog crate and dog bowls! Even doggie room service meal (at extra price)! But this comes with a heavy price tag which was NOT provided before booking the hotel. You don't find out until you check out. $75 per night per room dog cleaning fee. This is very pricey compared to most other dog friendly hotels that usually charges a one time fee instead of daily fee for cleaning. You really don't sanitize the room daily while you are still there so why a daily fee? 
This hotel really came with a lot of hidden fees that were not explicit until you get there - when it's too late to change. 

5) For some random reason the same day we checked in and after going through all the ordeal. The key card stopped working for one of our rooms. We had to call front desk again.....

What was good:
1) The rooms are nice and clean. The picture accurately reflects how the room looks. There is a kitchen complete with stove, microwave and oven (but no pots or pans) in some suites. Great views at the room facing Bellagio!
2) Dog amenities are very complete. 
3) Most staff were friendly and apologetic. I feel like the managers constantly have to provide free things for people because of all the hiccups.  
4) They were good about adjusting to the realtime room price which was lower compared to when I booked the rooms.
5) Close to walk to Aria and bellagio. Slight off the strip so you can bypass the strip traffic. 
6) valet service is $18 per day but you can valet at any MGM hotels. 

Overall my stay was not bad except for checking in and checking out. I had to figure out how much I was going to get charged since they keep putting multiple pending charges to your card. I really don't remember having all these problems in the past at any hotel. 

I really hope if was a holiday thing....

I'm not sure if I want to come back. I may consider coming back due to the great dog amenities if there isn't something else available that measures up.",7,4,2

First- the lovely Kyle checked us in. He was kind and courteous, and offered us an upper-floor upgrade for free. Nice! Also, a lens popped out of my spouses glasses on the way to the hotel, and he lent us his personal eye-glass repair kit. Vdara, if you're reading this, Kyle is awesome and saved the day, or at least saved us a trip to CVS.
The room is gorgeous and big, and on the 51st floor the view was amazing. You can order room service from a tablet next to the bed. 2 tvs. Could fit two more people with the pull out couch. Nice big clean bathroom with separate shower and soaking tub, and the little kitchen is cute, even tho we likely won't use it.
The resort is nice too. The bar in the lobby, Vice Versa, is pretty sweet- the outdoor seating are is very cool. The little market is nice too. The pool is open year-round which is rare in this city. I like the option of hottubbing, but we're here in December so we'll probably skip the actual pool.
My favorite part- NO SMOKING AND NO CASINO. We recently quit smoking, and the sound and energy of a casino can be sort of overwhelming, so we love it. Not like there's not a million casinos within a stones throw anyway- the location kicks ass.

Vdara's explanation is that their hotel is ""green and environmentally friendly"".   I can commend them for being environmentally friendly, but it just doesn't fit my needs.

That being said, the customer service here is great, everyone there was very courteous and willing to assist you.  I ended up wanting to switch hotels due to the water pressure issue, and they were very cooperative and understanding.  I wanted to switch to one of Vdara's sister hotels, and they were very accommodating.   My reservation was through priceline's name your bid and priceline told me they won't be able to make changes to my reservation.  Chinnaha at the front desk went the extra mile and called priceline directly for me.  She was able to get my entire reservation refunded with priceline. 

I had their standard room.  The room itself was extremely nice, it had a small refrigerator, dining table for two, and electric stove-top.  I was even able to hookup my laptop (using HDMI) to the LCD TV.

This place is very nice if you are looking for a classy hotel without the Vegas feel (I mean that in a good way). You get to party in Vegas and then come to a hotel that is smoke-free and slot-machine free.

I stayed here in December with the hubby and we were both pleased.  We booked a regular Deluxe Suite but were upgraded to a City View Suite.. SWEET!  

We got the views of the mountains and it was perfect as we love nature. When we stepped out of our room we got to see the famous Bellagio Fountains from the lobby. I don't need to see the fountains from my room so this room was perfect. 

So why do I not give the perfect score? 1\/2 star deducted because although they have dishwasher, dryer\/washer they do not include detergent or the likes.  We called housekeeping and then personally went to the lobby to get plates, soap etc. Another 1\/2 star deducted because the ""free"" upgrade came with an additional $15\/per night surcharge in addition to the resort fee. I don't mind paying it if I know in advance I will be charged.

Tip: Try to avoid the cafe in the lobby as it is WAY OVERPRICED!! I live in NYC and I still found the prices for their food ree-deek-u-lus! Shop at Walgreens on the Strip and save yourself a few bucks. Use that $$ to gamble.",1,0,0

I would've given Vdara 4 stars if it wasn't for their valet and considering that they only have a valet and no self parking, it's kind of a big deal. The valet parking garage is somewhat close to the valet pick up and as I waited for my car I heard pretty loud screeching of tires and brakes. I hoped it wasn't my car but soon after my car came out and as the valet guy started braking my brakes were also screeching...like wuhhhhhtttt. Oh and I was the only there at pick-up. My car is 3 1\/2 yrs old and my brakes are 6 months old! Even I myself don't make my tires screech and eff my brakes up that much!!! I'm fairly upset and had wished I gotten his name but I was giving him doubt but the moment I started driving my car I knew he messed it up. 



Don't get me wrong though, not all the valet guys are like that but at the same time considering that Vdara is a high-end hotel, something like this shouldn't go on unnoticed! I actually am from Vegas and have high standards for these places and nothing like this has EVER HAPPENED elsewhere. It's quite disappointing that that specific employee had no respect for my car, I honestly shouldn't even have tipped him. Ugh!

The hotel is small since there's no casino but you just make a short walk to the cosmo and there's your casino. Every time my friends and i stepped into vdara we had to comment on the smell. My friend loved it so much she wanted to purchase whatever air freshener they use but never got around to asking. Rooms were a good rate and very spacious, I felt like I got what I paid for, it's not as large of a suite as the ones in venetian or palazzo but like I said you get more than enough for what you pay for. If you're younger and looking for a party then check into Cosmo but if you like quiet and comfortable book here. I've also stayed at the cosmo which was a lot of fun for my bachelorette but we ended up coming back to Vdara to use their spa facility. I've gotten their 50 minute swedish massage twice, and it's wonderful! They employ some different things I've never had done before like placing a hot stone on your lower back i figure to warm and loosen up the area before they get into the massaging. And the other thing I noticed was that they place little warmers over your feet ... it was unusual to me that they concentrated on my feet longer than I've ever really experienced at any other massage but it was nice because I was in heels the night before! Aside from the great massage, the facility is small but nice too. I went with 5 of my girlfriends and though it was small we felt like we had the whole place to ourselves bc there weren't many other guests. There's a small little jacuzzi, warming chairbeds, a sauna and steam room, lounge and quiet room. They have the basics but when we went that's all we needed to relax.

I loved the non-smoking part the most, in a city where people can smoke everywhere it was nice to unwind in a clean environment. There is no casino inside, so you don't have to worry about crazy mobs of angry people down on their luck sloshing through the lobby just a relaxing place to sleep. They have a lot of little amenities and features that set it apart from other places I've stayed. They have automated black out curtains, the magazines laid out on the coffee table the large tub I didn't use and the amazing 24 hour room service. After a long night of gambling (losing all my money) and drinking (too much) it was nice to be able to come into my room at 3 in the morning and order a breakfast burrito and an ice cold Fat Tire Amber Ale. Also I have to mention the cafe downstairs that had the best turkey sandwich I've ever had in my life; roasted meat with aioli on cranberry bread.

The Aria casino next door is mind blowing too, all of the City Center is. They are under the MGM umbrella. The blackjack tables had 25 minimums, turns out that's not the best setting for a first time player, rookie mistake. But, I had fun and would do this again.",1,1,0

At first, they said it would take another half hour or so before we'd be able to go up and I'm not sure what happened, but after a couple of minutes, they said it was ready and we were on our way up.

Although we got a nice, panoramic view of Vegas, we were a bit disappointed to find trash still underneath the sink, sticky table tops, traces of dry vomit on the sheets, and empty bottles left in the refrigerator. While they were very professional about taking care of the situation, it was still frustrating having to call the manager and explain the situation when all this could have been avoided if it was cleaned properly the first time.

Not sure if I'd consider checking-in here again, but the hotel did do its job for the weekend. I'm just glad to be back home now - sans vomit-stained bed.",4,3,3

If you have quality company that deserves a lot more than weak tricks and theatrics, then consider Vdara. This non-casino, eco-friendly, and smoke-free property is located in the back corner of the City Center area. Write this down playas, if you want to impress your lady friend(s), book a stay at this classy joint. It's mad money.

You can easily walk over to the Cosmopolitan or Aria hotels from the Vdara, including the City Center if you can afford to spend loot at those shops there. Also, there's a monorail that connects you to adjacent hotels if you so choose to take.

Valet it, even if it's a '97 Honda Civic on chrome Enkei rims and an exhaust system that will instantly fail a smog check. If you haven't figured it out by now, valet service at Vegas hotels work on discretionary tip. Don't be so frugal, minimum $2-3 bucks at least please. These folks do work hard especially when it's 106 outside. Besides, I don't think they even have self parking available for you. So bring in that hoopty, it's all good.

Even though there isn't a casino in this hotel, the lobby area can still be quite vibrant and occupied by all sorts of mammals. There's a lounge that seems to attract people at all hours. The elevators are guarded 24\/7 by the grey suits so make sure you have your room key with you at all times. 

We got to stay on the 38th floor and most importantly in a corner room. This place was sick. Windows all around the entire room: from the long corridor\/hallway leading to the full kitchen, passed the washer and dryer to the living room into the bedroom, and finally leading in the restroom. We nearly had 360 degrees of view; it was more like 270 degrees. All the windows are controlled by electronic shades. For a darker enclosure, hit the ""black out"" button. Stainless steel is found throughout the kitchen which is stocked with glasses, silverware, plates and bowls. The refrigerator is huge enough to store food for a Greek family's two weeks worth of goods. 

The bathroom had a separate toilet section followed by an all glass shower. The separate tub sits right next to it while facing out the windows. You will be able to soak in all the lovely visuals of the city as you frolic in the tub.

The free mini gym offers state of the art cardio machines and weight machines. There's not too many dumb bells to work with so if the place is packed with meat heads then good luck. They offer fresh towels, water, and even headphones to connect you to their equipment. Flat screens were posted all over the place with ESPN blasting away. The gym is located next to the spa on a separate floor.

Calling it a ""room"" or a ""suite"" here is by far a total understatement. It was more like an upscale and high end one bedroom apartment or condo. I've been impressed by many top hotels in Sin City but this one just seemed to be very intimate as compared to the others. The Vdara is ideal for couples, honeymooners, people who travel in style, or even for families. But let's say you had 5+ dudes wanting to bunk up in a single one bedroom here, I'd probably pass and look for other options. Otherwise, this place is sick with it.",8,10,8

The rooms are spacious, the strip\/fountain view was just as seen on their website's pictures. Clean room, clean hotel. It is a non smoking facility and well you get the air and cleanliness that you would expect. 

The hotel's ambiance is boring. It's low key and out of touch with the rest of the ramblings that go down in Vegas. The good parts come courtesy of the walkway to the Bellagio and from the Aria being across the roundabout. Their amenities are subpar. The pool is okay but their bar is terrible. Although I did not have a chance to check their restaurants out, I did find their shop in the lobby convenient for when you need the essentials. 

The Vdara sets out to be what it advertises. A quiet upper middle class magnet. If you use your room for tranquility when you're away from the tables and clubs then you've found a winner.

The soaking tub in the bathroom was simply amazing. I went to the nearby CVS to pick up some bubble bath so I could enjoy it. The view from our room looked out over the Bellagio, so we could watch the fountain show from our room if we wanted. 
It was nice not having to walk through a casino to get to the hotel elevators to get back to the room, giving the Vdara a more relaxing, resort-like atmosphere. 
The cafe in the lobby is just so-so. It's rather overpriced for what you get, so I'd recommend going elsewhere to eat. That's the only other downside of the Vdara, there isn't a real restaurant inside, so you have to go to the Aria or Cosmopolitan for a buffet or full-service restaurant. 
If you have the time and the funds, enjoy an afternoon renting one of the poolside cabanas. One of my friends treated us to this, and it was the most relaxing time we had there!

The size of the room is nice to have with a desk and couch and 2 tvs. The bed was comfortable and we had a partial view of the Bellagio fountains. We loved that it is a non smoking property without a casino. 
The pool and fitness center are both small compared to other MGM properties. The gym was a bit crowded when I used it and there were only two elliptical steppers. 
We enjoyed the location and it's easy to walk a hall way to the Bellagio to access the strip. 
We recently had stayed at Aria in September and I prefer the Aria. They have a better pool, and huge workout room. I prefer the floor to ceiling glass windows in the corner suite of the Aria and the iPads next to the bed to control the shades and lights in the room. At Vdara you have to get out of bed to operate the shades and lights. However the Vdara does have a small kitchen space if you prefer to cook and save money on food. We ate out during our stay so the kitchen wasn't used during our stay. It was kind of nice not having a casino in the Vdara and it was more quiet. We just walked to the Aria quite frequently during our stay. We did get a great rate direct with MGM Life for Vdara this time. I think next time I would stay at Aria because I missed the Cybex machines and larger fitness center this trip. The pool area is much larger too. When staying in Vegas amenities like fitness center, the spa, and pool is what determines where I like to book. The corner suite at Aria was a bit more swanky than the Vdara parlor suite.

The rooms aren't rooms, they are suites. Some complain about the lack of ""action"" here. That's the point. We walked and got cabs to everything crazy and exciting Vegas is supposed to be, then when we drug our butts back to Vdara it was perfect. Quiet and relaxing. Great for recharging and going at it tomorrow. 

The pool area is more hotel pool than resort pool. The cafe and bar downstairs are good. The location is great, short walk to the strip, aria, and bellagio. 

If your idea of vegas is leaving the room to stay in the building for a buffet and gambling then this isn't for you. You sleep here, relax here, eat and drink a little here, then you go out to experience vegas. 

Great water pressure, room temp control, nice views from the corner suites. It gave us a high roller feel. And housekeeping took the time not to just clean up and make the bed, but we noticed small things. A pair of shorts thrown on a chair were folded, our toiletries strewn about the sink were lined up neatly. I know these are small things but they don't happen everywhere. Even other nice places I've stayed on the strip they don't happen.

If I had one complaint, it would be in the billing. The daily $25 resort fees (just include it in the rate) and the 100 dollar per day security charge that they hold onto for a week after you leave. That security deposit seems unnecessary.

I've been to Vegas at least a dozen times, sometimes with family, sometimes with friends. In the past, I've stayed at Paris, Mandalay Bay (suite), Caesar's Palace, Imperial Palace, Monte Carlo, Treasure Island to show you the range of places I've stayed at. 

I just gave one of the newest hotels in the City Center ONE STAR. I'll go into the satisfactory aspects of this first, then go into why I had to end up giving it such a low rating.

My friends had a car accident close to the Strip & since their car was pretty much totaled, they had no way of getting to Vdara. Vdara was nice enough to give them a complimentary limo ride to the hotel. My friends tipped them generously for such a nice welcome.

The room was ok. We had one of the suites with a kitchenette & 2 flat screen TVs. 

That's about it, in terms of what this hotel had to offer, in my opinion. Now I will begin a ""rant"" of sorts about why I would never want to stay at Vdara again ( and why you should never stay here, if you can help it). 

There wasn't much to do in the hotel, since there was no casino. I noticed 1 bar and 1 little cafe. There wasn't a nightclub or anything else to do at night, as the nightlife section of the Vdara directory was nearly empty.

There is absolutely NO SELF-PARKING. You MUST valet your car (which is supposedly complimentary, but you & I both know that if you don't tip the guy you just left your car with...who knows if you'll get it back the way you left it!). The worst part about valeting your car is that you have to sit outside in the 100deg weather, WAITING for them to bring your car back to you. 

The bellhops I met there were generally the nicest employees I met in the hotel. Of course, you have to tip them (it's the polite thing to do), but it was awkward to me, because the bellhop who takes your bags & loads it onto the carts is different than the guy who ends up bringing them to you...which means that you have to tip...twice. I thought that was a bit lame, but maybe it's just me. It could easily be that I'm not used to staying in hotels like Vdara. 

There were no service elevators in Vdara, so room service, bellhops, you name it, would be crowded in the elevators with you, aka the ""guests,"" which to me, seems pretty poorly thought out. It was no wonder that we ended up getting our bags close to 30 minutes after we were in our room!

In addition to all of the above, I'm going to give one final reason why I will never stay here again.

On the day we were checking out of the hotel, my friends & a poor Italian family were STUCK IN AN ELEVATOR. Yes, you heard right. STUCK IN AN ELEVATOR. Anyone seen Devil, the movie? eek!

The lights in there were like ""spotlights"" (?) which were tiny little lights which heat up the elevator like no other. I swear, I would've rather been out in Vegas heat instead of cramped in the elevator with 7 others. We were all SWEATING by the time we got out (approx 35 min later). Engineeers had to PRY open the doors. 

We were all trying to get down to the lobby to check out\/leave. The elevator opened randomly at the 3rd floor, and then closed again stubbornly after I pushed the ""close door"" button several minutes later. We noticed something glitchy but didn't think such a new hotel would have broken elevators. Finally the Lobby lit up but instead of stopping & the doors opening, it decided to go right on up to the 29th floor, seemingly on its own. When we got there, the doors, again, did not open. 

I called for help via the help\/emergency button in the elevator. We were asked a lot of questions, including which elevator we were in...which surprised all of us that they didn't already know which had stopped working. They asked us, more than once, which level we were on, and at the moment, we werent sure since we were stopped & the 29 kept blinking on the screen. It was very sad that the hotel couldn't figure out where we were for the longest time. 

Eventually when we got out, not only were we not offered any complimentary stays\/food, we got tiny bottles of water, which weren't even cold, I might add. To further add insult to injury, they requested that we all fill out tedious forms, BY HAND, with no clipboards whatsoever. They were ""incident"" reports & when we asked politely if we could dictate to them while they wrote, they said that they could not. We waited for a bellhop to come get our bags & waited 20 minutes. Then we waited again for an elevator to bring all of us down to the lobby. This whole ordeal set us back about 1hr 30 min. All we got was an apology from a security guy. No one else was here to talk to us when we got out. 

I don't know about you, but I come to hotels to relax and enjoy a mini vacation. In the elevator at Vdara, not only were we inconvenienced a great deal and put into great discomfort, but DELAYED in our plans to leave. We got a few bottles of water in return for this experience.

I even noticed that you could call the front desk to have dishes and cooking utensils brought to your room if you wanted.

The hotel is much quieter than the neighboring Bellagio which I think is really nice, but is connected via the tram and a walkway. I think it makes the Vdara a pretty convenient spot if you're attending a conference at the Bellagio, but wanting to get away from the hustle and bustle.

For a non-smoker like me, a smoke free property in Vegas was a great win! Gaming isn't available in this hotel, but is in all of the adjacent properties (Bellagio-attached, Cosmopolitan--next door, Aria--short walk around the roundabout). 

Rooms are large and modern, and come with a full kitchen, washer and dryer. It turns out this was originally a condominium building, and those amenities are a nice touch.

A nice spa is located within the property. The market cafe downstairs is a nice place for breakfast, a light bite, or to pick up items to keep in your kitchen.

One thing to note: there are no rooms with two doubles, though rooms come with a pullout sofa. The pullout sofa is pathetic!!!!!!!!! We pulled out the sofa and found the skinniest, creakiest (looked unused) mattress we'd ever seen... with four of us in the room, the two of us tried out the bed and rolled into one another--EEK! The hotel accommodated us and brought up a rollaway, and we made up the couch as a bed (instead of the pullout configuration). Just know this isn't the idea way to sleep four, so plan ahead or book elsewhere.

Resort fee is $25\/night (grrr... pet peeve of mine), but includes free internet (pretty quick, but you need to launch your web browser to activate it before opening apps on a smartphone or tablet), free newspapers and a few other things. Parking is not included, but we flew in, so not an issue for us.

My wife and I decided to try this hotel out and avoid the noise of all the casinos. We have also decided to stay here to see if this would be a hotel to come back to with the kids.   I can tell you this, there is no coming back.  I hate writing bad reviews, but this needs to be brought out.  

As we received the key to our room we realize that our towels and the area of the bathroom counter had black hair all over.   It took housekeeping almost an hour to get here and address the problem.

Next day at the hotel restaurant we waited almost an hour for an order of oatmeal and a toasted bagel.  Our coffee was mostly Cold with very few refills within the hour.  When we try to address the problem with the waiters they've told us that we simply have to wait because they were extremely busy.   After discussing this issue with the manager he apologized and advised us that our food ticket was lost.

When attempting to reach management and or front desk from our room  and were placed on an average hold of 40 minutes.  we address this with the front desk:management downstairs they devised us that they share an operator with the Aria Hotel and that their operator gets backed up occasionally. Not sometimes to get overwhelmed with calls. Again, this is the first time that I've ever heard of anything like this in Las Vegas.

When we left our room Saturday afternoon we kept the light on for room cleaning. When we came back and 1130 at night the room was untouched and no one ever showed up. We showered and used our previous dirty towels. Again we called downstairs, and were placed on hold for a long time after discussing the issue.   We gave up and went to sleep. In the middle of the night sometime around 12:45 we had a manager knock on the door and wake us up. We devised her that we were sleeping and are not in a position to discuss the room in the middle of the night.

Next morning we based our concerns with the front manager who was extremely cold and did not seem to be accommodating. They immediately offered to waive minimum some costs, however, this was not about the money. Instead of addressing the problem, she advised me to contact Expedia and  deal with them directly. Again, I have yet to deal with the such hotel that cannot accept responsibility and admit they're wrong.

I asked for another manager, who came on board and did absolutely nothing different than the previous manager other than offer us credit for A night. We never asked for anything in return we just wanted somebody to knowledge the problem. I was advised that I shouldn't be telling her how to do her  job. Those were the manager's exact words.

Anyways, my wife and I gave up will just suck it up and MoveOn.  I do however would like to bring up Sam's name in the Front desk. He was the most accommodating individual who listen to us and attempted to address the  problem. I can tell you that, this kid can run a major 5 star hotel. He's the only individual I'll remember from the stay of this hotel. So if you do want to take a chance and come to this hotel make sure you ask for Sam.",2,0,0

Pros:
The kitchenette is nice. I don't eat that much and I usually have leftovers (a lot of leftovers) eating out at restaurants. I stored my leftovers in the fridge and was able to eat the leftovers the next day instead of wasting so much food like usual. Housekeeping will bring up any utensils, pots, plates, dish soap & sponge if you call them. I liked the deep bathtub. The bed was comfortable. Housekeeping also brought up slippers and gowns when we called for them.
The one-touch shade and curtain control was nice. 
Complimentary valet parking, could be a good thing, (except if you needed something from your car, you had to have a valet get the car for you and then take it back to park it. A bit inconvenient).
Non-smoking, non-gambling hotel so it was relatively quieter and less crowded, which I think would be ideal for families with children or if you are like me and like to get away from the casino-scene for parts of your day. 
We had a daybed at the pool, which was pretty nice. The service, although slow, was friendly. The food and drinks that we ordered from the pool cafe were delicious.
The little market\/cafe on the first floor served some yummy breakfast options as well as single-items like yogurts, etc. Which I liked. 
Vdara is just a short walk to either Aria and Bellagio which was perfect distance away from the casino-scene but yet close enough to not feel so disconnected from all the action. 

Cons:
We found a lollipop on the floor next to the couch when we first checked in, which just shows that the room was not thoroughly cleaned.  Also the Kleenex box was stuffed on top with what looked like a used, wadded ball of Kleenex with glittery blue eyeshadow on it. Gross. 
When we checked in, the in-room safe was locked - probably the last person checking out left it locked. I don't know if this is housekeeping's responsibility but someone should have checked them and made sure the safe is left unlocked for the next person to use. We had to call security and security had to come in and unlock it, asked to see IDs like we were criminals trying to steal something in the safe that wasn't there.
The toilet in the bathroom does not have a separate door. It wasn't a biggie but if someone's in the bathroom taking a long bath (me), your partner or friend sharing the room with you can't go potty for a while. Also no TV in the bathroom (am I too spoiled?)
The valet showed some attitude when my husband needed to get something out of the car for me at nighttime. Sorry, but if you don't want to get my car out at 11pm at night, don't offer 24 hour complimentary valet service. And this was with good tipping too. Also they drive the sh** out of your car. If you don't want them to abuse your car, don't valet. Our car also smelled like smoke when we got it back at the end of our trip.

Overall, I don't know if we will choose to stay at Vdara again for any special reason but maybe if we wanted to stay in more we may, since the kitchenette is a nice option. And because we had a nice time at the pool. Pretty good in terms of amenities but there definitely some things here and there that weren't all that great.",2,0,0

Now, I understand sometimes these requests cannot be accommodated. But when I was asked, I was told ""no"" flat-out by the front desk.

Fine. Get up to the room and much to my surprise the windows are covered in a thick layer of something on the outside, making the view (of the freeway) blurry. I couldn't believe it. I called downstairs and was told it was water and would dry up. It did not.

Tried to turn on the TV in the bathroom, but of course, it didn't work.

I won't bad mouth the property because many people have obviously enjoyed their stays here (including myself earlier this year), but for the amount of money I paid for the room and what I received was, to me, nothing short of a ripoff.

I guess the only problem I encountered was that housekeeping once complained about how much towels we asked for.

The crowd here were mainly families, and 30+ people. Very few 20 year olds. 

The staffers here were really friendly and welcoming. Room service got me extra towels and eating utensils I needed in a very timely fashion. 

The fitness room, is a bit small, but it gets the job done. It was pretty much packed when I went. (Thursday 9AM). Towels and water were readily available.

The pool was nice and relaxing. I didn't actually go swimming, but I had the chance to sunbathe for about an hour or so.. enjoying a sweet Strawberry Margarita while the suns rays tanned my pale yellow skin haha. Definitely enjoyed this pool more then the bouncing pools at MGM, where kids are shirtless with beers in their hands and hootin and hollerin. 

The bed and pillows felt like home. I stayed at Aria that had a cooler setup with the electronics and whatnot, but the bedding is better here at Vdara. The pillows had the perfect plush to it , and the blankets had the perfect weight on me. 

24 hour complimentary valet service was a bit annoying at first thought, since I had to tip each time I dropped\/picked up a car, but it wasn't a big deal as I originally thought, and the valet guys were all nice, and hustled their behinds pretty quickly to get us our vehicle in a timely fashion.

But it's not stocked which sucked. Ordered room service and the food was good. Ordered hot wings, french onion soup and chicken ceasar salad...YUMMM!

Amazing property, smoke free, lightly perfumed, and no casino. The staff is easily the friendliest! No it's not necessarily the party hotel for people in my age range, but it's definitely relaxing and a nice relief.  Easy walk to Aria (2 minutes) and Bellagio (5 minutes to main part). 

Check-in was a breeze and they offer mobile check in through a link in your email the day of arrival. Stayed in mid-March and arrived around 10pm, a couple people waiting but nothing too serious. There is a 300$ incidental placed on your card but it falls off so long as you don't do anything heinous to the room. 

The suite gorgeous, even the standard suite. Two televisions, large soaking tub, tempered glass bathroom doors, all felt modern and beautiful. The only thing I did not like about the bathroom is that there is no water closet. Rather, the toilet is hidden by a small wall but somewhat visible. If you're sharing the room with a group, there's no way you can all get ready if someone needs to use the restroom.  In a hotel like this a water closet is a must!


The facilities: spa, gym, pool, all had great service. The pool was a bit crowded with people but there were plenty of towels and shaded seats that weren't cabanas. Cabanas can be rented for 125~150$ and up. One had a small semi-infinity pool which was nice. Poolside food is decently priced but it's Vegas so no complaints about the $$$. Didn't get to the hotel bar\/lounge but the small plates sounded pretty good. The gym was small with weights going up to 50lbs, a few machines (treadmill, elliptical) and cold towels to cool off after a workout (big relief!). There's also water to drink up before and after a workout. Pretty nice!

Housekeeping was AMAZING, anytime we needed something, we got it in a good amount of time. All were friendly, kind, and efficient. Room service is expensive but generous with the portions, the pizza was hot, kids grilled cheese and fries  were filling, and the chicken tenders had a nice flavor. Order off the kids menu! The portions are pretty big. 

No casino but Bellagio is a short, semi covered walk over. Go to the Venetian for blackjack though , better odds ;)

Once you find your way through the maze, however, you instantly feel like you're flashy money as you pull up to the valet.  No sir, no self-parking in this ritzy joint.  As you enter the lobby, you begin to question if you're really in Las Vegas.  The stillness in the air, and the light piano in the background say, ""no,"" but yet the array of alcoholic drinks in everyone's hand tells you otherwise.

I suppose it was a slow weekend during our stay, so we were kindly upgraded to a one-bedroom suite.  And -sweet- it was.  The decor was classy and modern: dark wood, marble kitchen counter tops, dual- sinks, large lounge-worthy bathtub, high-end appliances including a washer and dryer, single-cup coffee maker, electronic shades, and plasma screen tv's in the bedroom and living room.

My favorite things:

- Aveda bath products! 
- Filtered water from the refrigerator
- Washer and dryer (just because)
- Great quality dishware
- VERY comfortable bed

Things that were just okay:

- No typrical Vegas action (I'd be nice if there was an indoor bridge to the shopping center at Aria, but you have to undergo a short walk outside.)
- The closest nightclub is Haze at the Aria.  A total stinker.  That is all.

The mediocre things are really minor... considering that throughout the whole weekend and upon my return home I kept proclaiming that Vdara has spoiled me rotten.  I don't see myself willing to downgrade anytime soon.  It's too amazing.  Sorry Signature, but you've just been served.",0,0,0

I was disappointed when I called the spa on the last day. They said they closed at 8, I called about 5:45\/6pm to get pricing and see if they could get me in on short notice. After she went over pricing I said I wanted to see if I could get in now she said their last appointment is at 6, so no they could not.

We checked in came to the room and everything was fine, we went out to enjoy our weekend to come back to the room only to find the most disgusting thing EVER! In the corner of our bed there was a huge blood stain which is totally disgusting and unsanitary.  How do you go about sleeping on a bed like this? I go downstairs to check in for them to change my sheets really what else does this place have? How do you lay down in a bed like this. I rather sleep on the streets where at least if there was blood it would have been taking care of not like this nasty as@ room. I will never stay here again and keep in mind if you do make sure you inspect the room and make sure there is nothing there because if there is all they will do is switch it out like that's supposed to make sure you sleep good at night. This really sucks if anything, how do I go about getting a refund or leaving this horrible place?",0,0,0

The good: 
The hotel itself is nice, laid back and not the hustle and bustle of the lobby of other hotels - primary reason being there is no casino.  Its really a mix of people who stay at this hotel from what I saw.  Connected to the Bellagio which is nice and a 2 minute walk to the Aria. The pool is actually decent!  The day before we did Ditch Fridays at the MGM so the Vdara pool was a nice change of pace.  Low key, decent amount of people, and was able to locate 3 lounge chairs easily.  Tons of sun in the pool area.  The room was nice, new and clean.  We had a kitchen, washer\/dryer, 2 bathrooms.


The Bad:
 Service and room - we had to call housekeeping and the front desk 5 times in our 2 night stay.  We lit the button for a room changeover, which was never done so we had to call down for more towels.  The AC in our front room wasnt working so we had to call for that.  We asked for 3 bowls and cups and instead we got 3 bowls and 3 plates.  When we tried to use the dryer, it didnt work.

Not a bad place to stay for the price but some hiccups along the way.  I'd probably stay here again if I was going with a gf.",0,0,0

The kitchen had a huge refrigerator and there was plenty of cabinet space around the room. The bedroom was very spacious and the bathroom was gorgeous! We had a view of the Bellagio fountain from the bathroom! 
If you want to go to the Bellagio, Aria, Monte Carlo, or New York, they are pretty much all connected. There's a tram that goes from the Bellagio to Monte Carlo. From there, you can walk across the street to New York if you want. Vdara is very centralized on the strip. It may not have a casino or many restaurants, but you can easily get to the other mlife resorts. Definitely recommend if you want a nice place to stay and don't mind going to neighboring hotels.",0,0,0

We called down and they said that someone would be up shortly to fix it.  We said that they could come in without us here and walked over to the strip for lunch.  Just as we got our food, we got one phone call saying that we had to come back to change rooms.  I hung up and not 20 seconds later, another phone call saying that facilities could not get into our room, we needed to get out so that they could fix it.  Ok, we gobbled down our food and walked back.  Went upstairs to get our stuff, room key doesn't work anymore.  Downstairs to get get temporary key.  Back to room to get stuff.  Kind of a hassle.  Surprised that we weren't offered a credit for early check in fee, spa passes, room upgrade or anything.  Other than that, it was a nice room and the fountain views were amazing.

While checking in we were informed that this was a mandatory deposit that would need to be paid upfront in order to keep our reservation- as most hotels do. It's very unclear to me how guest services would stand by their documentation that this wasn't paid if it was ""mandatory"". This was a $500 loss since we had booked 2 suites. Clearly a daily audit isn't done otherwise a $500 boost in daily revenue would have been noticed. This was paid in cash and a receipt was given however maid services threw our receipt away our first nights stay.

Location - If you're looking for a non-smoking, nongaming hotel, Vdara is a very good choice. The location is GREAT. In City Center, near Aria, Cosmopolitan, and the Mandarin. This is where the action of Las Vegas seems to currently be. A short walk (outdoors) to the Aria next door and an indoor (air-conditioned) walk to Bellagio.

Parking - Valet only. Excellent service. Quick and courteous.

Lobby - Wonderful scent upon entering. Not very busy and the process was efficient (less than 5 minute wait in line). Security at the elevator entrances and the nicest lady - HI DOLORES! who greeted my daughter each and every morning with a warm wonderful smile and always chatted us up.

Cafe - Convenient but expensive. What do you expect?

Room - We had a City Corner Suite. Yes..the controls were super cool (open, close for shades and black out shades). Comfy king mattress but horribly uncomfortable, lumpy and flimsy sofabed. Stacked washer\/dryer (so nice to go home with luggage full of clean clothes)!

The kitchen was equipped with a dishwasher, stove, microwave and full refrigerator\/freezer BUT no utensils, pans, towels, detergent, etc. Yes, you may request some items (no additional fee) but it was a hassle. IMO, this is where MGM Signature shines above Vdara. Signature suites are complimented with all the kitchen amenities (pots, pans, dishsoap, plates, utensils). 

The restroom could use some improvement. The toilet doesn't have a door so if someone's doing their business, one wouldn't feel comfortable or be able to use the sink or bathtub at the same time. There weren't enough hooks or shelves for towels.

Pool - Small but it fit the bill. I also liked that it wasn't highly chlorinated. We didn't smell like we had soaked in chemicals, and our eyes didn't burn. The wind is NO joke. I read about it from other reviewers. So true...Vdara pool was absolutely built incorrectly. It's as if it sits in a wind tunnel. 

Also, drink\/food service seemed to be nonexistent. We went to the pool every day for 4 days and I only saw an attendant once.",6,0,0

I think this place is ideal for a short getaway (spa day!) or for families who don't want to deal with the hustle and bustle of the casino.

I have stayed at Treasure Island and MGM Signature Suites before, and Vdara is my favorite hotel. When I came here, I stayed with my husband and another couple. We are all in our mid and late 20s, and still like to party! LOL.  We stayed in the ""Vdara suite"" room. If you would like to see a tour of the room, click on the link below which is a video that I made when I stayed there.

I've listed my pros and cons below. 

Pros:
- No smoking hotel! The hotel has it's own unique smell, which is so nice to come back to after walking around the casinos and clubs
- The hotel has a relaxing atmosphere to it. You get the best of both worlds of Vegas, the wild and relaxing side of Vegas
- Relaxing atmosphere at the pool (It's not a wild pool party) 
- Connected to Belagio 
- Very, very close to Aria and Cosmopolitan (If you are a girl who likes to walk in 5 in or higher heels, you can easily walk to Haze nightclub at Aria without having to take sandals with you!!!!!) 
- The rooms are modern and beautiful 
- Room service was excellent 
- When we first checked in, the receptionist gave us the choice of the 2 different layouts that they had available for the ""Vdara suite"" room. 
- One more thing.... we always had the music on loud and never got a complaint from any neighbors. =D The walls were either super thick or we had no neighbors. LOL

Cons:
- After room service came to clean our room, they took our dirty glasses and didn't replace them. They did, however, bring us more glasses in a timely fashion after we called the front desk. 
- The Vdara pool area is extremely hot. I was down there for 45 mins and felt like a lost 5 pounds with all the sweat my body released. LOL. ... and I was under an umbrella.
- Check in was a hassle. We tried to do early check in, but they didn't have any rooms available. (The hotel was pretty packed for being a Tuesday!) We didn't get to check in until 3pm, which was their actual check in time! But I would have still liked to have had the opportunity to check in earlier. 

Overall, I would highly recommend anyone to stay here, no matter if you are old or young.",1,0,0

Desperate to part you from every single dollar you walk in with. We all know that Vegas in general has moved toward the ""nickel and diming"" model, but it's really in your face at Vdara. The rates here are not cheap, but we stayed here, like many, because we have children and it's easier with the kitchenette. 

Here are some of the highlights leading to the two star rating: 
(1) we get to the pool early and there was a sea of chairs. We went to grab the chairs in the front of the pool with the cover and the woman says - those are reserved. I said reserved for who? She says, it's $15\/chair for those in front and $50 for love seats. 

(2) Starbucks in the hotel is very convenient - but they charge 3x more than Starbucks on the street. Two coffees in the morning = $14.  There is also an extra charge if you want a coffee machine in the room. 

(3) we pull up to park the car and they say it's $25\/day for valet. We say, we would like to self-park. They say, valet only here; no self-park. Add another $300 to the hotel bill for parking. 

(4) daily resort fee of $35\/day includes internet, but the internet is hideous. Doesn't stay connected, constantly kicks you off the network and then takes 20 min to try to log back in. So glad I'm paying $35 per day for nothing.  

(5) we asked for a crib online. Then when I call before arriving to make sure they have the crib in room, they tell me they only have pack-n-plays. Then when they wheel it in, there is NO MATTRESS; just the pad that comes with the item which is okay if you're using it to have the child play in - not sleep for 14 hours. Hard as a rock. Felt very guilty and spent a day driving to stores around town looking for a pack-n-play mattress. If you know you have a lot of families stay here - invest in decent cribs and\/or mattresses for your littlest and most vulnerable guests. 

(6) we left the housekeeping sign on from 1030am to 8pm when we got back to the room and it was still a mess. No one ever came. We needed to wash and put babies to sleep. We called housekeeping and they said - what's the problem - we can come clean the room at any time. Pathetic is what it is. 

I could go on but you get the point. If we didn't need the kitchen, we would not stay here. We are paying close to $3k for a week's stay; you don't need to nickel and dime us to death. MGM in general is a poor organization with weak service and little transparency for consumers. We will airbnb next time we are in Vegas.",3,0,0

As part of my annual trip back to Sin City, we got an extremely good deal for an Executive Corner Suite and it was well worth squeezing in all your friends.

Vdara is a steal if you compare it to other luxury hotels on the Strip.  As deals are rampant in Vegas, we were fortunate to snag a deal that allowed us to comfortably pack nearly ten people in a room meant for say... five?  I can't say it was a tiny bit cramped, but from trial and error, these were some of the hi-lights:

1. That sunshine breaking your hangover sleep at 6am?  With the flick of a switch, the curtains come down and you're back to snoozeland.

2. Inviting your friends over for a party?  The service was splendid and were willing to provide us with extra plates and cups, so everyone can join in on King's Cup of course.

3. The shower in the executive suite gave us unique shower parties with 3-4 people at one time.  We're on a tight schedule here, so sharing is caring.  Plus after living in Japan for a few years, showering around others does not pose an issue at all.

4. Large pullout bed that actually turned out to be even softer than the real one?  Plus one for me!

Because of the lack of casinos in the actual hotel, there isn't as much smoking around the hallways and lobbies, so it also makes a great place for children or those that rather not soak in the smell of tobacco.

They also have a nice gym near the bottom.  Lots of weights available, along with cardio machines.  There's also lots of small water bottles available, so be sure to snag some for that friend that couldn't quite make it to the restroom last night.  Helping your body AND your friend.  What's not to like about that?

Only real bad  thing I'd note about Vdara is the confusing driveway up to it and the Cosmopolitan.  I mean geez... whoever designed this needs to get backhanded.  Too many near accidents from it, and all of us are sober (as it should be... don't drink and drive kids!)

A lot of people don't like the idea of this hotel because there is no casino, but I absolutely loved how small and quiet the place was.  There's no long walk from the lobby to your room while choking on smoke, you walk into the hotel and there is a market cafe, a bar, and the front desk -- that's it.  And Aria isn't far if you want to gamble or hang out. I loved the  decor -- very modern and in done in light colors.  The clientele is young, upscale 20-30 year old yuppies (no screaming kids running about the lobby).

The rooms were stunning.  They're mini suites (ask for the split rooms) but much larger than the average hotel room.  Even the kitchenette is quite spacious.

Felt like it was a relaxing hotel, stayed here 2 nights for the first time, thought it was very modern not rushed, not busy, and quiet which me and my lady liked very much. there's no need to walk through hella slot machines n cigarette smoke n loud drunken vegas first timers to get to the room elevators. 

it was a little wired walking out to other destinations specially when it was 98 degrees out. felt like they can build a walkway directly from the front lobby on to Harmon st. But its vegas you WILL HAVE TO WALK REGARDLESS! had to go thru the walkway then thru the bellagio. its not a bad walk about 5 minutes and  then you are out in the center of strip near planet hollywood\/fountains, or u can take a tram to city center\/monte carlo\/aria which is the opposite side of bellagio on the strip.

stayed in a city corner suite GREAT views LOVE the HUGE windows, nice amenities, 2 free bottled water a day and free wifi (that actually works and fast) . Bed was comfortable soft big pillows! Very clean loved the big bathroom n tub. 2 tv's and we defiantly made use of the fridge in the kitchen to store leftovers from eating out! Made use of the dining table as well ;)  plenty of glass cups and a couple of wine glasses\/coffee mugs.

Check in was fast and checking out was a breeze if done on the in room TV. I used their business center which had computers to surf the web which i used to check in for our flights and print tickets.

do be aware which i think is annoying they are going to charge you a room tax plus RESORT FEE then fuking tax you for that resort fee which is comes to $28 a day, i thought that was lame!!!!!!!!

staff was helpful with directions\/shuttle info\/and even left a message to see if we wanted housekeeping service, cause we left the do not disturb signal on for the room. which is a switch u can activate near the room door. so we got passed on house keeping during the day.

I didn't see a room service menu at all in my room, i was craving for a snack late night which was kinda annoying so i said screw it and walked to earl of sandwich in PH

defiantly will keep vdara in mind when im back in vegas.",0,0,0

The kitchen did not even come stocked with necessities and would only be provided by request. The bathtub was nice but compared to the amazing jacuzzi tub I experienced at Palms Place the night before, it was just ok. I was not aware this was not a gaming hotel. I personally prefer to stay in hotels that have the convenience of walking downstairs to gamble. This hotel is a short walk from Aria and Bellagio but still a walk and all you ladies know that any walk in ""Vegas heels"" is not a fun one...lol.

They have nice spacious rooms and they also have kitchenettes in the rooms where you can cook and prepare your own food. They will bring you a skillet, some utensils, plates, and bowls upon request. Everything else you need is up to you to acquire. 

They have valet parking only. If you don't want to deal with that, park at the aria and walk. I always tip a few bucks each time instead of leaving a big tip at the end, but I think it's really up to you.

Based on all the yelp reviews, I had high expectations. As soon as I entered the hotel room, I felt I was on a business trip. Although I'm not a smoker nor do I gamble really, coming to Vegas to experience a ""normal"" hotel was not my expectation. Every dark wood ""modern"", ""luxury"", ""sophisticated"" detail did not put in the mindset of vacation nor Vegas, but in the mind of sleep and work. If it weren't for the large windows to remind me it was Vegas, I may have worked the whole vacation.

It's clean and the staff were all nice. The rooms are rather small and dark (I said it twice now) unlike the other ""luxury hotels"" I've visited in Vegas. The kitchenette was ok. The microwave would have come in handy if my left overs didn't spoil in the mini fridge that doesn't get cold enough to chill water. 

The staff was really nice and though I paid for the patio daybed so my daughter and I could fully enjoy the pool without direct sun torch, the pool was small and just ok. 

All Vegas strip hotels seem to have a resort fee, for Vdara I'm still not sure what the fee covered. Maybe includes
 - Access to the small pool where there's a fee for padded seating. 
 - Or maybe it's the 2 burner kitchenette that didn't include any utensils, pans etc. (available upon request for another small fee?)
 - Maybe...the two mini waters
- Free version of the really slow Wifi
Basically I have no idea why the daily fee of 30+ dollars.

PROS -
*Comfortable bed
*Clean
*Pool and Bar food great
*Large Windows

CONS - 
*Small bathroom
*Fairly small room
*Dark furniture 
*No shuttle to anywhere
*Small pool
*Limited necessities (snacks, meds etc.) in the Vdara Market Café

Overall, my 5 day vacation was fine. In comparison to Wynn, Encore, Bellagio or even Caesar""s Palace, I think the hotel experience does not equal the rate for the room. This would be a great boutique hotel for long term rentals, business trips etc. Not really ideal for family vacation or the grandiose feel we normally get when we're on the Vegas strip. I'm not sure if I'd return at the same rate again.",1,0,0

Through myvegas you are getting rooms for $75 on weekdays to $125 on weekends. And you can get similar rates online without myvegas. 

That's similar to MB, MGM Grand, Paris, Mirage. You get a better location than all those places. Yes, Vdara is better located than Mirage or Aria. 3 minute walk to Bellagio, 5 minutes to Aria, 6 minutes to Cosmo. 

Rooms got mini kitchens with fridge, sink, stove, microwave. Basic rooms are like 550+ sq. feet with separate tub, shower. Goes up to 58 floors about. So the views are better than most of the resorts in Vegas. Views of Bellagio, cosmo, aria, desert, all decent. Parking is valet only and takes 3-10 minutes, plus it now costs money to park, but that's how it is for all MGM resorts in Vegas now. Location is very good. Not as good at as Bellagio or Paris or Caesars tho. 

Pretty cool lobby, kinda lame lobby bar, small pool area, but very good clientele and vibe, with plenty of space to lounge, even on weekends. No casino, no good bars, no nightclubs, so way less trashy people. No prostitutes either, come to think of it. They mostly hang out at the Cosmo, or across the street at PH. In fact on the weekdays its a good hotel for kids. 

Hmm.. what else. The rooms are pretty nice. Cheap hotel furniture, but spacious, and nice beds, nice cooking features, windows kinda suck (floor to ceiling would be better). Pretty much on par with Aria. Hotel doesn't feel old or dated at all, unlike Caesars, Mirage, even Bellagio feels a bit old. 

Gym is small, spa is pretty good size. Its very cool and relaxing. Also there is a little food store near the lobby. And I will give you a little secret. So listen up.. ready? If you want to use the cleanest public toilet in Vegas, it's located past all the meeting rooms on the lobby level. So go the left of the front desk, you walk past the meeting rooms and at the end is clean bathrooms that get used only by me and one other guy. 

You know how lots of places in Vegas feel sleazy, superficial, and trashy? Especially if you are on a budget? Well the Vdara is not like that, which is  why I like it. I'd  honestly rather stay here than the Cosmo, but I do some partying at the Cosmo. I imagine if I was a women who was in her mid 20's or 30's and into yoga and organic food I would be ecstatic over this place. I'm a late 20's bro, and I still love it. For a guys' bachelor part? Definitely not. But for a girls' bachelorette party it could be a good choice if the ladies are more low key and not into getting shit faced every night. 

So overall, its a really nice place. I'd rather stay at the Wynn or Mandarin, but those usually cost almost twice as much, so the Vdara is my default. Gambling is a 5 minute walk, so it's not a big deal. Send me a message on here if you have any questions about Vegas or Vdara!",2,3,0

I actually didn't know about the Death Ray until I read about it online while I was in my Vdara condo. 
The entire lobby wasn't finished yet when I stayed here a couple of weeks ago, but it still looked nice inside. It's cool to stay in this hotel but there's drawbacks as well.

The Good:
1) Sort of far from the strip, so there's not much people traffic so that's nice when you want a somewhat relaxing hotel-stay
2) Rooms have a kitchen
3) Good views

The Bad:
1) Far from the strip than most entrances of hotels--you have to walk through Vdara to get to the strip or an alternative route would be to walk down this staircase and walk on a perpendicular street (with no sidewalk) leading to the strip
2) Our room didn't have plates or silverware for the kitchen we had--do they expect people to not use the kitchen that they're paying for?
3) The hotel is not completely finished yet

This is my kind of hotel, it does not have a casino but is connected to the Bellagio.  Stay away from that place by the way if you value your money.  I loved being able to get away from the madness of the casinos and escape away to a beautiful hotel room.  Speaking of the room, its gorgeous, and its not just a room.  They are condo's, and I do believe the hotel offers residencies.  Its that amazing, the rooms have everything, bedroom, walk in shower that fits two, three, and more.  Unfortunately was not able to test the capacity on my first visit.  Kitchen and dining area, and I believe they offer pots and pans so you can cook your meals.  Amazing view from almost every room in the hotel as well.  

This place was famous almost immediately after it was built.  I read about the ""death ray"", that's what the staff calls the effect of the reflection of the sun off off the hotel that beams down into the pool area. This ray becomes so hot that the metal on the chairs becomes hot to the touch.  I wanted no parts of that, and luckily I was not visiting during the summer, so there was no need to dodge the ""death ray"".

 After taking a late flight in it was nice to be greeted by the smell of vanilla, not cigarette smoke. Once we recovered the Aria, Belligio, and Monte Carlo were all with in a short walk from our room, so we did not feel like we were missing out on any of the gambling fun, but we still had a quiet haven to return too.

So we decided to get the panoramic suite for 3 nights and just hang out in the room the whole trip.

The Panoramic suite was gorgeous but we didn't love the fact that they gave us one on a lower floor next to the tram, so we put in a request for another room but higher up. They only had it available the next day and said it would be on floor 27 with a better view. So the next day we go down to the lobby to exchange rooms and they were having a little trouble so they told us to come back later in the day.

We return from our day out on the town and speak to someone at the front desk about switching our room. My girlfriend tells them it's my birthday and we would love the best view possible. The guy leaves and talks to his manager then comes back and tells us they are upgrading us to the hospitality suite for our last 2 nights!! 

We finally go up to the room on the 46th floor and could not believe our eyes! It was a huge living room area with a full kitchen and island in the middle. 2 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. We called everyone we knew to catch a flight out to Vegas to come share this room with us but we didn't have any luck. 

Anyways the rooms here are beautiful, clean and modern. The customer service is beyond amazing and the staff is definitely some of the best Vegas has to offer. There isn't a casino (smoke free) in Vdara but Cosmopolitan and Aria are just a few steps away (my girl has a knee scooter for her broken ankle so if she can roll across the way on her knee scooter, you shouldn't have a problem walking there lol.

Service was my only issue. Check. In. Was. So. Slow. It probably took 30 minutes to check in on a Thursday afternoon at about 3. 

When we checked in, I requested that the sofa bed be turned into a bed. They said ""ok."" When we got back to our room later  that night, the sofa bed hadn't been turned out. So, I called the front desk and reminded them about my request. They said they would send someone up. 

Thirty minutes later, I called again and told them that I would make the bed myself if they would just drop off the sheets. She said that they had to service the rooms in the order of the calls received and there were a handful of calls before me.

Many reviewers have complained about the location of Vdara on the strip. I actually couldn't have been more pleased with the location. At Vdara, there is extremely easy and quick access to the Bellagio or a free tram that will take you about 3 hotels over. We walked the entire strip up and down, and the quality of the hotels in the middle of the strip are MUCH better than the dingy and outdated hotels as you proceed north or south along the strip. Thus, Vdara has a great location.

The atmosphere feels very clean, open, modern, new, stylish, young, and fairly quiet. There are no slot machines, etc. After a long day\/night of walking around doing activities, we were met with a palpable feeling of relaxation as soon as we opened the doors leading from the Bellagio into Vdara. It's just a completely different feel than the other hotels. It totally felt like ""home"" as soon as you arrive, nice and quiet\/relaxing.

Customer service was EXCELLENT all around. The bellhop, front desk, pool reps, and even housekeeping went out of their way to say hi and be friendly. This was very nice and added to the warm and welcoming feeling during our time at Vdara. 

The City Corner Suite was SUPERB. It has something like 750+ sq. ft. and had a live-in kitchen with fridge, stove cooktop (no oven), sink w\/ garbage disposal, washer\/drier, etc. It's essentially a 5-star condo. The bed was a king and so very comfortable. The sheets and comforter and pillows felt so high quality. I normally have trouble sleeping away from home but had zero troubling going right to sleep here. Our room on the 39th floor was very quiet. We did not hear any other guests at all and were able to sleep through the night without any disturbance other than an occasional siren or motorcycle exhaust down on the street in the early morning. It really was very, very quiet overall. The window shades around the 270 degree view of windows were all automated and had two levels; one was a regular shade for privacy that still let in some light, and the other was a ""blackout shade"" that kept it very dark and made it easy to sleep in a bit. This is a great feature because it was all controlled by buttons on the wall near the light switches.

I have nothing negative to say about Vdara. We had a wonderful experience here. Checking out via my iPhone through a link provided in an email on our last day there took no more than a minute and showed all of the charges accrued over our stay. Unfortunately, there is a $25\/night fee for staying at any hotel on the strip and then that gets taxed, so it came out to be $28\/night, but we basically knew this when we booked the room and were expecting it. My girlfriend also had no trouble using the free WiFi on her iPhone, but after countless attempts on my exact same model iPhone 5, I was unable to use it and had to use my data plan to use the Internet. We were given a number to call for tech support by a girl at the front desk, but I never pursued it and just kept using my AT&T data, which wasn't too slow up there on the 39th floor, although not the fastest either (getting 4 bars of 4G). 

Lastly, the pool was not overly occupied during our time there. They provide free towels and food\/drinks. It never got too busy and there were always extra chairs to claim to put down your stuff while you're swimming. There were even a few mini pools to reserve if you wanted to, but we just used the main public pool. It would have been nice if there were two large pools like many other hotels to split up the crowd a little, but we made do just fine in the one pool. It didn't ever get too crowded that it wasn't fun, but it was fairly busy.

Overall, I'd recommend Vdara to anyone. It was a wonderful experience staying there. Also, no smoking is a huge plus there, at least for me personally. :D

The modern decor and relaxed atmosphere suited us just fine. No flashing lights or beeping slot machines. No crowds of smokers streaming smoke as you walk by. No running children or groups of drunken college kids. It was great.

Check in took a mere 5 minutes because we were smart enough to check in on a Thursday afternoon. (Hey, if you don't want to wait on a long line to check in, don't check in at the height of the weekend rush hour.) 

There is a mini market right in the lobby for essentials, snacks and drinks, and a bar across the mini market tucked between the entrances. We were able to order a quick bite since we flew in from the East Coast, and had to adjust our internal clocks. 

The room was fantastic. It was a comfortable space for the three days we were there. We were tucked away on a high floor with the view of the Rio, Palms, Bellagio, the fountain and Paris. We called for room service, and the server was very friendly.

The bed and pillows were very soft, bordering on too soft, but we slept like babies. The bathroom was pretty large in proportion to the rest of the space, and with a separate tub and glass shower, it was a nice bonus. There is a half wall with TVs on both sides that separates the seating area from the bedroom area, which made for a cozy feel. The kitchenette by the door entrance was quaint, complete with microwave if you felt like doing a little pop corn popping, (which, by the way they had downstairs in the mini market.)

I have to agree with some of the reviewers that the light switches were a bit confusing at first, but once you figure out what is what, it's a non-issue. Wi-Fi is free, though spotty at times, but enough for when you need to do a quick search for restaurants, hotel locations, etc. The closet doors do block the area between the seating area and bedroom area, but seriously, if you're here for a weekend, the only time you use the closet is when you store or remove your suitcase. It's not that big of a deal. 

From the lobby, there's a walkway to the Bellagio, which made it easy to pick up show tickets, and across the lobby is the Aria, which was another gorgeous hotel, with a smoking casino, but definitely not as bad as the Bellagio. (The Bellagio is overrated, but I digress, that's another review.)

All in all, it was a great stay for a couple that isn't necessarily into all the typical Vegas scene (gambling, pool parties, etc.), that is there for a little sight seeing, a little eating and a lot of R&R.",1,0,0

1.  Non-smoking, manageable, clean hotel and room, easy walk to the Aria and Bellagio.  

2.  Excellent staff: housekeeping, valet, bell captain\/luggage, Business Center, Maintenance, Security.

3.  Business Center very helpful in printing boarding passes and show tickets.

4.  Starbucks in the lobby.

What we didn't like:

1.  Dealt with several Front Desk staff in person and on the phone during our 5-night stay and the only Front Desk staff who was warm and patient was Elias so his was the only name we remembered and took note of, thank you.  

2.  Fridge did not get cold.

3.  Weak internet connection which kept dropping and required repeated logging in.  

4.  The space between the curtains allowed a lot of light in.  

Overall, we were happy with the Vdara and will stay here again.",1,0,1

The shower was immaculate and the stand alone tub was a dream. I want my bathroom at home to look like it! It doesn't have a casino and actually it was a plus because it didn't take an hour to find the right elevator to get to your room. And after all the madness you've just experienced from Vegas it's nice to walk in and not smell smoke! If you want a casino you have Aria right within walking distance no uber necessary bc it literally takes you 4 mins to walk there. The major major downfall to rate this a 4 star is the pool. It was horrible. There was no life whatsoever. Very low playing music and a bunch of people with books. When I'm on vacation I like to mingle and meet people. You can't meet anyone here because their face is in a book. Boring!!,1,2,0

We ordered the pup something off their dog dining menu, which is really cute (I had to do it). The room was beautiful, very very clean, and the bed was very comfortable. I liked not having a casino connected to the hotel, no smoke, loud noise, or non hotel guests. Check in was relatively fast and the pool area is very nice.

The first thing I noticed, even outside in the valet area, was that it smelled great. They must pipe the smell in, since it was the same throughout the hotel. The lobby is tasteful and impressive and the elevators are easily the prettiest I've ever seen. The room they stayed in was gorgeous. A sitting area and the bedroom were separated by a divider with a large tv on either side. The entryway featured a mini kitchen, complete with two-burner electric stove. The bathroom had both a glass-enclosed shower and a huge stand-alone tub. The far wall wasn't really a wall at all, but a huge window with a fantastic view. Blackout curtains and sheers were controlled with a switch (the blackouts were pretty effective).

Vdara is located in the back of Citycenter, across from the Aria hotel. It's one of the few hotels in Las Vegas that is a Non-Smoking, Non-Gaming hotel. Aria is just a quick 2 minute jog along the pathway, so there isn't anything to worry about. 

Check-in:

Since this was my first time staying at Vdara, I had tons of questions. The usual stuff, like room upgrade deals, layout of the resort, and how things worked at their hotel. With other hotels that I've stayed at in Vegas, (like Mandalay Bay and MGM) there is a supervisor that overlooks each of the check in areas, but at this resort, there isn't. If you do have questions, they have to go the back office to ask the boss any questions that you might have that they are not familiar with or do not have any information for. So it may take a few minutes. 

Other than that, check in was pretty smooth. Abraham was really nice and did his best to accommodate me with the highest floor possible. 

The Room:

Had a bit of trouble getting into the room at first. I was so use to sliding my keycard into a slot and then opening the door. This one, took me a minute to figure out. Just in case the hotel clerk doesn't tell you how to open the door, you have to wave your keycard in front of the black magnetic device on the left side of the door in order to get in. (I laughed once I figured it out)

I loved the room overall. The studio was very spacious with separate bedroom, living room and kitchenette area. The bathroom is nice as well. Separate shower and a huge tub. Room is approximately 500 square feet. 

Overall I had a wonderful experience and would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to go to Vegas, but does not want a hotel that is filled with smoke. I will definitely be back here to stay again.",6,0,1

First off, it was freezing cold during our stay here.  The Vdara is remotely located so you have to walk outside to get to the Aria, Crystals, or the Cosmopolitan.  It doesn't sound so bad, but imagine when it's freezing cold and windy outside.  Also, the wind seems to circle outside the Vdara..  Yes, it was painful running back and forth from the Aria!

Secondly, Vdara bills itself as a hotel spa.  Umm, the spa was very lackluster but SUPER expensive as well.  I got a hot stone manicure, which is a basic manicure + 10 minutes of rubbing two hot stones on my arms.  $65..  I was expecting much more for that price. 
The spa was an additional $20..  It's upstairs and itty bitty.  There's a hot tub that will fit about 8 people max.  Everything except your own makeup is provided..  The vanity area was well lit and very clean.

Now on to the rooms....  The mini suites had a kitchenette so it's useful if you plan on a longer stay.  The rooms were clean and bright, very similar to a room you'd find at the W..  

$25 Resort fee.  Umm, the pool was closed.  They have free wi-fi, but that's all you're getting for the fee.  Not worth it.

There is a small cafe and bar downstairs.  Be prepared to head elsewhere if you're in search of dining, entertainment, or some nightlife.",9,3,5

Then, on the way to vegas we decided to upgrade the room to a suite for more room...  When we finally got there after the 6 hr drive from LA (traffic) we checked into our room that was only on the 7th floor with a shitty view.  We walked into the bedroom and the bed wasn't even made, like someone had just been in it.  My friend called and complained and 1 of the employees came and brought us new keys for the 45 floor.  We thanked him and started to get our stuff together, then phone rang and it was the guy who just gave us the keys telling us that the new room is a smaller then our original 1, but they would transfer us to another larger suite the next day around noon.  The next day we called in the morning and they said they wouldn't have anything available until 3pm, so we went shopping and came back about 6pm to find that our keys didn't work to the room.  We went to the front desk and talked to someone who gave us new keys to our room, but said we needed to talk to the check in staff to change our room, we asked to speak to a manager who took forever to come and talk to us.  She then told us that there was no executive suite available and that she could put us in a Vdara suite (smaller) and only charge us for the deluxe, but we would still have to wait a couple hrs... I am now waiting for this chick to call us about this change...  Also, we just looked in the refrigerator and there is someones food is still there.  This hotel is ridiculous, I cant believe we had so many issues...  To be fair, the front desk comped us $100 credit that we used on food and is only charging us for a basic room instead of the suite, which made us feel better about the situation, but wow, they really need to get their shit together.

The problems with the hotel were so serious and numerous, and the management handled them so poorly, that I would not recommend the hotel to anyone. 

To be fair, there were some good points that I'll go over quickly: The location and view were good.The valet parking was free. Our room had a small kitchen, but for some reason no dishes or silverware. The pillows, blankets, and bathrobe were fantastic. They were so comfortable that I would consider purchasing all of them for personal use if I weren't so dead set against ever giving Vdara a dime of my money. The bed was really comfortable (but not the pullout couch). Our suite had 1.5 bathrooms, which would have been just a perk for four girls staying in one room, but turned out to be necessary since the door on the main bathroom broke, trapping me inside of it until the hotel eventually sent three people to remove the door and get me out (more on this later). Also, the room had a phone next to the toilet, which I usually find creepy, but I'm glad it was there since I was trapped in the bathroom.

I'll list the negatives in order of most to least serious, and the poor response by management:

1) NO LOCK ON THE DOOR FOR TWO DAYS. We stayed at the hotel for 3 days\/2 nights, and around 5 p.m on the second evening, we realized that the door only appeared to be locking with the lights on the lock, but it didn't actually lock. The maid said she would have someone fix it immediately and that we could still go out for the evening while they took care of it. After dinner and a show, about nine hours later, the door was still unlocked with our belongings inside, and nobody had come to look at the problem. My roommates called management, who said there were no rooms to move us to, and they sent two guys over around 2 a.m. to fix the problem. It took 30-45 minutes for them to fix the issue, and they told us that our lock had not been working for the duration of our stay. 

2) Terrible security. Their ""security system"" was to sometimes have a guy near the elevator asking people if they had a room key. Since the hotel doesn't collect keys upon checkout, anyone who's ever stayed at this hotel would be able to access any floor, and you could probably just tell the guy that someone is in the room to let you in. The security wouldn't have been as big a deal if our room's door had a lock on it, but I felt uneasy knowing that anyone off the street could go into our room without a problem.

3) CODE 4: BATHROOM ENTRAPMENT. Our full bathroom had a sliding door, and I noticed immediately that the lock didn't work. Since I was among friends, I was OK with just shutting the door behind me. Unfortunately, something was horribly wrong with the door aside from just the lock. I was unable to get out, and my two roommates were also unable to free me from outside. They called security to let me out, and then called a few more times when nobody showed up immediately.  It probably took about 10-15 minutes for them to send someone. The repairman had to physically remove the door, because it had apparently been installed incorrectly and was jammed on one side. In addition to this, they made us stay in the room for an additional 20 minutes or so while we waited for a second person to ""supervise"" the first person, and a third person to write a report. The supervisor said on his walkie talkie that he had ""a code 4: bathroom entrapment"", so this obviously happens frequently enough for them to need a code.

There were smaller annoyances as well. They knew four of us were in the room, but only gave us enough towels and robes for two, and only two pods (one decaf!) for the Keurig , which we had to use since the espresso at the cafe downstairs was weaker  and more watery than the weakest coffee I've ever had. They didn't make up our room until we called them around 7pm on our second day.

When we asked for a refund, they offered us a $70 resort credit toward food and said they couldn't give us a refund since we prepaid through a third party website. After a few hours of going back and forth (not the way I want to spend my vacation weekend), they told us to contact the website, as they felt it was the website's fault for selling us a bad room in their hotel.  In the end (after keeping us awake for hours overnight), they contacted the website and gave us a full refund, and upon checkout gave us the $70 credit, which was useless after checkout. Every manager we talked to said they ""understood"" our feelings about the room, but nobody ever apologized for the terrible experience we had, and they were mostly argumentative, adamant that they weren't allowed to give us a refund. The hotel's policy must be to never admit fault, and managers are not empowered to give full refunds even in extreme circumstances. I wish I could give zero stars. I would rant more, but this is the first time I've reached the character limit in a review.",8,5,4

Older clientele. More, older looking folks and business casual. (Personally would've enjoyed seeing more folks my age, but glad no crazy wild young crowds acting crazy!)

GREAT AMENITIES. Housekeeping on point. 

Bed was very comfortable. Bathroom kind of awkward. There's no actual door so if you're traveling with a friend you will have to kindly slide the shutter when changing, taking a shower, or using the restroom. 

The bathtub pipe was leaking towards the end of the trip so it scared the crap out of it. I did NOT want to use that throughout the trip. 

Check in and check out was breeze. You can actually check out upstairs in your room via the tv screen monitor.

I was with my family and young daughter, so I definitely enjoyed the smoke-free atmosphere. I was also tempted to bring my dog on the trip, and the Vdara would have allowed for that, which is nice. The room was also beautiful - very clean and modern and comfortable. However, the food choices are extremely limited, so you'd have to walk to the nearby Aria, Cosmo, or Bellagio to eat. Starbucks in the lobby was nice though. Many people who wrote reviews didn't seem to mind the 10-15 minute walk to the Strip, but I personally found it tedious. I've always stayed at hotels right on the Strip, so I got very tired of ""the walk"" between the Vdara and the Strip each time we went somewhere. One last major hiccup we had with the room was that we had called ahead for a portable crib for our 1 year-old. When we got into our room, it took several hours for them to deliver the crib. But okay, no problem. The bigger issue was that it didn't come with any kind of crib sheet for the mattress. When we called housekeeping (and informed them that we were told weeks beforehand that linens could be provided for the crib) they quickly brought linens to the room for us. However, they brought a stack of REGULAR BED SHEETS. Although it wasn't ideal, I had the idea to wrap one big sheet around the mattress so that it was nice and tight (and safe) for my daughter, but I quickly realized that the mattress was sewn into the bottom of the crib (I guess so people can't steal it?), so there was no way to wrap a sheet around. My husband called and requested an actual crib sheet, not a bed sheet, and was informed that the Vdara doesn't carry those. He explained that a small baby can easily suffocate on bedding that is not fitted tight to the mattress, and although they seemed concerned over this, they had no resolution. They apologized, and that was it. They did not solve the problem. So my husband ultimately ripped the mattress off of the crib so that we could properly wrap the sheet, and figured we would deal with any repercussions later. At least our daughter slept safely! Bottom line - we couldn't understand how they offer a crib and mattress, but no fitted crib sheet. And it kills me that we specifically called ahead and asked this question, and therefore, we didn't bring our own sheet. That left a bad taste in my mouth, so it's hard to give anything more than 3 stars. We had a nice experience, but probably won't return here.",0,0,0

My only gripe is that we had an issue with the AC unit in our room being broken and it took almost 10 hours and about 5 phone calls to get fixed.  I asked the front desk to give me a call when the issue was resolved, but they never called me back, and I had to call multiple times for status updates.

In addition, it is centrally located to all the ""Hip"" places. Around the corner from Aria, City Center, and Cosmopolitan Casino. 

We got our room through Travelzoo, Jet Luxury Resort at a good deal of $240 for 2 nights. Their Deluxe room included a stove, fridge, microwave, gorgeous bathroom and 2 tvs. It was a bit small, but who really stays in their room in Vegas anyhow? Anyway, we arrived at 9am and tried checking but told that since we booked our room through a third party, our room was already assigned and the prior guest wasn't checked out. I understand that trying to check in at 9am but a bit to early, so I told the clerk to keep me apprised and went to have a light breakfast at the Market Cafe.

About an hour later, I checked in with the clerk at 11am and was told the previous guest already checked out and will put a rush on the cleaning service so please check back with them at 11:30am. We decided to give them plenty of time, so an hour an a half later, we went back, spoke to another clerk, but was told that the previous guest hasn't checked out and it will be another couple more hours. Um, What?!?! We're just not willing to wait that long, and since we already got our keys, we went right up, paid the cleaning lady $20 to put a rush on it and 20 minutes later, we kicked off our shoes and took a nap. The hotel didn't even bother notifying us that the room was ready. 

I understand that it's a busy hotel and they have to deal with thousands of guest each day, but I really don't appreciate the runaround.",7,3,2

Here are the pros:

wifi internet
cafe in the lobby area
no smoke smells
kitchen
noise free--we did not hear the neighbors
valet (was both a positive and negative--we would have liked to self-park instead of waiting for an attendant and tipping him each time we needed to use the car)

Here are the cons:

no AC in elevator
a lot of my TV channels were missing--like Food network!
small refrigerator that did not seem to keep things very cool--more like luke warm\/cool
resort fee of $28 even though we did not use any of the resort options--other than internet
the black out blinds had gaps in them so we were woken up early by the sunlight each morning

Vdara is a valet only property. Self Parking is available literally steps away at ARIA Resort & Casino. 
There is a master light switch on the wall right when you walk in the front door so turn it on.
There is no casino here at this hotel but Bellagio and Aria is literally 2 min walk away ( I timed it). The Cosmopolitan is 5 minutes away walking you do have to go down the elevator or stairs to get there.
Early check in is free if your room or another room is available.
Valet is fast and super friendly. Yeah we always tip valet but it is worth it. 
The check in was super fast and I was there on a super busy weekend (where people almost everywhere were coming here for the Iheart Radio festival)
Everybody I mean everybody is super friendly.
Why stay here?
Peace, personalized service, non-smoking, all suite hotel, view is magnificent, and everything is super super close. 
There is a trail to walk to the Bellagio and from Bellagio (like many more resort\/casinos) there are other trails attached to walk to other hotel resort casinos.
ONLY THE SUITES THAT ARE HIGH ENOUGH HAVE NICE VIEWS (maybe from 20th floor and up)
MY STAY
I had no issues what so ever.
I stayed in the panoramic suite and it was well worth it. 
I had a view everywhere I walked from a little partial view of the fountains, view of 2 pools, mountains, city, and strip.
Bed was super comfy slept like a baby. 
Didn't take advantage of the kitchen amenities
I took a nice shower did not ever figure out how to work the bath pull thingy.
Cons:
The Panoramic suite didn't have a guest bathroom just a coat closet in the front.
People can see you at night so you have to close the curtains and blackout.
No restaurant just a cafe that is super expensive which is normal for Vegas. 
(I ate elsewhere)
You have to have a credit for the deposit and for most of Vegas.",2,0,0

It was quiet enough so that I could get away from all the party and club goers, while also close to the strip so that I could get a taste of the full Vegas experience. 

PROS: 
- No smoking and no casino\/club. I hate smelling smoke and Vegas has it EVERYWHERE, except Vdara yay! 
- In the middle of the strip, has a bridge that connects to Bellagio and there's a tram to Aria or you can walk it. Cosmo was walkable as well. For all other destinations, we used Lyft. It was very affordable compared to taxi's. TAKE LYFT.  
- Helpful concierge and staff. We had talked with them twice. The washer in our room had old water in it, maybe from the previous occupants. It just didn't look clean and I didn't want to use it - told the concierge, they had housekeeping fix it asap.....and on our last day, we decided to do a late check out and they were very accommodating. 
- Spa, pool and gym...however we didn't get to see nor use any. We didn't make the time for them...
- Electronic window blinds and shades~~
- Kitchen, washer\/dryer, and hot tub in bathroom~
- Two sinks in the bathroom, so we didn't have to share or wait when getting ready in the morning.
- Flat screen tvs in both bedroom and living room. Living room also had a pullout sofa bed.
- Sliding door that separates bedroom and living room - I liked this alot since my boyfriend snores. I was able to sleep with minimal noise. 
- Very dependable housekeeping. It was in the middle of the day and we had forgotten to push the housekeeping button for them to come clean our room. I had gone back to the room to drop off things at around 1pm and just pushed it...as I was leaving - housekeeping was right outside the door! That was the fastest housekeeping service I've ever experienced. 

CONS:
- Few restaurants\/shopping options. Vdara only has Starbucks, Market Cafe, and Vice Versa. The nearest hotels you'd have to go to are Aria, Cosmo, or Bellagio for more options in food and entertainment. 
- Room temperature was slow to adjust. I'm from Hawaii and anything below 70 is chilly to me. It was around 50s-60s that week and even colder at night, so I would set the temperature to maybe 75-80s before we left in the morning and when we came back at night, it still felt super cold. It wasn't till maybe I felt asleep in the middle of the night or the next day that I would feel the temperature change and get warmer. 
- No kitchen silverware\/utensils readily available, had to request often and room service was slow in bringing them up to us. Maybe because it was late at night\/early morning? My boyfriend didn't want to just put the take-out boxes in the microwave and heat it up. We brought back a lot of leftovers and having no plates\/forks to eat with in that moment we were hungry was somewhat inconvenient. 
- No detergent\/dryer sheets for washer\/dryer, also had to request.
- Toilet didn't have a door. It was no problem for us, but it wasn't very sanitary nor visually appealing... seeing\/smelling your boyfriend there while you're showering and\/or brushing your teeth...
- Small trash cans. Maybe Vdara didn't think their guests would use them or have much to throw away but we did. Mainly from the leftover food and other misc things.
- Super soft pillows (maybe a PRO for those who like them). I had to use 2 and stack them up so that my neck\/back would feel more comfortable. At least the bed was firm.
- Strange wifi problems with my laptop. I didn't bring this up to the concierge since it didn't seem like a big deal. I had wifi on my other devices (phone, tablet) and so did my boyfriend, it was just that my laptop wasn't able to connect to Vdara's wifi. I tried everything and eventually gave up. What mattered most was that my laptop DID have wifi at McCarran airport when I had to wait about 5hrs for my flight back home. 

We stayed a total of 6 nights in February. Cons were all fairly minor and the pros definitely outweighed them. Check in was a bit longer than expected, but it was all good once we got to our upgraded city corner suite. Our view of the hotels and streets were gorgeous at night with all the lights in the distance. However, I was disappointed that we couldn't get the Bellagio room view though (guess it was pretty booked that week). That would have been perfect. My boyfriend is a fan of Vdara (so am I now), so we might plan to stay here again - maybe next time we'll be more lucky and get that view we want!",16,5,12

Service is what was not good, I had to wait 3 hours to check into a suite past check-in time. They kept making excuses and told me that they had unexpected guests extend their stay. That's nice and all but I don't understand why that should be my problem. They tried pushing me aside again and I had to get rude because at that point we had to cancel our dinner plans. They ""upgraded"" me to a higher floor immediately once I became an asshole. I travel a lot and would have probably gotten a nicer suite with them next time but my stay left me with a bad taste in my mouth.

To us, it's centrally located to our dining and gambling comings and goings on the Strip. Vdara is part of the ""new"" City Center that is comprised of the Crystals Shopping Center, Aria, Cosmopolitan and Mandarin resorts and casinos. This property does not have a casino located in it, it is 100% smoke free and touts itself as featuring natural and green room amenities. All of Vdara's rooms are clean, spacious suites that include a well stocked mini-bar, mini refrigerator, microwave oven, cabinets and wet bar sink. Although, to me, it seems a bit odd to have a microwave oven and mini-kitchen like cabinets in this type of suite. I suppose ""it works"" for visitors on extended stays. In the bathroom, there is a full-sized soaking tub and shower, vanity and very quiet flushing toilet. What is impressive is the comfort of the bed...once you lie down, you'll find yourself drifting off to sleep. 

There is a small gym and pool. Nothing like its sister properties, but, maybe this hotel usually attracts business travelers or gamblers instead of families.

This hotel is also conveniently located in the middle of the strip. Walking or free trolley ride distance to neighbor hotels like bellagio, aria, and Monte Carlo.

Let me mention, this is a 100% non-smoking and casino free hotel. A perfect place to unwind from the hustle and bustle of the las Vegas strip. When visiting the hotel and want to relax, they have a very clean and very relaxing spa. My husband and I got their couples massage and it was heaven! Once you book a spa appointment, you are welcome to use all their spa amenities such as shower, Jacuzzi, sauna, and they have a fully stocked vanity with everything you possibly need after taking a shower. They even have hair styling products and tools to let you do your hair before you leave.

-LOCATION: Is not convenient!  it is only connected to Bellagio.  U have to take tram to aria or take outside sidewalk path to cosmopolitan.  Far back from the strip so lack view.

- POOL: had fecal matter (poop) so we had to leave the pool for them to sanitize it.  Another guest stepped on glass and cut his foot.  It is extremely windy where the pool is, where all your belonging including the lounge chairs gets pushed into the water when the wind picks up. Jacuzzi was dirty with leaves and bottle caps.

-SHOWER: leaks water into the bathroom area

- RUDE SERVICE:  I advised the front desk assistant mgr Anar Shah about the pool situation and she had the nerve to say ""I don't believe you.""  Talk about bad customer service!!!  And of course they didnt have staff to fix the shower leak.

-NO LATE CHECKOUT.  They don't know what a queue is!  They seem to think that all their housekeepers can clean all +500 check out rooms at the same time.  check out by 11 AM so us latebirds forget about!

-PULL OUT BED - no sheets, no extra pillows expect to have to request for it.

- CURTAINS - NO BLACKOUTS. They use roman shades so there are gaps between the shades.

While I like to partake in my fair share of 'Vegas festivities' it was nice to avoid the ""typical"" Vegas scene once we came back to our hotel rooms away from the drunken masses living and breathing on the Vegas Strip, honestly it was nice to just enter a lobby that was not a casino!

We booked a suite during our visit and the room was spacious and clean & accomodated my friends and I really well. We got a city corner suite so we had a really nice view as well! The suite was well equipped with the bedroom, a huge bathroom, a kitchen, and a living room area. These living quarters had amenities that were all really useful during our stay, especially since we all had somewhere comfy to sleep since the sofa was also a pull-out bed!

To note on the kitchen, there were no dishes available for use. However, we did order room service....literally for soup and hot tea and it was unlike any room service experience I have ever had. They set up the dining table and even brought bread and water for us! ALL. FOR. SOUP. I mean, c'mon?! Where can you find that kind of service?! Because no place can come to mind.

Also, if you decide to put the ""Do not Disturb"" sign on your door you may be missing out on getting your free daily water bottles! It's important to stay hydrated in the Vegas heat - so don't be afraid to call down and see if they can bring you some up. Free of charge! 

The biggest game-changer for me was that upon request, you can have a humdifier sent up to your room. I suffer from chronically dry skin and eczema so this was a big deal for me. It was the difference of being able to not only breathe easy but feel comfortable while I was in my hotel room. Makes all the difference. They even bring distilled water for you to add if it runs out during your stay. 

Biggest complaint was that the WiFi was very spotty and hit-or-miss. Sometimes it would connect to my friends' devices but wouldn't connect to mine...

Overall, I had a pleasant stay at Vdara and could definitely see myself returning. While I do enjoy the ""turnt up"" scene that Las Vegas provides, sometimes it's nice to be away from all of that and regather your piece of mind. Thanks for a wonderful stay, Vdara! Until next time!",4,0,3

On the positive side: very attractive and well-appointed rooms, amazing location in City Center, walking distance to Aria, a non-casino hotel with a very friendly staff.

However, the friendly staff seemed uniformly underinformed. When my wife asked about using the pool, she learned that it was closed, but she could hike half a mile and use the pool at Aria. She hiked, only to find out that Aira pool didn't open until 9 A.M. No one bother to mention that fact. When she returned to Vdara, she was told she could use the jacuzzis in the fitness center. She wandered around the spa level looking for the jacuzzis, only to be told that she could use the fitness room (very crowded already), but would need to pay another $20 to use the spa. The ""resort fee"" didn't include that little extra. 

Other odd invconvenience include the mysterious locations and functions of the light switches in the room. You can't turn on lamp A without first having turned on switch B, which is not only across the room, but in the kitchenette. As another reviewer pointed out the ""suite"" aspect means that you walk through a kitchenette to reach the bedroom. 

Our room was very comfortable as a place to spend time, and not just a crash pad. The sofa was comfy, but positioned at a90-degree angle to the TV (which didn't matter to us, since we don't watch TV). 

The bathroom had one little peg about half the size of your little finger, but no hooks or racks for hanging clothes or towels. There's a closet in the bathroom, but it's not deep enough for the standard hangers provided in the main closet. No bathrobes (as similar properties in Las Vegas provide). Hard time finding washclothes. However, the free-standing tub was VERY nice. 

Bring a flashlight or your own nightlight, because the bathroom sliding door is translucent glass, which is very fashionable until someone wants to use the bathroom at 2 A.M. Thankfully, one of the bathroom lights is on a rheostat, but can't be turned down low enough to prevent a flood of light on the remaining sleepers. 

This may be getting picky, but the elevators were always hot, as tho there was no air ciruculation at all. Small point, but it is just one more minor discomfort that adds up to a general feeling of something being not quite right.

The front desk that checked me in was super friendly, very helpful and efficient. I was put in a corner suite, and he made sure that the room was ready beforehand since I was checking in a little early. 

The notch down in half a star is due to the fact that the room was very clean, but not as clean as it could have been. Overall, the hotel cleaning staff did a great job when they did tidy up the room. I was there for five nights, and I did not have them come in every day. However on the last day, whoever did come in, went above and beyond. They fixed the toilet paper holder which was broken off when I checked in, and did a much more thorough job cleaning the room then when I checked in. 

I love how small the hotel is, but its proximity to everything else. I'm pregnant so I preferred to stay at a non-smoking venue. The massive plus side of not having to walk through a casino is that I could go for my room down the elevator and out the door within 5 minutes. Downstairs was a Starbucks, which I did not love. Although the workers were very nice, you had to tip in advance on the machine, and the cashier was so distracted that he forgot to write up a cup with my drink, which meant that I waited quite some time for a drink that was not being made. Only after the entire area had cleared that I asked them about my drink. I didn't want to seem impatient after all. They quickly made my drink and it was burnt. This in no way reflects on the hotel or my review of it, but I just thought I should mention it in case anybody decided to grab a quick coffee on their way out. Or in my case, a not so quick coffee..

Upon checkout, the staff was amazing. The concierge was always very friendly.",0,0,0

We were in awe of the modern styling and color palette, which fits perfectly to my personal taste.  The room we were given was on the 14th floor with no strip view (which is fine by me) and included:

KITCHEN:  with a 2-burner induction range, mini fridge (1\/2 filled with mini-bar goods), microwave, sink, and lots of empty cabinet space (dishes and cookware available upon request)

LIVING AREA: King Sized bed with flexy individual reading lights, closet, Sofabed (with the most uncomfortable mattress), dining table, large flat screen wall mounted over a dresser, automatic shades and blackout shades, and an over abundance of small end and coffee tables

BATHROOM: Large soaker tub, individual shower stall, Toto toilet, and very contemporary shallow sink and other details.

Additionally, the key card needs to be shown to the guard in the lobby so you can enter the guest areas of the hotel. Also, you don't need to insert the key card into the door, but rather, hold it in front. It was a great convenience when your hands are full.

After getting over the initial overall impression, we started finding a lot of things amiss with the room, especially with this property being so new.  For instance, the shower head holder was missing, the shower curtain was just too small for the opening of the shower door, and the rug was coming out of the edging of the wall.  There was a weird smell coming out of the kitchen sink and we had to have maintenance\/housekeeping come up and clean it up. The smell never really completely went away, but was much better than when we first got there. Also, while the overall look of the bed and the headboard screams STYLE, the obvious ugly cheap bed frame really took away from it.  They should have gone with the complete look of a platform bed or at least put a bed skirt to hide the cheap frame.  Toiletries were actually pretty good, bed was so-so in comfort, overhead reading lights were loose at the base and unusable

The hotel is VALET ONLY so you'll be dishing out tips for the Valet. You COULD always park at the Aria or Bellagio and walk over -- the walk isn't far and the parking is free.  

The only food place in the hotel is the ""market place"" with lots of over priced convenience store goods, as well as a coffee bar, and plated meals. Again, all over priced, but for the ""image"" of the hotel, you should already know better.

Would I stay here again? Probably not unless I found the great online deal I found.  It seems that they tried really hard, but never really completely got all the details necessary for a complete flawless package.",0,0,0

So i looked at it and I paid a little bit more to get a Panoramic suite at Vdara! When we walked in, everything went smoothly at check in and we went upstairs to the room. The moment we walked it, it was breathtakingly beautiful, especially the view at night! It had a long narrow hallway that led to the kitchen, which had a refrigerator (with filtered water tap and ice!), stove, and microwave along with a four seating dining area. Behind that we had a living room that had a huge plasma screen tv with a couch, that supposedly was a pull out bed but we never used that function. Next the the kitchen was a really nice bathroom with two sinks, closet, a glass standing shower, and spa like tub! The one weird part about the bathroom was that there was a little section for the toilet, but there was no door to the toilet so you would have to lock the door to the entire bathroom and the second door that lead to the bedroom. Opposite the bathroom was the bedroom, which also had a plasma tv and really comfy king sized bed! It was so comfy that we found ourselves having trouble getting out of bed to go exploring!

Room service was pretty great, they would come in and set the table for you when you order a meal, no matter what it was. And they brought up flowers, which was really nice. 

My friend rented a car so there was free valet parking, which was pretty nice. 

The best thing about this hotel was discovered after we walked around the strip and walked through other hotels and their casinos. Vdara is SMOKE FREE! Coming from Chicago, I didn't realize that Las Vegas allowed people to smoke indoors. It was kind of horrifying to see that there were a decent amount of little children around and to allow smoking indoors at other casinos where they don't seem to have the best ventilation, I have to say I was thankful that I did not stay at any other hotel. I remember I was at the bellagio in the casino area for about 2 hours and my dress reeked of smoke! I was so disgusted I went back and took a shower right away at my nice hotel. 

Also my favorite part about the panoramic suite was waking up to an amazing sunrise, it was so beautiful. I was speechless.

It also has a little market downstairs in the lobby with some desserts. The only thing we bought there was some vanilla yogurt soft serve, we did most of our shopping at the walgreens that was on the strip. It was really a great location because it was near some other really great hotels that you could do stuff at.",0,0,0

As someone who doesn't gamble or smoke, it was refreshing to stay somewhere that had neither that you had to wade through just to get to the elevators. We stayed in the cheapest suite, which was still beautiful! Nice layout and features - we felt like we booked at an expensive hotel! 

The room service was yummy and the downstairs cafe was good (but a bit pricey). The staff was so wonderful, truly considerate and kind people. I felt like everyone was trained well and there to help us out! 

Also, we liked the free valet parking. I know some people listed that as a negative, but we thought it was great when we checked in around 10 p.m. and were able to just drop off the car with the valet.

Now comes the down and dirty on the Vdara - and I mean ""dirty"" literally. The suites were okay. One of them had a fold out couch that was broken. The front desk was called and an hour later a guy shows up at 11pm to say he was sorry but couldn't help us as the couch was heavy and he was getting off work in 10 minutes. Yeah, he actually said that! They did bring a single bed on wheels but we had to cram the other person in another room. Awful. 

In the premium room, there was - I dare say - an unknown liquid under the sink that could or could not have been a bodily fluid; but I prayed it was white opaque soap. Towels were stained with what I hope was rust, we never got any replacement washcloths so we used hand towels, the sink drained slow and gurgled, and a few bathroom tiles were loose and rocked when you stepped on them. Plus the mini fridge was broken and wouldn't go to a cold setting but remained at ""cool"" which is only slightly better than lukewarm. Oh, and our alarm clock (which is unable to be unplugged from a socket) kept going off at odd times and the off switch didn't work. 

The pool was disgusting and when I got out of it (note I was not wearing lotion or anything on my skin before) I was covered in oil from the slick that resides on the water surface. So gross! 

We also got disgusting food from the marketplace and The Bar Vdara: how about some strange liquid from old berries in the middle of your yogurt parfait? or a plate of soggy calamari while it sits on a shelf covered by plastic wrap? or better yet, nachos that probably were made using ingredients prepared more than 24 hours ago? Yeah, I thought not. Again, awful. 

Lastly Vdara has ""complimentary valet parking"" which translates to having to pay each time you want to use your car (we felt so bad for the valets as they run themselves ragged to get the cars out) and a good 30 minute wait with everyone else and their mother during peak times in the morning and evening. 

Yeah, take it from me - avoid this place at all costs!!! It's is not worth staying at for free let alone for the prices they charge for their ""premium"" rooms.",5,5,1

It has it's own kitchen with fridge, stove, coffee maker and microwave. There's a closet which has a washer and dryer and a 1\/2 bathroom with a dining table and living room with TV and pullout bed couch for extra guest.

Unlike places like the Trump, Four Seasons, etc., Vdara is centrally located so that the walk to several tier one hotels is literally 30 seconds to 3 minutes away (Aria, Cosmo, Bellagio most notably). Add to that the convenience of having huge rooms at low prices through M Life promos and now a personally verified lack-of-death-ray (Google 'Vdara death ray' if you don't get the reference), and you have a solid place to stay in Vegas.

-1 star for the fact that the toilet's water circ system made it sound as if the thing was speaking to us in tongues (verified by my friends).

1. It is not easy to walk to the strip. It seems the pedestrian experience was an afterthought. It should not advertise itself as being on the strip as it takes too long to get to it. The path seems completely made up at the last minute of construction.

2. Overall, it's like the place was not really finished. They say the rooms have kitchenettes, but no plates, cookware, or anything else are supplied without calling. The doors don't have pull or push on them, and they are large. There is no self parking, so it is time consuming every time you need to get your car.

3. While the price of the room is reasonable, the price of nothing else is. $15 for a martini? $6 for a latte? You're kind of trapped within the Center, and the prices of all food and beverage are much higher than the rest of the city.

If the tiny detail had even been alluded to during one of my numerous phone calls with the hotel to inquire about this particular amenity, the reservation would've been cancelled promptly on the spot. And why is it mentioned only AFTER I'm checked-in, angry and disgruntled? HATE.

Secondly, the staff needs to know it is NOT OKAY to let themselves into a guest room when bringing sheets and pillows requested 2 HOURS AGO, and said guests have given up on waiting and fallen asleep. It scared the crap out of me, I swear if I was sleeping with a gun under my pillow, housekeeping would have gotten shot.

We brought our two french bulldogs with us and were treated so wonderfully by all of the staff.  They gave us a goodie bag at check in with treats and a blanket plus a dog food menu (we did not order from this, sorry dogs!).  

The Staff:  BEYOND friendly, kind, helpful, you name it, they were wonderful.  This may have been the best service I have experienced at a hotel.  

Dog friendliness:  Excellent.  Our dogs went everywhere, even hung out in the lobby bar (Vice Versa) for a few hours with no problem.  The amount of attention all of the staff gave our girls was awesome.  I think having the dogs around makes every one generally happier people :)  My only complaint would be that many people did not pick up after their dogs in the dog park area, but that isn't the hotel's fault, people are just lazy and gross.  Pick up after your dog!  

Pool:  Personally I loved that the pool was low key and quiet.  I didn't want to be at a pool party like so many of the hotels do now days.  I wanted to put my head phones on, have a cocktail, and relax.  I paid extra to have a reserved chair so that in case it was crowded I wouldn't have to fight for a spot.  My chair was mine for the entire day, I could leave, come back and it was still all mine.  Love that.  Again, all of the pool staff were very kind and accommodating.  

Room:  The room was great, the view was great (and I didn't pay for a ""view"").  I cried a little when I had to leave because that bath tub was the greatest thing ever.  

Food:  There aren't a lot of food options in the hotel but that didn't bother me all that much.  I did feel that the prices in the cafe were ridiculous however it's understood because nothing is cheap in Vegas any more!  The cocktails in the lobby bar were super tasty!  Ordered some pasta from room service one night and it was actually really delicious!  

The ""resort"" fee in my opinion is just expected now days at most hotels.  Typically you pay the resort fee plus a outrageous parking fee.  If they just added that into the nightly rate then nobody would be complaining about it.  You do get free wifi and the wifi was actually good except at the pool area...the pool you're in some weird vortex of no connection at all.

The place is very modern looking, clean and it's a relaxed vibe since there isn't a casino here. I hear it's a bit on the pricey side to stay there, but I think it's expected since it's newer and the overall decor kind of gave me that vibe. Each time we came in, we had to present to them the card key which I can understand why they would have to, I just remember thinking it was a little annoying at first. We ordered something at the cafe there and was not impressed at all considering the cost of the food (too much money when you know there are cheaper eats elsewhere). I can't remember what exactly I got, but I remember two things: my egg was fully cooked but it was supposed to be over medium and the asparagus was burnt, like literally black. 

One thing that was a little annoying was one of the days we were there, both card keys were locked in the room and we waited FOREVER for someone to come by and help us. One of us even had to call the front desk to make sure someone was still coming. We did notice a lot of people checking in, but I don't know, you would think they could allow at least the janitorial crew to let us in, even when we had all the proof in the world they were staying guests there so that we didn't have to wait for, I don't know, a half hour, maybe an hour, outside the room just to have someone unlock the door.

It's in a great location, sandwiched in-between Aria and Cosmo (about a 2-3 min walk to each). You'll pay significantly less to stay at Vdara and still be in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the strip. There's also an internal walkway from Vdara to Bellagio, so you're really getting a three-in-one deal with staying at Vdara. And the rooms are really nice and spacious, although the layout is kind of funky. 

Docking half of a star for the front desk staff. The whole checking-in process was VERY long and somewhat unorganized. Maybe I got someone new, but both times I went to the front desk I had different people and both experiences were about the same. Very long and confusing. One of our two rooms wasn't ready until 3:30pm (30 mins after standard check-in time). To me, that's unacceptable. I'm going to assume it was because it was a Sunday and that's a big turn-around day for housekeeping. I'm not sure. But that was a lame first experience. 

Docking another half-star for the suite being so empty. For having a full-sized fridge, dishwasher, and oven I had expected to see a moderately stocked kitchen. There weren't any plates, bowls, utensils, pots\/pans, or any other kitchen supplies. If you want anything you have to request it from the front desk. Seems silly to me. There were about 6 small glasses that were supplied, but that's it.

It's a quick walk to Aria where there are tons of good restaurants, Crystal for glamour shopping, or the Cosmo if you want to party like Mr. Chow. So overall great experience, but there were some things that were less than 5 star.

We had a fancy corner suite with full kitchen, dining and living areas, with a gorgeous view of Bellagio water fountains, LINQ ferris wheel, the strip and the snow covered mountains. But there wasn't any sort of hotel guide in the room so I have no idea what room service, spa service or other amenities could have been had. The kitchen was useless since it didn't have a single pot, plate, fork or napkin in any of the cupboards. The suite did have a washer\/dryer. I used the dryer to fluff up my clothes - no iron required. :-)

The bathroom was separated from the kitchen\/dining area by a sliding door and there was no door to the bedroom. And there was no door for the little toilet room either. So awkward if you have friends come to the room to hang out before going out. Also, for the size of the suite, there way only one single clothes closet that was barely big enough for one carry-on bag worth of stuff, not enough space for a couple let alone if you had anyone using the sofa\/bed.

The location was also very inconvenient. Although centrally located its behind the Aria so you have to get through the Aria to go anywhere. It took us about 15 minutes to get to Planet Hollywood across the street. But our Suite was beautiful and we used the kitchen all 3 days to cook our meals. No kitchen supplies are in the room but all you have to do is call housekeeping and tell them what you need. Valet parking also was not at issue for us.

I had never visited the Vdara and was really pleased with our city-view corner suite. I found an excellent rate online about three weeks ahead of time and as a whole, I am pleased with what I experienced.

First off, the hotel is beautiful, clean, and the staff maintained a helpful and pleasant demeanor in every instance. Like many of these reviews correctly mentions, the Vdara does not have its own casino but is linked directly to the Bellagio and a short skip away from the Aria. You can also access the Cosmo via the street pathways. I went to all three casinos easily and readily throughout the weekend.

The only downside to my stay was the unanticipated room service fees (I did not order food or drink, we were simply charged asking for plates and utensils. Our room had a full kitchen but no common kitchen utensils one would normally expect). Fortunately the charges were small and I wasn't about to complain. I should also mention there is no self-parking; you must valet to park nearby.

Overall, the vibe is young and the hotel is quiet. I found some people partying in the lobby bar but I assume most people head to the trendy Cosmo casino\/Bellagio.

I had a very special guest who visited me from Japan and she wasn't really interested in gambling but wanted to see the Strip and be in the middle of all the action. So logically, Vdara seemed like a good choice. It paid off. It was a staycation for me and we had a very comfortable time here. 
This hotel is very modern, clean and most importantly, the service was outstanding for the most part. The bars downstairs and the eateries are very convenient. The whole ambience was very upscale and we loved the feeling. The crowd didn't seem nearly as typically annoying as most strip hotel tourist crowds as well. 
The room itself was beautiful. Similar feel to Aria, except more spacious. There are two TVs inside so you don't have to fight over what to watch. There's also a dishwasher, stove and microwave as well. But they don't leave any appliances (such as a pot for water, cups) or silverware inside the room, so you'll have to ask for them. And you have to ask for slippers as well. I guess that would be my only gripe about this place. I think these things should be automatically provided. 
The spa was gorgeous. We got the signature 'Espa Escape' service there and, my goodness, it was one of the more memorable services I've experienced on the Las Vegas Strip. 
Parking at this hotel is valet-only, so don't show up here and drive around in circles looking for the self-parking.

- Useless greeter at the check-in counter who holds and iPad as if he's very posh and can direct people with an ipad(?) With a staggering long line of customers waiting to check in. What is the purpose of this greeter if the line isn't moving any faster?
- Terrible slow service at the bar. I sat down to meet friends who are already eating and drinking at the bar and asked for drinks. Bartender barely acknowledged it and spent next 20 mins being busy with something else (it's a small counter so we see everything that she's doing). My friend finally asked how long it is going to get some liquid.

Made several more phone calls after 10:00 and waited outside the door at since 11:00 because I didnt wsnt to wake anyone up. Finally after several more phone calls someone brought extra blankets. I had offered to go downstairs to pick it up myself but they would not let me.

 The next day- I called from outside asking to clean our room because my mother in law had forgotten to switch the ""housekeeping"" light on and when we got back to our room it was not cleaned. I called the manager (Jordan)to complain about this and she was no better. She was so unfriendly and cold. 

I am sure this doesnt happen eveyday but this was my experience.

Finally we are going back after 5 nights at Vdara. Besides this bad feeling everything else has been very good.",0,0,0

If I remember correctly, we booked two nights in a Panoramic Suite. As we checked in, we got a complimentary upgrade to a One-Bedroom Suite. Nice! The room was spectacular. An entire unobstructed view of the strip, spotlessly clean, plush bathrobes, roomy bathroom, with even a kitchen (not that we needed it). 

We did enjoy that Vdara was just a hotel. It is sometimes nice not to walk into a lobby with slot machines and blackjack games surrounding you in every direction. I think this is a big plus. 

During our stay, we did get take-out from their cafe downstairs. It was good, but pricey. Yes, I know we're on the strip. Our last morning there, we ordered room service. Timely, friendly, and sufficient, but nothing ""wow"" about it. 

I definitely enjoyed my stay here and would recommend Vdara. I think next time we splurge, I'll try to save up a couple of paychecks to stay at the Mandarin Oriental.",1,1,0

* booked a 'winter package' for my folks. supposed to have 'welcome treat' upon arrival. took an hour and a half to receive, after several calls to dining services. weak.
* charged $35\/nite for modest upgrade, although i am an M-Life member
* charged $20\/nite 'resort fee' - which basically means 2 small bottles of water. total joke and rip off.
* no coffee maker in my 'deluxe room', only in parents suite. even then, only 1 pod of caffeinated coffee per day, had to go into hall and ask maids for extras, which they nicely gave.
* no outlets bed-side. you have to be kidding me.
* Vdara market is a hectic, stressful experience. customers climbing all over each other, yet the service is a slow as hell cluster f&#ck. people bumping into one and other, 20 mins to get 3 smoothies (@$8\/piece), customers complaining that the coffee dispensers empty. dreaded going there.

i mean come on, vdara. you have european appliances in the kitchens, high quality fixtures and materials and you cheap out on the basics? i suggest you return to Hospitality Management Training at your local community college and apply those principles to your property.

PROS
* smelled good inside hotel
* free valet parking. although i guess you end up paying for it in the end with the 'resort fee'.
* maids were nice and gave an extra coffee pod. wooooooo!

will i stay here again? if its free, yes. if it costs me a penny more? nope.",0,2,0

Granted, it's only 3 years old, but the property is still impeccable! We checked in on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving close to 10 pm and there was no line. I never saw the line more than 10 or 12 people as we walked through the lobby.

The room itself was very nice. Bathroom is extremely clean (which is my biggest marker of a clean hotel room!). There's a microwave, a hot plate, and a mini fridge. Layout is nice. Having a place to sit and watch at tv outside of the bed is really nice! Bed was very comfortable as were the pillows.

We booked a lake view room and on the 34th floor had a great view of the Bellagio fountains. I was extremely pleased with our view!

Bathroom is gorgeous. I'd be happy to model my dream bathroom like that.

Room was extremely quiet. We were right around the corner from the elevator and I didn't hear a single person or the elevators. Elevators were fast and quiet.

Being 6 months pregnant, I was happy to find a place that was 100% smoke free and there was no casino. There was quick access to Bellagio and the tram to Crystals and Monte Carlo which made going to the south end of the strip a breeze!

Drawbacks: ""blackout"" curtains leave some gap and lets some light in during the morning hours. No sit down restaurant or buffet. The food at the ""market"" was just ok.

We'd happily stay here again and definitely have a view of the fountains again. It was a great stay!",0,0,0

The staff were awesome - very friendly, helpful and pleasant.  The location is, in our opinion, one of the best in Vegas - easy access to most everything.  The pool gets pretty murky by mid-afternoon but I suppose that's to be expected with all of the suncreen and sweat (ewwww ;) and I'm sure most other places have the same problem.  The cafe charges an astronomiocal $19 for bacon and eggs, but the other deli and snack items are reasonably priced.  We loved the relative quiet (besides all the kids at the pool) and the non-smoking.  So close to Bellagio, just talk a stroll over there for a more reasonably priced breakfast :)",1,2,1

The reservation process for our Two-Bedroom Penthouse was quick and easy. Since my group was arriving the afternoon before my actual birthday, Billy at Reservations was extremely helpful and allowed for one of my friends to be the main person on account, with my name listed as well so I could still make any changes\/requests on the reservation. 

About a month before our trip, I received an email for concierge requests i.e. complimentary limousine transportation to and from the airport (included with a hospitality suite, penthouse, or loft reservation), restaurant reservations, tickets for shows, cabanas at the pool, ESPA services, and more. I booked airport transportation for two of my guests and dinner reservations at ARIA's Lemongrass via email. I received responses in a very timely manner. 

The complimentary valet service set a lovely first impression. The bell desk helped us unload our car and checked our bags until we were ready to have them sent to our penthouse. Check-in was a breeze. If you are college students (like us) or travelers on a budget, do keep in mind that there is a $100\/night authorization required for incidentals. If you use a credit card, it is just a pending transaction and will be immediately released back to your credit line after you check-out. If you use a debit card, it will do a hard transaction but will be refunded to your account within 3-5 business days after check-out. The lobby desk representative was nice and made fun conversation while he checked us in. 

We were assigned a Bellagio Lake view penthouse on the 55th floor. It was absolutely beautiful. All of the amenities listed for the penthouse on the website were accurate, but nothing compares to seeing it with your own eyes! The full-size fridge fit all of our groceries and drinks, the MP3 hub through the TV allowed us to hook up our iPhones to amp us up for the evening, the rooms were spacious, the beds felt like clouds, and the bathrooms were beautiful & the water got hot fast. The washer & dryer came in handy for the men to remove wrinkles from their dress shirts without the hassle of an iron. 

A few of the other highlights of the amazing customer service Vdara provided for us: the housekeeping lady visited us to ask if we wanted extra robes, slippers, water bottles, dish soap, laundry soap, etc. and also brought us a fruit bowl; the Market Vdara in the lobby provided complimentary salt & pepper and butter for cooking (save some money and don't let the full-size kitchen go to waste); my mother ordered a bottle of champagne to be sent to our penthouse while we were out and Dylan, her concierge, set up the bottle on our dining room table and threw in a gorgeous plate of chocolate covered strawberries as a surprise for us to come back to; and Mike, the security man at the pool, was very nice and explained the pricing on cabanas and chaises for us. We did not get a chance to go to the ESPA, for which we had four complimentary entries, but we will definitely go during our next trip. 

The true shining star of this trip was Dakota at the lobby desk. We requested a late checkout (complimentary until 12pm) and reluctantly completed our stay through the TV's checkout feature on our final morning. As we approached the border between Nevada and California, I realized I had left my MacBook in the drawer of the TV hub. We immediately turned around and headed back to the Vdara as we were only 40 minutes into our five hour drive back home. I called the concierge at the Vdara and they transferred me to Lost & Found. After waiting on hold for 10 minutes, I was connected to Security at the ARIA who told me that the Lost & Found rep was out of the office that day and housekeeping doesn't bring down found items until 6 or 7pm. He took down my information to pass along, but I decided to go back to the hotel anyways. 

Dakota, who had already helped out one of my guests on our first day and left an amazing impression, was incredibly kind and professional. He explained to me that Security at ARIA was right, the Lost & Found rep wasn't there, but he said he would call Housekeeping to see if they had found it and, if not, he would go downstairs himself to see if he could recover it for me. He offered us water bottles during our wait and asked us to sit on the bench across from the lobby desk. After about 10 minutes and several updates from Dakota (who did end up leaving the desk to go speak with security), the security guard brought down my MacBook. Dakota went above and beyond any of my expectations. I am so grateful to him for being genuinely concerned and involved in the recovery of my computer. He really polished off my already positive impression of the Vdara and now I cannot imagine myself staying anywhere else for my future visits to Las Vegas.",0,0,0

When we entered our room, we found a lamp broken, windows filthy and smudged, dust engrained in the room service book, broken, chewed on, chipped remote control, bath floor didn't appear recently cleaned,  shower valve leaked, the shower sprayed on the wall so you had to stand against the wall to get wet, closet door wouldn't close so the interior light started on, dining table was dirty with crumbs, and just 1 body towel. Also, plan extra time if you have to get somewhere because the elevators are so slow.  We were almost late to a show because the elevator took over 10 minutes to arrive. When we called the front desk to express our discontent, they didn't offer to move us, they didn't offer to make it right, they didn't apologize.  I had to ask if we could move (they didn't have an available room to move to and said WE would have to check back the next morning...why is that OUR responsibility?). When I asked what else they could do to remedy these things they said they could bring us a new remote...seriously? Thankfully housekeeping did bring us more towels and cleaned our windows so bravo to them for acting quickly. Housekeeping does deserve props though seriously...our room looked great everyday and they organized our things nicely in the bathroom each day. For a 4 diamond hotel this was a joke. I mean this hotel is still better than many of the other hotels on the strip (cool rooms, nice bathroom, fountain view, electronic shades) but if you're going to tout 4 diamonds then follow through.  We won't stay here again for the cost.  Cosmo or Aria next time will get our money because they actually earn their luxury status.",0,0,0

The suites are beautiful and always clean, but there are things that bothered me at my stay... The good things I enjoyed were the beautiful suites, comfortable beds, and good view of the Bellagio Fountains.  The bad things about the hotel are that you are charged $25\/night regardless of whether you use high speed Internet, house keeping, waters, etc.  BE SURE YOU KNOW THERE WILL BE A BILL AT CHECKOUT!  Also, there were staff that constantly hound you at the elevators asking to see your room key.  VERY ANNOYING especially when you have full hands and have to stop and dig the room key out of your wallet!  After the 1st night I got so sick of being asked constantly for my room key that I kept walking passed them when I was asked.  The resort itself is beautiful however the hidden fees and annoying pestering of staff wanting to see my room key every time I want to go to my room took away my enjoyment of staying at the Vdara.

I stayed in both a split and full room of which by the way all rooms are suites! The out the door price per night was fantastic on both trips for work and the ""Wow"" factor for me was when one of the early morning car valets recognized me from my first trip in early March and acknowledged me on my second trip at the end of April. In addition, I like the fact that the planners had really thought about the access entering and departing the hotel when using a car as you can enter on the backside of the hotel on Harmon Ave and not have to fight the mobs of people walking on Las Vegas Blvd. Great job Vdara!

Stayed here for my birthday and couldn't be more pleased with the room and the service. We got here around 8pm on Friday night and check in was easy, no hassle.

Even better at check in is when the guy at the front desk upgraded us for FREE to a penthouse with a view of the strip (honestly they probably over booked but hey I'll take it)

The room was nice and comfortable with an open air design so there was room to roam around. Comfortable bed makes you feel at home with a view of the strip that's breath-taking. 

The service was great, call the concierge and they bring up everything in a timely manor, my friend asked for a pot haha. It's a non-gaming hotel so you have to walk to Aria to gamble which can be a hassle for some people but not a big deal to me since I don't gamble too much.

2. bellhop service (pick up and drop off) 
3. absolutely anything brought to your room. 

I do have to add that the customer service is excellent though! Even with all the tip service! 

downstairs in the lobby, there is a small bar\/dance area and a seating area. there's also a coffee shop. the whole first floor is small and everything can easily be seen from anywhere you stand. 

it's a short walk to the Bellagio and then to the strip, or you can use the tram in Bellagio to head the opposite way.

I am pleased to up my review of Vdara back to 4 stars!  I booked three rooms for us, my parents, and my sis and bro-in-law for a three-night stay.  

The rooms were smaller in that it was closer to a Studio, and not our usual larger room with separate living room and extra TV.  They allowed an early check-in and managed to get us all three rooms close
together on the same floor.  Housekeeping staff did an excellent job this time, and we had no issues whatsoever.  Everyone had a nice, relaxing stay.

Other things I learned about Vdara:

+ They have free boarding pass printouts in the business center.  Well, not exactly free since you have a resort fee!  Still, places like Encore and Paris charge customers computer and print time!

+ Uber\/Lyft pickup stations right outside the hotel, and they come fast! Lots of UberXL available that can take six people whereas cabs are limited to 5 by law.

+ You can refill water at the gym, if you don't want to hike to CVS or ABC Store.

- The SB is about 50% higher than in Beverly Hills\/LA according to my bro-in-law.",6,3,4

Stayed here this past weekend for a nice weekend getaway post birthday trip and was not disappointed.  I had heard mixed reviews because ""it's so far from the strip"" but when I arrived I was so impressed.

First thing's first: NO CASINO - which means no BS when trying to find the check out counter and the elevator.  The last thing you wanna do after a drunken night or even a long day is try and navigate your way through a casino

Secondly: there's a nice walkway to The Bellagio (where we ate dinner and watched a show) and a nice path to Aria..

Third: The bed was a BED OF CLOUDS. Loved it.  It took me and the bf both down for afternoon naps

Fourth: A relaxing and calm vibe.  Nothing crazy or out of control

The pool was awesome.  We were able to find pool chairs right away (we went at 10:30) and the vibe is just really chill.  I do wish they played louder music but that's the low key party animal in me.  The service at the pool left much to be desired...there weren't enough cocktail waitresses and the drinks took a while - but we just went to the bar.  Food at the pool was so yummy.  Chicken tenders...totally hit the spot.

The resort fee is a little steep...okay WAY steep...you get wi-fi and 2 little bottles of water...they couldn't just throw in a regular sized bottle?

Housekeeping was nice.  They folded our clothes we left awry and arranged the bathroom...they did not provide extra shampoos and conditioner..most hotels just leave you another set...which isn't really a complaint..just an observation.

Overall, I'm definitely staying here again and recommending this place to friends. You never really have to leave City Center for all of your needs.",3,0,1

however, after being very excited with this news, stepping inside our suite, i was dramatically depressed by seeing that it was nothing different to what we booked, a executive corner suite. very upset, i went to the representative and he said that this is a penthouse suite but with a different floor plan, which upsets me more because it made me like he wanted to fool me. it is definitely different but he urged that it is the same which is a lie!

Especially after all the mixed reviews of this place on Yelp, I was a bit wary of spending 3 nights here instead of our usual choice. Yes, it is valet parking only when you arrive so unless you plan on self parking over at Aria next door and walking all your luggage over yourself just shell out the $2\/$3 and tip the guys. We chose to walk the strip whenever we left our hotel so our car ended up staying put in valet all weekend until checkout. 

The check in was accompanied with really good service and speed. We got an upgraded room on the 51st floor with a corner view suite by asking.  For such a high floor their elevators are quick! In no time we were in our rooms and checking out the city views throughout the room. The whole suite was immaculately clean with a small kitchen and dining area, washing and drying unit, and a huge bathroom with a separate vanity area. During the course of our stay, housekeeping visited everyday at the same time without having to request, which was nice. We had some friends over in our suite one night and our door was accidentally left open and security arrived to check to make sure our room was ok because they were alerted it was open. That's a plus to know they're actually monitoring this place and our rooms. So the only downside on my behalf is the lame resort fee that includes two bottles of water, wifi, and access to their fitness center which we didn't make use of.

Nice room, btw, same standards as when I stayed in here a few years ago. But they need to reevaluate their front desk employee:  MARISSA!

So we booked this hotel 2 months ago for our anniversary, even called ahead and asked to be put on a higher floor. So we get to the hotel by 3 pm for their check in because we wanted to make sure we'd have the room we wanted. MARISSA, checked us in and told us we would be getting the 45th floor, but then 5 mins. later proceeded to tell us that the we'd have to settle for the 20th floor because the people who had the room on the 45th floor hadn't done the rush check out. She told us there was nothing she could do because the hotel was fully booked and we countered back that it was unfair to get a lower room especially since we booked a long time ago. Finally she told us she could get us a room on the 49th floor but that we'd have to wait a few hours to actually get it since the room still had to be cleaned. So whatever, we took the room, paid for everything and she gave us a room key but wouldn't tell us our room number. So around 5 pm we call and ask if our room is ready and they say they just have to shampoo the room but if we want they don't have to shampoo it and we can just have the room. We said no, we can wait because we still have to drive back anyways and then we asked if the room we were getting was still on the 49th floor, they said yes.

So we're driving, it's almost 6 pm and and we call to make sure the room is available and they said no it's not because they cleaned the wrong room! But they can give us a room on the 46th floor. We get to the front desk and we somehow get the same girl that checked us in earlier, MARISA. I explain to her what they just told us on the phone and she's totally unapologetic, shrugs her shoulders and tells us that we should have taken the room she offered us on the 20th floor! Finally we just tell her to give us the room on the 46th floor that was promised to us on the phone and she does, not talking or looking at us throughout the whole deal or even apologizing for the mix-up. 

So lesson of the story:  if you want a certain room call ahead right before you check in to make sure it's ready and you don't have to wait 3 hours or asked to be settle for a lesser room.

I'm certain that we will never book this hotel again just because of the hell we went to and we also will be telling everyone else we know not to book this hotel. We've had way better experience with front desk staff at cheaper hotels.

Fridge in our room is tiny btw, half the size of a decent-sized mini fridge.

And if you don't wanna keep doing Vdara's valet service, it's best to park at Cosmopolitan, west side and then just walk to Vdara (stairs).",0,4,0

No, seriously. We frequent Vegas and have stayed almost everywhere on the strip. This place takes the cake. Where do I begin? We got a great deal through the website and stayed in a deluxe suite. And this is the least expensive room? What, it gets better (relatively speaking)? Free valet was a plus, seeing as how there's no Vdara self-park. The young woman who greeted us upon entering was very professional and the receptionist explained all we needed to know about our room and stay. 

The room. Very nice. The whole City Center area is one of the highlights of ""new Vegas"". They make great use of the small space. Extremely clean--so much so that I CONSIDERED using the tub (never got to it). We stayed 3 nights and look to book more in the future.",1,1,1

It is not visible from the strip. There is only 1 bar and one cafe. I wasn't able to check out the pool, but they have one. 

Service was nice and professional, but not bending over backwards for anyone. The bell hop service was nice. The rooms were very comfortable, but I find it awkward to be staying in an owner's suite, where they're renting out your place to random people who book on priceline. I would not invest in a property here.

Everything about this hotel is absolutely beautiful...the decor, the hotel layout and even the amazing spacious suites. For once, my non-smoking hotel room did NOT smell like smoke. I was extremely pleased. My favorite thing about this hotel is the outdoor seating area in front of the hotel. I recommend laying down on the long swinging chairs and sipping a nice cold cocktail. 

The only thing lacking from this hotel is a formal restaurant, however the little cafe and the cute bar on the first floor makes up for it. For two nights on a busy weekend I spent about $489.

Cons: Feels like the majority of the furniture in the room is made of Ikea. The rooms are very dark at night - not much strong or useful lighting in the rooms. No restaurant on site. There's a small deli counter, but if you want a real meal, you're probably going to find yourself at Aria. Customer service was lacking big time.

Personally, I loved the rooms here more than The Cosmopolitan's (TC) Terrace Suite.

Room: Though everything else at TC was stunning, the room design was inconsistent and seemed confused about what it wanted to be. At Vdara, it didn't try to be anything more than gloriously contemporary, modern and chic with clean lines, great lighting and technology-galore.

Pluses: Everything works on a master remote control from the multiple window screens that change how much light you want in your room to the flat screens (2!). All the accent lighting are on dimmers for a more romantic feel. The room maximize every square inch space, so even though it's half the size of the TC suite, the Vdara room felt just as spacious. The bathroom was massive with a frameless glass shower, soaking tub and dual sinks. Views were on par with the view from the TC. 

Minuses: Unlike TC, aside from the rooms, Vdara doesn't really have anything else going on. It was pretty dead--save for one sad little bar by the entrance. We even saw someone napping on the floor of the lobby with their luggage. After a week in Vegas, the consensus was pretty unanimous for the Vdara room--and The Cosmopolitan's amenities.",13,12,11

We arrived in Vegas around 8am (driving from Los Angeles)Friday morning, and although check-in time was at 3pm, I called ahead of time and asked if there was any way we could check-in earlier (even if there was a fee). The lady over the phone told me it was fine because they had plenty of rooms avaiable for early check-in. Score!

We got to the hotel, and the valet guy took our car, while the bell guy took all our luggage out. I waited in line at the front desk only to be told that I couldn't check-in early because our room was not transferable. Even though I told her I called prior to our arrival, and spoken to someone who assured me we would be taken care of, the lady at the front said, ""NO"". 

Talk about customer service! I wasn't too happy about that, and I thought Vdara would have been a lot more accomodating given the situation.
We had no choice but to leave and wait somewhere. I asked if they could call me as soon as the room was available, and she told me she would.

Four hours passed, and I never got a call. So, I called and asked if our room was available, and the operator said ""yes, it has been ready since 10am"". WOW.

I received no call, and no apology. 
I took a star off my rating because of this, and will try Aria on my next Vegas trip.

As for the room itself, it was spacious and clean. The mini-kitchen is great, and the bathroom has a soak tub and separate shower. The bed was a bit sunken-in in the middle though.

I agree with some of the views expressed here regarding long lines for check-in or checkout, but that's a small inconvenience to the clean and healthy environment. Try checking into the Bellagio, you will wait for about a day to be checked-in due to long lines. We had a view of Bellagio and Paris, and enjoyed the water-show from the comfort of our room. I requested towels and they were there in about 5 minutes, I found the kitchen to be spacious and if I needed to cook, I could have had done that, but who wants to cook? I mean, the buffets are part of the Vegas experience. 

I enjoyed a large tub, clean shower and bathroom. The TV can use real HD with more channels. The only drawback was the Wi-Fi, sporadic on the 45th floor and above. I found the Wi-Fi across at the ARIA to be super-fast and I used it when I went there for breakfast.

I didn't visit the pool or spa, but I understand it too small for a large hotel such as this one. Lastly, avoid free show tickets offers, they are scam and timeshare madness.

Upon booking my room (the Panoramic Suite), I decided to put some special requests in with my reservation. I've had a rough couple of months and asked if they could put a framed photo of Ryan Gosling on the nightstand as well as a written compliment to cheer me up. I also asked if I could have a room on a higher floor for a cool view. I did not expect any of these requests to be met and even wrote that I would understand if they could not be met.... Now to my actual arrival...

Tad, an incredibly friendly gentleman, checked me in. He offered a winning smile and informed me that all of my requests had been met, including my request for a room on a high floor. He then gave me my key for a room on the 54th floor. 

I was anxious to see the view from so high, but did not expect that not only was I high up, but they had upgraded me to a one bedroom penthouse suite! The room was remarkable and the view of the Bellagio fountains and Strip was just extraordinary. They also included a 3 sided frame with photos of Ryan Gosling (as requested), a compliment written on the notepad, and a laminated printout of Gosling that said ""Hey Girl, stay strong. I believe in you"". Their attention to detail and willingness to go the extra mile to make a guest happy is just wonderful. Aside from the dream-like room, I also had a wonderful dining experience...

I decided to order in room service so I could enjoy my room longer. I ordered the airline chicken breast served with mushroom and herb risotto and spinach. To drink, a bottle of UINTA Brewery Seasonal beer. The food was impeccable. Not only was this the best food I've had through any in-room dining, but it was also some of the best food I have had at any restaurant. My compliments to the chef! The gentleman who brought up my meal was also incredibly kind and set up my meal in a beautiful display on the dining table. 

My time at Vdara was perfect. The friendliness of the staff, cleanliness of the resort, sleek designs, and attention to detail were all 5 star!

The 1 bedroom suite was nice and spacious, and had a nice view. Windows were kind of open though...

The bedroom and bathroom was complete with all amenities but I was surprised the mini kitchen did not have ANY items. You would think they would at least have soap and some paper towels for the kitchen sink, right? One thing that kind of disappointed me was when we asked for utensils (to eat some food delivered to us).

day one - didn't realize it was a valet-only hotel, but whatever we used cabs all week anyway but more on the valet to come :-\/ check in was smooth, requested a fountain view room and they gave it to me (not surprised though it was a tuesday - friday stay so its not like the hotel was at capacity anyway)
the room: first impression was great we liked the set up of the room (2 tvs, one in the bedroom and one on the other side of the built in where the couch was.) we got the studio style room.
then it all went down hill from there none of the lights worked and the safe was open but locked so we couldn't store our items in it and go to the pool right away like we had planned. so I called the front desk and i told them the lights were out and that i didnt know how to use the safe. ""the instructions are on the inside of the safe"", says the front desk clerk. ""there aren't any instructions in my safe"", i said. ""well they should be, i dont know how to use it let me get someone who does"", says clerk""... REALLY? she must have been new. anyways we waited 30-45 minutes for someone to come up and fix our lights (they were shut off from the main electric panel in the room) and then i had to wait another 30 mintues for security to come unlock the safe and show me how to use it. 
At this point the pool was closing in an hour so we rushed to unpack, change and get down to the pool. 

the pool: its small but it does the job, luckily being midweek, it wasn't crowded but nothing impressive, my in-laws pool is nicer. 

first night\/morning after: being exhausted from traveling all day I crashed hard. next morning, i wake up with sharp pain in my lower back ( i sleep on my stomach ) and in the morning i inspect the mattress and spring box to find that it had been sat on my Godzilla and broke the mattress! probably the worst sleep i ever got in my entire life. so i call the front desk and i tell them politely that i think the mattress is broken . so again we wait 20 minutes for housekeeping to bring up a mattress for the sofa bed, apparently the clerk thought i was talking about the sofa mattress. keep in mind breakfast buffet was going to end in an hour and i wanted to resolve this before leaving but there wasnt any time  so i go down to the front desk after breakfast and let them know the whole situation and every problem with the room ( lights malfunction, water faucet pressure, safe, mattress and also the ac wouldnt cool lower than 75')  

the clerk was very nice, he apologized and offered to move us to another room, and offered to take care of the resort fees for us( which is great because we planned on visiting other pools and would have to pay the resort fees there in order to use their pool) we really didnt want to move rooms since we had unpacked and organized everything into our room. so that was a pain. but that mattress drove us out of that first room

anyway , get to the new room, its small. 1 tv. and different set up. so disappointing becasue we loved the set up of the other room. in the new room the couch didnt even face the tv. hated the lay out. but lights worked, ac went down to 71 and faucet had pressure. mattress still felt very used but better than the first. 

the rest of the stay (room wise) was just meh. 

check out; the hotel has a convenient method of checkout either on the television or through your mobile phone\/email but the guy at the front desk didnt delete the resort fees from my account so I have to get out of bed and go wait in line (friday morning when everyones checking in) and explain again that the room was crappy and we were promised no resort fees. guy takes care of it. again, nothing impressive i just had to ask twice for the same thing. 

go back to the room, get our stuff together and wait for the bell to come help with the luggage. he helps us load our stuff into the car. and we head over to the mgm to spend the day at their pool when i get out of my car i look driver side door and it is beat up! they scratched the paint and left marks from who knows what? shoes? it looks like they dragged a suit case into the car from the floor (see picture) and my car is new! and freshly washed just before getting to vegas i was so peeved. and i even tipped them! this is why i hate valet. my wife said we should go back and show them but i know how they would have responded. i really wish i would have gone back and made them pay for the damages.

then when we get to the mgm i wanted to lock the trunk since our baggage was in there while we were at the pool and the lock for teh trunk was damaged! i forgot my valet key at home so the valet had the real key that works for the trunk lock and they must have opened my trunk to see if i had anything of value in it. luckily i took everything out (laptop, jewelry, etc) just shows how classy this hotel is. 

NEVER STAYING HERE AGAIN! TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE!

Location-wise, Vdara is located near the Cosmo and Aria and directly across from Planet Hollywood. Bellagio is only a 5 minute walk as well. The hotel does not have a casino, which I find rather pleasant since the smoke and crowd casinos tend to bring are off putting. 

The suite itself was amazing. Our suite was on the 52nd floor (out of 56, I believe) with the view of Bellagio's water show and the Cosmo. The curtains\/shades were remote controlled and also had an option to black out the room just in case you're light sensitive. It was styled like an apartment with sliding doors dividing the living room and bedroom area. If you are like me, and water pressure is important to you for showers, take note...there were no issues with that :) 

The service overall was pretty good. The only cons of the whole trip was check in took quite a while maybe about half an hour, but that is to be expected as the majority of arrivals are around 3 PM. Secondly, we requested hangers and extra bedding. However, after waiting 30 minutes for it to arrive, we called house keeping once again and they stated we had never called, but they put in the request and it came 25 minutes later. I was bit annoyed, but I am willing to over look that. 

I recommend room service as well. We put in our order and the food arrived in a timely manner. They set up the dining table, and brought any additional things you might need to go with your meal. We ordered pasta, pizza, and chicken strips. Everything was delicious. My mother's pasta contained shrimp which she found extremely fresh and cooked perfectly. The pizza was okay, but the rest of my family really enjoyed it. My chicken strips did not fail to please my child-like appetite. So if you are starved from the long journey and have no energy to withstand a walk over to a buffet or restaurant, consider room service, you won't be let down. 

Overall, a stylish, clean, and convenient hotel to stay at.",1,0,0

My personal property (hair straightener) was stored in concealed compartment by the maid, when I realized my things were missing the staff would not return my personal items to me. (beware) 

I stayed at Vadara for two night switching rooms in between one of the nights.  On my way checking out, I realized that the maid had placed an item of mine in a concealed drawer in my first room. Beware of no handles on drawers.  I requested a staff member go in and retrieve my personal item. However, their staff told me the room is occupied.  They would however leave a message to the room to have someone in there check it. (They might as well tell me to scream to rock)   

My BIGGEST problem was that they refused to admit to any wrong doing and when I tried to reason with them they acted as tho my property was too cheap for there time. (even though they were the ones who took my things and basically hid it from me)   After an hour of pleading with them to retrieve my things the maid's supervisor accused me of arguing with them and threatened to call security. At that time I was MAD, I went downstairs to the lobby they gave me the same speech but did apologize.     
When I returned home 5 hours later, I call the front looking for an update. They asked me to explain the situation to them again and they would leave a message to the room. Outrageous!! They told to expect a phone call two days later. Outrageous!!

Grievance: 
1) My\/Guest items should not be tucked away- I FEEL ROBED 
2) They make their own rules as they feel fit: staff can go into rooms when they see fit
3) When I checked out the first time the room should have been thoroughly checked and my personal items should have been placed in lost and found!
4) After paying to stay there my concerns are no longer important to them.  

Loss
1) My property
2) My time

The driving entrance and lanes leading to parking\/valet are HORRIBLY DESIGNED!! It is very confusing to drive into the hotel..it is not on the front of the strip, you have to turn onto the side street...then you have to find a TINY ramp on the side with a small sign that says Vdara. we missed it twice and had to uturn to get in. Why did they make such a TINY, out of the way entrance to the hotel? do they not want to people to come here or to be able to find it? is this supposed to be part of their ""cool\/modern\/exclusive"" aesthetic??
Then once you get on this tiny, out-of-place ramp the parking situation is additionally CONFUSING and HORRIBLY designed!!!! there's several more crazy openings leading to self-parking or valet or leaving back to the streets. when we got in, we almost got onto the one leading right back into the street, cuz the tiny openings are everywhere and so confusing...and it makes you drive in circles... this place is horribly designed. then when we were leaving, we were driving the right way to go back to the strip (there were no ""wrong way"" arrows anywhere) and then in the lane next to the one that's supposed to lead you the strip is the lane for valet but it was so confusing i drove on to the valet lane and the guy just stopped and gave us a dirty look and said WRONG WAY you have to LEAVE and so we had to back out into the dangerous intersection of confusing lanes and risk getting crashed into just cuz they wouldn't let us circle back around using the valet lane... 
The location was good for us, cuz we just wanted to go to Marquee. It was a short maybe 10 min? walk to Marquee in the Cosmopolitan which is right next door. However it was freezing cold at night and we had to walk outside to get to it! The location is pretty centrally located on the strip. Except, it's located a little in the back of the cosmopolitan so that you can't see it or get to it directly from the front of the strip...

Customer service - SUCKS!!!! The check-in only had two people working even though there were like 7 check-in lanes. It was sooooo slowwww!!! and we were in a rush cuz we speeded there to get to the club since we were only staying for one night. i was soooo annoyed!!! and there's no line...so this other party of girls who i'm not sure was there before me or not got served before us. and the workers don't even acknowledge you when you walk to the check-in to let you know ""we'll be with you shortly"" or to let you know if you're next in the non-existent ""line"". 

Price - good compared to the other hotel prices i found online at the time. it was similarly priced to other older\/less modern\/ less aesthetically-pleasing hotels, and to hotels also in good location on strip. BUT i am not happy with the $28 ""resort fee""!! when the only extra thing we get is a couple small bottles of water...and there is nothing else to do in the hotel, no casino..

aesthetics: the hotel is new and pretty modern-looking...but when compared to the Cosmo next door t's def not as fancy or pretty-looking, it is pretty plain. and it has no casino or anything to do, so the lobby area is pretty small, and you just either go to the elevator to get to your room...or go outside to go to cosmo lol. 
We got the Suite with a king-size bed and queen-size couch bed. The room looked nice and modern i was happy with it! however i slept on the queen size bed and i wasn't happy with it cuz i was really cold because they didnt have any sheets or blankets for the queen size bed :((((",2,0,0

Also, there is only one king bed, which means the rest pile on the floor or the uncomfortable pullout.

Vdara is a nice hotel to choose if you want to avoid the craziness of Vegas. It's technically off the strip but a three minute walk gets you inside Bellagio or Aria! 

The rooms and staff are top notch! Definitely a plus when they remember your name! Cici helped me out several times and was able to get me extra keys and late check out! I had two rooms and one was upgraded to the city view. 

I recommend trying to get it upgraded or booking it over the deluxe because the room setup is nicer, more spacious and you get a good view of Vegas! Both have great identical bathrooms! I enjoyed the soaking tub. Room comes with a kitchen as well, didn't use it much except for the mini fridge for storing booze.

Hotel only has a Starbucks, bar and little food shop in the lobby. Pool was average. Not your typical Vegas pool full of drunk people and loud music.

My husband and I booked the basic deluxe suite and was upgraded to a panoramic suite on the 48th floor when I told  the desk clerk it was our anniversary :P The clerk informed us he was able to upgrade us so much because our stay didn't consist of the whole weekend. When we got to our room, we thought, ""JACKPOT!"" The place was really nice - like a really modern pad in The City (San Francisco, CA). We had windows spanning 270 degrees of our room. Our bedroom view was of the Rio and Canyon and from the bathroom, we had partial view of the Bellagio fountains and strip.

The panoramic suite is basically a very pimped up condo. It's very spacious at about 800 sq ft., comes with a full-sized stainless steel refrigerator, dishwasher, 4-burner stovetop and our very own washer and dryer! Talk about fully loaded! You have to ask for pots, pans, cooking utensils, knives, etc though. The rooms have sliding frosted doors separating the bedroom from living room so you can easily have privacy with people in the bedroom and living room (pull-out bed). 

The pool is very small and unimpressive including the wait staff there. I don't hang out at the pool much so it wasn't a big deal for me. Outside of the room, there isn't much else to Vdara but that's ok because there's a short connecting bridge to the Bellagio. Good location and reasonably price for center of the strip area (technically in the City Center but very short walk to strip by going through the Bellagio). Highly recommended!

Upon check in, we had already ran into issues.  Our friend, who's name the room was under, was not there yet and they needed a credit card for us to check in.  The girl at the front desk told us that anyone of us can check in but needed a credit card to hold the amount of the room in the meantime.  None of us were comfortable to do that but she said the amount was negotiable and that once our friend came down to officially pay for it, the hold would be taken off.  WRONG.

Vdara seemed like a perfect fit because we could party at Aria and Cosmopolitan and then retreat to a high end condo hotel. The hotel was nice enough for our discounted mid-week rate, but I would have been very unhappy if I had paid full price. The views are impressive, the check-in and concierge staff were great, and the valets are fast, but the bed was so firm that we had a hard time sleeping and the AC was hard to control ( too hot or too cold). There were some issues with housekeeping and service that you would not expect at such a high end condo hotel...

We picked a hotel with a full kitchen so we could cook breakfast (I have prediabetes and need to watch what I eat). The kitchen is empty. No silverware. No dishes other than two coffee mugs and no pots or pans. You have to call housekeeping for everything. And ""everything"" did not include a cutting board, sharp knife, or scrub brush for cleaning. When the maid cleaned she took my dirty coffee cup and frying pan and didn't replace them so we had to call down for more the next morning. Seems like a waste of my time and the staff's time. 

The hotel was also out of laundry detergent for the rooms so even if you wanted to pay a premium for it you couldn't use the clothes washer without going shopping elsewhere.

The refrigerator had one regular coffee pack and one decaf. There are two of us in the room, couldn't they spring for two regulars and two decafs so we wouldn't have to call housekeeping for more coffee? And no tea? Most people pay $300 a night for this hotel...I think the hotel could cover the cost of some tea bags. The people in the room next to us were a family with adult children and they had the same problem (including only getting two place settings for their entire family...lol). They also pointed out that the fold out bed was horribly uncomfortable for their kids.

We booked a cabana and it was advertised as having the capacity for 8 people. I really think that 4 is the maximum if you want to be comfortable in the heat. It took over 40 minutes for a server to check in on us in our cabana. After that the service was a little more regular (every 30-40 minutes), but not what you would expect when paying for a cabana.  I was glad we paid the discounted mid-week rate for the cabana. We did, however, really enjoy the pool food and privacy of the cabana pool.

We really liked the location and would only stay here again during the mid-week discount (but would select Trump over this hotel when we don't need to be near City Centre). This hotel will not be worth the weekend rate until they work out the kinks with their housekeeping service, AC, and invest in comfortable matresses.",0,1,0

We will never stay here again!   This horrible stay put a huge kink in our stay in Las Vegas.   We come here every year and we will never stay here again.   Many chances to redeem themselves, failed everytime.  Looks nice but looks are clearly deceiving.  I wonder if management ever reads these reviews?   Same complaints over and over!

Website was misleading, when stating each room comes with a king and queen bed, they fail to mention the queen is a pull out with a 2 inch mattress that you can see the coils sticking up.  I requested a feather mattress cover to throw over this poor excuse for a mattress 3 times.  When returning to my room at 11:00 p.m., there still was no cover as promised.  In addition, they charge a resort fee which is to include internet service.  However, internet did not work the majority of our stay.  Rarely even cell service.  Our last evening included road work outside our room with a jackhammer that ran from 10:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m.  Bad experiences can be remedied by the way a situation is handled.  This hotel management is far too young and not experienced enough to deal with these types of situations.  With so many fabulous places to stay in Vegas, I can't imagine this type of customer service working too long for the Vdara.",0,0,0

Since we were bringing the kids with us to Vegas (I know, I know...but my grandmother was going to be in town & we haven't seen her in over a year), we needed a kid-friendly hotel (i.e. space and a fridge). 
I ordered groceries from Von's that literally arrived when we did. I didn't want to have to mess with dishes being delivered. So, I just included plastic\/paper bowls, cups, spoons, towels, etc with the groceries. 
They held our groceries in their cooler until we got up to our room & then brought them right up. When checking in, they scheduled our linen delivery for the sofa bed. The sofa bed was NOT comfy. Glad the kids slept in it and not me! 
On day 2, the cleaning lady did a crappy job. Didn't leave washclothes, didn't pull the trash, didn't leave coffee, etc. The other days were fine. 

We didn't have any time issues with valet...even the time we left our ticket in the room. Tipping got a bit annoying (especially since we were getting the car out 2 times a day). 

We had a beautiful view of Bellagio's fountains! I didn't realize we could walk to Bellagio through the doors at the far end (around the corner) of the lobby until the last night. 

The Bosch washer and dryer were a lifesaver! Though small, they got the job done. Just watch the dryer b\/c it'll think your load is dry when it isn't. 

We got a good ""name your own price"" deal on priceline & upgraded to the full-sized refrigerator room once we got there (for an extra $40 a night). 

I'd stay there again, especially if we have kids in tow.",1,0,0

It was pretty crowded when we got there on a weekday during the summer, but check-in was a breeze and we were given our keys right away. 

Our deluxe suite was pretty nice considering the price and location on the Strip. Upon entering, there is a fully-equipped kitchenette (just need to call down for any pots, pans, or utensils that you need) and small dining area. Depending on the layout, there may or may not be a short wall diving the bed from the couch\/living room\/tv area. The bathroom was also very spacious, with a separate tub and shower and plenty of counter space for all the toiletries. 

Only a few downsides of this hotel: 1) There is no casino, so if you're looking to gamble you will have to cross the walkway and find your way to Bellagio's casino or talk a walk outside to Aria or the Cosmo. 2) There is no self-parking, so getting your car in and out of valet is a bit of a hassle during peak hours. 3) The dining options available are limited to mainly the Market at Vdara & Starbucks downstairs.

We came here for our wedding anniversary weekend 8\/24-8\/26 and it was an amazing experience from the start (my first time in Vegas with my wife :-). We cabbed it from the airport and check-in was super easy and the staff was very friendly and attentive. The first thing that I noticed and loved was that there wasn't a mass of people at the lobby like at Cosmo or Aria so it was easy to get to our rooms as the lobby area isn't huge. Also, the hotel smells great inside...whatever scent they are pumping into that place needs to be sold!!

When I walked into our room, there was a surprise waiting for us: champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, and rose petals from the door to the bedroom, bed, bathroom, and tub! My wife didn't specify on what to do, but just said that it was our anniversary and asked if they could do something special. The room itself was cool as it had a kitchen with a range, microwave and a mini-fridge and minibar. The living room and bedroom were separated by a half wall that had a flat screen t.v. on both sides. The bathroom was spacious with a shower and separate tub.

The overall service was very good from food service (for breakfast and they made quite a spread on the kitchen table!) and the spa. The pool is smaller than the pools at the other hotels, but not too bad. The only thing they need is to add more waiters outside by the pool area. It took us a while before we got served. The food and drinks were great!

Being as this was my first non-casino hotel stay in Vega, I really loved the experience and would do it again. Cosmo is right next to you (we were on the 34th floor and could hear a bit of the music from Marquee below) Aria is across from you and the strip (Planet Hollywood area) about a 10 min walk from the lobby so everything is quite accessible.

So if you are a married couple, family or a bunch of ladies who want to feel super pampered, and still stay close to the madness of Vegas then Vdara is the right place in Vegas! If you went with a bunch of guys\/girls who want to party hard, gamble all the time, and party at a day pool, this is not the right place!",5,0,3

I was charged exactly that, nothing more and no other hidden costs.  I arrived at 11:00 AM and was going to see if our luggage could be held until the room was ready.  I stopped by the front desk to see if, by chance, our room was ready.  I was told it would not be ready until around 1:00 PM but I could upgrade to a larger, city view room for $30 per night and it was available immediately.  I accepted the upgrade and was impressed with the additional room space and features.  

The hotel does not have a casino, so it is much less noisy, less traffic and no smoke.  The only downside is the limited number of dining options.   However, Aria is right across the driveway and takes about three minutes to reach.   There is also an attached corridor that takes you to the Bellagio which takes less than five minutes to reach.  

When checking in, the front desk staff was very welcoming and friendly.  I was traveling with my wife and 11 month old daughter.  The front desk agent, Teresa, anticipated my needs and had additional water, towels, crib and sheets as well as plastic bags sent up to place diapers in to reduce possible odors.  These items were very welcomed and came in useful.  
The front desk staff at checkout was just as friendly and seemed genuinely interested in my satisfaction throughout the stay.  The staff at the front door and valet\/taxi curb were also very friendly and helpful.  

Overall, the room was exceptional.  It was well-appointed, clean, and well maintained.  No issues were able to be found.  The rooms were very well soundproofed and I did not hear a sound outside of the room, aside from the helicopters that would fly by outside.  The property as a whole was elegant and in excellent condition.

Recently, I received a great offer from Vdara and my girlfriend and I stayed there while going to a concert at the Cosmo, which is next door. And I can honestly say, Vdara shot up my list as one of my favorite hotels. 

First off, the normal suite was very comfortable. The bed was top notch, as were the pillows. The furniture was very comfortable and the decor was also very impressive. I also love that the hotel prides itself on being energy efficient but it does not forget to be elegant. By that I mean all the modern appliances, like electric window curtains. I was also very impressed with the bathroom, shower and everything else. The electronic keypad is a little odd and I could see how someone who is stumbling back after a fun night may have a little problem with that but alas, that is not the resorts fault. 

Now the other reason for the 5-star review, the concierge was incredible. My girlfriend and I are extremely lactose intolerant but we also want to enjoy food in Vegas. We called down to the concierge and asked for her recommendation for a healthy buffet, kind of an oxymoron I know. However, the concierge called several other MGM Resort buffets and recommended either Aria or the Bellagio. Having eaten at the Bellagio, I was pretty sure that would work but the chef at Aria was willing to give us a personal tour of the each food item and if something had dairy, he would be willing to make it without dairy. We decided on there but before we left, the concierge sent us front of the line passes.  

I truly wish I remember the woman's name but we were so impressed that obviously she received a nice tip but also we spoke to her manager and told her just how amazing she was. 

Now I gamble, love it actually but I also like staying in a hotel without a casino. I believe that it allows me to have a better nice sleep, I will not stumble into a casino and just try my luck really quick and it was also keeps the drunks and smoke out of the hotel as well. But it is also really close to the tables, this case the Cosmo and Aria. 

My girlfriend and I also love to work out and thought the gym was very impressive. It had a large selection of cardio machines and free weights. It is a tad small but I expect not many people use it. We did not have enough time to visit the pool, even though it looked a little small nor the spa, which was expensive but looked wonderful. 

Overall, if you want a 5-star experience and wonderful customer service, I would highly recommend Vdara. On my many trips back to Vegas, I will always look there first.",5,1,2

+ Great superb service as expected
+ Staff doesn't miss a beat

- Beware of the $250 deposit fee, this is for any damages\/incidentals - You get it back in a couple of days after checkout.

I came here for EDC weekend and wow, what a great stay. They held my room even though I checked in pretty late around 3AM or so. Some hotels would put you down as a no-show, while Vdara kept mine (of course I called to notify that I'd be late..yes, other hotels would still give your room away even with notification). Only curveball that came my way was the $250 incidental deposit, but that was fine since I got it back anyway.

From the moment I checked in to check-out, It was a great experience. My room needed extra blankets, towels, cooking needs, etc and they weren't hesitant to come up and help with my requests. They accommodated really well during my stay. While the strip is a bit of a walk from it, it's not too bad at all. You can either go through the back lot of Cosmo or through Aria.

During my stay, I did get the chance to relax at the pool for a bit. I got to chat with some of the lifeguards and they were really cool! Made the stay even better! Kudos to them for staying out there with us! 

And some don't know, but you can check-out by using the TV. Just check your portfolio and go from there. It's a really easy process. I plan on staying here again next year, but unless they have a really good deal, I might find myself going elsewhere though. I'm still a huge fan regardless.",1,1,1

Anyway, Vuuhhdara is a decent place to stay if you want to stay in a more quiet hotel with newer rooms.  It is a short walk to the Aria and Bellagio casinos, and a slightly longer walk to Monte Carlo and Cosmopolitan.  The only nearby food is overpriced, typifying the nickel-and-dime-ing you see so much of in Vegas lately.  You'll have to go to the food court in Monte Carlo or the Planet Hollywood mall across the street to find something cheap.

The Parking situation is not great; you either can valet or self park at Bellagio or Aria and have a long walk.

Service is ok.  The check in guy seemed so bored he forgot he asked me how my trip was, and asked me again half-way through checking me in.  They usually will let you upgrade to a bigger room if you book a smaller one, though not necessarily for free.  Didn't try the $20 trick so not sure what that will get you.  Housekeeping seemed to follow the do-not-disturb \/ please disturb signals exactly... I never heard or saw them, but when we left and came back, the room was cleaned.

Although it does not have a restaurant, the Market Cafe has plenty of premade sandwiches and salads too choose from and a menu you can also order from.

King size bed, large bathroom with a tub deep enough to make a hot tub, queen size pullout couch (very comfortable) and full kitchen with stove, fridge and any cookware you ask for. It's also non-smoking which is nice to walk into after walking through all of the other smoking hotels. All for $149! 

The downsides to staying there are the pool area and their customer service. The pool area itself is setup nicely with private cabanas, HOT sun and a great staff. However, this was completely overshadowed as the pool area was covered in green bugs and they were all over the guests unless we were in the water. This happened this past Friday morning on 4\/16\/10. We could only last for about 20 minutes in the water and without being able to sit around the pool we left. We tried going to Aria, which when I emailed guest services before I arrived said we would have free access to Aria's pool, but was denied access when we got there. This left us no option for a pool, which if anyone that goes to Vegas knows is pretty much the best part of the trip. Thank god we only booked Vdara for the first night and the MGM Grand the last two. We promptly went to get our things and check out of Vdara. When I checked out they asked if I was unsatisfied with anything during my stay. I mentioned the bug problem and the fact that guest services had lied to me (and I have the email to prove it) and the employee didn't really seem to care. So we hustled over to MGM and guess what...no bugs anywhere! I think Vdara's problem is the trees they planted on the third floor pool deck which seemed to be where the bugs were coming from. 

I would say the pool and guest services issues would warrant three stars since going to Vegas is about being pampered and there's no reason why someone should have to be disappointed in Vegas, but it goes on. I received an on-line survey regarding my stay after I checked out and I wrote out the issues we had with our stay. The survey asked if I wanted to be contacted by a Vdara representative regarding my stay and I requested to be contacted by telephone. It's been well over a week now and still no call. I mean it's one thing to not care, if you are Vdara, because people will probably stay there anyway since it is the new City Center, but don't send me a survey and say you are going to contact me and then not contact me. It's similar to a company giving employees a satisfaction survey and the company keeps the results for themselves so as to not communicate any discontent employees may have. It's just bad business.",4,0,0

Being from Chicago where smoking is ban everywhere, vegas casinos were a bit overwhelming with the smoking. I was very appreciative of staying in a hotel where there was no smoking. It was also nice not to have a casino in the hotel. It made it simple to navigate around the hotel and not get lost which I found happening to us in some of the other hotels. 

Room service was delightful. We ordered breakfast our first morning there, it was delicious and quick to our surprise. The gentleman that set our table actually made my husband's breakfast burrito in front of him.

First off I'm not a gambler and not a fan of breathing smoky air, with that being said Vdara already had an edge in my book.

The location is great. It connects to the Bellagio and is right next to the cosmopolitan.  
The rooms are amazing. We had a corner suite on the 40th floor and wow, what a view!! We brought food and drinks since there is a full size fridge and cook top(that helped save $$ on food costs)

Service was amazing from the front desk, bell service, and anything we needed they answered promptly.
The workout facility was adequate but not as impressive as some other hotels, but we still had a good workout.
The pool was relaxing. They played good music and there is lots of shade if you want to take a break from the sun.  It's not a party pool or lush gardens but it worked.

And I have to say, for the price, it is definitely up there. We booked a corner suite (for 6 girls total) and it had plenty of room. I ended up tipping more than usual for most of the employees I had encountered here. 

Biggest gripe though would be access to Vdara to and from the strip. It's a little further back, just like the Aria. However, there is the Tram (have to walk through the Bellagio) and to just walk through the Aria. The place also only has one place to eat (a market place) in the actual hotel and no casino. Also, if sharing a room with people you hardly know, you will get to know them quickly. There is no door enclosing the toilet and it's next to the glass shower. There are doors to the actual bathroom, but when sharing with 6 girls, privacy wasn't an option.

I did book through a timeshare company, but monitored sales and deals for a couple of months before we went, it still had the best deal for the size and price. I will definitely consider staying here again, but for some reason, Aria still holds near and dear to my heart, even though it is more expensive. 

I really considered 5 stars, especially with the level or service received and the Pool Cabana was a sweet deal with private pools for a section of 3-4 cabanas. (See review under Vdara Pool & Lounge) However, the inaccessibility to the strip, food and gambling makes it difficult for me to give 5 stars!",1,0,0

[How is it different]
-No self parking- only valet (which wasn't that much at all)
-Non-smoking and no casino inside. That's a good thing!
-There are a few options in the lobby such as a fancy market cafe, starbucks, something else I think, and a good size bar.

[Rooms\/style]
-We had a corner suite with 1 king size bed and 1 bathroom. For 5 guys, that was plenty.
-Living room had a couch with a pull out bed (Springs hurt)
-Carpet was just as nice so perfect for my inner Asian. I used a sleeping bag over the couch cushions. Legit!
-Restroom was extremely nice: 2 vanity's, 2 sinks, shower\/tub, toilet with no door, and closet for the fancy clothes. Ironing board+iron+hair drying were in there to use.

-Small walkway held small vertical washer and dryer (bring some detergent and bounce if you need it)
-Master bedroom and living room had flat screens
-Kitchen area was legit


Overall: plenty of room, quieter, less smoking, and checking in was extremely easy. Had to call because flight came early to check in earlier and we had no problems. Very accommodating.",3,0,0

I've stayed in a few strip hotels, albeit not nice ones--Bally's, Excalibur, etc. Vdara was awesome because its located on the central Strip with easy access to all of the good stuff on the Strip. Even though the hotel itself is not directly on Las Vegas Boulevard, its really easy to get there (a really quick 5-10 minute walk) and there's a tram that goes to\/from Bellagio\/Vdara\/Aria\/Monte Carlo.There's no casino in Vdara, but it is connected to Bellagio and Aria, so you can easily go from your suite to the casino floor in 5 minutes. I was worried it would feel more isolated and less ""classic Vegas"" not staying at a casino hotel, but it was actually great. It was quieter and I could actually breathe in the lobby (no cigarette smoke). The lobby area had a few restaurants and a Starbucks. The rooms were awesome! I went with my family and we got two rooms--one Deluxe suite (the standard\/basic one) and one Vdara suite (a slight upgrade from the Deluxe suite). Both rooms were clean, spacious, had beautiful Strip views, nice bathrooms, comfortable beds, and little kitchenette areas. Both rooms also have a large pull-out couch, which was nice because Vdara doesn't have any double queen rooms--only single kings. The Vdara suite was bigger and had an extra half bathroom, separated bedroom and living room, the kitchen was larger, and it had a washer\/dryer in the room. Pretty awesome. Everything about the rooms were very modern--even down to the fancy little buttons that you push for housekeeping\/do not disturb\/etc. The minibar prices were kind of steep, but oh well, that's Vegas. We didn't spend too much time in our rooms but we loved them when we did. The pool area was also great. It was pretty busy (we didn't go to the pool until 2pm on a Saturday), so we didn't get a spot on the lounge chairs by the pool deck, but we still found a spot on some comfy couches and chairs near the bar and private cabanas. There was a larger pool and a few smaller hot tubs. Not too many children in the pool either, thank goodness. The prices for drinks at the pool bar were kind of ridiculous ($8 for a beer, $14 for a cocktail) but the pina coladas we ordered were quite tasty.

I checked out this morning out of Vdara and had a marvelous experience for my first time, for 4 consecutive nights. Everything was great at Valet- the employees Ebony, Nelson, Shane, and Joselyn were very pleasant, helpful, and welcoming, and definitely deserve to be recognized. Overall Valet was wonderful except for one person- KIMBERLY. My boyfriend and I have never been treated or spoken to with so much disrespect, unprofessionalism, and lack of class by her unlike the other valet employees we encountered.
 
First incident occurred today, 2\/16\/17 at 6:45 when I had called to have my car ready. Kimberly picked up, and I informed her I was heading down. She then said condescendingly, verbatim, ""So you want your car?"". Her response and tone was very inappropriate, as if she was talking down to me. My boyfriend also called to clarify a valet day pass payment; she was just as rude, short, and even stated she had just spoken to me, showing her frustration.
 
Second incident happened once we got down to valet. I spoke to Ebony first (who provides GREAT customer service and has helped my boyfriend and I during our 4 days there). Kimberly then tried to assist her, and once again brought up that she had just spoken to us and was clearly irritated. Her facial expressions and body language made it clear that she did not want to help us and came off VERY SNOOTY.
 
I then told her that the misunderstanding of information was not an issue, that what was the issue was her lack of empathy for us, and that she was rude. As soon as I said this, she immediately got up, did not let me finish speaking, and stood in the back staring where my boyfriend and I could clearly see her gossiping to another valet employee. The smirk on her face as she walked away from us was one of the most unprofessional, inappropriate, rude, and immature things I have ever seen. Ebony and Shane the supervisor were there and witnessed the whole thing.
 
I was very frustrated and angry after this happened, and asked to speak to Shane the supervisor. I explained that Kimberly's behavior was very rude, immature, and unprofessional. He was very pleasant, listened, and was great, however did not provide any explanation or plan as of to why I was treated with such disrespect. Kimberly never apologized for her rude behavior towards me after walking away, which was very frustrating.
 
For my first time at Vdara, I am VERY disappointed with the customer service Kimberly provided me with, as she simply lacks the sophistication and class that Vdara seems to stand for. Her customer service is horrendous and I am shocked she is even allowed to work at this 5 star hotel and gets away with treating customers like ignorant children. I am a clinician in the medical field, and do not even treat my own patients with this much disrespect and rude behavior. As a hotel guest I enjoyed everything else Vdara had to offer, but after experiencing this much disrespect and rudeness from Kimberly, I will probably go to Venetian or Wynn for my next stay where I feel more welcomed and appreciated. We did not pay to stay in a 5 star hotel without its own parking garage to be treated unprofessionally by Kimberly, whose service is comparable to Wal Mart. Her lack of customer service skills shows with how she handled the situation, and how she walked away from my boyfriend and I with a smirk while conversing. No apologies were ever given, which made the situation worse. Kimberly has left a very lasting bad first impression, and my boyfriend and I are simply in shock and livid that we had to be treated this way on our vacation. Perhaps she will raise Vdara's standards on valet customer service to hotel guests, since she represents everything that you SHOULDN'T do. Kimberly is a disgrace to the Vdara hotel, and needs some in depth coaching on social skills and proper customer service etiquette. 

By the way, this is the FIRST complaint I have ever written about anyone and FIRST time I have ever asked for a manager. I am a very patient and understanding person, but I cannot tolerate being treated as an inferior.",0,0,0

However because our last visit to Vegas was such a wonderful experience, Vdara paled in comparison to Aria. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed our vacation and had a great time, but no matter how much I tried to be positive, there seem to always be something missing.

Being that I'm not a huge gambler, it didn't really matter to me that Vdara didn't have a casino. With so many hotels in the vacinity, we were bound to find one anyway. The upside in not having a casino was that the hotel was smoke free. The lobby was quite small and there was only a cafe, which closed at 10, and a bar. Not having any restaurants wasn't too big of a day either since we could easily find somewhere to eat within the city center. 

It was quite unique Vdara lacked a casino and restuarants, but the thing which bothered  me was there wasn't a gift shop. I know, going to Vegas was not like traveling to a foreign county or somewhere that not many  have been to. However, I like purchasing keychains, postcards and little knick knacks for some close friends. So I had to go to Elements, the gift store at Aria, to see if they sold any of Vdara's items. Unfortunately that was not the case, so I had settled on a few postcards of Cystals, the shopping center in the city center. Not exactly what I was looking for, but close enough.

The amenities were nice. We visited the fitness center and pool once. There were plenty of machines and equipment. Each treadmill and bicycle had a towel and water bottle. There was one main pool, as opposed to having mulitple pools, like at Aria. While sitting by the poolside at Vdara, you could hear the music from Aria's side.

Aside from the lack of restaurants, casino, hip pool area, the most important part of the hotel met our expectations. The rooms were very spacious, nice and clean. There would be buttons to press when we needed housekeeping, which would alert the front desk. One night, we even had a message on our phone from the front desk apologizing for not cleaning our room when in fact it had already been cleaned. If that's not great customer service, than I don't know what is.

Vdara would not be my first choice to stay at. However if there are some good deals again and the opportunity comes up, I wouldn't mind coming back.",1,2,1

The bathroom and linens were phenomenal and there were great views. There is a really easy tram that will take you between the nearby hotels and Crystals mall. Also I like the fact that you can reserve cabanas all day ($200 for 8 ppl). Service staff was very friendly and accommodating. Checkout was simple and easy with one person on their ipad. 

Cons: Beware!... they charge you for everything! I stopped by business services immediately after I checked in to see if a package I had delivered arrived. It had, and I asked them to deliver upstairs to my room because my hands were full with my luggage. To my disbelief they charged me $10 to tote a little small box upstairs! Had I known that, I would have went back to pick it up myself.

Also, the check-in process for the cabanas is really competitive. You must reserve a cabana in advance and you have to arrive between 9-10am to check-in. At 10am they begin to allow you to choose your cabanas based on the order in which you checked-in (hence why you have to arrive between 9-10am)

We arrived quite early on August 6, 2017, but attempted to check in anyway at 10:30am. We were not dismayed or surprised that our room was unavailable. Phil told us that our room would likely be ready by 2pm. At 3pm we had not received a call yet, but since this was normal check in time, we decided to proceed to check in. We spoke with Bri who told us that our room was still not ready, but she told us for the inconvenience that she would provide us with a food and beverage credit and would call hopefully soon with a ready room. 
At 6pm we had still not received a call on the status in our room, so we popped by the front desk. Mariah told us that our room on the 20th floor was ready and gave us keys. We proceeded to our rooms, and as we were on our way up, we received a call from the hotel. We assumed that it was just someone unaware that we had just checked telling us that our room was ready. We got to our room and called for our baggage to be brought up. While we were waiting, I checked my voicemail only to hear someone telling us that our room was ready, but we had been moved to the 21st floor and to come pick up new keys. My wife, in the meantime, noticed that there was hair on the bedding in several spots and noticeably large stains on one pillowcase. She was very upset since we had waited 3 hours after check in to get this room. I told her about the voicemail, and she said we should call the front desk to see where we were actually supposed to be. I called the front desk and was told that we should be in room 21.001, so we went downstairs to get new keys. While we were downstairs, we told Nathan of the annoyance of switching rooms again, and my wife also let him know that room 20.001 was still not clean and had dirty bedding, and it should be taken care of before someone else got that room. Nathan was very apologetic and offered to remove our resort fees. 
We headed up to our new room 21.001. We were in this room about 10 minutes when water started dripping from the ceiling in the bathroom from the room above. This was not entirely the hotel's fault though we were told by maintenance that the loose faucets on the tubs cause them to leak. The maintenance man-he was also very nice-asked if we would like to be moved so we would not have to hear the constant drip of water and have a usable tub. He called the front himself and made the request. We were told to only room available was 20.001; I told them that we had previously been in that room, and it had been dirty. They assured me that it was cleaned. 
Once again we changed rooms only to find that the bedding in 20.001 was still dirty. We called the front desk and asked to speak to a manager. We were transferred to Raj (or Rog), and when I introduced myself and began to explain was was happening, I was rudely cut off and told, ""I'm aware of the situation with you."" He then proceeded to say he had been there with housekeeping and saw that it was clean. My wife cut in to inform him that the exact same hairs in the same places and stains were on the bed. I told him that he could come up himself and see. He said he was sending the housekeeping manager up and hung up. The housekeeping manager came within 10 minutes, saw what our concern was, and asked if we wanted a new room. We told her that all we wanted was clean sheets. She send in Veronica to change our sheets. Veronica was very friendly. 
In all this ordeal took up 3 hours of our time. We received a room at 6 (3 hours after check in) and did not have a clean room until almost 9pm. This is not the service we expected from this hotel at all. We have previously stayed here a couple times without incident and only positive things to say. However, we would have been satisfied despite this mishap had it not been for the manager's attitude. This is not how we wanted to spend the evening- in fact, we are fortunate that we had made no plans such as dinner reservations or shows this could interfere with, and all we would have liked is for a sincere apology from the manager. When we called about the bedding all the manager needed to say was, ""I am so sorry. Let me send someone up to change those sheets now."" This is unfortunately not what happened, and his attitude implied that we were looking for something more. We actually never asked for anything except a room and clean sheets. Raj needs a lesson in customer service- maybe he can get that from some of his staff. Our interaction with him has soured us on returning to any MGM Property if this is the type of manager being hired at them. 

On a final note, my wife never did get to use the tub as after running the water for about 5 minutes, she noted the water leaking from the top of the faucet and did not want to flood our bathroom in the same way we had experienced with the room above us previously.",3,1,0

On top of this, my friend and I reserved two city corner suites. I got the corner suite, but he did not. INSTEAD, they DOWNGRADED him to a regular room and still ended up charging him the same amount. His room was SIGNIFICANTLY smaller than my room. What kind of hotel does that?

The room: Beautiful. It was huge and completely worth the very reasonable price that I paid for it. There was a small kitchen\/dining area, a full size fridge that they stock with complementary water for you, two huge flat screens, a separate bedroom with the comfiest bed ever, a HUGE bathroom with a very deep tub with bath salts, and a separate shower with an amazing view. Did I mention a washer and dryer that I (unfortunately) did not get a chance to take advantage of.

We were assisted by Marisa who was so kind to give us a room upgrade and told us we could already go to our room. Marisa is so friendly and personable. Come to find out, she has family in Hawaii! We had such a nice conversation with her.

The room was very clean and the view was awesome!  We could see the Bellagio fountains and the mountains. Their parking used to be complimentary if you stayed there, but now it is $18 per day. That is probably the only downfall to our stay there.

Vdara is a non-smoking, non-gambling hotel. Definitely a change of pace for your typical Vegas stay. I kind of liked it.  If you want to gamble, you can just walk across the street to Cosmopolitan. If you want to smoke, you can step outside.

The room has an amazing view and the decor is sleek and sexy. Service is amazing as expected. Overall, I enjoyed my stay. My only complaint is finding this place if you have a rental car can be a pain in the ass. Once you figure it out it is easy enough, I suppose.",1,0,0

Vdara gave me the best option for my family situation.  This resort has no casino, so there's no smoking in the building and also offers a full kitchen along with a washer and dryer.  I enjoyed the contemporary modern look of the hotel.  I also loved the glass windows all through out my room giving me great views of Las Vegas. 

First off, the smell when you walk in is amazing! Very clean and tranquil; they don't call this a resort & spa for nothing!  Check in was a breeze and we checked in early!!  We called in a day before arrival and talked with Nate at the front counter who made some heavy notes for when we arrive.  He was a great help during our stay!

Upon arrival before noon, there was a lady at the front desk who did her best when we asked about our room.  We didn't receive the results that we wanted so we decided to have brunch at Aria.  Upon returning, we came back to the counter and another gentleman was able to check us into a different room on the 41st floor and we were given an upgrade to an Executive suite!  I was extremely thankful because we checked in early with upgrade.

Our room was clean and in the perfect spot; right in the corner of the building.  This Executive suite had windows all through out and reminded me of a Modern City apartment suite.  Everything was looked great!

Later that day we received chocolate covered strawberries as a thank you from the gentleman at the front desk.  Whenever we needed service, they came through as promised.  I was a little disappointed on our last day.  My husband was dealing with an upset stomach and so this delayed our time for leaving.  I immediately requested for a late check out (ahead of time) but what irritates me the most is when house keeping shows up early asking us why are we still in the room?

A 4-star rating for a great stay!  For a 5-star rating, I would recommend better communications with the front desk and housekeeping.  Also upon arrival, we had to call for a crib and for kitchen items.  We requested these items ahead of time and should be documented without having to requested for them again.  Other than that, a very nice and friendly staff; we loved our stay and will recommend to others.",7,3,4

Ive stayed here a coupla times and as long as you dont mind a casino not being downstairs you'll be fine.  The Bellagio is about a 10 minute walk from the lobby and Aria is about 7 minutes.  If you're coming to and from the strip it can be a little tiresome, but seriously, it's totally worth it.  

Rooms are pretty damn luxurious.  Ive had the corner executive suite both times ive stayed here and the view was amazing.  Big double sink bathroom with shower and tub, a tv in the living room area and in the separate bedroom.  Bed and pillows are ridiculously comfortable.  The room has a full kitchen!  Not like a little fridge and microwave, a full kitchen with a big ass fridge and stove and sink!  Which was great for leftovers from big ass Vegas meals.  Also great for holding a bunch of booze nahmean!!

Service is super friendly.  When we were there the pool was closed one day because of lightning.  When we checked out we asked if the resort fee could be waived for that day and they were totally cool to do so.  Asked for extra pillows, good to go.

I got here prior to the check-in time and the front desk was able to accommodate me and assign me to an available room on the 36th floor. This time, I had a different view - not the Bellagio fountain like the first time, but instead, the Luxor pyramid, Delano, etc. (which is just as beautiful.)

Of course, I forgot to pack the basic necessities (toothbrush, paste, etc.) but didn't forget to pack that sexy Vegas dress, right? I paged the Front Desk from my room and asked if there was a store nearby that sold toothbrushes, etc. and the lady responded, ""We can bring that right up to you, how many do you need? Do you need anything else?"". Well, that was easy! Within minutes, a gentlemen rang my doorbell (yes, doorbell) with a tray with toothbrushes and toothpaste. Um, thank you!! It saved me a trip to the store. Extremely convenient and helpful, they are.

I would definitely stay here again and have recommended it to a number of friends since. The location of the hotel is so convenient - walking distance to the cosmopolitan and aria, and shuttle to Bellagio, except the price is much less. Definitely a great bang for your buck. I understand it is not a casino hotel, but you are so close to casino hotels, you barely miss it. 

The rooms were phenomenal - especially for a large group like we had. The 2-story penthouse suites is what we really wanted, however they were sold out by the time we made our reservation. We ended up getting the 2-bedroom penthouse hospitality suite. It was so spacious, clean, and with great views of the strip. The kitchen is stocked with waters everyday (which is necessary in the Las Vegas heat and all the alcohol consumption). Our second 2-bedroom suite accidentally got upgraded and when we notified them that that wasn't what we had asked for, they gave it to us complimentary at the price of the original room (yay!). 

Unfortunately, one of our suites didn't get cleaned any of the days we were there, even when we had specifically called. They would show up in the evening, which just was so inconvenient given that we were all in the room trying to get ready for the night. They ended up giving us a $75 credit towards room service or the hotel room cost (I'll take that!). 

We really enjoyed our stay at the Vdara and it was great being able to all stay together in 1-2 suites, which tends to be a major downfall of many Vegas hotels - they don't accommodate for groups and everyone has to get individual rooms. Will definitely be going back to this hotel :)",2,0,0

1. To get to the strip is kind of confusing and difficult. The best way is to walk through the cosmopolitan. We didn't realize this on day 1, and then I realized that there is a tiny sign saying for pedestrians to do this. We almost got hit by cars the first day! Maybe a bigger sign?
2. The pool closes at 4. We were walking around a bit one day, and wanted to hang out by the pool before dinner. Not a late swim, but maybe like 5pm, I looked out our window and it was completely empty. That's not cool. Keep it open til like 7!
3. There is a full kitchen, but you need to call for plates, bowls, utensils, etc. I understand you don't want me to steal them when I leave, but I don't want to be boarding my airplane with  a new dining room set anyway!
4. The line at the front desk is always pretty long. I don't know how this compares to other hotels, but it takes a while to get through it. We didn't know when check in was, and we had to stand in the line just to ask which took  a bit of time. Maybe a sign saying ""check in at 2pm"" would be nice 
5. Resort fee -- like 22$\/day. Seems kind of silly. I guess it covers wifi, pool,  gym, etc. I don't pay $22\/day for my wifi at home!
6. Gym is pretty small for such a large hotel -- but this is only a minor complaint because I didn't come here just to work out!

-BEAUTIFUL room, amazing views, super friendly staff, comfy bed, nice bath tub, pretty quick staff for room service, bag drop off, etc, quiet hotel -- no casinos, I can't hear the people next to us or the elevators or the random children (why do you bring your children to vegas, this is the adult's disney world), not smokey smelling, pretty new building -- nothing has been severely damaged, quick access to a tram, etc, etc, etc",0,1,0

Requested a ""lake view"" (aka Bellagio fountains) but upon check in was told we had a suite with view of the pool.  Was disappointed, but they were willing to change our room the following day.  We decided to stay in the room we had, as the view of the mountains and sunset was amazing.  Yes, $25.00 resort fee is ridiculous, but hey, we knew that at time of booking.  You need to request your robes, slippers and kitchenware (all items were delivered promptly).  Water was delivered every day.  Saw the maid in the hall and she even gave me two extra bottles : )   You have to go to the front desk to get the newspaper (do this as early as possible if you're into reading the news.)  The hairdryer is in the drawer in the bathroom.  There is NO coffemaker like you see in the pics and videos.  The lights and shades are a little tricky (you""ll figure it out though) and the blackout shades are wonderful if you want to sleep in.  Speaking of sleeping, the bed and pillows are amazing (also available for purchase).

Security always made sure everyone going onto elevators were guests.  I felt safe and relieved to know not just anyone off the street was just wandering around the guest floors.  I do have to agree with others, the elevator is extremely warm!!!  They really need to do something about that issue!

The spa is small, however, for $25.00 I think it was well worth it!  My advice would be to go early (I had the whole place to myself).  The tea is wonderful!  Try the white ambrosia, it's truly sensational.  Loved the fruit and nut mixtures, and they also have fresh fruit and bottled water.  The meditation room is so relaxing.  And the showers and vanity area provide you with all the essentials.

Being a non-gaming establishment is wonderful in itself as you don't have to walk miles to get to your room.  If you choose to gamble, you can take the walkway to Bellagio, tram to Monte Carlo, walk to Aria (its right there), or take the steps or elevator outside (by silk road) to The Cosmopolitan.  You can also take the shortcut through Aria to get to Crystals.

All, in all, Vdara is a great place to stay.  Would definitely stay there again!  If you need anything from the store I would advise going to CVS or Walgreens.  They are both withing walking distance.

One more thing I would like to add is the incidental charge of $100.00.  Please be aware of this!  It will tie up your money if you pay with debit card, so be sure to use your credit card.

Hope this was helpful!  Enjoy your stay : )",1,0,0

room: no media package, as claimed. So no iPod charger\/alarm clock, no DVD player, nothing. The nightstand lamps didn't even have switches so we had to get out of bed to turn on the lights (it defeats the purpose of a nightstand lamp). No coffee maker in the room! What? Hard to find outlets. No robes (for a new\/modern hotel within that price point we expected to see them there). The rooms were pretty basic, they had a white comforter but no quilt, there was no color in the room. The toilet paper was crap. there was no safe! We're in Vegas, where's the safe? They have bad soundproofing, we could hear pool music at 8am. 

Service: one of the worst in Vegas and we've been here a few times. We were asked what floor we wanted and if the 36th floor was ok, we said yes, but then he said we'll upgrade you to a pool view after another worker whispered into our attendants ear. We ended up really disappointed with the room we had and the floor we were on. Constantly saw employees meandering around when there were lines. The person with the iPad, what do they do? When we were checking out there was no line and 2 attendants available, but because they didn't call us over we just walked to the front of the line. Except that two women behind us just ran up to the attendants and they helped them. I couldn't believe it! none of the front desk staff looked happy or at least welcoming. They didn't even ask us how our stay was; obviously they didn't care.

Once we are done for the day walking through all the other casinos to get to the strip\/ restaurant or see a show, we are able to head back to a quiet, clean air hotel.

The customer service and hospitality is impeccable!  We had an Executive Suite on 40th floor - it was a corner suite, the view was great.  We are able to see the Bellagio foundation.  Our bed was super soft and uncomfortable so I called housekeeping- we were so lucky Anthony (supervisor) picked up the phone.  Chatted with Anthony regarding the bed and he agreed to come to the room to check it out.  After inspection, he confirmed that the bed is old and it's in the process to get changed out.  At 10:30p that night, he brought over a brand new mattress (after confirming with us that it is not too late, otherwise he would change it in the morning)!!!  Another amazing service was that he didn't want us to wait for someone to put on the sheets, hands and knee he did it for us!!! WOW!!!  That is going the extra mile!  It made our stay incredible not to mention a good night sleep!

My one gripe about this suite is that we have a beautiful full kitchen equipped with full size refrigerator, dish washer, stove and a microwave, however there are no dishes, utensils or a coffee maker.  What hotels, even in a standard room that does not have a cheap coffee maker???  When I called housekeeping inquired about a coffee machine, it will cost us $20!  What hotel suites with a kitchen doesn't have any dishes, pots or utensils?  This is the first for us!!

Another funny part is that they have a scale in the bathroom.  Who wants to weigh themselves during vacation especially in Vegas.  First time seeing a scale in a hotel bathroom.  They fork out a nice scale but no coffee machine in a full size kitchen?!?! (Scratching my head)

This would have been 5 stars but had to take out a star for the kitchen without the coffee maker and other supplies.

The front desk staff was very nice, especially Kendal, who went out of his way to make sure our large group was able to have close\/ joining rooms.  I just wanted to mention his name so management knows that he was very nice and professional.

Our group had serveral different room types.
Standard room-25003: very nice and reasonably priced
Standard room w\/ lake view- 25008: very nice size, and spectacular view of water show. (I just wish I could have figured out how to play the music from the water show on the TV in the room)
Panoramic Suite-25001: great for 2 adults, but crowded for 3 adults. Decent views, but we couldn't see the Bellagio water show. Also gets a little hot when the sun comes up in the morning. 
2 Bedroom Penthouse Suite- 54004: very very nice.  It's basically a very spacious\/upscale 2 bedroom condo.  It has some of the best views of Vegas I've ever seen!  Sleeps 4 to 5 people comfortably, and has 2 full bathrooms!.  If you're going to have 4 people in your group, and you're getting 2 hotel rooms, spend the extra couple hundred a night and experience this room if you can! 


Overall Pros\/Cons: 
Pros: 
-new, modern, clean, non-smoking.
-3 minute walk to Bellagio and Aria, 
-great service, friendly staff
-pretty laid back atmosphere, not a lot of action going on. 
-priced extremely reasonable.  (almost half the price of staying at Bellagio, and they are connected, so it's like staying in a new\/modern wing of the Bellagio for half the cost!)

Cons: 
-no casino (but with how close Aria & Bellagio are, this wasn't a con for me).
-no restaurants except a lobby cafe with average food. (not a prob. though with how close my favorite restaurants at Bellagio and Aria).
-pool was average, not huge like other resorts, but it wasn't too small.  
-Sleeper sofa mattress was extremely uncomfortable to sleep on as a bed, but when folded up it was fine to sleep on as a regular couch. 
-We couldn't figure out how to use the media input for the ipod, so we couldn't play our own music.  I didn't ask for any assistance from the hotel, so maybe there was something I overlooked, but I'm pretty familiar with ipods\/ect.

We'd like to call out that the spa should be considered on it's own merit and would receive a 5 out of 5.  Specifically Kelsey in the Salon section does a great haircut.

Overall assessment: Vdara is the shell of a great hotel.  The design is outstanding - the touches of art and contemporary style are exactly what a great hotel on the strip should look like, but aside from that - all the ""little things"" about it that make a great experience were lacking.

Let's start at the very beginning... when checking in the front desk employee named Francis said that he was upgrading our room (yay!) and informed us that the pool was closed, but we could use Aria's pool instead.  As it turned out, he gave us the exact room we booked, misinformed us about the pool (it was open and we were later told that there was no affiliation with Aria), and yet, our breakfast that came with the booking was to be redeemed at the Aria (what??)

The room itself seemed smaller than described because a huge amount of sq footage was dedicated to a seemingly useless kitchen.  There is a kitchen, but no coffee maker.  Oh yeah, and then they charge you out the ass for a basic cup of coffee downstairs in the cafe (more than Starbucks!)  And to top it off, at one point, room service came up to drop off a box of Keurig k cups and when we pointed out we had no coffee maker they basically ran out of the room. The room was a king bed with a pull out couch.  The pull out couch was like sleeping on the coils and metal bars holding it together.  When we asked the front desk if there was another room with a better mattress (we were staying for four days and wanted to be comfortable, not too much to ask in my opinion) they said - we have nothing, but we can put 5 or 6 mattress pads on it and it will be okay.  OK is at best how I would describe it.  From a brand new hotel we expected some quality in the mattresses supplied in the bedrooms.  When the remote control stopped working in our room the front desk representative told me to pop out the back and make sure the batteries were in correctly then hung up.  

Our biggest issue with VDARA was that every single person who worked there seemed miserable to be there.  They were not there to make the experience comfortable nor pleasurable and hospitality was not on their minds.  Housekeeping was rude, the front desk was misinformed and snippy and the concierge did not want to be there.  We had good experiences with the man who delivered the linens for the pull out couch, the pool attendants and room service.  Icing on the cake; if you wanted to stay at this god forsaken place for a late checkout they were going to charge you for it, whether you're flight was delayed or not; oh and there is a $25 per day resort fee that is charged at checkout though there is no restaurant or resort to speak of.  
Aside from the Spa and hotel design Vdara promises a luxury experience and does not come remotely close to delivering.  NOT WORTH THE MONEY.",2,2,0

I haven't had the time to write a review now that I do let me just say. I wasn't happy at all. It was Cheap and that was fine it was my bday and our anniversary weekend. we decided to say one night down town and one in the main strip we stayed in golden nugget and as sad as this sounds the room was 3 times cleaner and smelled so much better! I if I remember right we stayed in the 22 somewhere there in a suit. First off we walked in the room it smelled like chicken wings! Like someone had just ate there like the smell was strong! The floors were not to clean and the glass door to the restroom was nasty dirty hand prints and stains. We also found empty soda cans in the closet! And water bottles half way next to the bed. I'm someone who likes nice and clean things and places. The room was so dusty I made my boyfriend whip everything with tissue and water. I was beyond mad! I was so mad but still didn't want to get the housekeeper in trouble she said it was her first week. So I didn't want to hurt her job cuz she said she was new. She was nice but the room was so bad.

We stayed in the Vdara Suite, from Saturday, April 24, 2016 through Friday, April 29, 2016. For the most part, our experience was definitely at the luxury level. But, there were small things that in a less expensive place would have been acceptable. In a 5-star luxury hotel, they are not.

Pros
The Vdara is a beautiful. It's situated off of the main strip behind the Aria. This removes you from the hustle and bustle and noise. If you are looking for a quiet place to stay, this is a good choice. No dance club to keep you awake, no binging and bonging casino, no smoke to cling to your hair and clothes and stink up your room (if you are a non-smoker, this is a great feature; if you need to smoke go somewhere else - there is no smoking anywhere on the property).

The customer service is second to none. Any problem you have will be rectified as soon as physically possible. (See below.) When I needed detergent, they ran it right up to the room in just a few minutes at no charge.

The housekeeping was amazing, to a point. We are slobs. The housekeeping staff was great about dealing with that. They lined up all of our toiletries, collected all of our loose change and put it into a glass, etc.

The room service was great, too. Food was very good, and when it was delivered the person set up our dining room table with place mats, silverware, even a small vase of flowers. A great touch.

Cons
The shower head and shower stall are designed such that the water hit me chest high (I'm 5'-9""), and I couldn't back up.  So, I had to contort myself and stand on one leg to rinse the lower bits. For the size of the stall, they should have an adjustable height showerhead or a handheld head.

As great as the housekeeping service is, we did have an issue. [The hotel does not know this story. We didn't tell them because we didn't really know what to say and, further, how and even if, it should or could be rectified.] While preparing for bed one night, I noticed that there was a jar of Vick's Vaporub on my night-table. We both hate Vick's Vaporub. Yet here was this jar on the night-table. I got a tissue and grabbed the jar. The top lid was covered in dust. Expired November 2014.  Assuming the person who left it behind was using it within the expiration period, this jar had been in that room for a minimum of 18 months. Probably just an oversight, but gross nonetheless.

Lighting in the living room was dim. Only one lamp on the desk and the wall switch didn't control it. We had to walk over to it and use the switch on the lamp to turn it on. Not a big deal, but there should have been more light in the living room. (See below.)

The blackout drape doesn't really black out the light from the windows. There is a blackout drape and a shade, and they have holes in them that line up and let in the light.

The washing machine stinks, and when I washed my clothes, they came out with the same odor

Bits you should know...
When it was time to go, we were in a rush to catch our plane.  We tend to freak out a bit when we leave a place because we are always terrified of leaving something behind. Because of this, the following three things happened:
     1. While was packing and zipping an overstuffed bag, I leaned on it wrong, it slipped to the side, landed on the living room end table, breaking it. My fault. It made a loud noise, and when it happened I screamed out a very loud eff***. My wife called from the shower, two rooms away, to ask what happened. I yelled back that I broke the effing table. Then I cut my foot and efffed again. 2 minutes later there was a knock on the door. Security. Accused me of beating my wife. Wouldn't go away until they saw her. Good I guess, but annoying. If they had seen the blood from my foot, I probably would have been arrested.
     2. In my haste, I forgot to tip the housekeeping staff. My fault, and I feel bad, but...
     3. I got a call the next day about the end table, which was resolved in minutes (I paid for it).  But the manager, who was VERY nice about the whole thing, also said that housekeeping said that I was responsible for a missing glass desktop (which is a six-foot long sheet of glass) and two missing end table lamps. These objects were not present in my room when I checked in. But how do you prove that?  It turns out that I had used my phone to take a bunch of pictures of the room when we got in so I could show family\/friends (because it was so nice). It's a good thing I did because those pictures showed that those items were not present at that time. If not, I would have had to pay for them as well. I think the housekeeping staff accused me of this because I didn't tip them. Why go six days without mentioning it? Why even let me check in to the room without mentioning it? Shady.

Anyway, the Vdara is beautiful, but make sure you take pics of the room so you can prove you didn't steal anything.",0,1,0

It does not, however, have the feel of a luxury five-star hotel across the board. First, the good: the rooms are very nice and spacious, with stunning views from the higher floors, comfortable beds, large bathrooms, and a relatively modern look. There is no casino, so that gives the lobby a quieter feel and helps you take a breather from the commercial cheesiness of Las Vegas. There is a complimentary valet, an extremely relaxing spa area (with purchase of a reasonable day pass), and a friendly\/attentive concierge. On the negative side, the pool area leaves something to be desired. It felt crowded and lacked an air of tranquility, to the extent that I would highly recommend daily rental of their ""private"" cabanas instead, which are pretty awesome (though undivided, so you're basically sharing with the cabanas around you). The hotel also lacks personality. It very much has the feel of a giant condo building, with a transient lobby area, a sad excuse for a bar, and a tiny market\/sandwich shop in lieu of a proper restaurant. The location is decent but not amazing. Yes, it's close to the Aria, but getting to the Strip required a very long, circuitous walk - a bonus if you're eating like a fat whale, but slightly limiting if you're looking to shoot back and forth from the hotel to certain attractions. Finally,the bath products are downright nasty - the same kind of cheap, overdrying soaps and shampoos you'd expect to find at a Holiday Inn Express, not a five-star hotel. Overall, it's a GOOD hotel, but it's definitely worth exploring other options.",2,0,0

The suites come with a kitchen (stove, dishwasher and fridge) but none of the tools to cook.. you have to call house keeping for pots\/pans and forks and plates.

I loved the bathroom in our suite!! The shower was awesome and the tub was huge! I always judge a place by their room service food and Vdara passed with flying colors!!! It was damn good and i ordered room service than once!! I would definitely revisit here :)",0,0,0

Vdara is one of the finished buildings of city center that houses a non casino hotel for those looking for the more quiet but close to action type of accommodation. This large hotel is located on the back of the city center and connected by walking bridge to Bellagio as well as aria and crystals by tram..Now you would think getting out of Vdara and getting on the strip would be an easy task with so many options,, but think again.. this property's location is so much in the back getting to the strip and back by walking will become quite a task after a few days of staying here.

Arrived unexpectedly earlier than check in time and was taken in with a smile.. My room choice was a 800 sq ft sutie room which included a dining room, 1 guest restroom, 1 full bathroom, living room, master bedroom and kitchen.. Beautifully layed out room with with almost all the modern ammenities you would want..

A few notable features of this hotel room that i have not seen in similar sized rooms was the fact that you get a water dispenser on the full size fridge, automatic shades in both bedroom and living room, new card scanning doors with button request for house cleaning and privacy oh and how could I forget a full washer and dryer built in..

Besides all the little surprises here and there, this room included many interesting storage closests that help you store your bags or watever you may need to hide from public view, perfect if you are planning a party in the room and don't want your guest to trip over all your crap.

Simple things such as bathrobes and shoes that are fitted for his and her sizes and not just one size fits all are those little details that make this a four diamond hotel.

However with all hotels there are always a few details that always need more attention.. Vdara is lacking ipod or iphone intergrated devices
which many other major hotels are now carrying.. Tvs in the bathroom always is a nice feature especially when your room already has a soaking tub.. One major detail I am now seeing not only here but other hotels that carry keurig coffee machines is that they provide a room for 2 with one coffee cup and 2 k cups.. Give more k cups and more than one cup saves us from calling to request more..

After staying at similar hotels like the encore and The Hotel the modern features in Vdara gives it that extra half a star that will put it to the top.. Service was top notch but sometimes a little annoying such as a person checking in on you to remind you that check out is at 12, ten minutes before check out time.. Totally don't like this feature and hope they get rid of it.. Also the check up call to see if you received what was requested earlier.. not necessary..

Vdara was a great hideaway hotel in the middle of the action, equipped with the must have modern touches and service to back it up..",5,1,0

Check-in was smooth, and we were moved to a room on the 50th floor the second night (mostly a view of in and out burger and the highway but nice enough)

Rooms are suites, which is nice and the bathroom is large enough for two girls to get ready in. Bed is comfortable. 

Pool is meh. $50 for a daybed, $150+ for a cabana. Came across a number of broken chairs. The pool was pretty crowded most days and was warm and cloudy by 2:30 p.m. Pool food was bleh. $12 for an order of chicken nuggets, $15 for a quesadilla with nothing in it but cheese. Servers were nice.

Bar Vdara? Bar barf-ara. Ordered yucca fries, Napoli flatbread and lobster tacos. These three items take over 35 minutes to appear.  Lobster tacos do appear and our waitress drops half of the lobster on the floor. Nevermind the lobster is cold. The food was god awful. She comped our bill, so we decided to try market cafe the next day. (Save yourself the trouble and walk to Aria or to the Cosmopolitan). Market Cafe again means waiting over 45 minutes for 2 paninis (? They take 3 minutes to cook) Prosciutto panini has exactly one piece of ham on it, $18 dollars later. The quality of food did not match the cost in any way, shape or form. The food options were really disappointing. 

We also had to harass housekeeping to clean our room (which they did eventually,  but probably wouldn't have if we didn't call them)

Consierge can get you free passes to Liquid and good deals at clubs.

1 - When you take a cab from the airport to here, make sure they take the city streets.  If they take you on the freeway, odds are they're taking you for a ride.

2 - If you have a breakfast credit (or just want to eat breakfast\/brunch at the cafe downstairs), don't order anything hot (i.e. anything with eggs\/bacon\/etc)  if you're in a rush.   The back kitchen forgot our orders more than once (though the workers were nice once we brought it to their attention).   Otherwise the selection is fairly decent - definitely better than your usual free ""continental breakfast"" of watery coffee, watery OJ, and stale warm-it-yourself pastries.

3 - The mattress on the sofa bed sucks.  It may be better to just sleep on the closed sofa.  You need to call down for sheets\/pillows\/bedding for it.

4 - WiFi.  I saw some other review mention it wasn't free for guests.  They're wrong.  They give you a code at check-in, and it's included in the (stupid) mandatory ""resort fee"".  

Big plus IMO:  RFID\/NFC (?) room keys, so you can just hold your wallet up to the lock\/receiver.  No fumbling through your wallet for the key card.  No having to insert\/remove the card a certain direction at juuuust the right speed to prevent the derpy yellow\/red light of denial.  Just hold it up like you do at the office.",5,0,0

I can only say one thing: Totally massive. Must be the best view in Vegas. The decor is very modern and minimalistic (In other words: not tacky, pimped-up, or wanna-be ""classic""). Spacious, good layout, automated shades\/blackouts for windows, 2 x 42"" tvs. Very comfy bed (a little on the soft side) and a good sofa. Had washer and dryer.

Service: General fine. However, both reception and restaurant were a little slow. The valet boys gave the fastest service.

Hotel: Non-gambling and little ""action"". Not a place to party. Pool closes already at 6pm.

Restaurant Silk road. Not worth it! We had two meels, both came too cold. OK taste, but somehow pricey (ex $6 for a tea!)

A few misses: Toilet, shower, bath, dressing-room and sinks is the same room, which gives very little privacy. Turning on\/off the lights is a puzzle - Who put those switches!? Kitchen is fully equiped (owen, fridge, etc) but with no silverware\/plates. The A\/C tends to cool down the bathroom the most - Getting out of the shower is like stepping onto the north pole! No detergent for washing machine.

My co-worker told me that it was confusing to get to the hotel.  It was ""different"". As long as you read and follow the signs, then there is no problem.  But if someone can't do that, then something is wrong. 

In the valet area, it was not congested at all. The max cars I saw at in the area at one time was approx 7.  As a result, it does not take long for them to bring the car around.  I did notice something that I would give them a strike for: there aren't any chairs or benches to sit and wait while valet brings the car around.  Again, it doesn't that long for them to retrieve the cars, so I guess they figured they wouldn't need them.  But it would be nice to add a sitting area while you wait.  Especially for those who have to use a walker or those who cannot stand long.

The lobby... very simple and nice.  There's the registration desk, bell desk, a café, a restaurant (for private parties), and a bar that has an amazing sitting area.  With the bar, you have the choice to sit at the bar as usual.  But for a large group meeting\/reuniting, the bar's lounge area is perfect. Check-in was quick and painless.  No issues there. The elevator ""talks"". It says the basics: going up, going down, ""x"" floor.

The rooms: 
First there's only 2 views: the pool\/Aria Hotel and the city view: 15N\/ North and East Las Vegas.  Because of the positioning of the hotel, a strip view is not an option.  The rooms are nice.  As you enter, you have your kitchen\/dining area.  There are eyes\/burners to cook, but pots\/pans\/etc are provided upon request. The quality of the mattress was okay. To me it felt like a medium.  Personally, I like firm mattresses.  Big fluffy pillows of the same quality: when lay your head on it, it seems as though the stuffing has moved and now the pillow is wrapped around your head.  There's 4 pillows on the bed.  Each person will need 2 pillows to get the support they may be seeking.  If there's an additional person sleeping on the sofa bed, additional pillows will be required.

The amenities:
Let's start with the ironing board.  They have them locked together.  Let's say a person wanted to lightly steam something and not use the ironing board....not going to happen.  The iron cannot be removed from the ironing board.  They've got them locked together that it's even hard to iron your clothes at the rounded edge of the board.  The iron will not reach; they have it on a short leash like that.

The bathroom was nice. Another thing was missing.  Ladies, please bring your own blow\/hair dryer.  There is not one in the room (I thought that was odd). Robes are provided.....upon request. Separate tub and shower.  Bathtub was amazing. However, it is not a friendly user for people with any disabilities.  The shower is better- there's a bench to sit on inside.

The challenges of this hotel: there's a café, but nowhere to really sit-down have a nice meal. You'll have to walk across the way to Aria for that (and to gamble, too).

Bottom line, this hotel is perfect for a bride-to-be to take her bridal party and have spa treatments.  But to party it up, it's too inconvenient to stay here.",0,0,0

My wife and I are not gamblers and I don't like smoke. So I decided to give the Vdara a try on a recent trip to Sin City. For me, the most important part of a hotel is the room. We had the cheapest room at the Vdara which was a king suite with a small kitchenette and four-piece bathroom. We had a nice view of the Rio and the mountains in the distance. The room was so comfortable that my parents and in-laws ended up hanging out in our room for hours chatting.

We only spent one day at the pool which I guess is small compared to the mega resorts like the Aria next door. We enjoyed the more intimate scene. I didn't try the pool side lounge or food but I saw lots of people taking advantage of the service.

We also enjoyed the Market Cafe in the lobby. It had one of the best breakfasts (although the coffee was a little disappointing). There were plenty of restaurants in the Aria, Bellagio, Monte Carlo and Crystals, all of which can be reached by tram or short walks.",1,0,0

Both of those are in easy walking distance with pedestrian paths, so Vdara is a good choice if you like the idea of a quieter, probably cheaper hotel. I like that it doesn't have a casino, though couldn't blame you if you need that.

I was very pleased with the size and layout of the room, a King bed with a divider separating it from a couch that folds out into another bed (some of the King rooms do not have the divider; I like the aesthetic with the divider even though I didn't ""need"" it). Also an apartment-sized kitchen and a large bathroom with large tub and separate walk-in shower. Don't know if true, but I heard they originally planned for the building to be condos.

It's located behind the Cosmopolitan in the mess they call the City Center.  Make sure you look for signs saying ""Vdara"" or you'll end up either at Aria or back on the strip.  Whoever thought of this ""traffic circle""  was out of their minds.  Vdara only has valet parking and the valets are not that professional.  A female valet got my car, jumped out, grabbed her tip and didn't even help me with my bags.  Thanks for nothing. 

The hotel itself is clean and non-smoking.  There is only one small bar and a small market\/sandwich shop.  No casino means no fun.  I did enjoy the guards next to the elevator banks.  I  got to see a guard try to chase down a lady of the night sneaking into the elevator.  He just missed her.  :)  

The room was clean and quiet.  I personally don't need a kitchen when I'm staying in Vegas.  I'm not going to cook, not sure who does.  My room had the bed located right next to the bathroom.  The bathroom door was a sliding door with frosted glass.  You can see light and body shapes through the glass.  You can also hear any ""business""  going on in the bathroom because the door is definitely not sound proof.  You wouldn't want to stay here with a new friend.  And as for the water pressure in the shower...there is none.  Good luck rinsing the conditioner out of your hair.  I don't iron, but my husband did not appreciate trying to iron with the iron bolted to the ironing board.  Guess there is a rash of iron burglaries going on at Vdara.

All the travel packages said that this place would suit me to a ""T"" but really, I wasn't that impressed overall. But, I paid the inexpensive rate so I wasn't too put out.

The first sign that I was in for an interesting experience was how the cab had to navigate to the hotel. I go to LV a lot, so I know about some of the crumb-bum taxi drivers that try to take you out of the way of where you're going to increase the fare. It just really took an 007 mission to actually get to the hotel. Taxi driver; I thank you for getting us there. 

The hotel is nice; nothing too luxurious really. Our rooms all had the expected nice views; although I was impressed that my room had two TV's, one facing my bed and one for the little sitting area on the other side. Don't want to miss Jersey Shore O_o There's no gambling here, which suits me fine, but I think I missed the buzz of just having...other people around.

Here's the GIANT ELEPHANT, HIPPO, BLUE WHALE that was in the room: This place is NOT friendly for those on foot. It LOOKS like it would be, but sadly, you and I would both be mistaken. From taking a tram, to walking through the small, un-busy and uninteresting mall to get to the Strip, this chick wasn't impressed. To meet other friends, we would have to add 20 minutes of travel time just to meet them on time. 

I didn't use the spa services because we had other stuff going on, so if other people's reviews are based on that, then I'll have to let them have it. I wouldn't go back unless it was free and Apollo-like gods carried me around on a palanquin from place to place, because giiirrrrrl I'm not WALKING in 4"" stilettos anywhere again! 

The security also took themselves way too seriously too. It wasn't until the 3rd day (when they recognized me) that I didn't get nearly patted down before entering the elevator. Really, Vdara, you aren't that exclusive, lighten up. Have a brownie. Speaking of brownies, the coffee shop\/small grocer downstairs always had a line that took forever to go through. Why you ask? Because there isn't ish anywhere close by!

The highlight had to be the pool. I dug it. But you can't mess with sun, water, and an interesting view of the neighboring hotels, right? I laid out there every day and achieved a warm, sun-kissed glow that definitely made me look out of place when I came back home. That was (sadly) the best memory of the hotel.",9,9,6

When we inquired to see if it was an oversight, we were told we could get one for $20a day. What the heck?  I travel, a lot, and call BS on that policy. 

Further, the hotel is tucked just off the strip and a lot quieter than you'd expect. There is no casino - which is the only reason I'm giving them 3, instead of 2 stars.  You think that would be a BIG plus, but it's almost too quiet. Everything (including, the EXTREMELY LIMITED FOOD) was closed before midnight. When we walked back from being out for the evening (1am, so not super late) the whole lobby was shut down, including the entrance.

The price for the size and kitchen compared to other similar sized rooms at other hotels, in addition to the two free buttet special they offered, sold us on this hotel. 

When we arrived I circled around 3 or 4 times trying to find self parking.  I finally pulled up to ask for directions but was told that they only offer free vallet parking. (tip needed) I personally prefer to park my own car so this was kind of an inconvenience for us.  

We only had a couple of bags and had planned to cary them up ourselves, but they quickly called over someone with a cart to unload our bags for us.  (tip needed) we were told that once we got to our room to call down for our bags to be brought right up to us. (tip needed)

Registration was quick and we asked for upgrade availability.  We were given a higher floor but same room.  So not really an upgrade in my opinion.  But the desk staf was very nice and professional at this point.

The room was very nice and spacious.  Nice decor, large bathroom and a nice kitchen with a refriderator that wasn't prepacked with spring loaded super expensive crap.  Well, that was there too but it was separate.  The view was also great!  But we soon noticed that there were a few things missing that we have grown used to having at other hotels.  There were no robes, no slippers, no kitchen utincles, plates, cups, bowls, etc.  There wasn't even a coffee maker!!!  I don't think I have ever stayed at a hotel that didn't at least provide a coffee maker.

We did, however, find a sign asking that if we needed any of these items to please call down and they would be brought up to us. (tip needed)  My personal opinion is that if I am staying at a supposed 5 diamond resort, I shouldn't have to ask for a thing as everything should already be provided for my convenience.  Obviously this hotel has developed a full tip based system, but it is quite inconvenient to its guests.

We ran into an issue in the morning were our room filled up with cigarrette smoke.  This is supposed to be a 100% non-smoking fairly new hotel.  Obviously the ventilation system needs work since it blows smoke from one suite to the next.  we called down to complain and was told that they would send security to investigate.  Two hours later and the strong cancerous smell is still choking our lungs.

So we go down to the front desk and ask to be moved to another room and this time the person behind the desk acts as if it's a hastle for him to accommodate us.  No apology for the cancerous smoke filled toom in this non-smoking hotel either.  We finally get another room and transfer our own bags ourselves.

Lastly, be careful when using the buffet special.  They make it seem as if you are covered for 2 free buffets double occupancy per night.  Well, you are covered up to $36 for 2 buffets only. 

Vdara's rooms are nice but it's too inconvenient for us to return when many most other hotels (such as Aria right across the walk way) offer everything Vdara is lacking making your stay much more convenient and enjoyable.",1,0,0

First it was the sheets. As it is the suite had one bed and a pull out. That's fine cause we had four girls. Then we wanted ice and the ice bucket... Not clean. Called down again for a new one they brought us soap and sponges. Then we were missing a light bulb and the ledges were not dusted. Then we didn't have enough towels and no wash cloths. When it was time for bed we had to call for sheets, comforter and pillows for the sofa bed. It took forever (30 minutes) And you know at the end of the night, you just wanna crash and go to bed. Not wait up. Finally when the guy came he asked us twice if we wanted him to make the bed. Of course we said yes. He said ok and threw on sheets and left. Today. Our second day, we came back from the pool. The room was serviced the sofa bed was Untouched  and left out. Sheets were not changed. The bathroom trash was untouched anddddd no toilet paper LIKE COME ON. yeah great view. I paid for that but I didn't pay for you to slack and not do YOUR job?!!  When I spoke with both managers and requested another room their response was call back tomorrow. They refunded us $50 for resort fees for all the issues we encountered on our first trip to Vegas!

Literally. You can tell the difference in air quality the second you walk in from, say, Bellagio or Aria. Non-smoking really makes a difference, the air smells so sweet. In fact, it actually smells like an Abercrombie store (maybe they infuse the air conditioners with Fierce or some other fragrance).

Service at the front desk was amazingly accommodating. We had arrived early and they were able to find us a room by 11AM, just by asking. Kevin at the front desk was great in making sure we had linens for the pull-out by giving us a call a few hours later to see if housekeeping had been by. He even put us on the 53rd floor - towering over the Bellagio with full view of the whole northern, NW and NE skylines and Bellagio's fountains.

The rooms are extremely spacious. Our ""deluxe room"" which was the lowest ranking room in the hotel sported a separated couch\/sitting area, a huge bathroom, kitchenette, and two LCD TVs. It was definitely much larger than the majority of junior suites you get at most other hotels.

Food and bar options left something to be desired. Silk Road simply didn't seem appealing - but with Vegas options abound all within walking distance - who really relies solely on their Hotel's restaurant anyway.

The pool was nice and had a mixed crowd on an early September weekend. Very easy to find a nice spot that's quiet. If you're looking for a pool party though, go somewhere else. But if you're a middle-aged mom with several kids, don't worry, the pool boys here will flirt with you all you want (I saw it, firsthand, multiple times!)

For those of you who fear valet parking, it's somewhat annoying to self-park. However, you can park in the Bellagio lot - it's closer than parking at Aria, and noticeably less complicated of a walk over to Vdara than other hotels.

Overall, great find, loved it, spent some time enjoying the pool, the room. As a non-gamer and non-smoker, Vdara was perfect.",1,0,1

The staff graciously greets you at the valet (you can't self park here, but it's complimentary! ;) and get you on your way to check in.  The check in staff was very nice and accommodated us nicely with a lower floor room overlooking the pool (mom doesn't like heights).  The room was spacious, extremely clean and very modern.  The bed was soooo pillowy soft.  You melt in it.  The sofa pull out bed also had a very nice comfy couch.  Spectacular view of the pool and the Aria across the way.  The view alone was worth the price.

One of the best selling points of this place is that you get lower prices for the room, but get  to enjoy all the benefits of the Aria.  The Aria is literally connected to the Vdara so you get many advantages as if you were staying at the Aria.  We got a great deal on the Cirque de Soleil show ""Zankara"" because we were guests of Vdara.  We bought one VIP ticket and the other one was only $30, we saved $150!!  Great deal.

We looked and requested a list of services, which we never got.  Our room was dirty and the pull out bed wasn't made up.  We found tags, batteries, the stove top in the kitchen was filthy and garbage in the drawers in the room and the garbage under the sink was overflowing.  I called down to ask to have it cleaned ASAP and it still wasn't done the next day.  Took 2 calls to get sheets for the pullout bed.

Pool area was a disappointment, we called the concierge and front desk to try to get reserved seats and were told ""there are plenty of chairs.""  No place in the evening to get food unless you order room service, which was lackluster.  No coffee pot in the room and despite being advertised as having a kitchen area, there wasn't anything in it except a sign saying to call if you wanted it equipped.  We weren't looking to cook dinner, but a few glasses would have been nice.

It's a walk through, up, down and around to get anywhere---either through city center or the Bellagio.  Again no one could explain the tram that runs to the Monte Carlo or that you could take a walkway to the back of the Bellagio.

I took a cab from the Airport which was great because, you need a map just to find the Vdara front desk.  I had a Panarama suite which was beautiful I had a 260 degree view of Las Vegas but, to be honest, there was not really that much to see as you are a ways off the strip.  There was only one small restaurant in Vdara which is a drawback.  The only other options were to go to Aria or one of the other hotels.  Even though Aria is next door, it was a long walk and tram ride just to get there.  

I found it odd that when I checked in, because I had prepaid the room and was using my Check Card, I could not charge to the room unless I left a $400 deposit.  So, I left the $400 deposit as I didn't want to pull my card out when ever I need to make a purchase.

Totally agree with a bunch of the other reviewers that the wonderful fresh smell of the lobby and throughout the hotel is a welcome change from the hotel\/casinos around.  The front desk was great and got us a wonderful upgrade.  Minor glitch was that we checked in early and our first room was still being cleaned but they quickly reassigned us to an even better room!  Our room on the 48th floor had an awesome view of the strip and the water fountains at Bellagio.

The actual rooms are nice but there are a bunch of minor complaints that I have!  I think it's silly that they don't leave robes and that they just leave you a note that says you can request for robes and slippers.  How does a 4 diamond hotel not provide robes and slippers, especially since many of their guests are Asian, slippers are a must!  Also, what's the point of a kitchen if you don't leave at least a pot and some basic plates and cutlery.  The one plus is that their housekeeping is super fast and we got everything that we requested fairly quickly.  You pay a $20 daily resort fee which includes wifi in the room.  The wifi was pretty fast.  Oh I wish that the market store was open later so that we could pick up random snacks at any time. 

Our spa experience had a couple hiccups but overall I think the spa is not bad.  We were booked for a couples facial and I guess one of the aestheticism was out sick and without informing us they split up our appointment.  So while we were each in our respective spa areas they tried to rush my other half into his facial without telling me.  Luckily my other half is good at complaining and worked everything out and rescheduled us for the next day...secretly I think he was just afraid to get his first facial without me there =).  So we got to use the spa facilities twice.  The facilities aren't large but I think quite nice - all Aveda products for use.  They even gave us a 20% discount on our services for all the troubles.

All in all Vdara is a nice hotel but I'm not totally sure I'd go back again.  I kind of miss hearing the hustle and bustle of a casino when I walk out of the elevators!",2,2,1

Our dog had been rather stressed since leaving our home in Boston, and Kim put her right at ease immediately.

The following morning were able to get room service to set the bed up right. It still wasn't comfy, but at least had sheets and such. The regular bed was comfy and roomy. Room service spoiled me with a bag of yummy caramel popcorn that I couldn't put down. The kitchen area is nice if you bring your own pots, pans, utensils and food! The kitchen was bare.

Just got back from an awesome LV weekend, while my thoughts are still intact, I wanted to write it down.

Vdara customer service is above-average! I originally booked a City-Corner Suite, got an email to upgrade to the Panoramic Suite, which has awesome views on the LV strip. The discount was so cheap it was hard to say no! 

Upon arriving, I was greeted by an very friendly associate. I then gave her my ID and Credit Card ($40 between the two), and she offered me another upgrade, on the house. Which was the 1 brdm-2 story penthouse on the 56th floor (which is the highest floor). 

The view from the Penthouse was worth the generous tip and i would do it again a 100 times over. Although the rest of the weekend was a blur, I can say that the bachelor that I host will remember the kick@$$ penthouse with the skyline view we stayed in.

The other thing about Vdara is that there is no casino, which I was perfectly happy about. Because Cosmo and Aria 3 min walk outside can suit those needs. It felt like a true resort that happens to be in Vegas.",1,0,1

A brief summary is that I took away a star because the drop-off\/ valet are was not as easily accessible as I would prefer it to be. What I mean by this is that there were not many signs off the beaten path to guide you towards it. Also, the drop off area for the Cosmopolitan is right across the street, causing a bit of confusion also. The drop-off\/valet area has an awkward design and honestly it reminds me of SFO.

The room: 
We stayed three nights here for New Years Eve. It was a beautiful suite, and everything was up-to-date with modern styling. There is a kitchenette and nice but small dining area. But hotel-er beware, most of the food or little snack-ies in the kitchen are not free, and as soon as you lift them from their resting place you will be charged. 
The room itself was very nice and very clean. The bathroom was gorgeous, and so was the view, which is accessed through an automated system that at the touch of a button you can raise and lower the curtains. My room had a small living room area with its own 42 inch LED tv, and the bed also had one just like it, directly on the opposite side. The room is spacious but not overwhelming

The hotel itself:
It is a nice hotel, nicely situated on the strip, but not too close to the pandemonium that is Vegas. It is right across from Cosmopolitan so you can go there to place your bets, and if you enjoy the night-club scene, Marquee which is located inside the Cosmo' is easily accessible. This helps when you have had far too many drinks, and find yourself stumbling around without enough cash for a cab.

There is no casino inside of Vdara, but they do have a bar, and a snack area. But that is not too much of a concern, take a quick half-block-length walk across the street to Cosmo and you can once again find yourself wasting away your winnings.

Outside near the entrance there is a quaint little patio with heaters so one may be able to recover from the crazy events that occurred night prior.

I do love this place, and it is a bit different from other hotels, it is not as over crowded because there is no gambling stations within, and also there is no smoking inside, which gives it a bit of a cleaner ambiance. Bottom-Line, I would recommend this place to anyone.",1,0,0

I managed to snag the Panoramic suite a few days after Thanksgiving and it was simply amazing.  I ended up getting a package deal that allowed me $150 on food and resort amenities so I definitely took advantage of the extra spending money towards food.  The room service was amazing as well as the little shop downstairs by the lobby.  Freshly made food and you could take it up to your room for your own private consumption. 

Now the only two things that might make you pause and think about staying here is the fact that 1. It's a smoke free environment and 2. its a non-gaming property.  Now if you don't smoke, need to get a way from the gaming, or both, then this is a definite property for you.  The lobby is only a short walk away from either Aria, Bellagio or Cosmopolitan and if you talk to the Concierge they can put you on the guest list for Haze over at Aria.

The Valet quickly unloaded our bags onto a bell cart and gave us our ticket and boom...to the check in desk we go. We were definitely treated with fast and professional service, check in was a breeze. We booked an executive corner suite and were on the 52nd floor. It was a total ease to get to the room, no casio, or clouds of smoke to get through and no maze of tables and slots trying to navigate the elevators. The Vdara itself is very contemporary and stylish. Has a very young feel to it but seemed to be a place for families too. 
Once in our room, it was just to-die-for..AMAZING views!!! The room is basically just over 800 sqft. 4 burner stove (electric), microwave\/confection oven, dishwasher, garbage disposal, full fridge\/freezer, dining table for 4. Sofa pulled out to a queen bed, although our friend said the floor was more comfortable, lol. Room was awesome with a bed that I would have no problem ever leaving. The bathroom is where it really gets crazy! Huge in itself, dual sinks, seperate ""Water closet"", rainfall shower with bench (can easily fit 4 people in there) and a soaking tub that I wanted to take home. The Bathroom is basically all windows.... ;)
We had a few issues apon arrival, literally 20 seconds after we shut the door, a maintenance guy was there to fix a loose toiled seat. I had to call down again because one of our blinds was stuck and was obsructing the awesome view that we wanted to see. This was all taken care of within 30 minutes. Our bags took the longest to get to us. We called down to ask the ETA and they had them up in 10 minutes. Not a problem. Just a few things you need to know
- 25.00 per day resort fee + 100.00 deposit that you get back a few days later. 
-If you plan on cooking, you need to call hospitality and request EVERYTHING, pots, dishes, cups, silver ware....soap, sponges, trashbags. I had to  make several calls since I didnt realize there was literally nothing there.
-They tell you that there is a guy checking to make sure you have your room key before you get on the elevator and that you need your key to even get the elevator moving, not true. We hosted a dinner one of the nights we were there and a few of our guests came up without a problem

I only now stay at various 5-star properties up and down the Las Vegas Strip and this hotel, despite having a kitchen, I will only award 4 stars. My decision is based on a weekend stay in a Deluxe Suite and am comparing it to other more deserving 5-star properties on the Strip. The game is stepped up significantly in Vegas.

Location: The only reason I chose this hotel is based on a compromise with my fellow guests. It is accessible to three gambling properties: Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, and Aria. Aria is an outdoor walk along the cul de sac. The Bellagio is connected via an outdoor walkway from the Vdara. The Cosmopolitan is a little outdoor walk down the stairs.

Casino: None.

Smoking: Not allowed.

Room rate: I have always found this property to be one of the cheaper official 5-stars. 

Branding: This is an M-life property.

Kitchen: If the kitchen is your only criteria\/deal breaker, and you don't mind the politics of Donald Trump, you're better off staying at the Trump. But staying there has a whole host of issues. The kitchen at the Vdara requires you call housekeeping and requests specific items (e.g. 4 sets of plates, cups, utensils, pots, pans, etc.).

Parking: Mandatory valet.

Resort fee: It's Vegas. Name a 5-star property that doesn't have one.

Pet-friendly: Yes

I will be staying here again if price\/location is the sole determining factor.",2,0,0

-No crazy belligerent party people
-No throbbing music 
-Nicely insulated rooms, couldn't hear our neighbors
-OKAY views of the Bellagio fountains and Red Rock
-Comfortably large rooms
-Good, quick room service
-Lots of TVs
-Soft fluffy towels
-Plenty of seating, couch, arm, dining and swivel chairs
-Thanks for having a doorbell and clear instructional buttons for the staff
-Within walking distance to Bellagio and Aria
-Nice pool and gym, all incl. in the resort fees
-Bed was comfortable enough
-Moderately priced
-Plenty of counter space in the bathroom
-Lots of magazines to peruse
-Fridge is clear to put my extra juices and water in, nice touch how housekeeping refills with the Vdara filtered water

Wish:
-Toilet was separate from the shower and vanity areas
-Robes were provided without a request
-Room service would have something OTHER than American and Italian eats
-There was an indoor route to Aria
-Better toiletries
-No humidifier, which kills me because I am SUPER sensitive to the dryness

Check-in was quick and the young lady at the check-in counter, while very efficient, took the time to tell us about the amenities, and when we asked where to get food at such a late hour, gave us her recommendation, which was perfect for what we needed.

When we walked in to the room, we were amazed.  Our room was on the 32nd floor with a view straight down to the pool, and out on to the strip.  The room was spotless and spacious.  The bathroom even had a deep tub plus a shower stall.  

The kitchen comes with a mini-bar plus two complimentary bottles of water and two coffee pods for the coffee machine. The coffee was awful though, to the point where I'm not sure if something was wrong with my machine because it was so watery.

The hotel is very quiet and relaxing.  Places to eat and hang out are very limited, but it is only 5 minutes walk to get to the craziness (and the many options) of Bellagio, so in my opinion you get the best of both worlds here.

I would give Vdara 5 stars except for some minor kinks.  The water pressure in the shower was not great, and housekeeping was inconsistent.  One day, after being out all day (and with the Housekeeping Requested sign turned on), we returned at 4:00 to find our room not made up.  About 10 minutes later the doorbell rang and it was housekeeping.  I explained that now was not a good time (we were about to shower, having been in the sun and by the pool all day).  The maid then asked if we would like clean towels.  I explained that no, we wanted full housekeeping services.  She then told me that she had to go home at 5.  We reached a compromise and she came back at 4:30, although that left us only 20 minutes to shower and get out of there.  

Also, the water and coffee pods in our fridge was not refilled one day, and the Aveda amenities seemed to come and go - face cleanser appeared only on the third day we were there, for example.

Overall these are minor quibbles and the experience was a positive one.",0,1,0

BUT... 
First day, the woman at check in Teresa said she would have bedding for the pull out couch brought up which included a feather topper, extra towels, and kitchen items.  3x talking to the front desk before they actually brought it up!
When the housekeeper did bring up the items, she said the feather topper wasn't on the list and I had to call down she would not just bring one. We called down, the SAME housekeeper then brought us an extra blanket instead of a feather topper.  Seriously? 5 attempts later we had the feather topper and our other items. 
Day 2.
The concierge booked our cabana 2 days before the date requested. We went to check into our cabana and they couldn't find out reservation. Apparently after waiting for 15-20 minutes we discover the concierge don't book them on the same system. Really?? 2nd day we had the cabana there were no issues. 
Day 4.
The housekeepers confirmed on Thursday we wanted service on Friday. We said yes. We left our dog locked up all day so they could service our room. They skipped our room.
I filed a complaint with the manager. She agreed to have fresh towels brought up. We declined service as our dog had been locked up all day and they did offer a $100 credit to our room.
When the housekeeper brought the towels. The manager proceeded to argue with my husband stating the dog was not locked up. We locked him up!!  He was locked up from 10am til we got back til 230pm. Just because a dog barks at someone knocking on the door does not mean he isn't locked up. We had the do not disturb sign on anytime we were in the room or out of the room if we didn't want to be disturbed with having the dog with us, but it was not on so we could have service.
We usually tip EVERYONE, but we are definitely not tipping housekeeping this stay.
There aren't many hotels that accept dogs in Las Vegas on the strip, but there are definitely others and I would not stay here again. 
THEN... the manager ASHLEY attempting to act nice and credit my room for the dog as it wasn't on my cost of the room supposedly (although my itinerary STATES studio DOG SUITE and I was told at booking the dog was included) said she would credit my room although I already paid for it basically . She even stated on the phone if it was booked as a dog suite it was already included but then basically she charged me DOUBLE for my dog then gave me a credit for the DOUBLE charge. Completely lame and SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICE if you charge a customer twice then act like you are doing them a favor by crediting them for the DOUBLE charge!! They were trying to say I owed more after complaining!?

- The left side of the bed was a good 3 inches lower than the right side bc of a sunken mattress. Felt I had to climb uphill to cuddle w my husband!
-The walk-in shower, while a nice idea, isn't short person friendly! The shower head angle didn't adjust low enough, so I was either nose-to-nose with the wall, or had to put my buns against the cold tile!
-Don't ask for anything from 9am-11am. There's a shift change in housekeeping. So those towels and shampoo you need for one more quick shower, won't get to you until 10:45....an hr after you asked for it, and 15 min before check out.
-I don't recommend anything from the menu of the cafe downstairs. While convenient, it is NOT a ""quick snack"" option. If you grab something from the grocery section it will be 3729x faster than waiting on a sandwich. 

On to the good points!!
-You can't be a smoke-free environment in Vegas. Seriously, why do people still smoke?!
-Got our room upgraded for free to an upper level floor with amazing views of the Bellagio fountains. 
-Close access to Cosmo, Aria and Bellagio
-While the shower didn't work out for me, the bathtub is gorgeous AND does its job.

but we parked at the bellagio because there was no self parking.  we don't like to valet because they may mess with your car; it also means that it's not free because you are obligated to tip.

Vdara is next to Aria and connected to the Bellagio.  it is a condo converter.  no casino means that it's smoke-free.  YAY!!  the rooms have a small kitchen area.  accommodations are nice with a spacious room and modern decor.  we also had a nice view from the 32nd floor.

the rooms have this cool light that changes color if you put ""do not disturb""...""housekeeping""... 

the gym is a good hotel gym.  it's small but there is bottled water, sweat towels, clean earphones.  each elliptical machine and treadmill has their own personal tv screen.  just grab a set of earphones in the clean basket.  when you are done, you can place them in the used basket.

we spent some time at the pool also.  there are towels at the pool desk.  you can swim or lay out on a chair.  there are some umbrellas for partial shade.  if you wish to have a bungalow, you can pay extra for your own.  you may order food or drinks in the pool area.  

i took extra aveda shampoo, conditioner, soap back.  when i arrived home, i noticed that the aveda bottles from Vdara were bigger than previous hotel products.  it was 1.7 fl oz to 1 fl oz. 

now, one gripe.  hubby said that when he booked Vdara on priceline, it was labeled as a 5 star hotel.  well, when we took the elevator up...two times...a bell boy with a big luggage cart came into the elevator with us.  usually if a hotel wants to be a 5 star or even a 4 star hotel, they would let their hotel guests go up the elevator first.  many times when a bell boy with a huge cart sees guests taking the elevator, they let us go ahead and say that they will wait for the next one.  no, not at Vdara.  

all i can say is...you are not a 5 star hotel.  five star hotels have top notch accommodations, service, etiquette, and top dining options.  at Vdara, you have a small cafe with some food\/drinks.  no restaurants for dining.

other than that, if there were no claims that Vdara was a 5 star hotel...then it's a nice place to stay -- a solid 4 star hotel.  just that fact that it's smoke-free and clean makes it a place i'd stay at again.

We were there from January 2 - 6, 2012.  Check in was quick and easy.  We made our reservations through Expedia and got an amazing deal for room and airfare.  Basically we only paid for airfare from Seattle and the room was free.  So we decided to upgrade our room from a deluxe room to a corner suite.     I don't want to go it to the specifics but I was not happy with our room.  I called down to the front desk and they told us they would get us a better room if we were willing to wait 2-3 hours (allowing us to use the current room until the other was available).  We were upgraded to an Executive corner suite and given a $50.00 room credit.  I was quite surprised by their generosity.  I was just expecting another room like the one we booked.  WOW!  Our room was SWEET!  It had a partial view of the Bellagio fountains.  The living room, bedroom and bathroom all had AMAZING views!  This suite had 2 bathrooms, 2 large flat screen tv's, washer and dryer, full kitchen, etc. I also have to mention that all of the windows have automatic shades ... it's pretty sweet.  Oh BTW - if you plan on cooking any food there is not a full-size oven in the kitchen.  However there is a microwave with a convection oven.  

Housekeeping was PERFECT!!  My Husband and I stayed out until at least 3:00 a.m. every night and we didn't leave our room until 3:00 p.m. every day.  Housekeeping came every day after we left and cleaned the room really good.  We have stayed at many hotels and I felt that housekeeping went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect when we returned to our room.

The one thing we really loved about Vdara ... no casino!  It was so nice to walk directly into the hotel and not have to walk through the smoky casino maze to find our room.  Our favorite casino to gamble was at the Cosmopolitan.  The Cosmopolitan and Aria both have casinos and they are a very short walk from Vdara.

The instructions were to go to the Mobile Window to pick up my key.  It wasn't that easy.  It took at least 15 minutes with only 2 people in front of me. Eventually another front desk person call me over out of the mobile line. Then I had to show my ID (okay) and give them my credit card.  That wasn't any different than the regular check in.   

Next when I got to my room I found a half empty coke on the night stand and a Vdara Cold Drink cup on the vanity.  I went down to the desk with these and received an apology. The room seemed clean other than that.  

On Saturday morning when I got up I noticed a half empty Dasani on a counter.  Also seemed weird no shampoo on the vanity.  Stepped into the shower and discovered a used bar of soap and the empty missing shampoo.  Since I had a meeting early I left the hotel and came back later to the desk and complained about this.  Now I don't think the room was clean.  '

I was moved to an upgrade.  I was also told that a manager would either visit my room or call within 30 minutes.  Guess what no visit no call.  (I don't really care but if you said it would happen then it should)

A few days later I received a survey on line. I completed it commenting the same as above.  One of the comments was ""Would You Like to Be Contacted""  I checked yest.  Guess what again no follow up.

I wasn't looking for anything free.  But honestly when you don't meet expectations. (like a clean room) you could at least make the customer feel like you were concerned and appreciative .

In the hospitality industry, service is number one. If you stay at five star resort style hotel, you expect five star service. NOT HERE. It felt like I was staying at MOTEL 6. Like most resort hotels on the strip, you pay a daily resort fee which includes use of the pool. I was surprised to learn the resort fee only allows admission to certain areas of the pool. You have to pay to enjoy other areas. It was so segregated. I have a little one and the small pool was off limits unless you pay to be in that area. The plus is NO GAMBLING in the hotel. Although this place is newer compared to others, the furniture is starting to look worn down. One word of advice have locks on your luggage. The guys who take your bags to your room will go through them. We lost an iphone 6 phone charger. FYI. It was cool VALET was free. Overall it was so-so. We came to celebrate our wedding anniversary, thank GOD for liquor otherwise staying here would've been hell. And I don't drink.",0,1,0

The bathroom in the room was biiig with a nice tub, shower, toilet and plenty of space. The extra bathroom by the kitchen is definitely convenient, especially when girls need more room to get ready to hit the strip!

Rates are not as expensive as other hotels since they don't have a casino, so if you're not exactly in Vegas just for gambling, this is a good place to consider! The only inconvenience is getting in and out of the hotel. They do not have their own parking structure, so you either have to valet or go from Aria and take a tram. However, if you stay out late, the tram does get closed so you'd have to walk from wherever you are back to Vdara or take a taxi. 

Other than the inconvenience of the location, Vdara is a great place to stay at in Vegas. The place is very modern and clean!",1,0,0

I really appreciated the location as it was quiet, but still close to everything. A non smoking and non gaming establishment, the Vdara prides itself in high quality service and support. Any complaints I had (e.g. phones didn't work well) were compensated directly as a reduction in our room rate. Direct compensation is by far the best way to deal with things! Bellman were of high quality and had pleasant demeanor.  One should note that given the location of the hotel, the frequency of cabs may not be desirable for the business traveler irrespective of the efforts of the bellman.

Rooms had some minor issues with heating and ventilating. That being said, the rooms are generally very large with a nice sitting area. I also had access to in-suite washer\/dryer and a very convenient kitchenette. The bed was good and bed sheets had fairly good thread count. Television was large enough for the rooms in question and offered a wide assortment of channels. The TV was HD quality, but would have liked a surround sound styled environment (we are in Las Vegas)! The bathroom was just OK. The shower pressure was extremely poor and even though the bathroom appeared large there was very little counter-space. Further, the toilet should have been in a more private\/secure area. Just seemed that the layout was poorly planned. Towels were not soft and should have been larger.

In summary, stay at the Vdara for less than $130 a night. That is roughly the appropriate price range if you can secure it.

We had stayed at the MGM Signature 2 previous times and were looking for something new and exciting.  Let me tell you, the Vdara is it!!!  I loved it!

First let me start by saying that we did upgrade from the Deluxe Suite to the Vdara Suite.  The room was soooo much bigger than what we were paying for at the Signature.  For the same price we and 1 full bathroom with a huge soaking tub, a half bathroom, and HUGE kitchen with room for 6 people to dine, a nice size living room with it's own flat screen tv & a large bedroom with another flat screen tv and very comfortable king size bed.

The refrigerator kept all our drinks & food nice and cold so we didn't need to continually leave the suite to get something refreshing, it was there waiting for us.  Also, the microwave came in very handy.

The room service was perfect.  The cleaning crew were very efficient and did an EXCELLENT job keeping our room clean & neat.  Bed was made everyday. Could not ask for better service.

When we came home I noticed I was missing a Coach purse which happened to have my ID in it.  I called Vdara and they passed me to lost and found and they already had it there waiting.  They sent it to me UPS and no additional charge to me.  

I will say, the only thing I did not like about the Vdara is one day my husband & I were walking back to our room, headed to the elevators and a young lady that worked at the Vdara asked to see our room key before she would let us continue to our room.  We had never had this happen at any hotel before and did take a little offense to it.  We had already been there 3 nights and a lot of couples walked straight to the elevator without the young lady asking to see their room keys.  Not really sure what this was all about but we did NOT appreciate it.  I don't understand why you would ask 1 couple and no one else.  Maybe it was because we were not Asian like 90% of its guests????  That's the only thing I can come up with.....",0,0,1

I've stayed at the Platinum Hotel (off the strip) and now here at Vdara, which offers a complete opposite experience from your standard hotel on the strip: 

NO casino = NO blaring sounds\/jarring lights upon entering
NO clubs = NO gathering of drunk and loud  d*bags or beezys stumbling about  
NO smoking = NO cigarette\/cigar stank and NO secondhand smoke

The rooms are all mini suites that come included with a combined mini kitchen & dining area.  Our kitchen consisted of a microwave, mini fridge, and plenty of cupboard space (cookware is available upon request).  Our dining area consisted of a table and 4 chairs. Our main room had separate sleeping and sitting areas.  A dividing wall, with dual flat screen tvs on either side, separated the areas from each other. The bathroom was nice and big with a nice sized and deep bathtub.  There was only one sink and the shower was average sized.  Our bed was nice and big and the pillows...OMG the pillows! If I could, I would've smuggled a set back home. The pillows were a nice size with just the right amount of softness and firmness. 

We had a expansive wall sized window view of the rear of Bellagio. The shades are controlled by a switch in the kitchen (odd) and only in the mornings did me and my boyfriend realize that the ""blackout"" option for the shades still allowed a ""nice"" stream of light to get into our room: not good after a long day and night of galavanting around Vegas -_-

**Access to and from the surrounding hotels is pretty easy**:
-The rear entrance of Aria shares a roundabout with the front entrance of Vdara. Its about a 2 minute walk using the outdoor and uncovered roundabout walkway to and from Aria. We made this walk multiple times during our recent stay since Aria is the closest hotel with a casino and restaurants.
-The Bellagio is accessible directly from Vdara using an outdoor covered walkway. The walk is a bit longer with not much sightseeing along the way but it definitely beats having to take a taxi OR walking along the strip among a mass of random people
-The Cosmopolitan is accessible from Vdara and while the walk isn't too bad, we had to go outside and take a set of stairs, a few feet away from the Vdara entrance, to the street level to get to the Cosmo.  But we didn't have to go out onto the strip at all. The walk to the Cosmo is bit longer than the walk to Aria, but definitely shorter than the walk to Bellagio.  

The hotel decor has a modern edge yet serene vibe to it. The main floor consists of ""Market Cafe Vdara"" the only place in the hotel to get food, drink, groceries, etc; a swanky lounge barl; the front desk; and the main lobby that offered plenty of comfy seating, located near the guest elevators. 

I probably wouldn't have stayed at Vdara if it hadn't been for the Expedia package I was able to get: $350\/person (taxes and fees already included) for our hotel stay and flight from Friday-Monday.  

After experiencing what Vdara has to offer, I'd definitely come back :)",3,1,1

I had a lake view on the 40th floor.  Lake meaning...the Bellagio fountains.  The view was incredible.  I slept with the shades up all 3 nights.  I couldn't get enough of it.  The suite itself was huge by hotel room standards.  The first night I arrived close to midnight Vegas time and after unpacking I went in the soaking tub.  Simply heavenly.  It was definitely what i needed after a long flight with 1 layover.  The bed was actually pretty comfortable, although I prefer memory foam pillows to the down ones they had.  I was disappointed that the kitchen area was not stocked with a basic coffeemaker so I could heat up hot water and make tea.  I guess I didn't need a coffemaker since I had a microwave, but I really could've used a mug at least.  Apparently if you need any kitchen related items you need to contact housekeeping.  Well, I could not be bothered.  I was there for work, and it was a big conference next door at the Aria so I just got my beverages there.  I love the fact that the hotel is a non-smoking\/non-gaming hotel.  It made my stay a relaxing retreat away from the madness and stinky-ness of Vegas casinos.  I would definitely recommend staying here again and loved the citywalk area.  The Aria was gorgeous and so was the Cosmopolitan.

I'm thinking, cool, five stars, I don't have to worry about a thing! I'm a terrible packer so this sounded good to me.  Hmm, not the case. 
We arrived mid-day, no problems, no worries. We stopped by the local Food 4 Less for provisions - champagne and the like. It was his birthday and they were nice enough to upgrade us to a beautiful suite over looking the Bellagio and the Cosmopolitan pool.  Sweet view of the Bellagio fountain show! The suite itself is awesome.  It was like a modern studio apartment.  
So on to this 5 star ridiculousness.  The kitchen area was great, stove, fridge, table .. but no wares.  Not a single cup in the whole place. Not even in the bathroom was there a rinse cup.  5 stars, I'm expecting a robe, right? Not so much.  Apparently, you have to call down for services.  Okay.  I've stayed at full service places before and I get it, you bring me silverware and ice when I need it.  This place, we called for robes, we called for glassware, we called for dishes, but we had to get our own ice :)  We got our own ice and waited for nearly 20 minutes for our glassware to come up.  I'm real thirsty at this point.
The bathroom looked good.  The large soaking tub was great.  I prefer my bathroom to have a fan or something, but this one only had a light.  Weird.  The amenities were awful.  5 stars and all we get are Q tips and a facial pad? huh? The shampoo, conditioner and lotion were in square bottles which made it nearly impossible to get out - which you might think is being picky, but my shower experience was so frustrating. It was like trying to get ketchup out of a Heinz bottle in the shower. No bueno. 
Large beautiful windows - great night lights and the early morning was also beautiful but too bad I couldn't enjoy my coffee while I got ready in the morning because there was no coffee pot!  On the same card as the price display for the mini bar, there's a coffee service item for $15.  The boyfriend doesn't drink coffee and I wasn't going to pay $15 for a cup of coffee that probably would have taken 20 minutes to get to me. I guess I could have gone downstairs to the Starbucks, but that kinda ruins the whole relaxing-in-my-room-before-I-step-out-into-the-world morning routine. 
Other than a complete miss on my 5-star expectations, it was a nice hotel.  It's a spa hotel and it smelled like a spa, which is super nice in Vegas since most every other hotel smells like ashes.  Its location is a bit bizarre.  Because it's kind of towards the back of the Aria circle, it took us nearly 20 minutes to get out of the hotel, on the tram, and onto the strip! 
I felt like maybe because I didn't know what I was getting into, I wasn't prepared, my experience was so-so.  And this 5 star business ... even the Motel 6 gives you free in-room coffee!  It's the little things that make it a 5 star, right? The service and the amenities.  Vdara wants to be 5 star but really, she's 4 star at best.

When staying at hotels like Vdara I expect to have a wonderful experience.  When In fact it was quite the opposite. When booking our stay we were offered a $50 room credit, but when checking out they were not going to apply it, until we reminded them. Also, when booking they asked the nature of our stay. I told them it was for my bday, and I was taking my family there who where coming from Michigan. They did not acknowledge my b-day  during our stay (disappointment). We decided to stay at Vdara because the rooms where built to be like apartments. They have a kitchen in them, which is great when you are coming with your family. You can make and prepare food in your room. But upon our arrival we discovered they did not offer any kind of kitchen utensiles, pots, pans, etc... Which just seems ridiculous! Why would you have a kitchen with out providing these items? No one travels with cooking equipment! Not even a coffee machine in the room, or a tea selection! Which is standard in any room I have stayed in. And I travel frequently..world wide! Ohh, yeah and they double charged us for our stay. Now dealing with the credit card companies and hotel.

I told the staff that we will be leaving at 7.00 pm and hope someone can clean the room and exchange the towel. We left for dinner and came back and no one clean the room.

The small kitchen area was clutch -  because no loyalty breakfast was included, it was nice to munch on some cereal versus dining out in the morning. 

Some things I didn't like :

1. The pool  This is the only major drawback, however. It would be nice if there was a bigger pool during busy weekends.

2. Breakfast. While they do have a small restaurant, I wish breakfast was included. This comes down to the Vdara not being affiliated with a major hotel chain, so this was something I was aware of upon booking.

The price was reasonable and when we arrived, we got a nice upgrade offer so got a great corner suite on the 30th floor.

The staff was friendly and arrived promptly to make the pull out bed when we called the front desk. While crowded, the pool had plenty of free seating (and plently of cabanas to upgrade to which we decided against). The only downside was the pool closed at 7PM ---- makes sense for adults, but given the number of families was a bit early. There are no restaurants in the hotel outside of the market cafe in the lobby which also doubles as quasi-deli\/convenience story with food, drinks and snacks to go. We did take advantage of it quite frequently and while on the pricey side, it isn't any different than anywhere else in Las Vegas. There is a Starbucks as well ---- two notes of caution, they don't take Starbucks loyalty cards\/apps and close quite early.

I have a goal of staying at least 1 night at every hotel on the Vegas Strip.  So Vdara was next on our list to stay at.  We rented a car from the airport (as we usually do) and drove to the hotel.  Getting to it by car was a little confusing (but then again, that little area with Vdara and Aria is a little confusing in general).  We were going around and around looking for self parking for Vdara.  After 3 passes around - we decided to just park at The Cosmopolitan.  When we checked in, I asked the clerk about the self parking and he said Vdara only has valet parking - no self parking.  You could self park at Aria and Bellagio for $10 or at The Cosmopolitan for free.  The check in clerk was very blah.  No conversation, no descriptions or mention of locations to any amenities of the hotel.  He answered my question about self parking, asked for my ID and credit card, and then gave me my room key and said ""the elevators are over there"" (pointing to the left).  That was it.  

The Room: We had a Deluxe Lake View Suite on the 46th floor which was the perfect size.  It was very clean and modern looking.  Amazing view of Vegas (strip and outside of town) from so high up.  It was beautiful to see all the snow on the tops of the mountains.  The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom was spacious with a great soaking tub and stall shower.  The shower head isn't very flexible so the you cannot aim the water onto your legs - so you find yourself doing a little contortion thing in order to wash your legs. No biggie though. One thing that was disappointing was that there was no coffee maker in the room.  You could ""rent"" one for $20 if you wanted.  I would much prefer to have a coffee maker than the iPad next to the bed explaining the amenities of the room\/hotel (including the info on how much renting a coffee maker is).  The iron leaked like crazy (I use the iron a lot).  I saw a housekeeper in the hallway and asked for a new iron, but one never came.  We were there only 3 days so I didn't make a big deal of it.  Oh and a 1L bottle of Fiji in your room is $18.00!!  I know hotel mini-bars are overpriced but that's ridiculous. (You can get a 12pk of 1L Fiji for $23).

The Hotel:  The lack of self parking is a big problem (at least for us).  Ironically enough, we were there when it was 43 degrees (brrrr) and super windy.  So walking outside to The Cosmopolitan, then through their lobby to the garage elevators and then through the garage each time we wanted to go to the car was a royal pain.  Granted - we chose to have a car and we chose to self park at The Cosmopolitan instead of paying $13- $18 (+tip) each time at Vdara for valet.  I was surprised to see limited places to eat.  Vice Versa is the lobby bar with great seating and there is a cafe type place and Starbucks.  When compared to other ""hotel only"" places, Vdara is very nice for a hotel.  And that is what they are - no casino, no clubs - a hotel.  I guess I never realized how much I like having a casino in the place I am staying at.  Even if I'm not gambling - it offers a larger area to at least hang out in.

All in all - I would say Vdara is very clean, modern and comfortable.  I highly recommend staying in a Deluxe Lake View Suite on a high floor.  Beautiful view!  If you are looking for just a place to stay - Vdara will meet your needs nicely.  If you are looking for the place you are staying at to add to your Vegas experience (like casino or club), Vdara isn't for you.",2,0,0

So in terms of online advertising it's false advertising. Not only did they put me in a wheel chair accessible room with and infant. Where the tub is low and there is no shower door but a curtain. our vehicle we where driving was hit in their security area only to tell us that it was the Bellagio.  Then when talking to staff of the Vdara the young man I spoke to was very rude. The manger Ashlee was somewhat helpful. But we where told they could do anything until tomorrow we'll tomorrow is thanks giving so nothing is going to be done anyways. So if you book something online and you think room is one way but it's not and then if your vehicle gets hit and it so damage you can drive it the only accommodation they will give you is 30 percent off the room and not charge you the room tax.  And be sure they will tell you a different story every time you talk to someone. But don't worry they have everything written in the computer.  We always stay at the Vdara but it looks like we will be looking else in the future.,0,0,0

He was very professional, yet friendly! He provided a sweet and short intro on the grounds and surroundings and even managed to fulfill our request of a high floor!
   This is the kind of service you would expect to get from a 5 Start Resort and are looking like money! 
If you stay at this place you will experience what I am talking about! I cannot emphasis enough how impressed I was with Philips hospitality, and it wasn't just him our housekeeping was also very efficient and friendly when we requested the sofa bed to be turned down and more extra towels!!

I had to buy a flip phone with prepaid minutes to use while my smartphone was stuck in Vegas for six days. This was frustrating, to say the least. 

Vdara is a large hotel with many departments that each have their own limited hours. My phone was sitting at the hotel trapped between the concierge, security, lost and found and the business center from Friday to Sunday.

But there are so many nice places with comfortable rooms to stay at on the Strip, the difference for me comes down to the quality of customer service, which Vdara is severely lacking.

My boyfriend and I were on a cross-country road trip and had planned to camp in the Red Rock Canyons nestled next to Vegas. We got to the campsite late in the day and watched as a local in a Subaru cut in front of our car, sped across the campground, and took the last campsite. It was too late to go hunting for another, so I pulled out my smart phone and booked a night at Vdara instead. At least this way we could rest up in a real bed and see the lights of Vegas. We were excited.

I've been lucky enough to do Vegas the ""right"" way -- showing up in a LBD with other girls in more LBDs with some money to spend. This time, however, my trip was unplanned and unexpected. We reached the front desk of Vdara looking like we'd been in the car for a week and were planning to camp - not like high rollers. The front desk noticed and treated us accordingly.

Immediately I was told they may or may not have my reservation. I had to give my driver's license to the man behind the desk, forward my email confirmation, and wait for him to speak with the manager. When he returned, he told me he could give me the ""least expensive room"" if I wanted, but there would be an extra $100 refundable deposit. Furthermore, I had to pay the hotel rate, instead of the lower rate I found online. We paid. Sheepishly.

Now, we looked like we were going camping, but we didn't look homeless! We were polite, had proof of a reservation, tipped the valet... but the front desk person managed to make us feel incredibly unwelcome, and frankly he embarrassed us. 

If you're wearing expensive clothing and book a top-dollar suite, perhaps Vdara will welcome you with a smile. And hey - the rooms are great, the bathroom is awesome, the bed is SUPER comfortable. But if you're a regular person on vacation, avoid Vdara unless you enjoy being made to feel like you don't belong.",5,1,1

* No casino so it's got a quiet lobby and easy access to the elevators 

* Awesome valet parking service. Always puts me right up front for a nice tip and I can have easy access to my car to come and go, love it. 

* Great customer service from all the staff even the guys at the bar in the lobby. 

* Incredible views from the high floor rooms. I always book an Executive Corner Suite which has sweeping 180 degree views. Their Panoramic Suite has 270 degrees of view with glass lined walls. 

The ECS (Executive Corner Suite) has two bathrooms one is a 1\/2 bath and the other full, full kitchen, living area, dining table and large bedroom. There's even a washer and dryer (stack) which I like so I don't have to go home with dirty clothes and usually do my laundry in room the night before. 

They have a small market\/cafe in the lobby as well and great room service. The hotel is connected to Bellagio through a walk-way, a 5 minute walk to the Cosmopolitan and less than that to Aria which is right across the drive. There's plenty of casino action in those hotels so if I need to play - that's where I go. 

The pool area at Vdara is nice too. Quiet and not as lively as say the Cosmo or some of the beach club resort pools in town. 

Really don't want to stay anywhere else when I do Vegas! Close to all, located in City Center at Harmon and Las Vegas Blvd. Great central location.",6,0,2

In fact, that was the reason I wanted to check this hotel out - maybe I could have gotten a room to see people get zapped like flies.  Fortunately \/ unfortunately, the death ray probably no longer exists, but it's a good fisherman's tale.

Seriously though, I wanted to try this hotel, since it didn't have a casino directly underneath the rooms, which drops the probability of me scuffling with a drunkard or prostitute before a nice evening.  This hotel was truly very relaxing.  True to it's namesake, the bathroom was very spa-like.  After 120 degree days and the stress of high stakes poker, a nice soak in the tub is indeed relaxing.

It has a cafe on the bottom floor, so if you just want a quick snack, you don't have to walk outside in the blazing heat to get a nice cup of coffee.  It's also connected via walkways to the Aria and the Bellagio (and tram), so it's an easy walk to the casinos \/ food \/ shows.  

Even though it's on the strip, it's a little bit hard to get to.  Thanks to the fellow yelpers, you must be very cautious to see the very small teeny tiny sign to the ramp to get there.  Also, the turnabout out of the hotel can also be confusing.

The receptionists were also very friendly and informative.  They really went out of their was to be accommodating.  The valet service could have left more to be desired though - at times it was rather slow.

Although I did like the ""security"" (after a certain time at night, there's a person checking for keys to enter the guest elevators), one of the staff was particularly aggressive towards me.  It was my first night there, so I had no idea.  I had my access card in my pocket, but I was almost yelled at for not showing it before going towards the elevators.  That wasn't very welcoming.

Typically when I review hotels, I judge it on a couple key qualifying factors: 1. Front Desk\/ Service 2. Room Amenities 3. General Amenities 4. Overall value. BONUS: Room service\/ food, upgrades, etc.

1. Front Desk line was a bit long for a Wednesday morning but incredibly nice and helpful once we got there. We had to wait 20 minutes to get serviced but when we got there, it felt like they gave us their complete and undivided attention. 4 stars.

2. Room Amenities: AHHHHH. I'm a bit of a nerd, but holy moly. Vdara. You had me at 'automatic blinds and shades'. Press blinds, press close. Dun nuh nuh. Blinds closed. BLINDS CLOSED. So cool. SO COOL. Other than this, the room was pretty large for Vegas standards, very clean, and very modern. It helped that we had a nice high floor with a beautiful view. (Like I said... King of the world) 5 Stars... those automatic blinds, man. 

3. The Vdara is off-strip so it can't compete with restaurants\/ shop offerings. It had a starbucks and a restaurant in the lobby that was fairly underwhelming. More importantly, it has a tram over to the Aria where there are fairly priced table and slot games for you. Honestly, I liked being off strip for a little because you didn't have the same commotion in your lobby as somewhere like the Cosmo, but you weren't so far away that it made getting to the strip an issue. Additionally, the Vdara has a pretty small gym but it's almost never used which was awesome.

4. We got this hotel on some discount hotel site and it ended up being like $150 or something + resort fee. Combine the solid front desk, awesome room, location\/ lack of overwhelming foot traffic, and priced decently = 4 star value. Check this place out if you can!",0,0,0

Last time we checked in, we were given the same room as someone else. Summer fixed the mistake fast and gave us a room on the 43rd floor looking over the Bellagio fountains!

I love that it's smoke free. It always seems quiet and in my opinion, it's in a great spot. It never hurts to get a little exercise.

First for the good:

- room design was cool
- love the no gaming vibe
- great view of Bellagio Lake\/Fountain show
- central location - loved the ability to walk straight to Aria or Bellagio
- overall great service
- comfy bed
- great tub
- room service was great overall and even toasted our bread in the room

The bad:

- Asked for upgrade options at check-in and was ignored.  We thought she was looking, but she wasn't - and just handed us the keys
- First room stank like there was a sewer problem - was moved to a 2nd room with slightly better view of Bellagio fountains
- although you get a kitchen\/dining area, they don't provide a coffee maker at all
- you have to call housekeeping to request robes
- our room was incredibly dusty
- one of our 2 phones didn't work at all (we didn't call about that - but it just seemed low rent)
- our minibar was locked upon arrival.  I called the next morning to have it opened, and they said they would send someone up.  No one came.  I called again and they opened it from downstairs magically.
- room service included a jam that was half-used
- only restaurant downstairs closed at midnight (hello - this is Vegas)
- room service is apparently shared with Aria, so it took over 50 minutes for a simple breakfast to be delivered

This place is pretty awesome because there's no casino or smoking -- the vibe is really relaxing and chill. I love that aspect of this place. +1

The wifi is pretty awesome -- I actually did some work the other night. Speedtest.net's latency meter told me 22ms. 

The rooms are sexy, bachelor-pad-esque joints, with a dark brown, gray, and cream color scheme. The view is awesome (I can see the fountains in front of Bellagio, the 15 freeway, Encore, Venetian, the Stratosphere, Planet Hollywood, Aria, and so on, and that's just from the desk -- you can see more of Vegas from the dining room and living room behind me). The curtains are electrically controlled. Awesome. I felt so cool raising and lowering them by touching buttons.

The rooms are priced reasonably.

Those are the positives. There were a lot of negatives, too, which I felt were unbecoming of a hotel of this caliber.

The service left a LOT to be desired.

The front desk lady was great (the $20 trick got us an upgrade), but every other service interaction was lacking. The kitchenette is stocked with a Keurig single-serve coffee machine, but we could only find decaf coffee pods (... really?). After 3 calls to the front desk on Christmas Eve, we still don't have regular coffee in this joint.

The room has a pull-out bed, but there isn't any bedding in the room for it. It took 2 calls and about 45 minutes to get someone up to our room with blankets and pillows. They forgot the coffee pods I requested too. FML. Also, this pull-out bed is pretty horrible -- it's more comfortable sleeping on it as a sofa, rather than as a pulled-out bed.

The rooms also have super-thin walls, which is something I wasn't expecting since the rooms are so nice in every other aspect -- somebody was blasting the Tron Legacy soundtrack at 2AM. I'm a fan of Daft Punk, but not when I can't shut it off if I want to. You can also hear everything going on Las Vegas Boulevard -- all of the random police sirens and modified exhausts came through the windows.

Anyway, I hope they resolve the service issues, because of the rest of the hotel is pretty nice. Extra bedding and a choice of non-decaf coffee in the room would be nice. I'm unsure whether I'll be back or not -- we'll see.",1,0,0

I love it here because there's no club and there's no casino. Now, I'll admit when I'm headed to Vegas the thing in the front of my mind is, ""What club are we hittin this weekend?"" However, it's nice to not have to deal with the madness of the club scene and the smokiness of the casino. But, you're close to Aria and Cosmopolitan to get in touch with the madness.

What many people don't know is that the hidden gems are the hotel bar and the hotel pool. The bartenders are pretty nice and make excellent drinks. It's a cool place to meet up with people and to even meet new people (unless you're too cool to chat with strangers). The pool is very chill. I don't recommend it if you're looking for your Vegas dayclub\/pool party (Wet Republic, Liquid, Marquee). There's a DJ and a bar. You can order food and drinks and chill by the pool. 

If possible, I highly suggest the 270 degree suite. Depending on where you are you can see the water show at the Bellagio from the comfort and privacy of your own room. Thus, eliminating pushy tourists and their cameras from knocking you in the head.",4,0,0

1) I hate cigarette smoke with everything that is within me. This spot is non gaming..non smoking. Nice.

2) Lobby smells wonderful, the staff is very attentive and the hotel is modern, clean and swanky.

3) Be sure to ask for your robe and slippers...yes I brought my own but I wanted to use theirs...Don't judge me!

4) Have breakfast in the sandwich spot located in the lobby. Our meal was cheap and really good. 

5) Be ready to sweat in the elevator and pray no more than two people make stops to other floors. For some reason the elevators are not air conditioned. 

6) I slept like baby in those beds for the few hours I spent in them. I'm seriously going to order those pillows. 

In conclusion, I had a wonderful time that weekend and the Vdara will be one of 2 hotels I'll stay in when I return. Tip: Ask for a room with a Bellagio view if available.  No upgrade fee!",2,0,0

First things first about the Vdara Hotel and Spa - (a) there's no smoking and (b) there's no gambling inside the establishment, gwhich is absolute bliss after frolicking throughout the rest of the city.  We stayed three days and two nights and because we had a few different rooms, we were able to see the variety that Vdara possesses.  Each room has an amazing view of the cityscape and the lovely ladies and gentlemen who work there are absolute dolls- helping us with each and every little question we had.

The Vdara is perfectly placed near the other hotels in case you get the urge to gamble, club it up or soak up some Vegas sun.  I'll definitely be coming back here, en masse!",5,1,1

The look of the hotel is beautiful but the virtual tour online is not the same as the room we got, which was a lot smaller. Totally disappointing stay. I won't be back for this kind of $.
This is an update to my comments above: the reason that we don't have a coffee maker in the room is that the rooms don't come with them. I mean, even motel 8 has coffee makers!

Only valet parking.  No parking structure.

Check in was a mess.  Use the mobile check in that they advertise as ""just come buy and pickup you keys.  Not true.  It took 30 minutes in the line.  The regular check would have taken less time.

The store attached to the café has a very limited supply for a hotel with suites with full kitchens.  I wanted milk, any milk, and there was not milk in the store.  A lot of wine,

A very nice suite.  In the web site the picture shows a Keurig coffee maker in the kitchen.  When we asked housekeeping about a coffee maker they told us it would be an additional $20 a night. 

There was not silverware, plates or pots or pans in a full kitchen with cooktop, full size refrigerator, dishwasher and washer and dryer.  We again asked housekeeping and they brought us two plates, two bowls, two sets of silverware, and one very old and beat up pot and pan.  Not at all what was expected based on the ads.

The café is very small and a limited menu.  In the morning there is not enough setting so people are standing and sitting all over the lobby eating there breakfast.

Everyone was friendly and welcoming to our kids and dog. No snarky attitude.

We stayed in a corner suite, with full kitchen, washer dryer, separate bedroom with King bed, and living room with queen pullout sofa for the kids. It was so clean, had everything we needed, and beautiful three sided view of the mountains and city lights (far enough up that the kids couldn't see the madness). 

Valet was super friendly and efficient, reservations and check in were patient and kind (had great advice for us about rooms, etc.), the whole place was clean and well maintained. The cleaning staff was so sweet to my daughter, offered us water for the car on our way, just totally friendly, helpful, and efficient. 

Market cafe was good, quick, and priced reasonably for late dinner and early breakfast pickup. They were able to cook a separate dish to safely accommodate food allergies. Pool was great and my kids loved swimming all morning.

You would think it would be a good break from the craziness of Vegas. I'm not a big partier so I thought it was a good location for a getaway. Not the case at all. 

My friend booked the room and it had one king bed. No option for double queens. This sucked bc we were 6 people. The pull out was a bed that was similar to what you would think would be a bed in a homeless shelter. Also, the fridge was broken and leaked water everywhere. 

Besides this: 

-maid service did not clean our room
-we asked for fresh towels and it took them over an hour
-the pool closes at 7pm
-the pool doesn't allow you to put down your umbrella until after a certain time
-food at pool was awful and very overpriced
-service at Starbucks very SLOW (they don't accept the Starbucks app either)
-pool chairs had no padding and were super uncomfortable (you have to pay $25 for the padded chairs).
- rooms are overpriced and they charge a ""resort fee"".

Resort fee for what amenities??!

Rather than the traditional chandeliers, gold and glitz the City Center opts for modern art, simplistic decor and an overall ""New York"" style.

We stayed at Aira a few weeks prior and it was simply a coincidence that when my boyfriend booked a 140 a night hotel on Hotwire.com, it happened to be Vdara. At first we weren't thrilled, there is no casino! We come to Vegas for the complete package- luxury hotels, gambling, booze and fabulous restaurants- this hotel really had none of those.

As we checked in we were both appalled at the ""resort fee"". 15 bucks a day for water and a newspaper? In a luxury hotel shouldn't that come included? Plus, we had no intention of using the pool and had to pay anyway. 

The style of the hotel really made me feel like I was in a W in San Francisco or New York. The lobby is rather small with no sundries shop or rows and rows of casino tables. There is one bar and one restaurant. As we reached our room, I was pleasantly surprised a the size. Our room in Aria was so tiny! This one had a mini kitchen, living area and huge bathroom. We also had full panoramic windows with a great view. 

As my boyfriend darted off to play poker at the Rio I first ordered a bottle of champagne and ran a bath. I was quoted 15 minutes for the bottle, it took 30. When I called to complain the lady simply stated, ""he is on his way"". No apology or nothing. I had to drain my bath and run a new one becuase it got cold. Later that night as we stumbled back into our room at 3:30am, we knew we wanted room service. We both sat and were so confused as to what was available at the time. I decided to call and it turned out we were missing 3 pages of our room service book so the lady simply rattled off a few things that were available- clam chowder, club sandwich, a pasta dish or buffalo wings. Yuck, definitely not what I wanted. We ordered the club sandwich and the pasta. The pasta was awful- it very obviously was re-heated in a microwave. I went to bed hungry and disappointed. 

After a good nights sleep I decided to order breakfast. Even after the terrible food the night before, I though ""how can you screw up eggs?"". Breakfast arrived promptly and it was delicious. I loved the little potato pancakes that came with the eggs and even a toaster was brought to toast the bread so it would be warm. 

Later that day I also got a organic pedicure in the spa. It was amazing! I was wrapped up in a blanket and served a cup of coffee as I received the treatment. I felt so relaxed and would recommend it to everyone.

As the weekend progressed we did notice something about the hotel we really liked- no tourists! Since there was no casino, shopping center or theater to draw in the crowds it remained so quiet. I really grew to appreciate this quality. 

All in all I think that these are great hotels, but don't really offer the ""Vegas"" experience. If you are a first time visitor or really looking to ""party"" I wouldn't recommend these hotels. But, if you are looking for something relaxing, romantic and quiet, then I would.",3,2,2

Water was nice and soft which is a plus. I appreciated the fact we had a microwave but here was the cons.

Cons: mini fridge was broken we called an hour into being there they sent someone out however she said she couldnt fix it. She offered for us to use the paid mini fridge side but it still didn't get very cold and it constantly got stuck. They were suppose to send someone the next day it never happened. It was disappointing that they didn't send a person I expected more since it's more upscale than other hotels.

We called in the day before our arrival to ask for connecting rooms, the lady on the phone said she will note it but we should plan on checking in early...and so we did, we checked in at noon time - the lady in the front desk said the rooms need to be cleaned but that should not take long and they will call and let us know when they are ready - she even gave us the key cards...we waited 90 min's and made the 1st call to check in on the status - a different lady said it will actually take 2-3 more hours, (just a reminder the official check in time is 3 PM). she promised they will cal us when the rooms will be ready...so we waited again and at 5 PM we called and asked and the answer was - one room is almost ready and they are working on the 2nd one. So we waited and called again, (no one called us as they promised few times), by 7PM we just went in and got into our rooms as the call never came 

The rooms were just in really bad condition, everything was dusty and not cleaned - even though we waited all this time for them to be cleaned up and ready...i have the pictures...was really tough getting to sleep thinking about the germs surrounding us.

I can't really compare it, but I wouldn't stay anywhere else. Having the kitchen in the room is insanely helpful for a proper Vegas trip, it allowed us to go buy bottles of liquor and pre-game in the room before going out and saved us from emptying our pockets on drinks alone (the average cocktail runs around $20 FYI). Not only that but it's location is central to almost everything on the strip. It connects into the Bellagio and sits right next to Aria, both of which seemed to be central locations so I enjoyed not having to take a cab most places (another FYI cab rides in this town are absolutely terrifying). 

Room- the room we had was absolutely beautiful, modern and simple. Fantastic views of both the strip, and that other part of Vegas nobody really goes to near the Palms. Stunning views of the sunset! We booked on vegas.com and when we checked in, the guy said their systems showed us having two rooms for 1 person each. I had printed out EVERYTHING and showed him our reservation was for 1 room for 2 people, he suggested we call them and make sure our card didn't get charged for 2 rooms but otherwise there was no real problem. We didn't pay with a credit card so we knew what we spent upfront. ***side note, it's probably much easier to book trips straight from them because everywhere we went we weren't able to view our reservations due ""booking with a third-party"". I mean really who doesn't book third party these days...*** one issue we encountered which was quite annoying, was the website did not have any useful information regarding check in\/out times- we had a late flight home and had no idea checkout was at 11am and we had to spend $400 switching our flight to an earlier time so we weren't dragging our luggage around Vegas for 10 hours. You get a nifty iPad that also doubles as a bluetooth speaker (we almost brought ours so I was very happy they provided one) and it's very useful with information about the hotel, surrounding areas, concierge, etc. Bathrooms were clean and well built. I work in the hospitality industry and I know what little things to look for, this surpassed my inspection. The hotel is very pro-green and even have lights in place of the ""do not disturb"" or ""clean room"" signs, as well as doorbells. I do advise locking the door if you don't remember to press the do not disturb sign, our maid almost entered once and we had slept through the doorbell and her knocking. The maids did very well with cleaning. The blackout shades, however, did not do their job and the sun kept us from sleeping well the whole time. No matter what we did there were cracks the sunlight made it's way through straight into our eyes. 

Food- We didn't order in-room service but we did wander down to the Vice Versa lounge for dinner one night when we were too lazy to go elsewhere. It was one of the rare downtimes so we had our little personal bartender, all that we met that worked there were very easy to talk to and very good at their jobs. The food was excellent, and a few bucks cheaper than most places we ate at on the whole trip. I tried my first chicken & waffle sliders here, and probably won't ever be able to eat them anywhere else because these were amazing. 

Pool- I sadly did not have a ""Vegas pool party"" experience, mainly cuz I heard how nasty it gets, but I have no idea how those major pool party places do it because only being up on the third floor, this pool had so much wind on any given day that your stuff was never safe. It sounded like a freight train down in the concierge area at all times. But the pool was pretty nice, the menu looked great but we never got a chance to try anything. I had my eye on the Grey Goose fruit platter. My husband was devastated because some kind of dragon mojito drink they had 5 years ago was taken off the menu.

People complain about how there's no casino and self parking, but I don't understand why people are whining about that when the hotel can't really change it and its not like you can say Vdara gave you bad service for something they don't provide a service for. So you should just try to figure out what you want in a hotel and what Vdara can offer, so you can choose the right hotel for you.

We didn't expect Vdara not to have a casino, but we later pleasantly found out that we loved the fact that there was no casino. There is no terrible smell of smoke! BUT, if you do want to go to the casino, the bellagio is connected to Vdara and its only a 10-15 min and Aria's casino is a 5 min walk (there isn't a strong smell of smoke here either, maybe cause its new!)

My room came with a king size bed and a queen pull out couch with 2 tv's. Also a small kitchenette was included! And I had great views of bellagio and its water fountain show. The room came with electronic shades that block out the sun so you can sleep peacefully until the morning without being blinded by the bright morning sun! 

I do have to say that the bathroom door is quite thin, so you can hear a lot of noise that you don't want to really hear. The aveda toiletries and bathroom interiors were nice! Free wifi too!

NOTE: the complimentary valet is a bit annoying, since everytime you want to get your car, you have to tip them. The market cafe has GREAT sandwiches! and good coffee! If you want to shop designer brands but don't want to walk all the way to caesar's, go to crystals! closer and newer!",0,0,0

The gym was better than the gym we have at home ha! Next time I will hopefully have time to get in that beautiful spa I saw!!! Thanks again Vdara!",0,0,0

I stayed here Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights and I enjoyed every single second here. We stayed in a suite on the 39th floor at the very end with a view of the mountains, Rio, as well as the Aria. The place was huge and full of luxury. Full sized fridge, microwave, sink, stove, washer, dryer, living room, and a nice bedroom with a locking sliding door. The couch in the living room pulled out into a bed. both the living room and bedroom had a large tv in them. The bed was very comfortable. They have extremely nice bathrobes for you to use in the room and slippers that you can take with. The walk in shower was very large and no waiting for hot water; it was hot within seconds of turning it on. It also included a very large bathtub where you could chill and stare at the beautiful view. Each room has three window settings...open, shade, or blackout. It is definitely the hotel of choice next time we're in Vegas! Also they do have a pool which is pretty shallow, and a hot tub which was awesome. FREE WIFI!",2,0,1

We enjoyed the location and the convenience of hitting the strip and the surrounding hotels (if necessary). I got what I considered a really great deal on the room that overlooked the strip ($325 total cost for Sunday and Monday night on Memorial day weekend with $75 food and beverage credit).  I did a lot of research and asked a million questions before booking and every expectation was met.  I signed up for M-Life and their service was nothing less than excellent. I typically love to walk around and enjoy the amenities of the other hotels but we found ourselves staying within our pocket of Vdara for relaxation and Aria, Citycenter, and Cosmpolitan for the action.",0,0,0

Thumbs up for the clean modern design aesthetic Vdara utilizes that makes the room feel a little more like an upscale condo and less like a run-of-the-mill hotel room. Well, I guess the fact there's a kitchen with a stove probably contributes more to that ""homey"" feel too.

I liked that the shower door didn't leak.  Sounds kinda dumb to point that out, but I had a small lake replete with fish pooling around my shower at Palazzo.  The sink was one of those trendy rectangular models that looked cool but functionally sucked. The near-flat bottom made sure that draining water never drained well, and when there's two guys shaving with razors it meant splashing water around futilely trying to clean up the place for the next person. 

I absolutely loved the fact that I didn't need to walk six kilometers through a smokey casino to go from the lobby to the guest elevators.  In fact, there is no casino at Vdara and the closest one is probably Cosmo next door.  The downside is that there's no direct connection to Cosmo, but it's not a big deal.  Vdara *is* connected via walkway to its sister property Bellagio.  It's a long route to take, but made easier if you make a pit stop at Jean-Philippe's for some chocolate.

The beds were comfy, the room nicely appointed and we had a decent view looking north towards the water show at Bellagio.  The gym wasn't huge with maybe 10 treadmills\/ellipticals and a dozen machines plus free weights, but it was also so empty that it wasn't a factor. Plenty of towels and water made a quick workout a breeze. Good location and everything above makes it a solid 4 stars for me. Looking forward to my next stay here.",5,3,5

The ambience as soon as you walk in is calm and serene, a world away from the bustle of Las Vegas. What the other reviewers have said about this is true, if you want calm, this is your place, if not, you might want to try somewhere else. 

So the things I loved about Vdara. Non smoking which is great, the décor is sleek modern and sexy. The rooms have excellent amenities and are clean and comfortable. The bed is to die for. We ordered room service for breakfast both days of our stay and it was impeccably presented and delicious. We used the gym and it was well equipped but maybe could have been a little bigger? The café, although a little pricey was good for a snack too. 

And in addition is the $25 resort fee. Now personally I think you're hard pressed to find free wifi these days, so if for the my $25 I get good wifi, a paper every day and good amenities, then that works for me. You take the swings and the roundabouts you know?

My main gripe I think is the location. If you walk through City Center you have to walk via Aria then Crystals, or via Bellagio or via the road then the Cosmo, or if you're feeling adventurous\/crazy, via the non-pedestrian road bit on the side of the Cosmo (don't try this!!). You weren't right there is what I'm trying to say. But for my husband and I who wanted some quality alone time relaxing - Vdara was an awesome oasis in the Mojave desert.",1,0,0

I thought he was crazy, but it was beyond amazing. Every night when we would come back from the crazy, loud and wild times on the strip, it felt like coming back to our hotel room was almost like coming back home for the night. This hotel is non-smoking, which you don't really appreciate until you've been out and about at all of the other hotels around. Even taking the gaming aspect out of a hotel in Las Vegas, this hotel was just so peaceful to come back to every night. We had a 900 sq. ft. penthouse that looked onto the strip and the Bellagio fountains. Waking up and seeing the Strip slowly come alive made me wish I could live in that penthouse! The staff was incredible and very accommodating. Our room was being cleaned when we were checking in and instead of just watching our luggage and sending us off to waste time for a few hours (like every other hotel in Las Vegas) they let us hang out and relax in another penthouse until ours was ready. We had one issue during our stay, but it was resolved VERY quickly and the manager personally called our room to apologize. I was also hesitant after reading some reviews about the power of the showers. Personally I want a shower to wake me up and be as strong as possible with the water pressure. I don't know what those people were talking about as the water pressure was perfect! I loved the shower so much that I never even got to enjoy the gorgeous tub in the room.

Ideal for someone who wants to end their night in Vegas feeling like they are coming home, not to mention there was an obvious lack of noise and smoke from a casino.

No there is not a casino inside but you are footsteps away from both The Aria and The Bellagio. It is a bit more tricky to get to The Cosmopolitan. Front desk staff and bellmen were all friendly. 
There is a bar inside but since we returned from our adventures on the strip pretty late it was closed when we would have stopped in for a nightcap. Same with the small cafe inside. I would have liked the convenience of grabbing a soda or some snacks before heading up to our room.
If you want to use the pool, GO EARLY. It gets very crowded and nearly impossible to find a chair. Drinks at the outdoor bar are overpriced, even by Las Vegas standards.
I do have to remove 1 star for housekeeping standards. Our room was beautiful at first glance but after a closer inspection, there was a lot of dust and streaking on the lighting fixtures and furniture. Bedding was extremely comfortable. One thing that I have to mention that did seem a little ""off"" was our housekeeper rearranging all my makeup and toiletries on the bathroom counter.

I am very pleasantly surprised with the room itself.  It has a small kitchen, a small resting place with sofa and plasma TV.  Then you have the bed with its own TV also.  The bathroom is very modern as expected.  Overall, one of my favorite rooms in Vegas.

As soon as you walk through the doors, you feel that sense of tranquility because it's so calm and almost deserted. Customer service is great. Front desk and concierge are very helpful in aiding you in whatever you need. I had no problems during my stay.
 
Some things to note:
No self-parking, only valet. If you are driving your own vehicle, just park at Aria if you don't like to valet. It's a little bit of a walk but at least you won't have to tip them and can get your car on your own time.

If you arrive in a taxi, they will take your bags up for you. I realize this is a nice gesture, but again you will feel obligated to tip them when they bring your bag(s) up to your room. 

Only the right side of the fridge is free. They give you complimentary Vdara water and two Keurig coffee pods daily. Nice little inclusion.

The elevator is hot. Ok, so I mean that both visually and literally. Every time we set foot in that elevator, it was hot. Why? I don't know. It looks very stylish, love the side paneling as it looks like water. Makes for a great backdrop in a picture (we had a couple photo shoots in there if you know what I mean). 

Free coffee in the Health Spa\/Gym area. Feel free to stop by and get yourself a cup of coffee in the AM if you don't like the Keurig pods (it is kind of weak). They also have Fuji apples if you fancy that.

Things about the room:
The view. Amazing. Luckily, we were on the 50th floor. 
Sofa bed. Surprisingly comfy. It was quite springy as a bed, but decent. I mean, my friend's back was fine the next day.
King size bed. Comfy but for some reason I felt like I over heated when sleeping. Mattress topper maybe? Pillows were great and comfy too.
Aveda products. Love the smell of rosemary mint when showering.
Again, love the technology incorporated into the room: shades, housekeeping button, and lighting. 

Housekeeping is very good; called for additional pods, came up in about 15 minutes, also called for toothpaste, brought that up in 10 minutes. If you notify them that you'll be using the sofa-bed, they'll bring up sheets; we only learned of this after the first night of our friend sleeping sheet-less with one light blanket throw.

5. Spa services on the second floor, pool on the third floor.


The following events though have led me to believe that we either had a REALLY untypical stay at the Vdara or just really bad luck.

When we got to the reception, there was no wait, which was very nice. A few people were checking in at the time, but there was a person available within a few minutes to help us. I smiled warmly at her and told her that my girlfriend and I were staying for our five year anniversary and we hoped she would help us make it extra special. We booked a corner suite to begin with because I didn't want to do the $20 tip trick, the price point was similar, and there was a guarantee that we would get a ""nice"" room. She immediately told us that she could upgrade us for $20 to a larger suite. And that the current suite we had was on a lower floor.

This surprised me because at EVERY hotel on and off the strip, an upgrade is pretty much a freebie. They want you to have a great impression of the property, lose money, and pay for services, and then come back. I was displeased, but I didn't want to spoil our vacation mood, so I agreed to the upsell. My girlfriend booked the reservation and she handled most of the check in paperwork. She never told my girlfriend to put me down as an additional guest.

Anyways, we were ready to start a relaxing hot soak in the tub and plan the rest of our evening. When we got into the room I was really disappointed about how technologically backward the room seemed to be. Every button seemed to have been pushed several thousand times and the lettering was gone, the shades control itself was buggy, and the lights were not automated. The bed sheets were really scratchy and were rough. The only really cool thing was the full stove, microwave, and fridge! However, shortly after that pleasant discovery, the real terrible stuff began to emerge.

The tub had water still in it. Not sure if they just cleaned the tub, but there was lots of water in it. I opened a drawer next to the bed and found two dirty, black socks from a previous guest. Finding this prompted me to tell my girlfriend to search other cabinets for other items left behind by the guest. She opened up the dishwasher and discovered a terrible smell and to our dismay dirty plates and kitchenware. I called the front desk and complained and immediately, we were upgraded to a much larger suite and higher floor.

I wished at that point I could say, our stay was amazing and we lived happily ever after. We got up to the floor and there was a strange chemical\/mildew smell going on in the air. It was very unpleasant, but it didn't get into the room. The door handle looked like it may have been busted in by another guest who tried to get in the room forcibly during a previous stay. We walked into our room and the shades were down. The same faded lettering was on the controls. Once I raised the shades, the view was absolutely spectacular.

The first thing we did was order turn down service, setting it for 6:00 PM for the rest of our stay. We got home that night and found out that the housekeeping lady wasn't aware that there were two guests. It turns out because my girlfriend didn't know and because the check in person didn't tell her that she should put me down as a guest, the housekeeper turned down only one side of the bed. It was late though and we were tired from our day, but I contacted the housekeeper the next day. 

I wanted to take a shower. The water came out hot and ready in seconds, but the showerhead was also busted and spewing water onto the tile outside the shower. After adjusting the head back in, it spewed a little less water. Anyways, after the shower the bedsheets like before were scratchy. In fact, I got a nasty rash from them and decided to sleep on the comforter instead.

The next day, we came back around 7 PM and I expected turn down service to be nicely done and the room to be in better order. We arrived to a room that had not been serviced or turned down. We were sure to leave the room's privacy light off when we left that morning. We were disappointed, but thought they were busy and would come later. We left to go out for the night, and came back to a room that was still not turned down. To annoyed and tired, we went to sleep and complained the next day. Turns out the charges that were promised to be waived weren't. And in fact, the notation for the upgrade for $20 overall was incorrect. It was $40.

At the end of things, we settled up with the manager who was the best part of our stay. I hope that my stay was not typical to the Vdara, and I  hope that you guys have a better experience.",13,0,0

As much as the bling of the Vegas glitz and glam is invigorating and oh so conducive to forking over more dough while living it up in the City of Sin, I have to say that staying at such a beautiful + classy hotel as Vdara has almost shown me a different side of Vegas... gambling-free + smoking-free. 

Located further to the back of the new CityCenter, it is located on The Strip but is removed enough that you don't feel like you're in the middle of everything. Entering in from the Harmon Circle loop, the hotel lobby is mostly dark woods with pops of color or light here + there http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=6YEnpx-qloIfFX-L9uyfbQ&select=YXJ3ItUoxyx1WznzsZYZow with a bar + Silk Road restaurant further down at the end. Most notably, there is no smoky, loud casino anywhere within the hotel which gives it that level of class right off the bat.  

We booked a Deluxe Suite for 2 nights for our group of 5 girls + the price was $199 \/ night for a weekend stay not including tax or resort fees. Had we booked earlier or timed our trip differently then maybe it would have been cheaper... but then again, it's Vegas on a Summer weekend so it could have been worse. And for the price, we got everything we needed + more!

First off, valet service is FREE. Yups, no trekking through self-park in the heat back to your room. And then secondly, because there's no casino the elevators are very conveniently located close to both the front desk + the front doors. Awesome. Heading up, our room was on the 39th floor ... + entering into our room, we were surprised to see that our suite pretty much included a whole mini kitchen. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=6YEnpx-qloIfFX-L9uyfbQ&select=n6A4Oj4PG4K0b1WJZfiFbA This wasn't just a micro-fridge propped in a corner like most hotels but actually a kitchen with ample counter space, large metal sink, microwave, mini-fridge, cabinet space + even a stove top! Then on the other side of the entryway was a dining room table, too. The rest of the suite is then a bedroom http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=6YEnpx-qloIfFX-L9uyfbQ&select=LcPszvcM6Rd6E3mGcu-6YA with a middle dividing wall that creates a living room on the other side http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=6YEnpx-qloIfFX-L9uyfbQ&select=GjJfrDsqp7XkWoGuyeTz5g + then a large bathroom. Words cannot describe how cool the set-up arrangement is or how pretty the contemporary decor is. But at the very least... the 2 large flat screen tv's, the separate shower + bathtub, the fold-out queen sized sofa bed, the panoramic view with electronic-controlled shades + the multiple different light switches for ambiance lighting were extra wow factors that made this suite a perfect choice for our group. And other little amenity details like a corkscrew bottle opener, robes, a bathroom scale, the button-activated ""do not disturb"" feature + our own doorbell ... oh man, over the top!  ***Check out the rest of my many photos for some of these details!*** 
 
The customer service is overly gracious with all their please's + thank you's right on the mark from the valet to the front desk to the housekeeping. I had room service bring us bed sheets for the fold-out bed, extra towels + extra champagne flutes in the middle of the night + they were on it so fast that we heard our doorbell within not more than 10 mins.  

Aside from wishing we could have found a better price... my only qualms about Vdara are the $15 resort fee per day for water bottles, wireless internet, coffee for the nifty coffee machine, gym access, etc... plus the walk to The Strip. Sure it wasn't too bad to go through Aria, past some art galleries + down the stairs since that beats winding my way through an endless smokey casino any day but still. Apparently there's a walkway to Bellagio that's a shortcut to The Strip, but we never found it.

Since we didn't get a chance to try out their restaurant, rooftop pool or extensive spa services either, I definitely would like to come back to stay in Vdara again someday. Until then... 4 stars just because this place almost seems too good to be true for Vegas.",8,3,3

On the positive side, the room was modern, elegant and had fantastic views. We got a decent rate from Jetsetter (hint for deal hunters). The luxurious bathroom and poolside cabana were both highlights, throwing me points on the ""happy wife, happy life"" scoreboard. ;)

On the negative side, there were small shards of glass on the floor of our bathroom which my wife discovered by slicing her foot. The housekeeping manager apologized sincerely and cleaned it up, and the front desk took $30 off our bill for the inconvenience. For a supposedly higher end hotel, I would have expected better service.

We'll probably stay somewhere else next time.",4,0,0

I gave you several chances, I informed you about the problems I was having and I even confronted you in person. But, you leave me no choice, this is our goodbye. 

I had a very long list of all the problems I had but lucky you, I accidentally deleted them from my phone =[ So we'll go off of my memory, and pictures to back them up. 

I also don't know who gave you the ok, but you are not even close to being a 5 star hotel. 

1. Biggest complaint = NO WATER?!?! Ok, its Vegas, who doesn't stay out late to club, gamble, drink? I came back to my room around 2am and there was no water to found anywhere. First I wanted to shower, but nope, no water there. So I proceed to brush my teeth and wash my face - again, no water at the sink either. Ok, lets try the kitchen, notta! If the hotel is going to undergo any maintenance, let your guests know!!! I received no warning at the time of check in, no call, nothing. There was water in the toilet bowl! However, I was soon disappointed to find that there was no incoming water to flush that toilet. 

2. Finally, I was so happy to find that water was up and running in the bathroom and the kitchen the next morning. However, midway through my shower - the water turned freezing cold. I couldn't even get all the shampoo out of my hair because I could not take it anymore. I had to finish up in the sink! 

3. The stove doesn't work. What's the point of advertising that all your rooms come with a kitchenette if the main appliance doesn't even work!? 

4. That morning, I spoke with a representative in lobby - told them about the water and stove issue. I was then informed that the hotel was doing some plumbing work and that someone will be up in my room to fix the stove immediately. Again, why didn't anyone warn the guests of this before so they can plan accordingly? That day, I drove up to the grand canyon and did not arrive back at Vdara till 9pm that night. Not only was the stove STILL NOT working, but the room WAS NOT cleaned either....Needless to say, management was no help at all. 

5. Holes in the towels, classy. I'm sure house keeping would notice since all the towels are neatly folded. But I guess it also didn't matter because 2 towels with holes in them ended up in my hotel room. I have pictures for proof! 

6. I was also a little taken aback when I poured myself a glass of water - there were bits of blue paper stuck to the bottom of the cups! 

7. Worse pull out beds in life. I felt like I was directly laying on a bunch of springs, each poking me individually. The venetian is a much older hotel and I'm sure their pull out bed have been around a lot longer than Vdaras, still I found the Venetian ones actually comfortable! 

8. Surprise surprise. You know those people that flick little wallet sized cards at  you on the strip? The cards with naked girls on them? Yeah, well I found 3 of those cards under the pull out bed. How do you expect me to explain that to my younger brother!? 
Yup, that was the last straw, Vdara no more.",6,2,0

First off, resort fee is BULLSHIT.  Wifi is slow as hell and they didn't always refill our water.

Came into the hotel at 3 told us it'd be another hour to check-in.  Room fucking REEKED of weed and apparently the only solution they were willing to even entertain was a can of air freshener.  

- Bathroom was never cleaned.  Did the whole write into the steam and see if it goes away.  For our 3 day stay it was there right with us.

- Went to the spa and the charged services 3 extra times and then some.  Yes I was spoiling myself because I HAD JUST GOTTEN MARRIED.  I don't have a spare 3k in my pocket.  The spa never spoke to me directly and when I tried to get this sorted out while I was still there, and at no point did anybody just offer to send me a revised receipt or an email or even a middle finger.

- Then 4 days after I checked out, I get another random $200 charge and their response was ""we have no idea why this was charged.""  Then just fix it.

- Hallways were always filthy

- They have no customer service number but an email which conveniently you'll never find a response a week later.

One looked like their regular suite, walk into the sitting room area with the bed on the left then the bath beyond. Large standing shower and a soaking tub. 
The second room has the TV and desk separating the sitting area and bed area. Much nicer.... 
We were able to check in early and parking was a breeze. Whats with the extra fee $15.00 for newspaper, Internet etc...

An hour after checking out of the hotel I realized I had left my brand new sonicare toothbrush in the hotel.  I immediately called the hotel and they told me to call back tomorrow after they had finished cleaning the room.  I did and they said they did not find anything but that I should call back later in the week to see if it was found.  I called back again and, again, nothing.  I understand I am responsible for my belongings, however this makes me question the trustworthiness of the staff that cleans the room.  I still don't understand why someone would want to take a toothbrush or, maybe throw away something that is obviously not trash or a disposable toothbrush. I contacted Vdara and informed them of the value of the toothbrush ($200) and they had me file a report since it was over a certain amount.  They also said they would contact me within the next few days once they reviewed the claim.  A month later, I received a letter in the mail saying they very sorry about the situation but under Nevada law they are not liable.  They also went on to state that, by law, they provide a safety deposit box at no cost (per the law) to store valuables in.  Who would ever store an electric toothbrush in a safe?!  This is horrible customer service.  I have had friends who have accidentally left valuables (including an engagement ring!) and non-valuables (articles of clothing) in hotel rooms and have had them returned. I would never have written this yelp review if this incident had been handled in a satisfactory manner but it is obvious that Vdara is not concerned with customer satisfaction, only what they are liable for by Nevada law.  In addition to possibly employing untrustworthy staff, customer service and guest satisfaction is severely lacking.",1,0,0

The biggest downfall of this place was the surprise $250 security deposit required at check-in that they fail to mention in the fine print when booking. It was just frustrating because it was another $250 that we couldn't spend while out there. 
It was, however, super clean, and modern. Our room was cleaned everyday pretty well. The building is so tall that if you're anywhere near the top floors, your ears will pop every time you get in the elevator because they go so fast.
The pool was very impressive. We spent every day there. The staff was so nice, the waitresses came by every hour or so, making sure we didn't need any thing more. They were very accommodating. There was plenty of chairs to lounge out, but it did get PACKED on the weekend. So if you want a chair on the weekend, get there early!
The other downfall is that, there's no fast way to the strip necessarily. Yes, the hotel is on the strip, but not facing it. So the front doors are facing their garage that they share with Aria. There's a walkway outside the front doors right to Aria's front doors, but you have to find your way through Aria, then get out to the strip. Or what's worse, is taking the tram that travels from Monte Carlo to Aria shoppes at Crystals, then to Vdara and Bellagio. It takes awhile, and then you still have to travel through the halls, the tram is quite confusing if you're new to this city center area. We found it best to take the back exit of Vdara, down their corridor, and go through the whole Bellagio and get to the strip that way. It was better than going through Aria in our opinion.
The refrigerator in our room sucked, but that was really my only complaint about the room. It was hardly cold and wouldn't change temperature, and it hardly held anything. We couldn't fit more than 3 beers in it. Other than that-I would have nothing bad to say about the rooms. The shades and blackout shades for the morning were pretty convenient and a nice addition to the room. Those blackout shades really came in handy in the morning hours because you're so high up in those tall buildings that the sun really is right there.",1,0,0

i arrived here for my stay at Vdara for the 8\/8\/12-8\/10\/12..i sure wouldve stayed an extra day if it didnt cost me a whole body or two to stay here! 

my bf and i drove to vegas and when we first got here, we were a bit confused at their valet system because the roads were a lil weird since they share it with Aria. but we got the hang out of it, right when we got our of car..we were imediately greeted and offered for bell hop service. we politely declined and moved onto the lobby.

front desk-
i got here around 2pm (since that is the check in time for several hotels) so i guess that would be a reason why the line was going really slow to check in. but NO, it was because they only had TWO employees\/ladies working the frront desk and had two needy ass couples they had to dealt with. so the line i was in which did have 3 people waiting to check in (including myself) turned into 12 people in line! you would think they would call for back up or something. no they didnt..they did have a random guy in the front desk area who had glasses on with a caramel complexion just walking back and front and doing nothing. i didnt get it. front desk was a breeze after 25 mins waiting in line. i had to ask for my complimentary buffet tickets (which i wish i didnt have to because it should be a given) and the weird thing was usually every hotel ive been at usually asks if i would like to upgrade my room..they didnt, but if they did i think i wouldve. $$ lost for them and btw $25 for resort fees each night PLUS  an extra $3 resort tax to it each day as well. total $56 bucks! yes, its ridiculous!

the room-
we got the standard deluxe suite and the room was amazingly clean. i loved the dark wood decor and modern feel to it. i was a little bit dissapointed in the size of the room. i mean, i knew it was their standard room but i wouldve just called it a deluxe room instead of a suite...prb because it had a mini kitchen thats why they had to call it a suite? LOL.

we did use their kitchen to save money on us buying food out on the strip, their fridge SUCKS in size\/space!!! i mean cmon why give us a kitchen if we cant store the food we bring in it. it was like the depth of a boot size shoe box. i had to sit on the floor and reconfigure every container of meat i brought so the door can close! their electric stove IS amazing though...i dont why there wasnt any dish soap or even a place to hang your dry dishes after you washed them..so i had to improvise by using their bathsoap to wash. 

the bathroom was on the small size in my opinion but every amenity in there was a great. we used the bathtub - which was a decent  size and the shower can fit two people but it was smaller than what i was used to. the countertop\/sink area was on the small size for me as well..i had to move their vdara products and bath dishes to my bf's side because it was so small for me to put all of my bath necessities there.

the view was great and the bed was probably THE MOST AMAZING BED i ever slept on. my bf and i would be so damn tired from the day\/night's events and when we woke up the next day -we were def refreshed and none of our muscles ached!

the hotel itself-
vdara doesnt tolerate any smoking nor does it have a casino. at first i thought it wouldnt be a problem but since my bf and i do like to gamble here and there..it wouldve been nice to gamble inside of our own hotel. although it was a nice change and i could see vdaras view on why they did so. we didnt mind walking to aria or bellagio to gamble and eat anyways. i didnt see why people were complaining about the walk from vdara to the strip...youre gonna walk everywhere and for a good amount of distrance anyways! vdara didnt have a great selection or should i say nearly any resturant\/food options..they had a lil market area but that place was so overpriced than usual vegas prices...because it was organic and all the natural fancy nancy foods haha. so my bf and i just ate at aria or any other close by estashblishments. 

would i stay here again or not? -

most likely not, although i did enjoy the convience of the location and modern amaneties..it didnt live up to some of the cons i had for this hotel. i think im more drawn and spoiled from my last stay at cosmopolitan. i would  probably stay next door to Aria since it did have the ameneties i was looking for and etc;or back to cosmo.",2,2,1

This time around- room was incredibly dusty all over, carpeting well stained, and showed age far greater than the actual age of the hotel. And don't touch the Fiji water- unless you like paying $18 for a bottle. They now also charge $26 for parking (!), and $44 each day for ""resort fees"" (Vegas went down to hell- at least 10 years back, they comped so many things and actually made you feel good about losing money- now you leave with a sour taste in your mouth). The bar area seating to order drinks is way under staffed, and took about 35 minutes to get our $15 cocktails. 

Front desk service was also subpar. If you are the type who like to tip front desk for upgraded room, avoid Kevin C., who will take your tip ($20) without hesitation and act like he's giving you a better room, when in fact it is worse (tested this with a friend who checked in same time and was told there were plenty of Bellagio fountain views on higher floor). Went back down and requested a different room with another front desk, who promptly gave me better room. 

If you receive a tip and decide to keep it, then follow through with the non-contractual request of room upgrade. If you don't participate in this, politely deny the tip and give them the normal room. Don't be an ass to accept the tip, act like you're providing an upgrade, and stick you in a room with a parking lot view (he called it ""incredible city view"" and actually fibbed that there were no more Bellagio fountain view rooms). I called down and called him out on it and had that weasel transfer the tip to the one who gave me better service. Or request specific room type and if they deliver, then maybe tip. Either way, I'm done with Vdara. If you don't have a casino on site, at least compensate for that with superb service, free parking, and better room.",3,0,0

I wish I could of giving you a 5 star review, but there are certain things I would like to share with you. I hope you can take this review and improve.

Being that it's Sema week and Halloween weekend I understand that your hotel is booked up and busy. But the most ridiculous part of this is your check in \/ check out times. I'm not sure why any hotel would have a pm check in time. Meaning I would have to wait till noon or later just to get a room? It doesn't help when your girlfriend is handicap and our flight was super early in the morning. We got in to town at 6:55am and after getting our bags, car, etc etc. It was already 8am! At this point we are pretty tired and need some rest. One of your representatives help us get checked in, but was unable to get us a room.. she put a rush on it, but it still wasn't going to be available till this afternoon 11\/1\/16 (keep in mind that my girlfriend is handicap and we are sleepy!) So she offered us another available room for 30 dollars extra a night. I turned it down because I was already spending a thousand for 4 nights, resort fee, paying for rental car, tipping ,and paying for valet parking. And she wasn't able to do anything!? 

So my girlfriend and I waited for an 1hr in the lobby deciding what we should do. At this point most hotels are booked and we wouldn't be able to find another place. So I went back up to the counter and other representative helped us. His name is Cody and I would highly recommend and give 5 stars! I told him the situation and he found a room right away. It was the same exact layout of the room we wanted, but the only difference is that it's a room for the handicap meaning walk in shower and lower counter tops. Perfect!!! I asked him if it was 30 dollars extra for the night? He said ""nope, same price as you payed for no extra and you can go up to the room right away and get some sleep."" I couldn't thank him enough! Great service from Cody!! 

It's now 1047am and I can sleep because I'm writing the review. 

I apologize if it doesn't make sense. I'm not all there right now. Time to sleep and then go have fun.",0,0,2

I was a little unsure about the whole no casino thing and not directly on the strip thing, but since I flew in to Vegas for EDC, I knew I wasn't going to be spending much time in my room anyway since my friends and I were a bit ambitious with the pool parties, clubs, and actual event at the speedway. It was SO NICE to have a relaxing setting without all the cigarette smoke you would find in your usual casino resort. It's not too far off the strip and you can always take the tram to aria\/crystals\/Monte Carlo. 

The breakfast is pretty delicious for room service food. The dinner menu ok. It looks kind of unappetizing but it tastes all right if you're too lazy to go out or have some comps available. 

You can charge everything to your room which is cool. 

Housekeeping is awesome. They reorganized our messy stuff on the tables\/bathroom (in a good way) and clean the shower each day for you so it's like your in a new room each time you come back. The staff are super nice too. Hands down the best experience I've had in a Vegas hotel. I realized how bad my MGM experience was last year while on this stay lol.",4,4,2

-No self park, valet only. This is a royal pain. Costs me quite a bit since I tip.
-No coffee maker, no tea bags etc. Even the the 3star suite places provide this.
-The kitchenware must be requested and only include a two pans , plates and bowls. So if you plan on using the kitchen for breakfast it is barely useable. I am not sure why the kitchen was provided in the first place.
-No walkway to Cosmo, but the walk is relatively short.

Pluses:
-Nice rooms with great views.
-Great service.
-Walkway to Belagio (and Aria but not sure).
-Smoke free.
-Provides a  calmer atmosphere than the surrounding casinos.

Overall not the most practice place if you planning on renting a car or using the kitchen. I would chose a different place for the price the next time.",0,0,0

Upon check-in, we were told that there was a ""MANDATORY"" resort fee ($15 + tax = $16.80 per day) that we had to pay, which included 2 tiny bottles of water, 2 coffees, newspaper, valet, access to the fitness center and pool (which wasn't IMPRESSIVE at all by the way, similar to a gym pool).  I was like, ""Aren't these things STANDARD for every single hotel?""  The person at the front desk kept repeating the same thing, ""This is a MANDATORY resort fee.  Unfortunately there are no exceptions and everyone has to pay for it"".  

To be honest, I wasn't very happy with this arrangement because we were not told about this HIDDEN FEE in the first place.  Right, $16.80 extra isn't THAT MUCH per day, but still, I wasn't happy with the fact that we weren't told about this upfront, and I wonder if the fee was even disclosed.  I later checked with the neighboring hotel, Aria, and found out that Aria has no resort fee or whatsoever.  I hope sooner or later, this charge will be dropped altogether for all other customers as it is absolutely ridiculous in the first place!  Something that is standard in EVERY hotel now becomes an excessive luxury, and we didn't even use the fitness center or the pool (which was closed on the last day due to weather condition).

If one is looking for some quiet time, this is definitely the hotel to stay as it does not have a casino.  Personally, I think it is a bit inconvenient as we have to walk via an outdoor pathway to get to Aria.  Each room is a suite which has a living room, dining area, microwave, coffee machine, kitchen, etc.  The room has nothing to complain as it is contemporary and quite high tech. 

Overall, I'd give it a 3 star rating; honestly, there are so many other hotels on the strip that I can visit next time.  Vdara does not have ONE particular area that really stands out for me to be a loyal customer or raving fan.  The call is on you--you make the choice, but at least you now know about the resort fee and won't be hit by any surprises!!  :O",1,0,0

We're not at all disappointed with our recent stay (3 stars = ""A-OK"") and we're glad we tried it out.  We don't necessarily plan to stay here again though due to the distance from the strip and the lack of blackout shades, both of which are important to us. Overall it's a nice place and I highly recommend spending a few extra dollars for a view.  

The Pros:
-Quick and easy to get in and out of the hotel and room
-Amazing view from my fountain view room
-Great toiletries 
-Pretty good happy hour in the bar with the sweetest waitress
-Easy walk to Bellagio, Aria, and the tram going to Crystals & Monte Carlo
-Fresh, clean environment and smoke free!
-Quickest check-in I've ever had in Vegas
-Comfortable bed

The Cons:
-Shades don't effectively block out light
-Several minutes walk to the strip
-Fire department has a station next door and we were woken up several times the first night by sirens
-The couch cushions slid all over so the couch was very ""slumpy"" and uncomfortable
-Nothing in the kitchenettes to make them functional (available upon request though)
-Many of our room's electronic items barely worked (TV remote, buttons for shades, a couple of the lamps)",1,0,0

First impression was good.  Hotel was centrally located to the strip, Aria was right across the way, and it wasn't far from the airport.  It's quiet and secluded in not in the craziness of other resorts. They actually had a shuttle which we did not know about until checkout. Concierge can arrange a pick up for you.   We were able to check in early which was a surprise and at no charge (they Front Desk associate Cody made this happen). 
The room was decent...has a little kitchen, seating area, and large bathroom.  But...we had bloody sheets.  GROSS.  Called Front Desk and they said they would send housekeeping.   We waited for a bit no one came. We decided to leave and comeback later and upon our return still had bloody sheets. You can only imagine how upset I was at this point.  I pay $400 plus and I get ignored all the while some one else's bodily fluids are in my bed.  A House Keeping manager came up took pictures and then and left.  15 minutes later the housekeeper came up and changed our sheet.  They were apologetic but offered nothing for the inconvenience.   At checkout I requested at least one of the resort fees be taken off and they honored it but also included another night.  Would have been nice if that actually took a more proactive approach beforehand.  

Another side note on housekeeping...we left for the day and each time we came back our room still hadn't been serviced.  If we area gone from 10   to about 5 pm, there is no reason a room should not be serviced.   Not to mention the fact that there weren't a lot of people on the 17th floor. At least none that we saw...in fact we hadn't seen another guest on our floor the entire time.  

One last random note...the water in this hotel was hard!  Maybe my skin is accustomed to filtered shower heads or maybe its just west coast thing but that water made my skin extremely dry and I broke out after taking showers here.   It was scratchy and irritated the entire time. Now that I'm home using my own shower with no issues, I'm convinced its the hotel. 

Outside of Housekeeping issues and water problems, the overall stay was decent considering the price we paid on Super Bowl Weekend.   Would I give this hotel another try? Maybe. But overall I wasn't too impressed with my stay.",2,2,0

My room faces I-15 and a little if the Aria,  maybe if I could see the fountains of Bellagio, I would feel better about this hotel, not.  To answer some of the previous reviews:  no coffee maker in my room,  no way to get hot water,  if you want a cup of hot coffee call room service, pay $6 for small pot plus $5 for delivery plus tax plus tip and wait 35 minutes or get dressed and head out.  Strong encouragement to get out of your room.

Okay now the bed, nice bed.  Light switch for big lights by the bed is in the kitchen area.  There are small led style lights by the bed but they suck for reading, reminds  me if the days as a kid that i read in bed with a flashlight.  No outlets near the bed, forget about charging your phone and having it close by.

Wifi, okay, thanks, but not free, part of the $15 resort fee.  Don't plan on using the desk.  Very small, gotta pull the desk away from the wall to get to the outlets.  Come on,  put the outlets 8"" higher up.  Duh!!!!!  Speaking of outlets,  plenty, but not convenient.

Last bad note:  3 small drawers for clothes.  Did I say small, I meant tiny.  

Onto the good stuff.  The bathroom is great.  Plenty of room, separate shower and tub, nice tub, even if you are not a tub person, you will want to get in.  

Two big flat screen TV's but only one remote and the layout of the space precludes two people watching different channels.  The buttons controlling the window coverings are cool,  but that feeling passes quickly.

I can't get enough of this hotel because all the staff were so accommodating to all my needs. In fact, I was so impressed with my stay I emailed the management on how well trained their employees are on providing excellent customer service. If only they trained everyone else in the world working in customer service. I stayed in the executive hospitality suite, which is the largest room they have if I'm not mistaken. 2 bedrooms, living room, kitchen with a large front counter with breakfast nook and 2 and a half baths. There was also a washer and dryer, which is probably useful if you're staying a few days especially if you have kids. The major downer about these rooms is that you don't get a view of the strip or the beautiful fountains at Bellagio because these rooms are located on the opposite side of the hotel. I was told by front desk all these types of suites only have a view of Aria and the I-15 freeway, not bad I'll take it. Beds were comfortable from what I can remember.

The pool area is small, but ambiance is fitting for the demographic of those staying at the hotel.  Pretty mellow with mainly mid aged adults and a few kids here and there. My only suggestion would be is for the music to be louder as Lee had also mentioned in his review. 

P.S. LOCALS: if you are looking to have a ""hotel party"" Vdara is a good option, despite all the noise coming from my room (music and a ton of people), I did not get one complaint nor did I have security warn me about the noise level. I know at other hotels they shut down your party immediately if other guests are bothered.",0,0,1

-entire hotel is non smoking
-rooms are really nicely furnished. Real classy look
-comfortable beds
-extremely quiet. I couldn't believe I was in Vegas. 
-big showers with tall shower heads 
-I don't know if this is standard, but my room had microwave, decent size fridge and even an electric range
-fast wifi (no device limit, unlike some other Vegas hotels)

Cons:
-a little hard to find if you are directionally challenged (by either foot or car). This City Center area is like a Bermuda Triangle for me... I've got lost so many times its not funny 
-roughly 10min walk to the strip 
-no in room coffee machine (you can rent one for $20 a day which comes with 4 coffee pods... that is excessive given you are already paying a $30 resort fee)
-limited dining options in hotel

Fitness room was decent size. People say it's small but it does the job. The Dumbbells are pretty light though... Go up to about 50lbs

There is no casino, which is okay with me. There are many casinos within an extremely short walk (eg Cosmo, Aria).

I thought it was absolutely wonderful that Vdara is a casino\/smoke free hotel.  It was like walking into peace and then deciding when to join chaos. It was a wonderful change; however, with this difference there were other areas I expected Vdara to excel.  That would be the concierge and service experience.  The concierge was an awful experience and our one call to service took so long (just asked for silverware) we left to go to a restaurant; instead of eating what we had planned in the hotel room.
 
The atmosphere of the hotel was wonderful but the service experience was not worth going through again.
 
If someone was staying for business, I'd consider telling them to try it.  If they're going there to have an enjoyable, relaxing, happy experience; I'd tell them to go to the spa, don't talk to anyone (except the spa attendants) and stay somewhere else.
 
The concierge should be incredibly friendly, hospitable, knowledgeable, and eager to please.  The concierge I had was none of those things.  It took 5 minutes for him to acknowledge me, after watching him happily assist someone else.  In fact another lady brought his attention to me, I was really hoping to speak with her for assistance but that's not what happened. The attendant that did ""assist"" me, didn't seem to know what he was doing in regards to spa appointments.  Plus I was informed by the front desk attendant that hotel guests get a discount on spa treatments.

So after getting onto the correct ramp and taking the correct ""exit here"" sign, we pulled up to the VALET ONLY parking, which is FREE but we just tipped.

Walking into the lobby, the concierge is up front, there's a bar, sitting area and the tram that you can take back to Monte Carlo I believe. FYI, I didn't know that Vdara was a non-gaming hotel. Before you can even get to the elevators, you must show your room key or the old probably ex strip club bouncers won't let you thru. Maybe because the hotel is so damn tall, but the elevators were shaky all the way up. They were pretty fast, but I've been to the Empire State Building ... I don't remember that elevator shaking left to right. 

Once you walk out of the elevators, the floors look like a high end condo or apartments. My cousin's suite was a corner suite which was nice since it only shared one wall. The suite was nice, windows galore with views of the Cosmopolitan, PH and the rest of the strip. No matter where you are, sunsets are pretty and there was a good 180degree view from the room. The blinds were those automatic control blinds with the remote control. There was a half bath off the entrance, table for 4, kitchen with fridge, oven, stove top & microwave. You had your living room, flat screen, desk in the corner with views of the strip. The bedroom was a king bed and I don't know where they got there sheets, but they had to have been 1000 thread count! LOL. Softest hotel sheets ever! The bathroom was pretty big, glassed in shower, two sinks, soaking tub also with strip views.

All in all, its a nice hotel. Would I stay here?! Maybe. It sucks that its a non-gaming hotel, because what happens when you get bored?! You can't just go down and play on some machines. You'd have to gown down and walk next door to Aria. Also, some of the finishes in the room looked like ""luxury"" but you could tell they weren't.

We were able to check in early at noon instead of 3pm and was pleased right when we entered in our hotel room. It was nicely decorated with modern and elegant features. Vdara is eco-friendly and is committed to be non-smoking. It's conveniently located in the heart of the City Center, in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip. Only passage to the Strip is to walk through Bellagio. The staff were very welcoming and friendly during my stay at the Vdara. There are resort fees ($20) applied daily to this hotel in case you're wondering!

The room:
Instead of those ""Do not disturb"" door signs, Vdara considers it by the click of the button. After clicking the button, the outside doorbell light turns blue which means ""do not disturb"". 
The room includes a sofa that can be pulled out as a queen size sofa bed, but it's expected to not be as comfortable as the actual bed. 
The kitchen was on the side right when we enter our room with a sink, mini fridge, mini stove, and many cabinets.
The window is a panoramic view, with 2 layers of blind shades that you can control by the touch of a button!
The bathroom has separate tub and shower, but no ventilation. The bathroom door is a sliding door with a lock of course.
The bed was very comfortable, courtesy of Sealy mattresses. Vdara also provides a list of products they purchase its bedding products that's available for you to place an order if you really like it.

The bad:
I'm sure many Yelpers have mentioned the cons of this hotel already, but Vdara does not have a casino as its commitment of being a non-smoking hotel. To get to the casino or the Strip, you'd have to take a walk through Bellagio (no negatives about Bellagio!).
We've experienced a water shut off around 1-2am during our stay which disappointed us. I understand it's late at night that they wouldn't bug you to notify, but I would like to be warned ahead of time. When I used the water around 1am, I felt like water was scarce since the outflow was limited as if Vegas ran out of water. My boyfriend then uses the bathroom and there were NO outflow at all.

I would stay at this hotel again, and would only recommend it if you don't mind the walk through Bellagio for the casino or the Strip. You do a lot of walking in Vegas anyways, so it wouldn't hurt as much. It's a very nice and clean hotel throughout.

They had given me the two story one but I did not like the layout and they quickly upgraded me to the single story two bedroom suite. The room had two separate rooms with the kitchen n living area in the middle and the rooms on opposite sides. One room had a king bed and a master bathroom and the other had two queen beds with a regular bathroom. There was also a third guest bathroom and the couch turned into a pull out bed. Great for a large party.
My second stay here was in a regular room that was still very spacious. Had a kitchen and living room as well as the king bed.

They also only have partial view of bellagio fountain, unless you stay at one of the top floors. We stayed at 24th fl and half of our view is blocked by bellagio building. Parking is valet only and when it's crowded, it can take a while waiting for your car.

Having said al those, the hotel is very nice for 2 people per room. The bathtub is my favorite! Also the hotel does not smell smoke at all since there is no casino, so not many people smoke at the lobby. It's pretty easy to get to aria and bellagio and they even have tram to get as far as to montecarlo.

If you're looking for the party atmosphere, it's not here. Think spa, not twerkmode. Our panorama suite was beautiful; unfortunately they stuck us on the backside of the hotel so our view was of the highway instead of the strip. Boo. Suppose we should have voiced a preference.

In any case, the suite was sleek and modern. There was a full kitchen, living room, and spacious bedroom that housed a super comfy bed, not like there's much time to sleep in it while you're out doing that Vegas thang anyway. We book the room for a few of us to stay in, so we ended up utilizing the pull out sofa bed. Uh.... super uncomfy, yo. Feels like springs are jabbing you in the back. Needless to say, I reclaimed a spot back in the real bed. My suggestion? Don't try to do the packing-more-people-into-a-suite thing here. Vdara is for luxuriating... so luxuriate. Book it for yourself to enjoy.

The only setback I could find is that you have to walk about 10 minutes to get to The Strip. It's kind of a hassle, especially if you're in your heels. I like the idea of just stepping out of the lobby and landing right in the heart of Vegas like you can from most other hotels.",13,8,12

We usually stay right on the strip. When we first walked into the room, we were pleasantly surprised. It exceeded my expectations. Unfortunately about 5 minutes after we arrived, we were in the entry area and we heard the door unlock and a strange man walked in with his luggage. Apparently the hotel booked this room for 2 parties. We called down and they didn't do much about it but say sorry once. I was expecting a little more for a very uncomfortable situation and a big mistake on their part. At least breakfast the next day. ANYTHING! We spoke to a couple different employees about it and didn't receive any compensation. Thank God we were fully dressed and had just got their ourselves. If the situation was any different, we would've made a bigger deal about it. After that ordeal, we went to get into our mini bar for a soda and it was locked. Called downstairs again and they proceeded to unlock it, which didn't work. She said she would send up someone from maintenance to help us out. After waiting for awhile we decided to  just leave. We didn't want to waste time sitting in our room for a coke when it was our first night in Vegas. All in all the guy never showed up. I was expecting alittle better customer service from such a highly rated hotel. I was less than pleased.

The rooms were pretty, and clean, and it's super conveniently located. If you're attending a convention event at the Bellagio, the Vdara is actually closer to the ballrooms than many of the Bellagio's rooms itself.

We had to change rooms FOUR times due to lack of cleanliness...and I don't mean some trash left over in the cans. I mean smudged windows, mirrors and left-over food in the fridge. 
In each room, different amenities were present or not present. Sometimes there was soap...sometimes not. One night we got a splendid turn-down service complete with little candies left on our pillows. The other two nights, the room looked barely touched. Sometimes we were left with a couple of waters in the fridge, sometimes 4 and sometimes none. 
Some amenities for the room, like silverware, dishware, cleansing liquids and cookware are only available on request, but you don't always get the same standard items. We were brought plates, but when we washed them, they were taken away and not replaced. We asked for laundry soap and were told that the hotel was out of stock. I looked on a housekeeping cart outside my room and there were about 10 boxes of it on the cart. 
Our keys were deactivated for no reason and, when I called the front desk, the clerk had no record of us in the room. I suppose they deactivated the keys because they thought the room was unoccupied. Hmmmm....
The coffee shop is run and manned by children who do not communicate with each other. I was there 10 minutes and saw two transactions where lack of communication either caused the hotel to lose money or the customer to lose product. 
All this said, each interaction with a SINGLE PERSON is lovely. Housekeeping and support staff are kind. Front desk were helpful. Manager (named Kendall) was extremely professional and apologetic. 
However, there is no standard of service from floor to floor - much less room to room. 
Vdara has real promise. It is smoke-free and health oriented with a FABULOUSLY appointed gym\/spa and pool area. The decor is beautiful and well matched. 
It could be a real gem on the strip, but this type of hodge-podge service is unacceptable. I hope that the staff are well treated and, if not, get off this ship before it sinks.",3,0,1

I was in town for my buddy's bachelor party and they were staying at Aria next door. Vdara was cheaper by about $50 a night so I booked my own room over here. It was only a 3-4 minute walk from my room to the Aria casino so not being in the same hotel wasn't an issue.

I arrived late on Thursday night, around 10:30pm. There were only 3 people working the front desk and when I arrived, there was a line of about 3 people ahead of me. It took about 20-25 minutes to finally get to the front desk. Once at the desk, the checkin process only took me a few minutes.

Once I got my keys to my room on the 22nd floor, I made my way to the elevators. There is a security guard by the elevators checking for room keys. You simply have to show him the key as you walk on by. Something else to pay attention to is that there are 3 elevator banks and each bank correlates to specific floors. Make sure to go to the right elevator bank to make sure you and up on your floor.

Upon walking into my room, i was greeted by the small kitchen in the hallway leading to the rest of the room. The room was a good size and was quite nice. The bathroom had a on the counter sink, toilet, and separate shower stall and soaking tub. I took a good look around the room and everything seemed to be clean.

Everything worked as I expected and I didnt have any issues at all. 

Overall, while the room was nice, it felt kind of cold. I don't know how to describe it and I don't know what i really expected but the room was just cold.

In the middle of the strip, but away from the action by about 2 blocks. There is no casino, no club, the pool is small and not alive. If these are required for your trip, don't book this hotel. We had to take the taxi out each night because walking would have taken over 30 minutes easily. 

Clean, simplistic interior, bed is super comfy (and I have a bad back),  and the staff is friendly. Tip: don't buy water there, you can get free water at the valet, or the cleaning staff will have it available, one lady gave us a whole tray. The bathroom was large and clean, but the toilet seat was puny, really small! The room had 2 tv's which was excessive because we couldn't really watch 2 at the same time because of volume, but it was manageable. Had a mini kitchen and dining table as well.

Got the room service, cheese fries and chicken Caesar salad, not bad. Prices were higher than let's say a restaurant, but that's obvious by now, right? Internet is included in resort fee ($25) and valet just required a tip.

The room had a SPECTACULAR view with wall to wall windows and the room was very modern and upscale.  Two flat screen TVs, remote window shades, beautiful tub and shower, nice compact kitchen, ironing board, dinner table, couch, internet access (but bring your own laptop), two bottles of water....  

The entire hotel is non-smoking so that is sensational.  Aria with its casino is a two minute walk and seems to have the best ventilation system in Vegas or maybe because so many of its clientele are from Vdara that the air is so much nicer than any other casino.  There is also a tram to next door Bellagio and the concierge was able to get us a dining reservation at Michael Mina spur of the moment so that was terrific.  I think all of these hotels are part of the same company.  

Word of warning.  We went to next door The Cosmopolitan and absolutely could not find our way out of the place without back tracking all the way out the front, through the Crystal mall, through Aria and finally back to Vdara, even though I could throw a rock from Vdara to the outside of The Cosmopolitan.   

So in Vdara you arrive, wait let me also say that in my Honda Accord Navigation 2600 W Harmon does not exists, too new, and 2600 E Harmon IS NOT THE SAME PLACE!  I give 2600 E Harmon zero stars and did not enjoy the drive through slumville.  Vdara has valet parking, so in most cases great.  Stop, unload, walk right to the front desk, up to the suite.  Super.  Compare that to the self park at the MGM, hauling your bags for 10 miles of shopping and casinos, to the desk, then back through the casino and shopping to your room...

So I get to Vdara and tell the Valet, keep the car close I need to leave in 30 minutes and am in a rush.  I get back in 25 minutes and wait 10 minutes for my car.  RRRR, no tip for you dingus.  Leaving on Sunday was almost 30 minutes waiting for the car.  Plusses and minuses for valet here.  I also asked on Sunday how to get to Caesar's Palace and the valet told me to go left on the Strip.  I am not going to tell you all of my shortcuts, but there is a backroad that is 100x faster than Las Vegas Blvd.  Another dingus in the valet department.",0,2,0

The modern themed resort is located in the city center right off the strip across from Bellagio and Paris resorts. The hotel from the outside looks like a shiny convex\/concave mirror that grasps excellent views of The strip and city center depending on your room. 

When we arrived the Valet service was on point and baggage trolley ready. As we walked inside we were quite surprised how easy it was to check in. No walking across casino floors, no lines, no smokey air, and right to the point. Very different from the USUAL Vegas hotels. We arrived at the resort at 9am in the morning and our reservations weren't ready yet. Since all the rooms are suites I asked if there are any other rooms available earlier and they upgraded us to a room with a view of the bellagio fountains for FREE since our rooms weren't ready. Def an excellent way to start off our vacation. 

The check in was very fast and the service was really friendly. We ended up staying on the 39th floor. Another convenient aspect of the Vdara was the elevators, turn right from the check in and boom! The elevators are right there. No going thru all the chaos and noisy casino floors. This is a GOOD thing after a long night out, stumbling out of a taxi cab at 5am and wanting to go straight to the room. Of course being a high rise the elevators are very fast and can be quite queasy at times. 

When we approached our rooms the hallways are very clean and modern themed as well. Electronic doors are nice and easy. As soon as you walk in a kitchen space with a table, microwave, stove and fridge. Then the living area with a fold out couch and a divider that holds a flat-screen TV and desk workspace. IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN 3 PEOPLE DONT STAY HERE, No cramming friends into this hotel room because it will be uncomfortable for all. Its a smaller room that is great for 2-3 people MAX. It has a very comfortable king sized bed and a spacious bathroom with a bathtub, shower, toilet, and sink area. Again everything is straight to the point. Best part of the room is the 4 panel panoramic window that over views the Bellagio resort and their fountain show. 

The property is perfect for the people that want to stay in Vegas without the young, drunk, gambling type of people. Much more relaxing even the pool. If your looking to gamble, the Aria resort is a walk away and has all the rest of the amenities for the party-goer. Another great part about the Vdara hotel is the walkway connecting the hotel to the Bellagio resort so you can do all your shopping or go to the casino, restaurants, and nightclubs.

We were upgraded to an upper floor room with a view and didn't even have to pull a ""twenty dollar trick.""

Our suite was huge and came with a super comfy king sized bed, mini kitchen and a living room with a couch and chair.  Because this hotel is smoke free (much appreciated) none of the rooms or hallways had nasty lingering smells.  The pool area was classy and clean and had an attentive waitstaff to bring drinks and snacks.

I loved Vdara but in trying to write the most honest review possible I must say that this place was seriously lacking in concierge service.  Vdara must remedy their concierge situation to prevent long lines and long waits.  A start would be putting at least 3 staff members on duty at any one time such as they do at other City Center resorts.  Waiting 30 min to print a boarding pass is just too long.  Nonetheless, our stay was a five star experience and Vdara provided a perfect alternative to the smoky, noisy strip casino hotels.",2,1,2

So it doesn't have a casino or restaurants, that's what Aria & Cosmopolitan are for. It truly feels like coming home. It is smoke free and clean. I love coming back to this hotel! 
From arrival to departure I had no issues whatsoever. Best to call valet (like is suggested) and they will have your car waiting for you by the time you get downstairs. Bellhop did take about 20 mins or more but it gave me time to relax and love the view from my room.
Not a whole lot of staff around the place, so the staff that is there could be a bit more outgoing so they standout.

This was our 3rd time staying at this ultra-hip, luxurious, and four diamond hotel & spa. Each time I visit this hotel, I'm blown away by their high standard of care, first class customer service and impeccable taste for the ultimate luxurious hotel & spa experience. The biggest draw for us was the fact that this hotel is a non-smoking & non-gaming establishment so you NEVER get the smoky, yucky feel of most other hotels and it sets for a relaxing, spa-like feel when you enter the hotel instead of the noisy, Vegas feel. 

ROOMS: all rooms are suites that resemble more like a hip NY bedroom apartment. The decor is ultra-hip with shades of brown, green, and splashes of various modern colors. Depending on which room view you get (city view overlooking the City Center buildings, pool view, or lakeview overlooking Bellagio fountains), they are all pretty amazing. TIP: you can always ask for a specific view upon checking in. All three visits, we have requested for a ""nice"" view and have thankfully been given free upgrades based on availability. Two flat screen TVs  in each room (one facing bedroom) and the other in the living room).  All suites come with its own kitchen (fully operable glass top, refrigerator (no freezer compartment though), microwave and a cute dining table. Each room allows for two complimentary water bottles as a basic service to the guests. Note: there are no coffee-makers, dishes, or silverware but these can easily be requested through housekeeping. 

BEDROOM: Sheets\/comforters are standard white and green. Not too fancy or impressionable but definitely feels ""laundered"" and NOT grimy or dirty. The mattress has a memory foam feel to it so it's very plush and comfortable. However, the pillows are a bit too thick for my husband and I (we can only sleep with very thin pillows b\/c we don't want our necks to pop out of our spine). We ended up throwing pillows on floor and sleeping on just the mattress w\/o pillows. Rooms are super quiet (no noise from outside can be heard in your room. 

BATHROOM: The bathroom alone earns 2 stars for their chic bathroom tubs\/sinks and  well equipped with ""green"" amenities (paraben\/sulfate\/gluten free soaps & shampoo\/conditioners). Even has a glass weight scale for the health conscious peeps who are counting calories. Feels like you're in a luxury spa! TIP: Call housekeeping to ask for complimentary robes and slippers for the ultimate comfort in your suite.

SPA: My husband and I opted for a 50 minute couple's massage package that included bath salt scrub and hot stone massages (he opted for deep tissue and I choose swedish). Prior to our massages, we were escorted to a waiting room (men and women were separated) where they had complimentary water\/tea\/sweets & snack bar. We were thoroughly impressed with the spa amenities, decor, and ambience. Not a cheap excursion but definitely worth every few hundred that you spend in this spa! 

OVERALL: If you want to do Vegas differently (i.e. non-smoking, non-gaming, non-noisy but still be in the midst of Vegas excitement), stay at the Vdara! You won't be disappointed. My rating is the highest I've ever given for any hotel or establishment. Like I said, I have a love affair with Vdara that will continue as long as they continue providing top-notch services and amenities aforementioned. See you at our next anniversary\/birthday celebrations...until then, I miss you already Vdara!",6,0,3

Location is central though still removed from the Strip; this can be good or bad depending on if you want a slight ""retreat"" or not. Vdara's hotel restaurant has closed for some reason, perhaps due to the economy. On the other hand, Aria is right across the street, and there is a walkway to Bellagio from Vdara.

Service could be improved. The book in the room says checkout is at 12, but concierge mentioned checkout was at 11, so I called the front desk to clarify. I was promptly informed that the time had changed a few weeks ago. When I responded with an ""Oh..."", I was told that this information was on some paper that I signed when I checked in, in a ""you should have known better"" tone--instead of apologizing for the confusion or automatically offering to extend the checkout time.

At check-in, there was also no mention of our $50 resort credit (which was the promotion we used when making our reservation) until we asked about it the next day, and the $50 amount was not automatically deducted from our hotel bill until we again stood in line and asked for the credit at check-out (so we couldn't use the video checkout or express checkout).

One , we were celebrating a 10 year wedding anniversary with family and friends, and I was told when we originally booked that the Vdara would possibly upgrade our room or surprise us upon our visit.  That never happened, nor was it even mentioned by any of the staff.   Second, we elected to get the VIP curbside service so we can be rushed to our rooms once we arrived at the hotel without waiting in line. Instead, we call Vdara from the airport to let them know we're on the way, but once we get there , the staff told us the room isn't ready for 20 minutes.  So  there we are in the lobby with our suitcases like a bunch of shleps waiting after flying for 6 hours from nyc....20 minutes later we go back to the front desk. The guy behind the counter calls the room and starts whispering in the phone.  He says they are still cleaning and to wait another 20 minutes, he'd let us know then.  No apology or I'm sorry.  Nice douchey move.  So basically we waste 40 minutes in the lobby after rushing from the airport.  We were told after the $50 VIP curbside service credit could be applied towards our room or for food, but that wasn't the point. Besides,one of the only places to buy any food in the hotel is in the Market Vdara downstairs which charges you $22 for a 3 egg omelet , $16 for eggs Benedict., $12 for a salad, etc.  You get the point.  The valet was also hit or miss.  Sometimes there was no line and you still wait 15 minutes, sometimes they were fast.  One time we were all chatting for a good 10 minutes and we asked the valet where our car was, and he said he called our name 3 times and he walked away all pissed off. Mean while, we were the only people waiting for a car so you would think this tool would at least come up to us to ask.  On the bright side, house keeping was very good.  We had to ask for extra towels now and then, but they were on point.  Room was clean , spacious with an ok view of the Bellagio fountains.   I did request a room on the 40th floor or above, but we were stuck on 33.  The pool was decent, not huge so it gets crowded easily depending when u go.  The fitness center has free weights and a treadmill, but your basic hotel gym.   It's a short walk to the Aria, which is nice, but to get to the Strip is a good 10-15 minute walk.  A car would be best, or take the tram to Bellagio and walk from there.  Overall a nice looking hotel, but administration and management are definitely lacking in key areas.

This hotel now charges $18 every time you retrieve your vehicle. (Keep that in mind as you read the rest of my review & FYI, this hotel is valet only no self park)  The valet staff is incredibly RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL.  We constantly dealt with the valet guys standing around chit chatting while we stood there waiting for them to get our vehicle.  The manner in which they speak to you is APPALLING.  The valet is managed so poorly that the typical wait time to get your vehicle is a minimum of over 20 minutes or over 45 minutes during peak times. (no one answers the phone even if you try to call down in advance to request your car) 

If you need to call for hotel amenities your call will go unanswered.  We called down to the spa, valet and bellhop with no answer. (no one mans these phones at a hotel?!?)  We then waited over 45 minutes for the bellhop to bring our bags to the room (it was NOT during a peak time) - when we called a second time to check on the status of our bags, it was apparent our request was never forwarded.

No maintenance seems to be done on this hotel.  We had to walk down 33 flights of stairs due to broken elevators.  We also had to change rooms twice - first room stunk of sewage and the second room had an overwhelming odor of paint (there was still painter's tape left on the wall!).  The employees in the Market Cafe Vdara are rude which seems to be the norm with this hotel.

You have your own kitchen, microwave, mini fridge and the bathroom has a shower and a separate tub.  So modern and clean.  Definitely a place where you feel like a million bucks.  Before my stay here the concierge called to ask if I needed anything before I landed! 

They do charge you a daily fee but you get unlimited access to their gym, free wifi, and bottles of water.  I know it's kind of annoying having a daily fee but honestly, if you stayed at other hotels their gym fee would probably be double that for a daily pass. 

The walk to Bellagio and Aria is seriously only 5 minutes so although you don't have the convenience of a casino downstairs, you aren't missing much...and you are probably saving yourself some gambling money too!

Partly due to the hotel not having a casino so the stench of smoke on the carpets isn't present.  Both good and bad.  If you do want to get your casino itch in, the Aria is walking distance.  The only downside is that although you can walk to the strip, it'd get really tiring because it is a bit of stretch to\/from the strip itself.

There's a little cafe\/convenience store in the lobby.  Along with a Starbucks and a little bar area.

One thing is the elevators.  There's 6 of them for the higher floors and they're pretty slow.

This hotel is in the brand new city center. It is a bit in rear end of it also, so to get to the strip involves a lil bit of a walk. That is really my only gripe...this should be considered a 4.5 star review... You can get to the strip from going down to the bellagio (there is a walkway), or through aria and out.

Check-out is at 11:00 am, but you can push it back an hour for late check-out.  

The room came with a kitchen, which we didn't use. There aren't any utensils or dinnerware anyway, because you have to request for them. The mini-fridge was too small for us to make use of it. A majority of the time, the girls went to the Market Café for food. There isn't a restaurant in the hotel, so it was the only convenient option. 

Next to the kitchen is the living room area. There was a sofa bed, tables, and a TV. The sofa bed couch was not comfortable. On the other side of the living room is the bed with another TV facing it. The bathroom was adjacent to the bedroom, which was spacious enough. The room has automatic blinds that you can black out. It was the first time I saw anything like it.  

There were two minor problems with the appliances. When we got into the room, the alarm clock was going off. My friend couldn't figure out how to turn it off completely.

It's a great hotel, nice change of pace with the no casino and no smoking policy. We stayed here through a friend that owns a residential unit, so we got a great rate. The hotel has a great location  in between Aria and Bellagio & across the street from Planet Hollywood  & Rio behind it. The hotel is in the middle of everything and that's why it called The City Center.
Check-In - 3\/5
It was very quiet in the lobby area. The design was clean and sleek. There was a line at the front desk and the agent called for some help there were 3 or more guests waiting. The only snag we ran into is the fact that they charge a $100 security deposit per night during your stay. We stayed 2 nights so they authorized a $200 deposit. 
The Room - 3\/5
The room had the same design as the lobby very modern and contemporary. We had a Studio Deluxe with a Lake View (Bellagio Fountains). The view of the fountains and the Eiffel Tower was great! The room design is a kitchenette at the entrance then the living room with a partial with 2 TV's to separate the bedroom. The bathroom was descent; it had all the basic needs. The blinds are mechanical, but should never be called ""BLACKOUT BLINDS"". They won't black out the room, waking up in the morning with the sun in your eyes after a night in Vegas is not good. The room is a little cramped compared to The Wynn and Encore basic rooms. The 2 TV's are useless because they are back to back, and having guests watch in the living room while you're watching in the bedroom combines all the sound. The foldout bed from the couch is a very thin spring mattress with a pole running through your back.
Overall 3\/5
Overall we had a great stay. If you're looking for a hotel that is quiet, simple, and up to date, Vdara Hotel and Spa is a great hotel. This is hotel is definitely not for people coming to celebrate bachelor\/bachelorette parties, or birthday parties. It more people in need of a stove top, microwave, and refrigerator. Vdara is not up to par Wynn, Encore, Venetian, or Palazzo. I was very happy paying the $130\/night, but it's definitely not worth paying $200+ a night.

I liked their non-trippy decor. The simple clean design and suites were great! I loved the beds n pillows but the other half thought the beds were strange and too soft (to each his own).

Check in was a breeze. Jordan helped us and was great! Efficient and had a great personality. Our experience with the rest of the service staff was stellar (altho SIL did not have the same, she waited 1\/2 hour for her luggage because the guy that helped them  took their ticket and forgot about them!!!)

I appreciate the Cafe at the lobby that has GREAT coffee. They sell some basic groceries and all the suites have a stove top so one could cook breakfast or a late night snack! Pans and all types of kitchen ware can be requested~

The downside is the $20 resort fee and the fact that they dont have their own casino. But w the Aria casino, it is not too much of an issue (unlike Trump).",0,0,0

I have been wanting to stay at Aria for a minute and we decided to do vdara since they offered suits. Upon checking in we were able to upgrade to the executive suite which was awesome. It was a corner suit with 1 and a half bathrooms and a separate living area and full kitchen. The suit had an amazing view of the strip. I mean you could see everything! We were even able to get a complementary bottle of champagne with some chocolate covered strawberries since I was celebrating just graduating. The entire staff were great for the duration of our stay and it was located right in the middle of everything so what's there not to love! I would absolutely recommend them and come back again!,6,1,2

They're part of the MGM program and also participate in Hyatt points. From what I'd heard, the ownership is shared as a hotel and as a rental property.

The hotel itself it somewhat remote. There's a nice pool and spa\/fitness center. A lobby bar which offers food and drinks until 12:00 a.m. The Market Cafe is nice for breakfast or lunch.

I liked the modern look of the spacious room and their view of the Bellagio fountains so I suggested that my friends and I stay there on our April trip.  Ugh... not worth over $200 a night.  

First, through a reservation error, we didn't get a fountain view.  They were booked so we couldn't change and ended up with only a view of the parking garage and delivery trucks.  Gross.  Then, we were charged a $25 resort fee... which would have been fine if the amenities that were included in the charge were nice.  But they weren't.  The internet that's 'included' didn't work with our cell phones, only the laptops... slowly. If the pool would have been a nice one, that would have been cool... but it's not.  And, the 2 'complimentary' waters are about 4oz bottles... if that.  That's almost insulting and definitely laughable since you're in the desert.   So much for a 'resort fee'.  They don't even provide dryers in the bathroom.  

The rooms look nice but there is nothing open 24 hours so if you get in late, you have to walk over to Aria for food\/water\/etc.  Also, when we tried to call down for Valet they apparently didn't feel like taking call downs.  Not a crisis but just an inconvenience when you're in a hurry to get to a show and thought you could have your car waiting for you.  

These things I didn't realize when I was a brief visitor at my friend's room.  I only saw the nice room, bathroom and kitchenette.

This means a couple of things: 1) you can keep more of your hard earned money and 2) there won't be a ton of random people walking through the hotel which makes getting cab at night easier.  

It's location in City Center is ideal if you like shopping.  And it's close proximity to The Bellagio and Cosmopolitan put you right next to a couple of great hotel\/casino situations.

The service was generally good, staff were generally friendly, and I loved that we were just a short walk from the Bellagio and Aria. I would definitely stay here again.

I had two complaints, each of which I consider a 1\/2 star off:

1. DO NOT USE THE SOFA BED EXCEPT IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. Seriously, it was the worst sofa bed in the world. The kind where you can feel every single spring, as well as the bar in the middle of the bed. It was especially offensive in comparison to how lovely and comfortable everything else in the room was. 

2. Caught some seriously bad attitude from the chica at the front desk when I had to re-register a request to have the sofa bed made up (no sofa bed sheets 6 hours after my initial request). I wasn't pushy about it, just explained the situation, and then she turned it around as if it was my fault. It was unprofessional and just plain AWKWARD.

The Vdara is a respite from the humming and bells of the Las Vegas entertainment options. Beautiful, quiet, hospitable-it's really very relaxing to end the day here.

Checking in at the hotel desk you may notice just how quiet the process is. The design of this first floor emphasizes curvature and softening corners. The effect draws your attention, rather than divert to the Vdara bar\/restaurant, a large refreshment\/cafe\/storefront and a Starbucks. But it's actually QUIET! Wedding party gathered? QUIET! Love this.

My friend took a 26th floor disabled access room. Larger than my suite, divided into two rooms, tastefully appointed and add from my description below a full size Sub Zero fridge\/freezer.

My 43rd floor room begins with a large kitchenette, Bosch full size microwave, 2 under counter fridges, (one stocked as a mini bar,) a Gagganeau 2 burner electric stove top ( bring a pan,)and then a nice dinette for two.

Next is a large space divided in two by a large dressing console with attached writing table.
Each side has a 50"" TV. One side includes a queen sofa bed, the opposite a comfortable queen size bed. Now a large closet (another in the bath,) ironing equipment and hangars.

Ahhh...the bath. Imagine very large, deep, free standing tub and accessory caddy nearby. A full size, glass enclosed rain shower. Lovely toiletries, luxurious towels, hair dryer.

What else? Immediate response to your inquiries (I've asked for additional items.) Full spa. Swimming pool with reservable cabanas.

Parking is valet only (complimentary) and we had to wait quite a while when we first arrived to valet the car.  Check-in also took FOREVER and I was told that I couldn't get a view upgrade because the hotel was sold out that night. The problem with the Food & Beverage credit is that it can only be used for room service, the lobby bar, or the market cafe (but not the market part).  We ended up using it for coffees, sandwiches, juice, and desserts at the market cafe and it took 35 minutes after we ordered to get our food.  I used my Salon Spa credit for a nice manicure but I would never pay $50 for that service.

The room seemed really small despite its square footage. The kitchenette, dining area, and hall are just wasted space. The bathroom is also laid out kind of oddly, with the tub at a diagonal.  It seemed like the lack of a towel rack was a design flaw so they placed a little towel cart next to the shower. The area just didn't flow well.  Since over half of the suite is poorly laid out, the living room\/bedroom area seemed really cramped.  Oh, let me also mention that the ""blackout"" blinds leave a huge gap of light coming in.

I found a deal that got us a room at the Vdara for a decent price and decided to just book it. When we arrived the lobby, was GORGEOUS! And smelled amazing! Quiet and intimate, no hustle and bustle of a loud casino (don't get me wrong i LOVE that sound, but it was refreshing to be in a different setting). The front desk staff was attentive and friendly, and the check in process was efficient and simple.

The room was beautiful. We were in a Deluxe suite which was PLENTY of room for the three of us. There was a king sized bed with a pull out queen sofa. We had expansive windows with a great view of the bellagio fountains. As soon as we got there, a show was starting so of course we all whipped out our cameras and got a great view. The weird thing was, we also had a view of another rooms bedroom and since both our blinds were open at that time, we were able to watch some guy getting ready for bed and texting while in bed. super awkward? yeah. 

The room had a mini kitchenette - we didn't use it, but there was a sink, microwave, and fridge and it had a bit of counterspace which would have been nice had we stayed longer. The bathroom had a shower and a tub, which was nice. 

The nice thing about this hotel is that since there's no casino within the actual hotel, it's priced a bit lower than other hotels in the area. It's ""off the strip"" in that it doesn't spit you out onto las vegas blvd from it's front door, but it's right behind the cosmopolitan which is on the strip. There's a walkway that will get you to the Bellagio, which is amazing for my future trips since that was my favorite gambling spot (and I may not always want to spend the extra cash to stay there). And, you can easily walk to the Aria. 

Along with the rest of the hotels on the strip (or the ones I've looked at), valet parking is complimentary if you're staying there. We had rented a van for our journey to Grand Canyon when we got into Vegas that night, so that was a nice convenience.

The hotel and our room were very clean and the fact that it is non gaming (nonsmoking) was great to get back to after many smoked filled hours. When you're ready to get to the casino Aria and Bellagio are steps away. 

Parking is valet only which is great because it keeps others out and the valet guys are great at helping with taxis and car service.

The hotel is amazing, the service is top notch and I had a wonderful time at the hotel. However, one thing really made me feel like a criminal and put a bad taste in my mouth. 

I like to iron my shirt before a big day of meetings and being CES, I wanted to be in top shape. I pulled out the iron and ironing board. To my surprise, not only did the ironing board have a iron holder bolted to the end of the board (making that end worthless and making ironing a shirt challenging) but it had a security cord attaching the iron to the board. Did they think I was going to steal the iron? Do they really have a problem with that? 

I've stayed at hotels from no star to four star and this is the first time they have ever been attached. It's challenging enough to iron with the cord much less having two cords. I hope that Vdara will correct this. I can't imagine that iron theft is a problem and if it is why don't you just charge the client.

The Vdara is part of the city center, and it can be hard to navigate your way to the Strip. We made the mistake of going through Aria a few times and it takes forever. We quickly learned that the hotel has a walkway to the Bellagio, and it put us in a much better position on the strip. On average, it took about 10 minutes to get from the hotel through the Bellagio walking, no more than 20 minutes to get to the Flamingo\/Bally's.

If you want to be in the center of all the action, this hotel is not for you. But if you want a beautiful, relaxing place to go back to after a day or night out in Vegas, than stay here ! We ordered takeout at 4am and there is something to be said about just going down the elevator to pick it up at the front desk rather than taking a 20 minute walk through a casino to get there :)",0,0,0

As a result of the Vdara being a non smoking, casinoless hotel in Vegas that is a little ways off the strip, you walk into a quiet establishment everytime. Have no fear though- if you need to smoke and gamble, just walk next door to the Cosmo. On that note, the Vdara is close to the shuttle that travels from the Cosmo\/Vdara to the Aria and eventually Monte Carlo. 

Rooms are spacious- great view from the 53rd floor, had no complaints. Rooms are really sleek, clean and modern. The kitchenette area is nice for storing drinks and food in the fridge. I am not sure who needs to use a stove, but it's there for you! Maybe the microwave will be better utilized.

Staff is very friendly. Housekeeping always had a smile on their face. No complaints.

We had an excellent view of Las Vegas.  We could see the Bellagio fountains from our room.  If you bring a car, you will have to valet it.  The self-parking is pretty far away.  The valet is complimentary for guests -- just gotta tip.

Once you exit the hotel, you can walk to the tram which will bring you around CityCenter.  You can also exit the hotel and walk to the Vegas Strip.

Front desk to housekeeping staff were all courteous and more than helpful. The scent in this hotel is incredible. It is subtle and smells so fresh. As many others have mentioned, since there is no casino and no smoking on site, it is wonderful to walk into this place. They let you know upfront that if you are smoking on site they charge a $250 fee (fine). They have a nice little bar available right by the front entry and a little deli that offers bagels, sandwiches, etc.  The rooms were only exceeded by those at Encore. Very nicely designed, electric shades, bed and pillows...oh my God! Nice little kitchenette, even though we didn't really use it. We arrived at the hotel at 10am on a Saturday and they had a room available on the 8th floor, but she offered to put us into a handicap accessible room on the 21st floor and we jumped on that. It was essentially the same room with only a few differences; microwave and bed were a little closer to the floor and the shower had some alterations. Minor issue with the shower not having a shower curtain, but it was brought up to us by housekeeping. They were also going to bring up a liner for the curtain, but we never received it, not that we cared. Some have complained about the distance to the strip, however, we thought it was perfectly situated. Aria is right next door and the back entrance to the Cosmo is about  1\/2 a block away.

For a last minute trip, my friends and I got a special one night deal for $180 at a Vdara corner suite so we were stoked. Since the hotel is the sister to Aria resort, we had high expectations but they were faltered as the minutes passed, realizing that despite the stellar view of the strip and Vegas mountains, inside the room was: 

1. A dirty kitchen - utensils were not properly washed and un-emptied trash from previous guests
2. S L O W service - the Vdara seems to be lacking staff since it took about an hour to bring up our suitcases from the bellhop and another 30 minutes to bring up extra towels.

The upgrade didn't come as a surprise to us later on when we learned that not many people check into this hotel. Shocker. Other than that, I do have to say that the staff is super friendly, though there aren't many of them.

I was planning on asking for management in order to share my concerns during checkout, but as others have stated, the lines were so long we didn't want to wait.  Instead I emailed these concerns to guest services and only got a form letter response.  I feel I put enough time into writing my concerns that they warranted a personal response.  I want to provide them with this feedback to make the experience better for future guests.

My wife and I stated at the Vdara for our anniversary in May 2012.  We both thought the hotel was very nice, and enjoyed our stay, but there were several items that kept it from being the ""three diamond"" experience they so heavily advertise.

When we checked into our room and did a quick inspection of the room, we noticed the minibar was locked, the TV in the ""living room"" area didn't work, and the guest refrigerator on the right was slightly cooler than lukewarm.  I called the front desk and they told me they would open the mini-bar remotely.  I called housekeeping and they said they'd send a technician up for the TV.  The technician came up and fixed the TV by reconnecting a cable in the back.  I asked him about the fridge and he said it needed to be defrosted.  I let it go, since it was more trouble than it was worth, and it at least provided a minimum amount of refrigeration.  

Two hours later, I checked the minbar and it was still locked.  I called the front desk again and they said they'd have to send someone to look at it, but since it was after 5PM it would have to be the next day.  Nobody came or contacted me otherwise for the rest of the weekend, and the minibar stayed shut.  It is probably still broken.  Luckily I had a cooler that I used with ice from the hall machine to keep the wine and champagne that I bought in the lobby cold.

Saturday morning the bedside alarm went off at 5:30AM, waking us both up.

I recommend to management that they add the following items to the maid service routine: check the minibar to see if it opens, check the TVs to see if they turn on, check the fridge for refrigeration, and turn off the alarm.  This would be three diamond service.

Another couple of notes.  In the hallway, one of the lights was burned out.  It was a ceiling light shining on the wall paintings between 29036 and 29038.  It may still be burned out as I write this.

Finally, the parking situation is difficult because of the poor signage.  Driving up to the hotel, I went down a closed road and had to back up and go around twice until I could figure out how to get to the valet.  Leaving, we went out the wrong exit and had to turn around to get back to the strip.  With aggressive cab drivers it is particularly challenging.  It would be relatively easy to redesign the signage to point out specifically where one has to drive to get to the valet.  For example, if they were to place one large sign on the spot where the current small Vdara ""loop"" sign sits, showing a diagram with ALL four (five?) road options that diverge from the front of the hotel, and label each of them, the problem will be minimized.  The valet affirmed that I was not the first person to complain about this.

We liked the fact that there was no casino and no smoke.  The pool was nice although crowded even on a super hot day.  We didn't notice the death ray reflections from the other buildings that other critics have talked about - the large umbrella helped.  We'll come back, and hopefully will get a fully functioning room next time.",2,2,3

When I moved away from the area, City Center was still just a much of scaffolding with a couple pieces of glass on it. To see it finished, and be able to stay at Vdara, was truly a treat.

Checking in late on a Wednesday I never expected an upgrade to a corner suite, but sure enough I got one! Oh boy, how can I ever stay in a regular hotel room again? Full kitchen, washer and drier, large living room separated from the bedroom by beautiful smoked glass doors, and (my favorite) separate soaking tub and glassed in shower. Sooo nice. I couldn't have asked not more. Even though our view wasn't that amazing from the 6th floor facing the parking garage, it just didn't matter with all the luxury around us. Truly a beautiful room!

My only complaints with Vdara would be the room cleaning service and the fitness center. On 3 out of the 5 days during my stay all my wash cloths were taken but not replaced. Also, after using the 4 glasses and 1 (yes, only 1) mug in the kitchen, they were also taken but not replaced. It was pretty annoying...Then the fitness center so waayyy too small. The 3 times I went it was packed tighter than a can of sardines; no cardio equipment open, no room for functional training. I know vacations aren't supposed to be about working out - most of the time - but I really would have appreciated a more conducive place to my fitness. 

Overall my experience was wonderful. I would stay again without hesitation. Believe what others say about this being a hotel you can actually sleep at in LV. It was very quiet. On the 6th floor I only heard trucks in the morning; nothing at night. If you're like me and don't go to LV for the nightlife, you'll love this just as much as I did.

Not fantastic as I thought it would have been, but we did get a really good deal through a travel agent. This is an all-suite hotel. We had a junior suite. I believe it was their most basic, cheapest suite.

Pros:
*Convenient, quiet, non-smoking location and right behind the Cosmopolitan.  If you want to gamble, it's a 2-minute walk to Cosmo.
*Overall, the suite was nice.  Nice mini kitchen complete with two mini fridges and a microwave, and spacious room with 2 tables, couch, and bed.
*Multiple electrical outlets within reaching distance of the bed
*Panel controlled shades
*Starbucks located on-site near lobby and market cafe

Cons:
*The shower head was not adjustable.  It's like the shower was made for someone 6 feet or taller.  I had to stand right against the wall just so the water could reach down to my head.
*Controlling water temperature was annoying.  Our tub water would be backwards: turn to HOT to get COLD water.  And the water from the sink was always hot.
*We returned to our hotel at 2am to find they shut off our water, and it wouldn't be back on til 6am.  We didn't get notice or anything. That was a big no-no for me.

Notes:
*Their mini fridge has sensors under the alcohol, water, and snacks. So even if you shake the fridge just a little, you will get charged, so check your hotel bill regularly.  This happened to us when I slammed the fridge door to keep something from falling out.
*There's no cookware in the kitchen.  You would need to call the front desk to have someone deliver it.

My friends and I usually only like to stay at the Palazzo since the rooms are huge with 3 beds. When we saw that this place was cheaper and had the same size room online we decided to give it a try. We got a corner suite which was a bit extra but man did it pay off.

Our room had giant windows that when the blinds werel ifted gave you and almost 360 view of vegas. It was probably the best view I have ever had in vegas. Now the room itself was great. It had a full kitchen with a filtered water faucet in the fridge (which is freakin amazing in vegas since you get so thirsty from the heat and smoke and water costsl ike 20 bucks downstairs). There was also a washer and dryer which i was very surprised to see. The bathroom was very luxurious with a bath tub and shower. The beds were very comfortable but the pull out bed was not at all.

The problem started almost immediately as we checked in to the hotel. First, we drove around looking for the self parking garage, and couldn't find it (or signs that say there's no self parking at Vdara). Finally I called and the hotel said that Vdara only does valet...which is unusual for Las Vegas. Anyway, so we dropped off our car and checked in. Our suite was pretty nice but as soon as I sat down on the couch in the living room, I felt my socks getting wet. There was a large wet spot on the carpet right in front of the couch. Not sure what that puddle was (and praying it wasn't puke from previous guests), we called the hotel asking someone to take a look at it. Mind you that this was immediately as we got into the room on Friday afternoon. A guy came, looked at it, didn't offer anything useful and just gave us some towels to put on top. 

Moving on to Saturday, the big day. We got back to the hotel at 3pm and the room was still not made up. The wet spot was still just as wet as yesterday. We called the hotel asking someone to take a look at it again and to make up the room. By 4pm, still no one came. So we called again and then left for the pool for a quick bit of sun. Came back at 4:30 to get ready for the big night. Our dinner reservation is at 6pm. We were planning on being ready by 5:30 and have the family up in our suite for a quick round of drinks before heading out. As we walk up to our room, our door was open, there was a huge cart outside and 6 people in the room. We asked what is going on and apparently that wet spot was from a leak from the AC and they had moved all the furniture in order to strip the carpet!! Who does this during a guest's stay without asking them first whether if it's okay with them? To have 6 strangers go into your room with all your belongings tearing apart the living room is NOT what I expect to deal with at a 5 start hotel. Additionally, the maid is cleaning bathroom at the same time! 

Bear in mind that NO one had apologized to us at this time for this craziness. We asked if they could come back to do this after we check out tomorrow since we are now running late in getting ready for dinner. It took a long time for them to move back the furniture and clear out the room. Meanwhile the maid is still taking his time cleaning the bathroom so we still could not get ready. Imagine my husband and I just standing in the middle of the suite with all these strangers there and a mess everywhere while time is ticking away. By now, I decided that we need to switch rooms . Again no one was around to help us. We called the front desk explaining this and asking to switch us to the nearest room so we can get ready. One woman came over saying she is the manager then said she will ask the manager to see if we can get another room (....i thought she was the manager??). After several more phone calls by us to the front desk (because no one came back or called us), they said finally they found another room and someone will come to take us to the other room. Meanwhile I had to frantically clear out everything in the room and dump them in the luggages (which irritated me so much because all of our nice dressy clothes\/costumes has to be shoved in the luggage). Still after an hour (now it's 5:30) no one has come to get us to a new room!!!! So now we are looking at possibly missing our dinner reservation. 

So I hauled my stuff down to my mother in law's room to use her shower.  Any woman knows that 15 minutes is not enough time to shower and get ready for a fancy night that you had planned for months! I was so frustrated and overwhelmed at this time that I broke down in tears (which I NEVER do in public). We rushed out of the hotel (my hair wet) without being able to do our little pre dinner get together and luckily reached the restaurant without losing our reservation. 

On sunday, I called the hotel customer service to give them feedback The woman on the phone said that she will call me after talking to her manager and credit us some money back in an attempt to remedy the situation. Days later, no one called. We saw a credit of $44.80 on our card.....what the heck does this mean? This is so insulting. Do they think that this horrible ordeal has a price of $44.80? 

Additionally, we left some valuables in the first suite during the chaos.  A reasonable person would see this and easily be able to figure out who this belongs to. They should have contacted us immediately. No one did. We had to call the hotel's lost and found to get them to send it to us.

We have stayed at almost every hotel in Las Vegas from 3-5 stars. No place was this terrible and unprofessional. I feel so insulted by this hotel. I will NEVER stay here again.",5,1,0

I believe this is a five-star quality, smoke free, casino free type hotel with high-quality, sheek and spacious rooms. We stayed for 1 night.

The kitchen looks straight into the living room which was nicely decorated with medium sized couch. There's a huge mahogany  shelving unit\/entertainment system that divides the living room and the bedroom, so there's no door to the bedroom. The mattress and sheets are super comfy. I was sleeping on a cloud. The bathroom seems like it doesn't have a door but it has a sliding door within the wall that you have to find. The bathroom has a lot of counter space, which I appreciated, a stand-in shower with separate two person intimate bathtub, and an extra mahogany coat closet which is a nice accent. There are two night stands with drawers, one on each side of the bed and if I remember correctly the entertainment center had drawers too. TV has general cable. Hotel food can be catered to the room.

In a corner suite:
-with a pullout sofa, no bedding or pillows provided. 
-no coffee machine. 
-no hair dryer in room. 
-no laundry detergent in room even though we paid for a washer\/dryer. 
-no bath salts. 
-room was filthy. 
-no self parking. 
-mandatory resort fee for wifi. 

Complaints to manager resulted in the waiver of resort fee which is a ridiculous fee to begin with. At the four seasons, I informed them we had no use for wifi and they waive this fee. Calls to housekeeping for a blow dryer and bedding required multiple calls and over 30 minutes, resulting in being late for dinner (to dry hair, not the bedding). 

No niceties in the suite.

I love how quiet and low key it was.  Rooms are comfy, love the separate living area and kitchenette going on.

This hotel has unqualified staff that is incompetent. Stayed here for business this week check in was ok the room wasn't ready but they quickly found another room on a different floor. When dropping off luggage into the room and checking out the layout of the room it was noticed that there was a huge white stain on the couch. I think we all know what this was gross!!! 

So here comes the trip to the front desk to alert the staff of the condition of the room and to request a room change. They should have apologized up and down this didn't happen. They should have also offered to change the room it shouldn't have taken us requesting that be the course of action.

The luggage was still in the room so the receptionist said the key would work for an hour so we could collect our belongings to move to another room. The receptionist said she would note the room and have someone come clean the room after the hour was up. When going up to the room we were unable to get into the room as the key was no longer working, big shocker here! While standing at the door a British couple approached telling him us we were trying to get into there room. Can u believe the hotel just reassigned another unsuspecting guest to the room with the nasty stain without sending someone up to clean the room. After explaining to the couple what happened they let us in the room so we could collect belongings, then head back downstairs.

Cool and contemporary in a residential setting.  One of the best kept secret of the MGM empire.

One and two bdrm suites and two story lofts; 885 - 1,450 sq ft.  All equipped with a full kitchen and top end appliances.  Separate  living room and in larger suites, separate dining room.  Well designed bathroom with separate shower and soaking tub, his and hers vanities in the master with outstanding views to enjoy from the ""throne"".  Sufficient closet space though no walk in's.  Nice up end fixtures, furnishings, and finishes.  Excellent spa amenities (soap, body wash, lotions, bath salts, shampoo, etc...)  Want a regular hotel room?  Studio suites around 600 sq ft also available.  

All penthouse suites and lofts include complimentary limo service to and from McCarran and personal, pre-arrival concierge service.

The catch?  No casino.  So what.  You're a two minute walk to Aria and a three minute to Bellagio and a quick tram ride away from Monte Carlo.

Smaller is sometimes better (has nothing to do with my opening paragraph).  Faster, more efficient valet, baggage service, check-in experience, concierge service, and no line taxi stand, uber \/ lyft stand.

High level MLife?  Add, invited guest check-in, generous tier level discounts, always room upgrades if available.

Outstanding, friendly service.  Exceptional value.  Prices  20-30 percent below Aria.  

Why not five stars?  Sadly, on my last visit in the penthouse loft, there was a lot visible dust on the second story window ledge (not a deal breaker but makes you wonder how clean the units really are).

-A nice breeze that constantly blew across the pool deck.
-Unlike the rest of the Strip, not crowded.  It was nice to come back to our hotel and have some quiet after being out on the insanity of the Strip.

After some not so great dining experiences on the strip, my bf and I cooked in the hotel room.  Be aware that if you get the mini fridge, one half of it is filled with bar goods. So on the other half, with proper meal planning, we were able to hold about three days worth of food. Not bad.

As far as our room, I found the bathtub to be really too high to get out of safely. I'm sure if I needed a step, they would have provided one. However I am a young woman, just short. I literally was jumping to get out of the tub.  
Also, there is so much lighting in the room but really no central light. That seemed silly to me.  Lastly, be aware that they hold your card for one hundred dollars per night for up to five nights and there is a daily 28 dollar resort fee. 

Overall, for this location, the area and the cost is great.  My only suggestions are for the gym facilities. The gym smells clean and looks clean but I must question how clean it really is. There is no equipment cleanser specifically for the machines. I was forced to use the hand sanitizer to clean the machines before and after use. One day I walked in to use one of their cardio machines and there was a slick of sweat left on the handles as well as a puddle of sweat underneath the floor where another hotel guest had just worked out. Also, there are complimentary headphones but no way of knowing if they are used or unused because patrons would use them and throw them back in to the wooden baskets alongside the unused headphones. Plenty of plastic cups and bottles everywhere but no clear area for recycling these items.  TV in every cardio machine but there was only one working remote for these TVs in the entire gym of which there was no backing to cover the remote's batteries.",0,0,0

The hotel is also non-smoking, which we also enjoy.  Nice to get some fresh air after walking through the other casinos.

The rooms are incredibly spacious.  We personally always get the Vdara Suite since it comes with an extra half-bathroom, but is less expensive than the other bigger suites (which only come with 1 bathroom).  We haven't encountered any loud people\/parties going on, which is always nice when you're trying to go to bed early or sleep in late.  Love that a full kitchen comes with the room with complimentary water and coffee, and we're always using the fridge and the microwave.  Just fyi, some suites are way more spacious than others (our first stay had a much larger bathroom, living room, and bedroom, but our second stay had a room near the top of the building so it had a better view).

During our last trip we rented a cabana and it was a great experience.  The pool area gets really hot because of the reflection off of the hotel, so we alternated between using the dipping pool and laying out in our cabana.

The room is more like a suite. It had a cooktop, a fridge, and a separate seating area with its own TV. The decor was modern and looked great. The wall of windows is certainly en vogue as well. The bathroom was large with a separate glass shower.

We had an Executive Corner Suite on the 52nd floor overlooking the Bellagio fountains. We watched the water show from our living room, our bedroom, and our bathroom. Ironically the best place to view the show was from the tub! 

The room was set up like we were at home. We had a dining room table, kitchen, living room with desk space, bedroom, and a huge bathroom. I only rated four stars because we found the couch to be rather uncomfortable and I think I was allergic to it; it appeared to be a down feather couch.

The concierge was amazing to work with as well, in fact all the staff was. Everyone was super friendly and went out of their way to assist in any way they could.

One of the best things about this hotel is there's no casino on site! There's no stall smoke smell and if the gambling bug does hit you, the Aria and Bellagio are on a short distance walk away.

There was a full kitchen and even a washer\/dryer.  I loved the dual sinks too.  They had condo specs for sure.

LOCATION: It's situated along the center of the strip but offset so it's not directly on LV blvd.  It was very quiet and that was nice.

SERVICE: Disappointing.  Housekeeping came to our room at 10am and we were still tired from the night before so we sent her away.  Before leaving the room we called at noon to send housekeeping.  We also turned on the housekeeping light that shows in front of your door that you want the room cleaned. When we left we saw someone a few doors down and thought we'd get taken care of. 5 hours later and they just started in our room.  We were tired from walking and had reservations to get to.  So we went to the bar since there was nothing to do.

The bartender we had was socially awkward, rude, or was offended by us or something because we were very friendly to her and she looked at us like we were bothering her when WE are her customer.  We tried to get her attention to order food and it took a while for any acknowledgement.  She also told someone else to make our drinks.  It was NOT busy at the bar btw.  

When we got back to the room we had to rush to get ready and head off to our reservation.  I REALLY did not like that.  I hate rushing.  They were busy this weekend but hello?  Schedule more people to work if you know it's President's Day\/Valentine's weekend.  We also CALLED to request housekeeping AND turned on the light. That was not great.  If we are going to pay that much for a room at Vdara we would expect comparable service to the prestige of the hotel.  I felt ignored during the whole trip.  The employees either hate their jobs or they do not focus on exceptional service. I felt like I could get the same or better service at The Gap. 

We are from la and visit Vegas often and are trying each hotel to find the favorite.  Vdara is a definite NO on that list.  The room was very nice but I would not recommend Vdara to anyone because there are MANY hotels with nice rooms.  I was looking forward to staying there for a while now and was very disappointed with what I got.  

WHY 2 STARS:  Great rooms and the quiet feel was nice since there was no smoking or gaming. Service was not good.",0,0,0

Vdara is a great boutique hotel. It's on the strip, in the CityCenter plaza. No smoking, no gambling.. PERFECT (for me). The decor doesn't scream Cosmo (trying too hard) and it's plenty lush, even for the cheapest ""room"" suite. All rooms are apartment style suites, like Cosmo & Aria. Hotel staff, housekeeping and bell service are all great, and the room rates are very affordable for the luxury you get. You can pay upwards to 2-3 times for Caesar's or Venetian and get crappy old small rooms with an old projector style TV, smelly AC if it functions at all, and tiny bathrooms. 

I got the VDara Suite for the weekend and it was freaking huge. It was pretty much a 1 bedroom apartment with a queen sofa bed (which I hear was very uncomfortable). The bed was VERY comfortable, down topped with very soft sheets, bath linens weren't the softest but they weren't rough either.. freestanding tub, two 42"" wall mounted flat panel TV's, blah blah blah, you can read about it on their website. Bathrobes provided were very comfortable & soft, and the storage available is immense.. seriously, so much closet space. 

Quick thing, if you're needing a hair\/blow dryer, it's in the main bathroom, under the sink.. the drawers don't have knobs or pulls, so just look carefully for a hidden drawer. Lol... We couldn't find ours until housekeeping showed us. 

I will definitely be staying here again on my future visits.",3,3,3

When we arrived at the hotel on May 19th, the front desk girl offered us a room that was ready on the 28th floor that wasn't facing the Bellagio fountain. I booked a corner view suite had requested a room on a high floor with a Bellagio fountain view when I first made the reservation. There are 56 floors at the hotel. She then said there was a room on the 30th floor with a view of the Bellagio fountain, but it wasn't ready. She continued to look for rooms, which she then said that there was a room on the 50th room with a Bellagio fountain view, but it wasn't ready yet either. We agreed to wait for that room to be cleaned, which she said it would be couple of hours before it would be ready. We waited a couple of hours by walking around the area before calling to check to see if the room was ready yet. I was transferred to housekeeping, who said it wasn't ready yet and they would call me back when it was. After eating and walking around some more for a couple more hours without hearing back from anyone, we decided to go back to the hotel and was told that the room was ready. It would of been nice if they had called me as they told me they would

Upon inspecting the room, we found a dirty fork and knife in the dishwasher, as well as trash in a trash can underneath the kitchen sink. When housekeeping called to see if the utensils were delivered, which I requested upon check-in and had been delivered, I told them about the trash and dirty utensils. They said they would send someone up to take care of it. No one ever showed up, so the trash and dirty utensils were left until the next day when housekeeping came to clean the room. The room did have a great view of the fountain, strip, and mountains!!!

On the evening of Thursday May 20th, I called concierge to attempt to change reservation time for dinner at Jean Georges Steakhouse at Aria. I held on the phone for 30 mins waiting for someone to answer, but no one ever did, so I hung up and decided to call the restaurant directly myself. 

The hotel is a nice hotel, which unlike some other reviewers, I feel that it IS within a short walk to the Bellagio, Aria, The Cosmopolitan, and the strip. I would suggest going to the 24hr CVS, which is a short walk and is located a block south of CityCenter on the strip to grab snacks and drinks, since the market inside the hotel has limited choices and closes at a certain time.

The Clark County fire station is located adjacent to the property. They tend to stay busy, which on one of the late nights\/early morning hours, they seemed to respond to several calls in a span of 4 to 5 hours. The windows are not sound proof, so you will hear the sirens, which may interrupt your sleep if you're a light sleeper.

The entire property is nice, which I would stay there again, especially with it being a non-smoking\/non-gaming hotel.",2,0,0

Polite, helpful, and going above and beyond for no reason other than because they want to.  That kind of ethic always gets 5-stars from me.  It was my first time in Vegas (a city I learned I am not cut out for) and I did the gambling, spending that is common.  What was uncommon was having an establishment, NOT Vdara, overdraft my account by $1500.  As a result, the day I was to leave I had no cash, and obviously, no money in my account.  I was unable to get a cab to the airport... problematic.  After trying multiple ways to use other forms of payment, Ben, the man who calls the taxis for guests, calls one up and pays for my ride to the airport.  He said, ""It's close enough to christmas, right?""  What a way to save the day!
That being said, the environment of Vdara cannot be beat.  The rooms have a simple elegance without all the fluff you find all over Las Vegas.  The suites are clean and spacious with wonderful views, the lobby and sitting areas are open and inviting.  Our suite had a washer and dryer in it!?  That was a first!  Also, it was QUIET.  After walking on the strip all day, it was a welcome change.  

I will likely never go farther in Vegas than the airport ever again... But if I do, Vdara will be my first stop.",0,0,0

My husband and I were in Vegas for three days.  He had to be there for work and they had set us up at the Bellagio for the first two nights.  What a disappointment that so called 'classy' hotel was.  Our room was small and depressing.  A third night there would have been $470 which was waaay over priced for what we were getting.  We decided to change hotels and booked a panoramic suite at Vdara for half the price of the Bellagio room.  Were we pleasantly surprised when at check in we were told our room had been up graded to a penthouse, two level, top floor (56th and 57th) suite.  The suite was an absolute Hotel-Nirvana-Experience!   The suite takes up both sides of the floor, so you have amazing views on both sides of the hotel.  The suite features a spacious living room with gigantic windows, flat screen TV and media center; a dining area; a full kitchen with huge fridge, dishwasher, stove, micro wave oven and washer and dryer; one downstairs bathroom; a bedroom with yet another flat screen TV; an enormous upstairs bathroom with stunning views. The list goes on and on. Another plus point is the free and super fast WiFi, which is a luxury on its own compared to the poor WiFi some of the hotels offer ... and charge for!

On this stay we ordered room service for dinner and it was fabulous! Our server set up our dining table in the room as if we were at a restaurant, he even brought up a small vase with flowers, it was so special. The food was amazing and worth every penny! Shrimp cocktail with huge, and I mean huge, fresh prawns was the appetizer. For entrees I ordered the Short Ribs Pappardelle and the boyfriend ordered Grilled Filet Mignon with mashed potatoes and baby vegetables. Everything came out perfect, my pasta was fresh made and his steak was flavorful and tender. 
I love visiting the lobby bar here at Vdara. Their cocktails are tasty and they always have new items on their drink and good menu. 
This hotel has so much to offer you don't even notice there isn't a casino, which isn't a problem at all because Aria is so close.

Booked the hotel because it's right in the middle of everything and I like the idea that it does not have a casino. It's a modern hotel and the price wasn't bad. Housekeeping did a good job and staff were great. Everyone greeted us, check in was a breeze. Room was quiet, which was a big plus. Hotel is kind of hidden and if you have a car it can be difficult to find the entrance. Valet were great but I wonder what it would be like on the weekend or during high peak season. Dropping off was a breeze most of the time, but trying to get your car in the evening took a little while. I was a little worried about picking up car the morning we left. (Didn't want to miss our flight. ) The valet guy recommended getting there early before 8 a.m.  He said it gets really busy in the morning. 


Room was extremely quiet, bed was comfortable and we slept great without any outside noise waking us up. This is a big plus for me. 

As much as I really wanted to give it 5 stars I couldn't. Here's why:

The sink kept getting clogged, which just grossed us out. I know we could have called front desk, but we just dealt with it. We were so busy and hardly in our room that we just didn't want to spend the time dealing with someone coming into room and fixing it. We ended up using sink in the kitchen and just being cautious using bathroom sink. 

Next the lighting was horrible in the entire room and bathroom.  Room is pretty dark if you have the shades down during the day and at night of course you need the lights. Not all of them worked and the ones that did were not bright enough. Light in bathroom for pull out mirror did not work. Also, I think just the design of where the lights are situated are bad design. 

Refrigerator temperature was not cold enough and there wasn't a place you could adjust the temp.  However, I do have to say that they give you one separate refrigerator to put your items in. Unlike most hotels fill up the frig with their sodas and waters and give you no room to put your own items. Vdara gives you two refrigerators!

No robes in room! I expect this for the price we paid. I don't want to call for this. 

When I tried checking out via television, the menu got stuck. This must of been on their system's end. I had to call the front desk and they had to check me out. 

We will probably stay here again due to the location and quietness. I just hope by the time we go back, they end up fixing the little things that just matter and make them five stars.",0,0,0

Upside: For starters, there's no casino in the hotel at all so that eliminates all the smoking fumes that you always run into at the other hotels. Everything is fairly new in the suites and the design is modern. The suites are spacious enough, and the views are great! Suites have a kitchen and dining table, also there is a washer\/dryer to do laundry if you need to.

Downsides: No self parking what so ever! There is only valet parking, and it takes some time before your car arrives especially when there's a cluster of people going in\/out at the same time. Our check-in time was 3pm, but our room was not ready when we arrived. Front desk informed us it would take 1 hr. more to finish. Fast forward 2hrs 30mins later, our room was still not ready!

The lobby consisted of one restaurant (Silk Road), a small seating area, a bar (Bar Vdara), and a small front desk all within relatively close quarters. The hotel room was modern looking, but definitely 'confused'.. You'll know what I mean if you stay there.

The service was mediocre.. B- at best if even. We did use the bellhop\/valet service who were surprisingly attentive. The front desk was nice (gave us a complimentary upgrade on the 47th floor with the Bellagio fountain view..) but room service (housekeeping, coffee refill, etc) were mediocre. The linens were dirty (all of the guests we stayed with came home with small rashes on our bodies) and the resort fee which included coffee\/water never showed up in the two nights we stayed there. The room also had a pull out sofa bed but strangely no linens whatsoever in the closet.. Two requests and a ""I'll come down myself if it would speed up the process"" later, someone arrived with them. The bathroom amenities were sparse and missing quite a few things that the website promised. There was no face wash, lotion, toothbrushes, or even conditioner. There was two shampoos in the shower and a new bar of soap in the dish. And a strange number of towels... In haphazard locations. The dust also noticeably began to collect on the dark wood the following day. We do not order housekeeping room service during our stay unless the hotel has proven its ratings... And after reading some reviews we decided it was best not to. Also.. the lines during check in and check out were not as bad as some people have experienced.

The restaurant was OK. We were confused at the decor and its name... We got to eat as part of the room voucher so can't really complain at the quality I suppose. FYI I didn't know, you have to pay the gratuity even if the dollar amount should be covered by the voucher.. So much for the happy tip I thought I left because I wasn't happy after I found out when I was checking out.

Anyway, it was a journey to get from the hotel to the strip as other reviewers have stated. We just played at the Bellagio and Caesar's Palace but when we tried to find out way to Planet Hollywood \/ Paris, it was quite an epic journey.. Somehow we ended up at Aria finally and then after walking through Aria did we finally make our way back to Vdara. Unless you plan to only play at Bellagio and Caesar's Palace.. Probably not an ideal location unless you plan to take taxis everywhere. Of course, we were rejected from a taxi because they said Vdara was too close.. from across the street.

Overall I wouldn't stay here again. Dirty linens is just my number one pet peeve. If you plan to make no requests to housekeeping and keep to the connecting hotels, this may be the place for you. We were able to stay for $125\/night + 15% hotel tax + $15.99 resort fee and booked on the Vdara website two weeks in advance. I was going to get the resort fee taken off but my guests wanted to use the sorry-for-a-gym fitness center they had. If you pay more than this, it definitely won't seem worth it.

P.S. We never got to stay at the pool b\/c it was too windy, however it looked incredibly small for a 50-something story hotel. Also.. They expect a heavy deposit so be ready to pay for that at the beginning of your stay.",2,1,1

There's no self-parking at Vdara and only valet available for $25\/nt, which can be charged to the room and includes in and out privileges. If you prefer not to use valet, there are 3 nearby self-parking options. The 1st is the City Center\/Aria garage. After parking, you have to walk through Aria towards the valet to an outdoor bridge that leads to Vdara. The 2nd option is the Bellagio parking structure. After parking, you have to walk through Bellagio to an indoor walkway that leads to Vdara. The 3rd option is to park at Cosmopolitan, preferably near the west elevators. After parking, you have to go up the elevators to casino level, walk a couple steps to the west valet and use the crosswalk and sidewalk to get to a set of stairs that lead up to Vdara. If you have a lot of luggage, drop them off first!

Check-in: There is an option to check in online using the link in an email sent the day before check-in. Upon arriving, go to the online check-in line and pick up the keys. If you want to inquire about upgrades or have other inquiries, you may need to stand in the regular line. The regular line was never that long, about 5-10 guests waiting at a time. During my recent visit, I had checked in online but still stood in the regular line when I arrived. Even so, it only took 15 minutes from the time I arrived at the Vdara entrance to the time I arrived in my room. No casino, nice fragrance throughout the hotel, easy access to elevators, and security at the elevators all day long.

The room:

My first visit, I stayed in the Vdara suite. It had a 1\/2 bath (toilet and sink) next to the entrance to the room, which is great for groups or guests visiting the room. It also had a full kitchen with full size fridge & freezer, table for 4, sink and stove, a small living area with pull-out sofabed and TV, and a private bedroom with king bed and 2nd TV. The main bathroom had 2 sinks, a deep tub for soaking, and a walk-in shower. It also had a washer and dryer, which is handy for taking care of wet swimming clothes! There was a safe, nice toiletries, and robes & slippers in the closet. The view was of the mountains & City Center\/Aria. I loved it!

My recent visit, I stayed in the Studio Fountain View Suite. It's the smallest room available with an open floor plan. Upon walking in, there is a kitchenette with 1 mini bar fridge and 1 empty fridge for you to put your things in, a 2-burner stovetop, sink, and counter space. Past the kitchenette is a table for 2 and the living space with a king bed, pull-out sofabed, and TV. The bathroom has 1 sink, a deep tub for soaking, and walk-in shower. I did notice this time around, the room was more worn out and bare than before. We had to call for extra blankets (for the pull-out sofabed), a pan, and plates & utensils. There was no robe nor any slippers in the closet. The shower, though modern, looked worn. I recommend noting down what you need and then calling for it all at once. Otherwise, you'll be calling constantly and have to tip each time. The housekeeper that brought up th3 blankets offered to set up the sofabed for us, which was a nice gesture but we declined. They do set it up beforehand if they know you will be using it. Anything you'll need for the kitchen, bring your own, such as oil for cooking, soap for washing dishes, paper towels, etc. When we called for the stuff at 2am, they came promptly! Very much appreciated.

Views: The view in the Studio Fountain View Suite (40th floor) was incredible! Cosmopolitan Hotel has one of the best views of the Las Vegas strip and Bellagio Fountains in its balcony rooms, but Vdara is not far behind with wonderful views as well. No matter which side you get a room on at Vdara, there will be a nice view of either the mountains, City Center\/Aria, Las Vegas Blvd & Harmon Ave intersection, or the Bellagio fountains. Can't go wrong!

Fitness Center: spacious, but the clientele that Vdara attracts is very much fitness\/health conscious people. You'll rarely find it empty, though there is a good amount of machines and equipment. Like other Las Vegas hotels, the fitness center is not open 24 hours, but instead opens 6am-8pm.

Pool: I never made it there, but my friends did. They said it was crowded, but they managed to find 1 seat that they took turns laying on. The pool was crowded so they couldn't swim freely. With one or two people, it should be okay but with a bigger group, I would rent a cabana. This is more of a family-oriented hotel than a party hotel, so people are up early exercising and going to the pool.

Still love it!",5,0,3

The room, deluxe suite, is great for a couple. One king size bed, a kitchenette, dining table, computer desk, coffee table and a pull out sofa-bed! I love their restroom, shower, soaking tub, what more can you ask for?

I was just looking for a comfortable, affordable place close to the Cosmopolitan, where I was planning to spend most of my time before my flight the next day.

Vdara did a fine job of fulfilling the basic requirements I had, but I felt the experience was lacking in areas that were less of a necessity -- the areas that might have bumped this review to 4 or 5 stars. Check in was fast and the woman at the desk was polite. She told me she would upgrade me to some sort of deluxe suite, but I'm not sure what was deluxe about it except that it was more like an apartment than a hotel room (but it seems that all rooms are like this? I could be wrong).

The room had a dining area, kitchen, living area, work station, and a separate bedroom\/bathroom. There were two water bottles included in the resort fee found in the refrigerator. Robes and slippers were comfy.

I just read through some of the reviews here and looked through pictures. I'm seeing this large soaking tub that I was hoping for, but my bathroom just had a regular bathtub like the one I have at home. That was extremely disappointing. I also got regular Vdara toiletries instead of Aveda that I am reading about here. Are these only found in certain rooms? If so, Vdara should not advertise themselves as a fancy retreat sort of hotel if they won't provide this fancy treatment to all guests. That's not what I call service. Even if they're doing this because they want to save money, don't make it so obvious that you're cutting costs starting with me, the customer.

There were support bars almost everywhere in the bathroom and a seat in the shower, so if you are someone that requires some stability assistance or just likes to sit while in the shower, Vdara is very accommodating.

Complimentary wifi was great because I was tired of paying for it at the other place I stayed. It was a tiny bit spotty when I first logged on at midnight, but was working again with no problems in the morning in my room and the afternoon where I camped out at the lobby cafe with overpriced, okay food when I needed to telecommute.

Of course, everyone should know that this is a non-gaming hotel. I like to gamble, but I was totally fine with the short walk over to the Cosmopolitan where I found $5 minimum craps tables in the morning. How could I resist?

Vdara definitely suited my needs for the one night I needed a place to stay, but as potential for my future typical Vegas trip accommodations, it wouldn't make my top list. I wouldn't fully object to staying here again, but I certainly wouldn't be very excited.",1,0,0

That's about all I liked.  There are no amenities at this hotel.  No robes, blankets, extra pillows, sheets on the pull out, etc.  There was a sad tiny box in the bathroom sink that had three q-tips and cotton swabs.  That being said, because you had to call housekeeping for everything, you had to do a lot of tipping.  If you didn't want to tip for something that should already be in your room, then the staff would just stand awkwardly in your room until you did tip.  The bell service guy wanted a tip so badly that he told me three times that I wouldn't see him when I picked up my bags so am I sure I'm not forgetting anything.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I usually just tip the once when I retrieve my bags.  

The front desk was nice when I checked in, but MIA when I needed anything else.  Would never answer the phone.

My TV didn't work.

They have a tram that goes from the Monte Carlo to the Bellagio, which makes it kind of convenient to get to your hotel from the strip. However it does close and then it's a two mile hike back to your hotel from Las Vegas Blvd.

I would say save your money and stay at any other hotel that is the same price for the room.  You will end up spending more here with all the panhandlers (I mean staff) that you will have to tip.",2,0,0

Purely a resort, so no casino, no smoke, no wild drunk teenagers stumbling around the lobby, no crowded pool area with no places to sit and relax.  Very classy, very quiet, a breath of fresh air.

It's brand new, and you can tell,  The rooms are quite modern and clean.  Complimentary valet parking, which is a plus or minus depending on how busy they are.  Their gym is also quite nice, with complimentary drinks and coffee.  We were there on a Saturday morning, and hardly busy at all, plenty of open machines.  I didn't make it to the spa, but I'm sure it's fantastic.  The pool area was gorgeous, not too crowded.  Kinda surrounded by tall buildings, but all glass covered, so the sunlight bounced around and still got to us.

There is a quiet bar in the lobby of Vdara, but if you absolutely need the ""chaos"" of Vegas, the Aria, its casinos, bars, and restaurants are right next door (walking distance, even in platform heels!).  The Crystals shopping area is also nearby (but for the really high rollers, not really much to truly buy.  Fashionistas, I would suggest the Forums or Fashion Show Mall).  Through Crystals, and you are on the strip right across from Planet Hollywood.  There is also a shuttle to the Bellagio.

The hotel is behind Cosmopolitan and connected to the Bellagio by a tram. It takes roughly 3 minutes to walk from the lobby over to the Cosmo which wasn't bad at all. The lobby is clean, bright, and modern with a cute little cafe\/marketplace downstairs for your convenience.

The rooms are all equipped with a kitchenette. Pots and pans can be requested to use on the electric stove. A mini fridge is useful too to store water bottles and other groceries. There's a spacious area  for the pull-out sofa bed situated in front of the LCD television hanging on the wall. All the rooms are also king sized beds... I don't think there are any rooms with 2 double beds for 4+ guests. The curtains were automatic with a switch of a button! Loved the technoloy :)

We stayed on the 25th floor with a gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountains from our room!! 

The pool area is small but still relaxing.  

The best thing about this hotel is the fact that it's SMOKE-FREE. I'm sick and tired of leaving Vegas smelling of smoke! Even the clothes I don't wear and leave in the luggage for the weekend manages to smell of cigarettes. Also, without the casinos downstairs, I felt truly relaxed coming home at 4:00am from a long night of clubbing on the strip.

I'm definitely staying here again.

You walk through the (smokey) Cosmopolitan casino, then go to a dark elevator or stairway, ultimately walk some more, end up at the front desk.  Check in and check out were slow and inefficient.

Since the hotel is non-smoking and does not include a casino to it, it was a lot less crowded and a lot more fresh-smelling. Also, just like the Palazzo, you have to show a room key in order to go up to the rooms, which is both a good and bad thing. 

We stayed in the Deluxe Suite and I really loved how each suite is like a condo. Either 1 or 1&1\/2 bathrooms, depending on which suite you choose, kitchenette, a huge fridge, pull out bed, etc. My favorite part of the room was that the hotel includes a Keurig machine in each room. I guess it doesn't really matter in Vegas but I thought it was really nice to have. They had a dining table, huge master bathroom, and the bed in the master bedroom was beyond comfortable. Once our stay was almost over, I realized that there isn't really much need for a huge fridge, stove, microwave, and dining table since we barely spent any time in the room anyways. The hotel is really nice and maybe more suitable if you're staying longer than just the weekend or if you're here with your family. On the brightside, Vdara is located quite conveniently from the strip. Walking distance to Planet Hollywood and everything else. I thought the location was one of the best parts of staying there.

The only downside of my stay was when I  seperated from my group after a night out clubbing. I was the only one from my room to come back and the rest headed up to their own room. My boyfriend held my ID, money, and room key, but wasn't back yet so I went up to receptionist to try to get let in. Surprisingly, I wasn't the only one with that problem. The girl in front of me was giving the poor receptionist a lot of attitude but you can't blame the hotel for taking every precaution, especially when you have no identification on you and your name isn't on the reservation. Luckily, my name was on the reservation, I showed her my Facebook, and even at 4AM I had a lot of patience, which isn't hard to have since she was doing everything in her power to help me out. My friends ended up letting me back in and everything worked out in the end, but I still give the receptionist a lot of respect.

Thankfully before I arrived there I did a little bit of research of things you should know about before staying there:

- no self-parking directly at the hotel, Vdara is [free] valet only.  The closest self-parking was at the Aria
- You have to walk a bit through the Crystals mall to get to the main strip to cross the street to get to the Miracle Mile shops.

So knowing that, I brought a good amount of small bills with me to tip the valet.  I drove there from San Diego with my gf, and when we arrived, we were welcomed helped out with our bags immediately.  Our bags were even brought up to our room for us.

The room was amazing! I reserved the cheapest room available, and usually at other places it means no view.  But we ended up with a pretty good view of the Belagio fountain.

It was so nice to be close to the action without dealing with cigarette smoke and the chaos of a hotel casino. 

A great little market to grab snacks, drinks, and even medicine in the lobby makes for a very convenient stay. It's also nice to be able to wake up and go grab your Starbucks downstairs on your way out. I'd highly recommend getting the root beer float from the bar downstairs- delicious and boozy goodness. 

The staff was friendly and helpful. Everyone was always offering to go the extra mile and was happy to assist in any way they could. Free valet parking was a great perk for the stay.

I like the fact that their shades have a black-out setting and the blinds are automatic by the touch of a button, but when walking in it made the room feel really small.  

The bedroom was small too, with a small closet and one dresser.  The bed was comfortable and had book lights into the side tables so that was nice. 

I loved how their bath products are all Aveda!  The housekeeper even gave us a little extra to take home since we loved the shampoo so much and didn't have time to buy some.  Overall, the bathroom was small but clean.  Its a good place to stay if you're only staying a night (and your time isn't spent in the room).  

The pool disappointed me though! Their closing time is super early, at 6pm.  We were psyched because our friends came over to try the pool out, and we were only able to stay about 10 minutes because they close so early.

The room was exceptionally comfortable with a nice view of Vegas (we were on the 30th floor). It was exceptionally cheap at $179\/nt. for a five star hotel.  A couple of additional cool factors were the salon...got a great blow out (I think the lady's name was Rachel) and they have a Veuve bar should you get thirsty.   I also liked that you could get away from the casino hubbub.

After our friend's Johnnie Cash\/June Carter themed wedding and way too many Sapphire and Tonics, we stumbled into our room around 2AM.  I noted when I made the resie through Expedia that Vdara claimed to have 24 hour room service.  This is key to your sanity in Vegas.  We specifically avoided foraging for food outside the hotel because we figured we could eat in our room.  When we called down, they said that they don't do it any longer.  When I asked for a manager and told them about the claim when we made the resie, not only did he not apologize, but he basically brushed me off.  No offer of a free breakfast, nothing.

The next day, I realized that I had forgotten a brush, so I called down to the Concierge for a comb.  The lady said in a smug tone, we don't provide combs to guests.  WTF?  What kind of five star hotel doesn't have plastic combs for guests?

To say the least, I miss our little home away from home, and that means a lot and it's a great thing.Breakfast at the Market café was pretty good, pricey but good. Bartender at the Patio Lounge was dope. 

The spa was great, but that's gonna be another review. 

I did knock out one star because the hotel was very hard to navigate at first and it pissed me off at first. I wish we were told about the tram when we first checked in. It seems like it's tucked away so far from the strip that it was nearly impossible to find our way out or in back to the hotel.

It was also annoying that we had to request all the amenities like the coffee machine and robe, etc. They should come in the room, in my opinion.

We got room service and the only part I liked was the granola and greek yogurt. The egg frittata-like dish was bland, and the french toast was disgustingly buttery.

Like other reviewers, the first thing that I noticed walking into Vdara was the smell. Clean, crisp and very spa-like. The hotel is modern, sleek & very anti Vegas like in it's minimalist approach.  Trust me.  We go to Vegas to get as disgusting as everyone else. But it's absolutely wonderful to wake up at the crack of 2pm, slank down to the pool through dimly lit hallways & appreciate not hearing the clanking of machines, stale smoke clouds & angry broke gamblers.  

Everyone that we dealt with was very nice, helpful & friendly. The bells & valets were the best, housekeeping beyond great. Vdara stocks Aveda bath products, the first day I requested extra salts & for the rest of our stay, we had Aveda stocked shelves. Little things really do make such a difference.  

Our suite had a great view, the bed really was as heavenly as others have described.  Comfortable room, princess tub (glorious!!), dining area with fridge, microwave\/convection oven & anything your missing a phone call away. Loved everything about this hotel. It was nice having the walkway to the Bellagio, the tram that shoots you around the area and of course, it's a few steps to Aria & city center.  The best of Vegas, all close by--and yet a world away.",0,0,0

It had a good modern vibe and a good location right at city strip.  The rooms were comfortable and well appointed.  I loved the clean modern style of it all.  As I saw someone else mention,  the switches for the lights and window shades take a minute to figure out.

The hotel has a pool, spa, a bar, a cafe and a starbucks,  but doesn't have all the usual parts of a hotel on the strip.....casino, buffet, shows, shops etc.  It is right by Aria and Bellagio though so all of that is close by and it was kind of refreshing to not have to walk through a smoky casino every time to get to my room",0,0,0

Another huge plus is that there is no casino at this hotel despite being right off the main area of the strip and theres NO SMOKING! So it smells ultra delicious here.

The pool is somewhat mediocre for being such a nice hotel, but at least its famous for its newsworthy death-rays that help with a 'killer' tan.

Slight down fall, there's no self parking. Only Valet which costs 25.00 I think. Don't get me wrong that's really convenient and nice to have but a little pricey for parking there for a one night stay.

City Center is confusing as it gets.   I was in a constant state of being directionally challenged. 

Vdara is a beautiful hotel.  The lobby has a great bar with outdoor seating.  It's actually nice to not have to walk 100 miles through a casino to get to your room.  The rooms are chic and modern.  They offer a small kitchen, a small seating area, and a great bathroom.  However, the bathroom door is see through.  Maybe this is fine if you are traveling with your significant other but if you're traveling with friends or co-workers things might get a bit awkward!

I got the 38th floor; a ""Vdara Suite."" 

Pros:
- A lovely decor; very modern and pleasing, yet homely.
- STELLAR view of the Strip.
- No casino = family-friendly.
- A convenient walkway to Bellagio (for the fountain show) and beyond.
- The room is very new and hence clean.
- A convenient tram operates in the CityCenter.
- I like the rather simplistic interior of the lobby. It's by no means mundane or mediocre; it's a relaxing, royal yet ""simplistic"" feel.
- The tub included a shower-head.
- Good, firm bed (not the cheap kind).
- Large two flat-screen TV's.
- Kitchen appliances include cups for drinking water.
- Fantastic deal; $116 for such a room is a hard-to-find deal. 
- Five-star hotel atmosphere.

Cons:
- The kitchen area in the rooms will be useless for most travelers, but inevitable because this is a part-condo residency. Makes the room look a bit smaller than advertised.
- The parking is VERY confusing (we had to go around three times). TIP: Vdara has complimentary valet parking; just go to the entrance and the guys there will offer you one.
- One of the door to the bathroom was broken.
- Two lights (one for the toilet, one above the tub) were not working.
- The queen-size pull-out bed is next to useless; hundreds of the bed spring will poke your back.
- Since it's located close to the I-15, you may hear the cars (but it won't disturb your sleep).
- No TV in the restroom.

All in all, I enjoyed my stay at Vdara. It made me nostalgic for the metropolitan life. If you don't mind the absence of a casino, you will, like me, love the hotel.",2,0,1

Depending on your purpose in Vegas, Vdara could be the perfect hotel to get away from the bustling strip and drunk patrons. However, if you're here to partayyy the lack of a casino, restaurants, and shops might be a drawback. Their one and only market\/restaurant closes at 8PM and there was no Starbucks or convenience store in sight. 

Although the location is fairly convenient, it's a bit of a trek from the strip if walking (it's located behind Aria and Cosmo). Without the basic Las Vegas hotel amenities taking cabs and walking in 110 degree weather will be a must.

I honestly knew next to nothing about the hotel and after staying in a fabulous room at the Wynn on my last trip, had low expectations.  Boy, was I surprised.  

When I walked in, I noticed there was no casino.  THANK GOD.   Vegas scares me a little and the lack of a smokey casino filled with fanny packs and Bud Lights, made me feel better about my stay.  My friend was already there and wanted to check in earlier so he agreed to an upgrade.  We had a corner room, complete with a kitchen, sitting area, HUGE bathroom, 2 TV's and an amazing view.  I could LIVE in this room.  Very clean and simple, the only thing that was missing was an iPod hook up (I like to play my music when I get ready!).

So it was CROWDED.  But we both agree that it deserves 4 stars, hubby says maybe 4.5.  
So it is valet only, as everyone else has said, but that's fine with me.  They have an amazing system in place and we waited maybe 10 minutes for our car even when 4000 people were all trying to leave at the same time.  They run their butts off!
The hotel employees were very friendly and helpful and we were given a free upgrade to a 50th floor, Bellagio-fountain-view large suite for free upon request, after I mentioned it was our anniversary.  
The room was a very modern, very clean, very nice suite (including nearly a full kitchen).  We loved it.  King size bed was perfection.  Free wifi which worked ok. 2 flat screen tv's and electronic window shades, which were sweet!   Again, as everyone mentioned, it's a non-smoking hotel, and no casino as well.  There is a cafe on the lobby floor that has plenty of choices for snacks and drinks and they do have room service 24\/7.  
We didn't bother with the pool or spa because we knew it would be stupid crowded so I can't talk about those.
But it was a really wonderful place and a great night.  I had one big complaint - the shower.  The hotel's main design goal was to be environmentally friendly\/sound - so the shower heads are low-flow.  And they are VERY low-flow!  Nothing irritates me more than when I'm trying to wash my hair with low-flow water pressure because it takes FOREVER.  So it was really frustrating and I was bummed.  I expected a 5 Star shower in the Vdara.  And it should be possible to get good water pressure even with low flow!  Super disappointing.
Also, the AC was a bit weak.  It worked and the room was cool but during the afternoon, when I tried to lower it to 67 (I like it cold), it never happened.  Never got below 70 until the sun set.  Probably another result of their focus on the environment.  
Forgot to mention at the top that we checked in early, around 1 p.m. with zero problems.  As did lots of other people because we had to wait in line about 5 minutes.  We didn't even call ahead and request early check in, we just showed up and it was fine (and we got that free, easy upgrade)!
Overall, nice experience and nice hotel.  Definitely recommend it, especially to younger travelers (because you'll be surrounded by other 20-somethings the whole time, they were everywhere)!

PS  Got room service raspberry cheesecake and it was divine.  Wonderful!
PPS  Just remembered my other complaint - there was NO coffee maker in the room!!!  Something to remember if you're not a morning person (like me) or if you might be hung over while staying there or you just happen to love coffee in the morning (like the hubs)!

Just remembered one more thing I very specifically wanted to add after reading the other reviews - the bathrooms absolutely DO have a door!  It just happens to be a pocket door that slides out of the wall so I guess that reviewer missed it.  But they are there and they're lovely!",0,0,0

There's a couch with a pull out bed and two flat screens (one in front of the couch and the other in front of the bed.

Some other nice perks were an empty mini fridge, electronically controlled shades, and a real blow dryer. 

The not so good things: 
There were no Aveda products like other reviewers had mentioned. We got the deluxe suite so maybe they only have them when you upgrade? 

Not really convenient when walking to the strip.   Even though only a mile walk, it's not centrally located. It's sort of tucked away between Aria and the Cosmopolitan. 

The $20 per day resort fee and $2.40 tax or additional charge to the resort fee is ridiculous! What does it pay for? The two mini water bottles we get per day? Oh, and the death ray from the pool?

If you want more of a casino you can walk over to the Bellagio via bridge or walk over to the Aria from outside.  Both are very close by.  You can have the loud casino experience while walk back to a quite lobby to have a final drink before going to bed. 

Room:

The view was amazing!! We had a large bathroom with a stand up shower and separate tub.  It was a good size.  The suite had 2 TV's but we only used 1 that was located in the living room area. 

We had a small kitchen with a stove, microwave, sink and frig.  We had a table with 2 seats in the kitchen which was a great addition to the room.

I'm not a huge fan of the noise in hotels with casinos and I especially hate the smoke, it gets in my hair and my clothes. You can't walk out of a hotel without smelling like you've been in a bar all day. But mostly because I'm asthmatic, it's easier to breath without all the smoke at Vdara. The lobbies were clean and the elevators were amazingly spotless as well. The concierge and front desk were efficient and accommodating.

Our suite had a pretty amazing view that was 270 some degrees, the bathroom was gorgeous, the room was super spacious and comfortable. It even had a separator door if you wanted to close off the bed to the living room. We also had a large fridge and kitchen, not to mention a washer and dryer (all which we put to good use). We were living the high life. :) For room service they have these cool doorbell ringers that you can turn off to let the maids know not to disturb you. I believe white light means ""empty room"", green means ""come clean"", and blue was ""do not disturb"".

Vdara only does complimentary valet, but you can park in Aria or Cosmos self park and walk, it's not that far and you have access to your car at all times. The close proximity was great as we were clubbing at Marquee the next day. We were able to walk. :D

Our visit really did start on a great note because of Angela. We then went to go place our things in our room and we were so delighted to see the view as well as the comfort of our room. Angela made sure we had an excellent room!!! We then left the hotel in search of grub and when we returned we found a surprise in our room: a plate or chocolate covered strawberries and a welcome note from Angela!! So awesome. She literally made us both agree that when we return to Vegas again, Vdara is where we are staying. 

Vdara has no casino inside which is amazing when you want a respite away from the slot machines and smoke. It's also non smoking. We loved it. It was a very calm and relaxed crowd in the lobby of Vdara. 

Our room was exquisite. I couldn't have picked a better view myself. We had a walk in closet as well. We were beyond comfortable. 

The Vdara has connections to the Aria and Bellagio so that you may get onto the strip or use their casino. Vdaras pool is out but we were told we have access to Arias pool. 

The whole place was very clean. Staff were all friendly. There is a Starbucks in the lobby. There is a spa in the building as well. They also have a designated area for uber and lyft to pick you up which is more than most hotels allow in Vegas (because of the feud between the cabbies and uber).

She apologized and wished us a happy anniversary and did her due dilligence to get a a corner suite.  After calling the housekeeping team and speaking to her manager,  she was able to get us in a corner suite on the 30th floor and even comped our resort fee.  

Everyone that I saw in person eye to eye is awesome,  attentive,  intentional and available to help us.

Since it does not have a casino downstairs or restaurants, it is strictly for those that want a comfortable and even luxurious stay without the smoke from the lobby.  The rooms are clean, still newer and has stylish features.  We had a mini suite with a middle standalone wall that separated the spaces (can't really say rooms). It is a terrific and efficient use of space. We also had a kitchenette. We called room service for some more towels and water, and they came up quickly. I was surprised at such quick service when the hotel houses thousands.

You can take an easy 5 minute walk to the sister hotel Aria for all the other stuff. I love that the circular driveway between Vdara and Aria dropoff areas reminds of a really modern airport.  The whole wing of the Strip along with Cosmopolitan and Crystals Shopping Center has all your Vegas needs. If that's not enough take a 10 minute walk to the corner of Las Vegas Blvd. and Harmon and have at it with Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile Shops.  

One tip -- Vdara doesn't have its own self parking (just valet). Do park at Cosmopolitan and take the stairs or elevators up off of Harmon. This past weekend the gates were all up at the Cosmo lot so parking was free all weekend. The rates are not that bad to begin with.",3,2,1

Our stay at Vdara was pleasant. That's what I can say. Rooms are modern, chic, and clean. We had the Vdara suite, but got upgraded to the Executive Corner suite. I mean, supposedly it's bigger. My only complaint was I was expecting it to be MUCH bigger. We had a party of 5 in the room, which is probably as far as you want to go for these suites. 42'' flat screens in the rooms... too small... I can't... I just can't... LOL. 

I chose Vdara for the non-gaming, non-smoking, eco-friendly factor. It really is pleasant to come back to your hotel after all the craziness at the other hotels and what all that is on the Strip. The overall check in\/registration area is VERY small, compared to say, MGM Grand, Bellagio, etc. I wish there were more to do downstairs. Yes, its no-gaming, but more shops and dining places would really make Vdara more appealing. Pros is that it's next to Aria and Cosmo, which are absolutely gorgeous!

The property is also non-smoking and non-gaming, which makes for a civilized experience at check-in and a quiet atmosphere inside the hotel, as guests cavort elsewhere. Combined with the great location, I'd choose this place in a heartbeat even when compared to far cheaper mega-hotels further south like the MGM.",2,0,2

First off... if you're a smoker or a gambler, this may not be your thing, but for someone like me who doesn't smoke and really couldn't care less about being in a casino... this was AWESOME.  

We arrived in Vegas at about 10am on a Wednesday and right from the time we arrived in the hotel lobby, things went really, really well.  The person who was helping us with checking in was very friendly, chatty and very personable.  And, she  arranged to get us upgraded to a room that was one level above what we had booked, but because it was so early in the morning our room wasn't ready yet.  No worries - off to the pool!  

When the room was eventually ready, we were duly impressed.  On the 51st floor and overlooking the Bellagio fountain with a super comfy bed and TVs on both the bed side as well as the living room side of the room... it was perfect.  There were only 2 very minor complaints about the room: one - that the water pressure coming out of the shower was pretty lame (though this was made up for by the fact that the water was HOT within seconds of turning it on); and two - that there weren't robes already provided in the room.  Minor, I know - but I'm a girl who likes to relax in a robe and slippers, and quite frankly, every other hotel I've stayed at on the strip in Vegas has just provided them in the room already.  Not a big deal as you can call down to housekeeping and have some brought up for you, but when you're fresh out of the shower and just want a soft, comfy robe to put on you want it already there in the room.  First world problems.  

Other REALLY good things about this place were the concierge service people.  They seriously rocked.  Not only did they get our Cirque Du Soleil tickets printed for us and have them ready, but also made a reservation for us at a steak restaurant in a competing hotel that had NO reservations available when we tried to book earlier in the night.  Wifi was free in the rooms, and I was able to pick up signal in both the pool and lobby areas by just logging on with our last name and room number.  I also loved the pool area - there were tons of lounge chairs, umbrellas to put up when it got stupid hot in the sun, and the waitresses were always happy to bring drinks.   The mojitos were fabulous!!  

In short - I was sad to leave.  I would have stayed for another few days if only I had that much vacation time to take, but alas, as of Saturday night it was back to reality.  

Thanks to the staff at Vdara - we'll definitely be back!",1,0,0

My first time here I was in a City Corner Suite and absolutely loved it. Loved the full kitchen and refrigerator with an ice machine and water spout (super convenient). It was extremely helpful to have the full bath and half bath in the room when you're sharing with three other people. The living room is a bit on the smaller side, especially since 2 people had to share the pull-out couch (took up most of the space when it was pulled out). Bedroom itself was very spacious and loved the views. 

Other times I've stayed in a regular studio suite with a kitchenette. Small bar fridge to hold leftovers. One side of the fridge has a minibar with sensors that will charge you automatically if you take one. There was a sign in the room that said you have about 60 seconds to look at the product before it charges you. We never picked one up or took one out, but somehow we got charged for an item at checkout. We were able to get it taken off of our bill though. Big studio area to comfortably fit everyone even with the pull-out couch. Still comfortable and luxurious feeling. 

Prices are pretty decent if you plan in advance and don't book on a crazy weekend. I personally liked that it didn't have a casino, but it's connected to Bellagio through the back and Aria is across the street to the front for my friends who like the casino life. It's also nice to have a more lowkey Vegas hotel when I'm with a smaller group of people. Starbucks is now available in the lobby area and their Market Cafe isn't too bad when you're lazy and wanna grab a quick bite that isn't room service. I have yet to try the bar they have. 

All of the staff are extremely helpful and friendly, from the front desk to the house keeping to the valets. Exceptional people in the hospitality industry and it definitely makes your stay a little better without having bitter, rude employees during your stay. Kudos!

In-room tablets for easy room service ordering and online checkout. 

It is quite the walk to get from Vdara to the main strip in front of Bellagio, which some nights seemed like it took us forever to get out there. But overall, it's not too bad. I guess it just depends how tired your feet are lol. 

Easy to find taxi and rideshare stations. Downside is that Cosmo is right under Vdara so you can be sitting at a light for while trying to get back because of the back up from Cosmo. 

NOTES
- Valet Parking only
- they do offer luggage storage
- dog friendly
- no dishes in the room, but available upon request 
- you can still visit the pool after you checkout until 7PM
- Bellagio & Aria are the closest casinos",1,0,2

This was our first time at the Vdara and we enjoyed it. We have stayed in the City Center twice before (Mandarin Oriental and Aria) so we knew the turf.

The main difference in this hotel compared with the other 4\/5 star hotels on the strip is lack of casino and no real restaurant on property. No biggie-the Aria, Bellagio and Cosmopolitan are within walking distance have have top notch restaurants and of course casino's. Vdara is also completely non-smoking (huge plus).

Staff was nice, friendly and helpful and the room (standard 34th floor facing the mountains) was very nice and new. All rooms seem to have some sort of kitchen\/kitchenette, although the only city I generally won't need a kitchen is Las Vegas!   An upgrade (besides a larger room) would be a room facing the Bellagio to see the famous fountains. 

Bottom line: If you can get a good rate and are traveling with children or just want a quiet oasis to get back to at night-this is your place (and Mandarin Oriental as well). If you love having the casino action and general Vegas craziness IN your hotel-stay at any of the other 4\/5 star hotels on the strip.",3,0,1

First off, not sure if this is something new now, but we got the Vegas early (around 9:30am) and decided to go and ahead see if the room's ready- we were told that early check-in costs extra 30 dollars!? It's getting ridiculous how the hotels are now treating customers like they're cash cows as opposed to actual human beings - from ridiculous resort fees to now early check-in fees? What's the $30 for, because it is harder for your staff to type on a computer screen if it's before 10am? So we wait around for 15 minutes, then we go attempt to check in again. Of course now there's a huge line at the counter, and get this - before 10am, there were 3 front desk staff helping people, which is already paltry. Come after 10am, now there are only 2!!! What kind of mainstream Vegas hotel has only 2 people working the desk on a Friday morning, with about 20 people waiting in line? We had to wait for over 30 minutes to get checked in.

Get to the room; automatic blinds were broken, and the sheets and the blanket had some stains; I called housekeeping to get new sheets and a blanket - 30 minutes later, nobody showed up. I called AGAIN, politely telling the staff that this is my second call and it's been 30 minutes - the staff assures me somebody will be up right away. I wait for another 20 minutes, before somebody finally knocked on my door. It took nearly an hour to get something as simple as clean sheets and a blanket. I decided to not even bother with getting the blinds repaired - I just manually pulled them down.

The ""included"" water that's given for the daily resort fee (which is now $25\/day) is so small, it wouldn't be enough for a 5 year old kid. Overall, supremely disappointed for a so-called 5-star hotel that costs over $200 a night. I've received better service at pretty much every other Vegas hotel I've stayed at.

About the only upside to the hotel is that it's dead quiet most of the time; of course, this also means in order for you to actually get onto the Strip, you have to walk forever; and nothing was labelled to tell you how you should actually get to the Strip; the hotel encourages you to walk through Bellagio's maze of corridors. They couldn't even build a covered walkway over to Aria; we happened to visit when it was raining in Vegas - it sucked getting wet when all you want to do is head over to Aria for dining options, as that's basically non-existent at Vdara.

If this was any other city with limited choices, I'd just accept it as bad corporate management and rate it as mediocre; but, in a city like Vegas, when there are literally hundreds of hotels offering similar services at comparable price points, I have way too many choices to bother coming back here again.",1,1,0

NO self-parking. Valet only. Two nearest possible locations for self parking would be to park at the Aria, going towards the west valet and cutting across outside, over the bridge over Harmon and back in OR you can park at the bellagio, and walk passed the flower garden towards the jean phillipe patisserie, and along the path towards the tram but following signs towards Vdara instead of going on the tram. Both estimates around ~10 minutes walking time. 

Now for the rooms :P 

Executive Corner Suite - Have been in this room twice. Corner room. Room designed in a long upside down L shape. Upon entry, a dining table for 4 on the right. On the left, you have a 1\/2 bath as well as a mini kitchen with full size fridge, stove, and microwave. In a ""closet"" you have a washer\/dryer as well. The living room has a sofa as well as a chair with coffee table for the TV area as well as a desk facing outwards by the window. Turning the corner, you'll have a door-separated room for the bedroom. Bed is super comfy with reading lights on each side. Bathroom has a walk-in shower, twin sinks, as well as a separate stand-alone bath tub window-side. Great for relaxing in the tub and enjoying the view ! Great room for parties. Lots of room for a good amount of people, while being able to have the bedroom off-limits to guests :D

Vdara Suite - Much smaller room in comparison to the executive corner suite but a lot nicer compared to a normal hotel room. Upon entry, there is a small 2-person dining table as well as a mini kitchenette with a microwave and stove. There are two mini fridges. One is stocked by the hotel (charges apply upon use) and an empty one. But these mini fridges are super small. Good for a few drinks, thats about it. Before getting to the bedroom area, you'll see the bathroom. Bathroom has a single sink with a standard size bathtub and a walk in shower. Bedroom has divider that separates the sitting area with a TV with a sofa and chair, and the bed with a TV as well. Like the executive corner suite, it has two reading lights as well as two separate lights on the side. For some reason, the bedroom portion is brighter than the sitting area. Sitting area only has 1 light. 

Valet is good. Fast service and quick response. 

Overall, great hotel to stay in or to use for parties. After a specific time, they'll start restricting entry to elevators to those with only key cards. Two separate elevator lobbies for a lower portion and higher portion of the hotel.",3,0,2

         Review on fountain view suite
1. This hotel is not a casino so it has no entertainment. 
2. This hotel does not have a self parking only valet parking at a charge. So you either have to park at bellagio or aria and walk over.  Which if you forget something in your car turns into a mission. 
3. There is nothing to do but sit while waiting for your room to become available.  (Ours wasn't ready till almost 5 pm.)
4. The pool is small and doesn't seem very kid friendly.  Everyone is quiet and to themselves. I think for a resort their pool could be much bigger.. it's about the same size as an apartment pool.. which is meant to serve all 50+ floors. Not very impressed. 

The good things

1. Our fountain view suite had a bedroom and livingroom.  Door to room can be closed for privacy from guests. 
2. Had a table for 4 people,  full fridge,  microwave, washer and dryer,  sink,  cook top.  But u had to order pots pans or plates from house keeping.
3.Has one full bath that includes 2 sinks,  stand shower,  separate tub, toilet small bathroom closet and a main frosted glass door for privacy. Has a 2nd bathroom by suite entrance fur guests.  Only toilet and sink. 
4. Livingroom and bedroom had flat screen tvs... livingroom couch turns into a bed. windows have black out shades and are controlled from panels on the wall. 

 Over all Very nice hotel over all but parking cam become a problem And hassle.


One thing I highly would suggest is to offer music option with fountain view rooms. Like maybe a channel or something we can tune into to listen to the music from the shows. It's great to see the dancing fountain but it's REALLY missing the sound.",1,0,0

-Front desk - there was always a line.  They have no stancions, so you just make up your own line and stand there.  Then one of the front desk agents comes out from her cave when the line gets pretty deep and guides you to stand in a certain line waiting for an open agent.  
The problem with this is, someone who was in the back of me, 4 deep was helped before me, because I was standing in a line that 
did not move.  Urgh.....  I was getting pissed at this point.  

-The room is spacious, but does not compare to the feel of the Palazzo or Venetian.  Different class\/decor.  

-Limited counterspace in bathroom.  Hardly enough room for 2 persons to place all of their toiletries down.  I know I have a lot of stuff, but very small countertop area.  

-Dead Bar\/Lobby
You would think if you had no casino, you would have an attractive lobby bar to give your guests a reason to drink at your bar.... ah, no.  
No entertainment during the 5 days we were there.  Sad, dead and no reason to drink at the bar.

-Smelly Lobby - I did not like the scent.  Much too perfumy....  a clean scent would have been nicer.  

So the question is, would I stay here again?  Probably not.  We spent all of our time at the Aria and ate all of our meals there, except for one evening, when we had dinner at Joel Robochon at the MGM.  For $159.00 including the $15 resort fee, you can probably find another hotel that will give you more love.",2,0,1

The bathroom has great lighting with many mirrors (a major plus for girls getting ready for a night out!). There's never a wait for a taxi right outside the lobby, and it's about a 10 minute walk to the Bellagio.

My only problem was the service at the front counter. I came to pick up my key card that was left for me, but the lady was quite rude and frankly embarrassed me when she had mistakenly not seen my key card\/name in the files.

We had originally booked a City Corner Suite, but were upgraded to a 55th floor 1 Bedroom Penthouse. Wow! The view was spectacular and my wife and I were suitably impressed. The suite had a kitchen, 1.5 bathrooms, a living room, dining area, and a bedroom.  We were treated like VIPs throughout our stay and the housekeeping was immaculate.
Staying at Vdara gave us a break from the zaniness of The Strip casinos. It's quiet, and there weren't any drunks yelling in the hallways. If you want that atmosphere it's easily accessible with a short walk. However, we like to escape it when we want some rest and the Vdara provided that special place.

Since we were arriving late at night, we decided to check our luggage for free, spend the night on the town, and do early check in (saving Friday night, summer room rates!). But by, 5:30am we were wiped out and ready to crash. The Vdara desk said they had a room ready shortly after 6am and before 7am we were comfortable in our room with our luggage brought up to us. (Our second room, without early check in, was ready by 2pm.) when we got up from our ""nap"" and left the room, we pressed the housekeeping button at the door and the room was completely refreshed before we got back that evening. 

The room itself was beautiful - loads of space, clean, comfortable, great view (mountain side looking over the Bellagio water show) through the wall of windows, shower plus deep bathtub, plenty of bathroom counter space, and a kitchen, but we didn't really use that other than the fridge. There are 2 refridgerators: the one is for you to use for storage and has complimentary water bottles! the other is the mini-bar with sensors - if you touch the mini-bar items, the sensor will automatically charge the item to your room.

If you're looking for the hairdryer, it's in the hidden drawer at the bathroom sink. If you need a coffee or tea pot in the room, for $20\/day you can get a Keurig with 4 pods.

There's a pool and large hot tub outside on the 3rd floor, if that's your thing. Both the pool and hot tub were very nice and well maintained. The staff was wonderful (showed us to empty seats, set up our towels, offered us water, offered to send a server our way, etc.). I'm not really a pool person when there's so much else to do in Vegas, so we were only there a bit. I did look at the menu, which looked quite reasonable, but we didn't stay long enough to eat\/drink.

The hotel is in the same driveway to the Aria, so it's a quick walk on the sidewalk to the Aria casinos, restaurants, buffet, pools, etc. which are all accessible to Vdara guests. We loved the Aria buffet, and highly recommend that, but otherwise we didn't spend much time there. Through the Vdara lobby, there's a hallway leading to a short outside covered bridge walkway that goes directly into the Bellagio hotel. Follow the signs and it leads you to the Bellagio casino, and a short walk later either to the Bally's casino, or outside to see the Bellagio water show, etc.

The Vdara accommodations were just what I was looking for, beautiful comfortable stay, great location on the strip, none of the hassles of being in a casino hotel (smoke, etc.), but still all of the conveniences!

PS. We walked past the checkin at the Bellagio and the lobby was packed with sad tired looking people from 3 pm until well after 6:30 pm! The Vdara check in (and check out) was quick and easy and no more than a few people in line for only a short moment!",0,0,0

Our room had a view of the strip, overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  Occasionally we could see the fountain show going off, and we loved turning off the room lights to watch the glitter of the Strip at night.

We loved that the Vdara is smoke-free and casino-free.  It was nice to go back a peaceful, pleasantly smelling hotel after a whole day and evening of walking around the windy, smoke-filled sensory explosion of other casino floors and lobbies.  The Vdara is a place to unwind and relax; if you want an upscale casino experience, the Aria is only a stone's throw away.

I would gladly stay at the Vdara again the next time I'm in Vegas.  In fact, it would be my preferred hotel.  It has a great, central location to the rest of the action, and it truly feels like a (luxurious) home away from home.",0,0,0

The quality of the room and it's amenities was absolutely fabulous and the receptionist was always more than helpful! Everyone looked professional. It was not trashy or crowded by drunks at all! The market cafe breakfast was perfect, convenient, and well priced! The fact that the hotel requires a room key to get to the elevators was very comforting since we all know some people in Vegas can get weird. I went with 4 other girls, all of which felt the same way about the service and appearance of the hotel. The view was fabulous to top it off too ( we were on a corner unit).

the vdara suite offers a generous amount of leg room and is the perfect room for a couple.
the bedroom is huge with a comfy bed and delicious linens, the bathroom is spacious and spa like with slippers and robes, the living room, dining room and kitchen are overkill but still nice to have.

yes, it's pricey because it's room service.

if you enjoy coffee, you will be disappointed with theirs.
it's not freshly brewed.

The Vdara is a welcome edition to Vegas if your not a big fan of having to wander around a smoky, loud, and bright casino floor in order to get to your room.  The good thing is Aria and Bellagio are across the way if you need your dining, gambling, drinking, lounging fix.  

Vdara rooms  are more a studio  than a hotel room - however, i doubt the kitchen area is ever used in any substantive way - maybe for longer stays.

Cool technology includes automatic shade\/blinds, and buttons to push for 'room service' and 'do not disturb'.  some the the lights i think are automatically set to the time of day.

I did have a little issue with housekeeping - where they didn't do my room, but a quick visit to the main desk got it cleaned pretty past.  Also some of the lights were burned out.  I find that kinda strange.  

Note: They are charging a resort fee of $25 that includes 2 small bottles of water, newspaper at check in desk, internet access, unlimited local calls, and tuck-in service.  I didn't use any of this stuff except for the water.

It is on the other side of the Bellagio (further away from the strip, about a 10 minute walk - blocks in Vegas are huge!) and it was really nice to not have to walk through a smoky casino every time we left our hotel. There is a Walgreens kitty corner from Bellagio that had a good assortment of fresh and frozen food, and alcohol. The concierges were great - they helped us book discounted Cirque du Soleil tickets, make restaurant reservations, and had lots of advice for restaurants and bars (including guest list and passes for day pool parties). 

I liked the pool area, lots of umbrellas for shade, but also the ability to close them if you wanted to tan. There were a lot of children there though so I imagine that was a function of Vdara being a casino-less hotel. 

Vdara doesn't have a complimentary airport shuttle service, but they can arrange for a shuttle, and other airport shuttles do stop there. They do have complimentary luggage storage though.

Vdara is in the Citycenter, and it's a little bit away from the Strip --- to get to the Strip, your best best is to go through Aria or the Bellagio.  The Cosmopolitan is very close by, but there's no direct walkway\/path --- I had to go take the stairs outside, then walk into the parking driveway of Cosmo.

Got in around 10am and dropped off my bag at the bellhop, since the room wasn't available until around 2.  Very convenient feature of having my bag delivered to my room after checking in.

Room is nice and spacious.  Had a higher-level floor with a slight view of the Bellagio fountains and overlooking the pool area.  Free wifi as well (hear that, Total Rewards hotels?)  BIG negative was that the room wasn't 100% clean --- keycards and an empty bottle of water from the previous occupants were still on the kitchen table, and there was an unwrapped (presumably used) bar of soap in the bathroom.  And there were only regular bath towels (no hand or wash towels) in the room.

The staff is very friendly and even the security guards at the elevator banks were nice enough.

Some more negatives: the Market Cafe and the Starbucks were always understaffed --- almost always had long lines, particularly the Starbucks that only had one barista both mornings.  Ordered the chicken and waffles from the cafe and it was very salty.  Service was fast.  Didn't check out the bar but it was nice.  Also, the outside seating area looked very unappealing --- I wouldn't want to hang out there, even though the pictures on the website look nice.  No one was on the cushioned swings the entire time I was there.

I was looking for a pet friendly hotel for a mini vacation with my puppy brother. I decided to go on the off days and check in on a Sunday afternoon and check out on a Tuesday (to avoid the drunken crowds on the weekends). There is a dog park and a memorial park found after you cross the valet lines. They provide free valet parking service which is kinda nice and definitely makes you feel special. Walking into Vdara you can clearly notice that there is no casino or smoke from people's cigarettes. I honestly loved that! I loved not walking in and smelling a whole lot of crap. There is also one bar and a starbucks. The location of Vdara itself isn't too shabby. You are able to go to Cosmo with just a few steps, it's in the City Center so it's definitely very close to every thing. I did see the cleaning cart in our hallway all 3 days that we were there. Not sure if maybe it was forgotten or what but it was just so weird and random to see it there. Also, on one of the nights we were there, I ordered room service for myself while I was taking a hot bath and the person that delivered literally just walked into my room, while dog was loose (being that I was in the room with him). It was a weird experience. So glad that my husband was there to go take care of it and ensure that Porky didn't get out. I would have preferred for room service to knock first and if no answer, come back after a few minutes or something, don't just walk in, especially when you have a dog staying in the room. As far as cost goes for what you get, not too bad. Totally worth it.


The Room:
Huge! Modern and very spacious suite. I loved the huge window we had in our room (our view wasn't the greatest.. we saw the highway but no biggie). It was a bit of a pain to get out of bed to close the blinds (yea, I'm lazy.. don't judge me.. it is called vacation!). The room had enough space for Porky to even run around. It had a comfy couch by the window. There is a kitchen area with a stove and a sink that is found in the entrance of the suite. You can call the front desk for kitchen ware for what I understand. There is also a small fridge and two free water bottles are provided for you every day. There is a big bathroom with a soak tub and a standing shower. One sink with a decent amount of space for all my crap. WiFi was ok. Tv is alright too. The tv is in a weird location of the room being that if I lay down in bed, it is not in front center of me. 

Dog friendliness:
I honestly loved that it was dog friendly. Dogs up to 70 pounds or two dogs with the combined weight of 70 pounds are welcome to stay at Vdara. There is an additional fee of $50 per night plus an additional $75 one time only cleaning fee that is not refundable. When you check in, the make you sign a waiver and let you know the rules. They provide your dog a small goody bag with a blanket, a dog treat and a dog menu. Being that it's a dog friendly casino, there will be times that dogs will bark during your stay. I was ok with it but I know my pup had a few moments of ""wtf? what was that?"" Nothing drastic though. I had the chance to order room service for Porkchop since provide a dog menu. Sure why not, right? He gobbled that up in no time too. Must have been good. There is a dog park with dog poop bags, a bench and a water fountain. Unfortunately you gotta cross the valet line to get to it. That would be one reason to deduct a star. No dog bowls available unless you call the front desk. 

Dog room service menu:
Fetch of the day- Seared filet with sweet potatoes. green beans and yellow squash (S: $10 M: $12)

Chicken a la coop- Hormone free baked chicken with whole grain brown rice
(S: $7 M: $14)

Rollover- Chicken and beef sauteed with fresh vegetables and orzo pasta
(S: $8 M: $15)

Casino and Parking Lot: NO casino. Valet parking only and it's super tricky to find.

The suite was awesome, very comfy, very quiet and very plush in all the right ways.  If I had any complaint, it was that the exhaust system in the upstairs bathroom didn't work AND there isn't an air conditioning vent in there, so the upstairs bathroom was so hot it was almost impossible to be in there. We had to keep the door open at all times, and the blackout shades drawn. But the housekeeping would raise the blinds when they came, so it just got hot in there all over again. Relatively minor thing, but worth mentioning so that maybe they can do something to fix it.  The entire hotel is nicely appointed, the staff is very helpful and extremely polite and friendly. Valet service is very good.  We will be back again soon, for sure.",0,0,0

pros - value for money in terms of square footage, no casino to walk through and get lost, non smoking, easy walk to aria\/bellagio but have to go outside though covered to get to bellagio. good sheets\/bed, modern decor. Aveda amentities.

cons:
1 hr to check in!!!  slowest check in, in the world?!?
cockroach! as we were leaving and I was writing this, cockroach!! gross!

not sure what my $20 resort fee went towards, if there were supposedly 2 bottles water\/day, I didn't see it
perhaps for the free wifi

in our panoramic suite - 2 phones in the small bedroom, but none in the kitchen nor living room.

I liked the sofa bed in the living room - good for one of our kids to sleep in

Blackout shades were NOT blackout - in that there were gaps every 3 feet and in the corner of the room! which of course, hit the bed! which is the most important part

I came with a group of 5 other friends\/couples. we asked to have our rooms put together. NONE of them were together. one was 1 floor down. one was floor 48 one was floor 58, etc etc.

no pen\/paper easily accessible to jot phone notes. 

When I made the reservation months ago, I asked to have a connecting room. When I checked in, I was told ""sorry, can't do that."" So they gave me room 28.001 and 28.011 But we also happened to have another room booked under my mother's name, and somehow that room was connecting to 28.001 (it was 28.003), but somehow seconds ago, he couldn't get me a connecting room? what a messed up system?

They should just have the rooms stocked with the utensils, etc. or at least napkins?

my friend's room didn't have a coffeemaker. 
Bathtub looked deep but was really wimpy.

parents got the room service - said the food sucked.
we got locked out of our room - if someone in the room turns the special thing - then you are locked out. Later our keys didn't work.

concierge told me she booked grand luxe at palazzo - when we got there, the restaurant said we had booked grand luxe at venetian! luckily it was fine.

my friend got the 2 bedroom 2 level - said it was very vertical and not good
then she got the 2 bedroom flat suite and it was NICE for the master bedroom and ok for the other bedroom. but great view in the living room.

so next time would go with the 2 bedroom flat suite - room 54.004 or similar.",2,0,0

However, I'm deducting a star because due to some random service blips that we encountered, including:
- failing to provide us with bottled water on our second day (should have been included with our resort fee
- failing to provide us with shampoo and conditioner on our 2nd day
- business center closes at 5pm or earlier so we had to rely on the front desk staff to print some stuff for us

its definitely a different kind of suite, its contemporary. comparing it to the venetian suite it is way better. i stayed with one other friend in this room so for us we had plenty of room. we stayed in the deluxe suite and got a good deal when we got it during their 72 hour sale.

when we arrived at vdara, we were greeted with warm smiles by the bellman\/luggage man and had our bags sent up to our room. the woman helping us check in was also really nice. when we got up to our suite we were blown away by how nice the view was and the room was so beautiful. it had a nice plush king size bed with nice sheets. the shades were remote controlled. and my favorite part was the bathroom because it was so huge, the shower was nice and had a bench in case you need to shave your legs. and the tub was huge perfect for soaking your feet after a long night of clubbing. plus theres a mini fridge perfect for chilling out patron, jager, redbull and our other chasers.

The gym was extremely clean, but with quite limited machine selection. The spa facility was also very modern and very, very well quipped. I got to use the jacuzzi on my own and it felt like heaven.

The Vdara is the perfect hotel for me and really suits my needs and requirements. I am not a huge fan of Las Vegas. I generally do not go to Vegas unless I really have to. There are too many lights, smoke and opportunities to blow my bank my account.
Vdara is perfect because:

- ALL rooms are non-smoking. As a matter of fact, the entire facility is non-smoking. I was down at the bar when some guy tried to light up a cigar. Unanimously, several of the patrons and bar staff looked at him in horror. We all told him the place was non-smoking and he'd have to take a little walk to the Aria to light up. Sorry smokers, this is one place in Vegas where you're going to have to let the rest of us breathe in peace.

- The suites are all very roomy and definitely private. My suite had a kitchenette, dining area, living area, sleeping area and HUGE bath room. I had a free suite upgrade (no $20 sandwich trick), so I'm guessing I got one of the larger suites. I had a great view of the Bellagio fountain show and loved the automated curtains (esp. the Blackout option).

- Besides the bar and small café in the lobby, there isn't a casino, so there isn't a lot of noise or a crowd around that's going to cause a huge ruckus. I loved it.

- It's just a short distance away from Aria, Bellagio and the Cosmopolitan, so if you want to go to a show, or casino, you can walk or take the train to any of these other hotels ... you do that anyway regardless of the hotel you're staying at.

- They have a very awesome bar with great cocktails. If it's not on the menu, the bartender will still whip you up what you're looking for.

The staff was very friendly, at all hours - I encountered them late into the night and early in the morning. I will definitely be staying only at Vdara in future Vegas trips.",8,0,5

When we check in, it takes us an hour because their computer froze. We booked 2 rooms. However, one of the rooms still wasn't available and we checked in around 11-ish. When we go to our room, there is only 1 bed and a sofa bed for 4 people to stay in. 
The sofa bed is the worst part !!! It doens't come with any sheets or blankets and we have to call and ask for them. We have to place the sheets ourselves. We went up to them and asked for a room that has 2 beds for 4 people. The staff said, ""there is no room with 2 beds in Vdara. I tried the sofa bed myself, and it is very comfy."" The truth is, when we sat on the sofa bed, we were sitting on the springs of the bed and onto the bottom of the bed. 
I am not sure about people live in Vegas drink coffee or not in the morning. I cannot believe there is no coffee machine in the room even though there is a small kitchen. For everything you need in the room, you will have to call the services every time. It is very inconvenience. There is internet, but it does not support much on the phone data. VERY SLOW !! Laptop sometimes doesn't even connect to the internet. Customer service is bad.

1. First of all, it doesn't have self-parking. WHICH HOTEL IN VEGAS DOESNT HAVE SELF PARKING OTHER THAN VDARA? There wasn't even enough people out there helping with the valet. We waited forever until the car was parked.

2. The lobby was a mess. There were 3 people working at the front desk, people were all confused not knowing if there was one line, or 3 lines. There were only 3 people in front of me, but i still waited for about 20 minutes. The lady also had trouble scanning the keys to give to us. She seriously scanned about 10 keys, and made us wait while she asked other people to make the key for her.

3. The room is nice, but the pull out sofa bed was really bad. The mattress on the sofa bed sinked in in the middle, so it was very uncomfortable to sleep on. I called to request a blanket\/ comforter, and I think they gave me a bed cushion thing. Also, the air points directly at the sofa bed, so sleeping at night feels like sleeping in a wind tunnel.

4. The bathroom door has the kind of lock where you turn clockwise to lock. My sister closed the door after she showered, and the door locked inside! We had to call someone to come fix it for us. Horrible Design!

Vdara is wonderful for resting up after hitting the casinos elsewhere and getting away from the cig smoke. Do not expect wonderful dining experiences but the pool and spa are lovely.
Staff are decent.
If and when you need something, it will be delivered to your door within minutes. (Make sure and request a robe, ahh!)
Modern and clean, it may not be the cheapest on the strip but the best value as far as I am concerned re class.
Drinks are expensive in the lounge and you will not be reminded that it is happy hour which will cost you more in the end. (a bit annoying so we did not drink there again)
Rooms are nice - try to get a higher floor as some of the views of the city and beyond are quite nice.
Our safe malfunctioned and had to be serviced - fixed quickly. 
I do wish upon check in the dishes and coffee maker were in the room kitchen already but this too can be rectified. The coffee is Kcup which is a plus so if you wish, you can bring your fave coffee from home! (some is provided too)
I like the location on the strip, you will access Las Vegas Blvd through the Bellagio. Bellagio has great dining choices so you can eat great nearby!
The best thing was that our room was very quiet. Not sure if they have soundproofing but this was a plus in the morning. No housekeeping knocking on door and no Do Not Disturb Signs needed that just get stolen from your door anyways.  You will have a switch inside the door that will show when you are busy or sleeping, and also when housekeeping can come in. Also, there is turn down service each night should you allow it and they will leave you treats on your pillow! Your door also has a doorbell! How cool is that!
I wish the darkening shades worked better (cracks where they separate) but the beds are comfortable and we had a good night's sleep each night. I felt almost like I was in a small apartment than a hotel room , I liked the space. Internet included in fee and was well connected. TV channels plentiful and not choppy. (2 TVs)

We stayed here this past weekend with a group of 8, two rooms. When we checked in we slipped a $20 with the ID (A good Vegas upgrade practice) and got upgraded to two Bellagio Fountain rooms right next to each other which was great.

As many people have mentioned, the hotel smells fantastic when you walk in. It is such a breath of fresh air (did someone make that pun already, too?) from every other hotel on the strip. The thing I really disliked about vegas was the smoking EVERYWHERE, so coming home to this hotel was so refreshing as it is a non-smoking property as well.

The rooms were modern, the service was for the most part speedy, and the views we had of the strip\/Paris\/Bellagio fountains were AMAZING. Really a great place to stay if you are looking for something modern, classy, and different in Vegas.

Still 5 stars, however  it wouldn't be Yelp if there weren't a few nit-pickey things to say. Just to point out in case any of these things hit your buttons:

-- The $25 resort fee. Thats $25 a day, and supposedly covers the pool, gym, Wifi, and bottled water in your room. The Pool was closed for renovation during our stay (We were  given use of the Aria pool next door by showing our room keys, which was actually a plus for me since their pool was amazing!). Also, the Wifi barely worked and we had to ask for the bottled water to be replaced daily (not usually a water snob, but the tap water there tasted very odd). $25 still seems way too much for all that, but it is Vegas.

-- No Pool (for now at least). Like I mentioned, if you are booking around the date this review was posted note in advance that their pool area is currently closed for renovation. You are given access to Aria's pool next door, just show your room key when you walk in. Aria's pool deck is fantastic: three pools, three spas, and a bar. Watch out for those $25 Mojitos...

-- It's a short walk from the strip. This didn't really bother me as after the first day we pretty much had our bearings and could figure out the fastest ways to the strip. Vdara is connected to Bellagio via a bridge so walking through Bellagio, to their casino, to the shops was one way out to that end of the strip (or) taking the tram to Crystals or Monte Carlo was another. Just know that everything will be a walk, and everything looks closer than it is!

-- Be ready to ask for everything. Although the rooms have kitchenettes, none of the cupboards are stocked. We called Housekeeping countless times to request things like silverware, glasses, plates, a can opener, bottle opener, hair dryer, more towels, blah, blah. There a little signs around the room that say things like ""For your convenience, you can request kitchenware from Housekeeping."" Not sure how this is more convenient this is for the guest... or even the hotel for that matter. Just making more work for housekeeping! We received most items we requested within 20 minutes.


Bottom-line, I would stay here again. Everything was high-end, modern, and such a nice break from the strip. However, I'd probably choose Aria or a different hotel on the strip next time just the same, to try something new!",5,0,0

It's so drastically different from the other hotels on the Strip. Vdara has a pretentious air about it but it's not without reason. Because of its non-smoking policy, Vdara has higher quality air (you'd think this was the norm anywhere in the United States but it's Vegas). 

The condos-transformed-into-hotel rooms are roomier than any other rooms on the Strip. It even includes a kitchenette! Sweet. 

The bathrooms have a similar architecture as the ones in Aria. Individual areas for bathtub and shower area. I prefer Aria's rooms to the ones in Vdara solely because of style. Vdara is much more contemporary and minimalistic, whereas Aria seems slightly cozier and has more personality.",3,2,2

Even ALL the personel were super friendly including the room cleaners and maintenance people.
Electric window shades were cool as well. 

They only have Valet parking which is included in the price. It was efficient and quick.

The disappointment was that even though everyone must pay their ""resort fee"" of $25 + $3 tax each day, the use of any steam room or sauna is NOT included. One must pay a hefty daily price to use their ""spa"". That is really a no-no for me.
The ridiculously high prices at all the restaurants was expected so i just ate in other places or even bought food and kept it in the refrigerator. 

Walking to the strip was about 6 minutes as construction was being done so one has to go through a different parking lot.

Overall, if you want a 5 star hotel and are willing to pay for all the incidentals along the way, this place is surely a good one.

My bf and I absolutely love spontaneous Vegas trips. We live 6 hours away, so it's close enough to randomly drive there, but far enough to be tired from the drive. We were greeted by a warm and engaging receptionist. He asked what brought us to LV and we said, ""Oh, it's our just-cause-trip."" He responded with, ""I love that."" And continued with, ""Cause of that, I have something special for you two."" He upgraded us to a breathtaking suite! The room was amazing: spacious, modern, beautiful view.

If you prefer to relax and want to avoid the hustle and bustle of the strip, then this is the place for you. 

It is definitely new and chic. Well worth the visit and walk if you're staying at another property.

My husband and I recently came to Vegas for a weekend and booked Vdara for about $168 a night.  Considering Vdara is a new hotel in the City Center, it's an amazing deal.  Once you enter the hotel, you get an amazing whiff of lavender (or something) instead of disgusting cigarettes, but that's because there's no casino in here.  The bottom level pretty much consists of a lounge, restaurant\/mini-mart, and check-in area.  When you're leaving the hotel, you can go one way and take the tram to Bellagio and the rest of the City Center or exit through the main doors and walk across the way either the Cosmo or Aria.  My only complaint is that it's hard finding your way back to Vdara because like I said, it's hidden and there aren't many signs for it.  Just remember your original route and back track.

We got the most basic room with a King bed and pull out couch and a big bathroom with a stand-up shower and small tub - NOT a hot tub or jacuzzi.  There's also a mini kitchen with a stove, sink and microwave!  I already have a room booked here at Vdara for EDC weekend and I cannot wait!!",2,0,0

Pros:

1. Customer service. Rose, one of the front desk receptionist, was fantastic. She was incredibly friendly, warm, helpful, without being intrusive. Perfect balance and a great asset to the hotel. 

2. Non-smoking. I love that this is non smoking. Our last stay in Vegas had a smokey smell in the hallway, which triggered my allergies every time. So this is a true blessing in Vegas.

3. Location. The Bellagio is literally a hallway away from the lobby, the Aria is a 2-3 minute walk from the front door. 

4. Room amenities.

a. Room divisions. I like that our room had a partially divided seating area (couch, chair, desk) from the bed, while also having a separate kitchen area. However, I should note that some rooms are an open floor plan without this. Our original room was open, but we requested one with the partial wall and they were kind enough to switch us.

b. Drawers\/storage. There are tons of drawers (3 below TV, 2 each on bedside end tables) and a decent closet, which was also nice. 

c. Kitchenette. The fridge and free bottled water was also a huge bonus for us, since surprisingly not all Vegas casinos offer this simple thing.

d. Shades and blackout curtains. There were options for just a shade and blackout curtains, both of which are electronic. (Switches in kitchenette). 


Cons (though none are huge)

1. Market\/restaurants. They have a small market with some cafe eating options, some beverages, a few Amy's frozen meals, and a few snacks. This store is definitely smaller than many of the other casino shops. There is also a Starbucks, but it closes at 8p Sunday-Thursday, and 10p otherwise. However, super close to the Aria and Bellagio, which do have these.

2. Bathroom quirks. There were a few quirks to the bathroom, which is why I gave Vdara 4 instead of 5 (though if 1\/2 stars were an option, it'd be 4.5).

a. Door easily slams. It's a sliding\/gliding door, which can easily slam shut. Given that it's 4 feet from the bed, not the best at night or in the morning if someone else is sleeping.

b. Hair dryer was hard to find. There is one drawer to the left of the sink that contained this, but wasn't obvious so we had to call the front desk.

c. Shower head immovable. We couldn't get the shower head's angle to move, and it was a little high for my 5'2"" frame. So though a large shower, I had to be pretty close to the front wall\/glass to wash my hair.

d. Soaker tub actually has a small base (maybe 2-2.5' long) but then curves upwards. Not a huge deal, but it's slightly deceiving in pictures and could be a little awkward if tall.",1,0,0

Coming to Vegas for the first time in a good 3 years, I really wasn't sure of where to stay and left it in the hands of some friends to pick a hotel that was nice, adjacent to the strip, and ideally, had a nice pool.   They came up with a 4 night, 5 day stay at the Vdara.. and boy, was I happy.

Firstly, the ambiance at the hotel is really relaxing right off the back.  Minimalist ceiling fixtures and light music really sets the calm mood in the lobby.  Also, the SMELL!  As other people have mentioned, the hotel is a nonsmoking hotel, but the fresh-scent that is ever-present really was something worth taking note.  Every time we would walk through the hotel, someone in our party would comment on it.

The pool itself was smaller than a bunch of the other hotel pools, but really relaxing, and the drinks from the pool bar were pretty good for the prices ($).  AND, the Vdara-death-ray found in so many articles is since long-gone.

The corner suite that we had was very spacious and easily fit 4 people, due to the pull-out sofa bed (which originally looked kinda shifty, but was more comfortable than I thought), and having a full refrigerator, washer\/dryer and stove-top really felt like an apartment rather than a hotel.  Someone in our party found out that originally these suites were dedicated to resort-style apartment living right off the strip, but when they weren't selling, they opened it to the public.  SWEET.

Even though I am a major gamble-holic, and there was no casino directly down in the lobby, I was kind of relieved, since it forced me to get some exercise (...and think twice) if I wanted to gamble a bit.  Aria is literally less than 5 minutes away across the roundabout and the Bellagio casino floor is also a quick 10 minute walk away adjacent through the breezeway.

A couple little criticisms:  when we first requested extra towels for the room, they were sent up very promptly.. within 5 minutes, actually.. HOWEVER, we were very surprised to be looking out at the view, and hear a ""Hello?"" right behind us.  The housekeeper decided it might be fun to sneak up behind us, enter our 'locked' room and walk into the bedroom to deliver them personally.  This prompted us to DEADBOLT the door anytime we were in the room.  I read reviews on here about peoples belongings getting jacked, so we utilized the tiny, tiny safe in the room, and I would recommend it.  

Also, we showed up one afternoon, to a smelly room and our vents all pulled out and set alongside the floor.  Apparently, there was a leak coming from our room that had leaked down 20+ floors to the lobby so they tried to fix it before we came back... (HA!  Caught them!), but a very nice mechanic named Harris apologized to us and got us a discount for the inconvenience.

Even with the minor mishaps, I really enjoyed the stay here and will definitely stay here again, no question.",1,1,1

This room had a full size fridge as well as a washer and dryer.  The hotel provides detergent and fabric softener upon request at no additional charge.  Nice touch.  The 270 view in my room was quite abstracted by several large buildings, however the layout of the room itself was really cool.  The bedroom has sliding doors that divide it from the living and kitchen area.  

Also I should note there is a market place downstairs that makes eggs and sandwiches.

I was fully aware that it is a non-smoking, non-gambling hotel.  I was looking for some relaxing time instead of going bananas on the casino floor somewhere. It definitely afforded me that!  

I am a local REALTOR in Las Vegas and have stayed at many of the hotels so I can help friends\/clients decide on places to stay when they come to town.  Like many of the other reviews, the internet is terrible and the tech is a lil behind for this all-suite hotel that targets the executive clientele. Like any hotel of this nature, everything is going to be over-priced! It's Vegas, so come prepared for your stay! I always pack a small cooler with drinks and snacks; it helps.

Lastly, I was pleased to have the assistance of Tabatha when I checked in. She allowed me to check in to my City View Corner Suite early without hesitation.  I wanted a top floor room as the views are way better of course, but all I could get was the 14th. It was still really nice with the 270 degree views.

If you come with expectations of a luxury hotel with first rate service, you will be disappointed. If you come with the idea that it is well located and convenient to the Vegas fun stuff, you will be (mostly) fine.

This is why:  

The rooms are spacious but not well maintained. Our shower head was falling off (which got fixed), the furniture is chipped and scratched and the sofa bed was the worst one ever. The lights are finicky. Sometimes they went on, other times they wouldn't.  Weird.

There is no restaurant and room service had only a few of the items on the menu. Really frustrating. And ridiculously expensive. 

Also, there is a market which serves breakfast and lunch with prepared meals and sundries, but it is organized so inefficiently and the space is so cramped, it truly is worthless. 

The worst part is that this is Las Vegas and it closes early!  So if you come back to the hotel looking for a late bite, you are out of luck.  You can always walk to Aria, but Aria can be crowded, especially the Buffet. 

One one hand the concierge was helpful with booking shows.  On the other hand, when you need help, they won't pick up the phone because there is usually one concierge and a line of 10 people waiting in line for help: again just not thought through and inefficient. 

Check in was fine, but this hotel seems understaffed and I've seen horrendous lines lines to check-in. 

You have NO CHOICE but to pay a daily resort fee for things I will NEVER use, except for WiFi. A rip-off.

The staff is really really nice.  The housekeeping and room service staff are first rate as are the bellmen.  

So, if you look at Vdara as a room with a bed which is convenient to lots of stuff, especially the Bellagio, the Cosmopolitan and Las Vegas Blvd. it is fine.

Anything else, you will not only be frustrated but disappointed too.

Ultimately, there are better smaller boutique hotel options in Vegas. I didn't want a mega cigarette smoke infused crowd maddening experience. Those are ubiquitous and easily gotten too.  I was hoping for an intimate and gracious space with superb amenities. On that level, Vdara is an epic fail. Once I lowered my expectations, I was still annoyed but less frustrated.

I was shocked, because I didn't expected the hotel like Vdara would make such mistake. I called the housing keeping instantly and asked for changing the sheet. Then I asked the manager to come as well, the African American manager took a picture and said he would report it, and would compensate us for that.

Got a room on the 37th floor; beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains and pretty much all of Vegas! I love how they had a tub and a shower in the bathroom and their beds were so soft and comfy to relax in. The service was great as well, house keeping was thorough and when there were some technical difficulties with the TV audio, a technician was promptly sent to fix the problem in a jiffy. Resort fee includes pretty fast internet as well, woohoo! 

It's really refreshing how there are no casinos inside the hotel. 

There were a couple of cons though...
Beware the hotel food\/Market Cafe - we ordered food here a couple of times, and every time we finished a meal, my boyfriend and I would feel sick. We also ordered a chicken noodle soup to go from the Market Cafe - it took thirty minutes just to receive and on top of that, the soup was extremely old and smelled funky. We asked for a refund immediately which we received.
After two days of that nonsense, we learned our lesson and ate somewhere else. A Starbucks is conveniently located right next to the Market Cafe; it's privately owned though so they won't accept any regular Starbucks giftcards and the prices are incredibly inflated compared to LA. 

I also noticed that after a couple of days of staying at the hotel, I was breaking out in little bug bites. We complained to the front desk about the probable mites in the bed and they took our resort fee off.

Modern decor for the rooms, and if you get a high floor, the view is absolutely gorgeous.

The standard rooms at Vdara has an amazing king-size bed, and a nice size bathroom. TV in the bathroom as well. 

It does seem like some rooms have seen some abuse over the years. Fridge didn't really work properly at my most recent stay and the sofa bed actually gave me a small one inch gash from one of the rods being exposed. Asked for some gauze and tape when security came up to do some basic dressing, so I can change it myself later but they just said they only had ""one roll of tape"" so just gave me some band-aids instead.

Foodwise, there's a cafe downstairs, but it is overpriced. There's more options over at Aria and Monte Carlo so make the short trek if you're not too lazy.

Vdara is good for family and for the business traveler that's doesn't really need a casino floor. Just wish they can start inspecting the rooms a bit more!",4,0,1

The staff from the front desk, housekeeping, maintenance, security to pool staff are SUPER friendly!!! They all were always very happy & up beat! They definitely love working here!!! It makes the stay so much better when you have this type of staff. I highly recommend staying here. Can be a little pricey esp. The $28:night resort fee but you definitely get what you pay for. The bed was sooooo comfortable along with the pillows. Master bathroom is very spacious & I like the extra bathroom for room guests.

Originally booked through Hotwire.com Secret Hotel deal and was nervous at first. We ended up getting a room at Vdara through their third party Jet Luxury Resorts. After reading a lot of negative reviews, I wanted to cancel our reservation. I called Hotwire, Vdara and Jet Luxury but no one was willing to let me cancel. 

I am so happy that we did not cancel. Our stay was perfect. We arrived early (10am) and checked in our bags till our room was ready. We were able to get into our room at 2:30. The room was so elegant, classy and modern. We had a living space, kitchen area, very comfortable bed and a beautiful bathroom. 

Everyone working at this location was very nice and helpful. The hotel is beautiful and a great retreat from the normal Vegas style hotel. There is no casino but that wasn't an issue for us since we could walk across to Aria. 

The location was great, right in the middle of everything.

Highly recommended hotel for people that don't want the crazy Vegas style but still very close to everything.",1,0,0

Just checked out and probably would not be back! It's a new clean hotel. Booked with jet luxury and we did not know they don't service your room during your stay. We so badly needed a service cleaning! We had to request towels and toilet paper daily! The bed was comfortable and the room was clean when we first arrived! The lobby doesn't feel like your in Vegas. No casino and no smoking! They had a cafe, restaurant, and Starbucks. But not much else going out in lobby!

Majority of the girls wanted to stay in the same hotel so after researching and taking recommendations from other friends, we decided on Vdara as the prices were extremely cheaper than other hotels on the strip due to the fact that there is no casinos\/gambling. Whats great about this is you dont smell to much smoke and its just really a clean and modern hotel! I like the close proximity to aria and cosmopolitan as well!

Upon check in the guy that checked us I was very nice and help us check in easy. The room was not ready and said he would put a VIP rush on it along with my friends room and put both rooms side by side. I had pre ordered a cabana and since I knew room wouldn't be ready for a while I figured would be nice to hang at the pool. We get to the pool and everyone was excited, they showed us the cabana and even though it wasn't next to the pool it wasn't to far. After getting into one of the smaller pool we get told that we are not allowed to swim there because we didn't pay an extra 50 dollars to get the cabana that's closer. We had already paid 200 for the cabana, and that was. It enough. We decided to upgrade as we rather have a more private setting. They specifically say up to 8 people per cabana but the cabana next to us has 15 people and being extra rowdy! The whole point of us getting that spot and paying so much was to get a more intimate setting but that was disrupted but party goes that didnt care about the limit. My friend finally gets a call that his room was ready but my room was not ready for 3 more hours. I had to go to the check in desk and ask if my room was ready. Apparently the room was ready but we had no call. We check out of the cabana and the girl said she comped the extra 50 dollars for the cabana but when checking my folio she ended up charging it anyways. I had to call front desk and complain about that. We check into the room and there was still clothes from the previous people and bags in the room. I called front desk and they switched us to a ""better"" room. The room was facing the bellagio fountains but was a very obscure view. After waiting for so long for the room all I wanted to do was shower and get ready to go out. I was putting away my clothes and see that there was a used towel in one of drawers and the dressers were dirty. After having trouble with the first room I decided just to not say anything. After a fun night on the town I come back to the room and get in bed, turn on the tv to watch and the tv was in black and white. I turned it on and off several times to see if that did the trick but nothing. With it being late and all I decided to not call service at the moment and wait till the morning. I called the next morning and had a technician come up and check on it. They fixed it but don't think that by it having new tvs and being a 4 diamond hotel I should have any problems. As I check out the next morning there are 2 charges for long distance calls so I had to once again call front desk to get that taken care of. I usually stay at the cosmopolitan and always get great service so expected the same here but that was not the case. Came to vdara to try something new but was very disappointed. For it being a 4 diamond they need to get their act together! The only thing that was decent was the fast valet but even that was pricey. Needless to say I don't think I will be ever staying back here again and will stick to staying at the cosmopolitan.",1,1,1

Looking for the entrance to valet was kinda difficult since we turned into the Aria entrance and we had to turnaround and the entrance to Vdara was on Harmon.  It felt like LAX airport entrance going here.  LOL

Got here at 8pm and valet our car.  Valet area was empty and service was fast!  
The hotel is modern and beautiful decor!
I love the room and the tram was convenient to get to another hotel.

You're first greeted by the valet guys. No self-park, just valet. I don't know what's wrong with some of you, but valet is awesome! I don't want to walk a mile in a stuffy (and for half the year 120 degrees) parking garage.  (And yet, I'm THAT person who won't let housekeeping touch my room, hah.)

Then, you enter the hotel and immediately notice..hey! No smoke..no casino. The lobby smells incredible and is much appreciated after walking through other hotels\/casinos.

The rooms are large and equipped with practically a full kitchen--sink, two burner stove, mini fridge, kitchen table, etc.  According to others you have to ask for dinnerware, but I didn't check to confirm (who cooks in Vegas??).  We had two TVs, one facing the bed and one facing the couch.  Speaking of the bed...SOOO comfy!  Loved it.

The reason I didn't give it five stars is I have a couple minor complaints.  The water pressure in the shower is a joke.  Ladies, be prepared to be washing your hair for a loooong time.  Also?  The bar of soap kind of sucks and smells bad, too.  The room also didn't have a hair dryer in it.  I'm sure I could have requested one, but I didn't have time for that.  The vanity mirror in our room was broken and the lights didn't work, making it slightly more difficult to do my makeup.  And last, but not least, our room clock was like 6 hours off.  I'd think housekeeping would reset the clock when turning over the room, but guess not.  Not a huge deal, but worth mentioning why I can't afford this great hotel a five star review.

Now back to the good stuff.  When you retrieve your car from valet, they ask you if you need directions.  I thought that was pretty cool.  They also offer free water at the valet station.

Overall, I loved this hotel and can't wait to stay again.  It's nice to have a quieter, non-smoking hotel to come back to after a long day on the strip.",3,0,0

The room had electronic shades. We had a beautiful view of the strip and the water show at Bellagio. I loved waking up to the morning light peeking through the windows.

For the most part, the bathroom was awesome. Soaked in the bathtub for so long my skin got pruney.  I wished they had more drawers for my bathroom toiletries. There was only one so I had stuff scattered all over the counter top. Shower could've been just slightly bigger but I like the bench inside except I don't know how many bare asscheeks have been on it. I pushed the shower head to spray some water on it but still wasn't comfortable enough to sit down. The bathroom also had a scale! It said skinny on it, kidding me? All I did was eat on my trip. There were no bathroom vents :\/ The sliding door was difficult to lock, and even when you lock it, there was a big gap where you could peek inside.

The bed was amazing! I almost charged a king size bed to my credit card. I would've just purchased the pillows if I had enough room in my luggage or hands to carry it back onto the plane. I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud..it was hard getting out of bed because it was so comfortable. I get disappointed with my own bed every time I come back home.

I wished the room was brighter. At night when all the lights were turned on, it was still pretty dim. It's good sex lighting but not good for everything else. 
Customer service was exceptional. They were very professional. My bf left his suit in the closet and didn't realize it until we got home.

I stayed at the Vdara in October of 2012, and it took me by surprise. They have great deals and offers and got a really good deal with one night for free which extended my vacation. Upon arriving at the Vdara, the experience was remarkable. As soon as you walk into the lobby, you automatically get this great feel of classiness and cleanliness all over. A very slick and sexy hotel no doubt, great for everyone. Even though the Vdara has no casino, its actually a great benefit. Nice and quiet, great for relaxing and if you're ready to gamble, the Cosmopolitan and the Aria are literally feet away. Another benefit of the Vdara is that you have the tram station at your hotel which leads you to the Aria and Monte Carlo, very very convenient and nice ride too, you get a great view of the City Center that you cant get without getting on the tram. The rooms are amazing, very modern and classy as well. I also had a great view of the Bellagio fountains and the Cosmo, nothing better than waking up watching the show.

I do agree with other posters that there are yet a few kinks to be worked out as the hotel is so new, but I believe that these will get worked out nicely with a little more time.

The hotel is clean and modern, nicely decorated, and has soft music and smells great (a huge plus after the old ash trays that are the other hotels).  There is lots of natural light and space in the lobby which actually has a rather small footprint.  The bar is sleek and tasteful but I can't comment further as I haven't had a drink there yet. 

Our room is nicely furnished and large.  The kitchenette didn't have plates or silverware so we had to ask housekeeping to send them up.  It took two requests before they came but they dishes and silverware were nice when they arrived.  The bathroom is beautiful, the bed comfortable.  I enjoy the free wireless internet that doesn't require too many funky passwords or logons as other hotels sometimes do.  The automated window covers are pretty slick.

The gym is on the small side but beautifully appointed.  It shares space with the spa which together is named the ""Health and Beauty Center"" which made it difficult at first to know whether that was just a spa or included a gym.  I haven't checked out the pool.  

All the staff so far has been very helpful and friendly although it has felt that they get their wires crossed sometimes and take longer to respond to requests than they should.  Again, I trust that this will get worked out in time as the team adjusts to their new working environment.

There are people that own rooms at the Vdara and rent them out when they are not there to lower their costs. 

If you do not book a room DIRECTLY through Vdara in favor of getting a ""good deal"" via a travel site you run the risk of getting one of these rooms. If you do get one of these rooms the housekeeping staff will not come and clean it because you are technically not a guest of the hotel. READ THE FINE PRINT WHEN YOU BOOK A ROOM INDIRECTLY for this hotel. I have read three bad reviews from people that did not do the research and read the fine print. OK now on to my review.

I absolutely loved this hotel. As a caveat this hotel may not be for everyone. I loved the fact there is no casino, no smoking, and no crowds. I was there for 8 nights and I had a nice view of Aria and the pool. I was also close to the elevator, but not too close. I would specifically ask for this room again.

I used the valet parking at check in and check out because of my luggage, otherwise I self parked at Bellagio the rest of my stay. I did not mind being a little further off the strip or the 5 minute walk to the car in order to gain the peace and quite you get at this hotel. 

Unlike every other hotel I have stayed at in Las Vegas was never bothered by housekeeping even though I had the do not disturb signal turned on. The only part of the kitchenette I used was the fridge which kepts things plenty cold. I absolutely loved the king sized bed and large tub which I used before I went to bed every night. This was also the first time in Vegas I was never bothered a single time by loud people in the hallways.The clientele at this hotel want a more quiet and low key experience and they respect other guests in turn.

I had one minor problem with my room and someone came up within an hour and fixed the problem right away. I spent three hours at the pool one day and even though the pool was fairly crowded the waitress came pretty quickly and I did not have to wait long for my drinks.

Vdara is clean, relaxing, smoke-free, and I absolutely loved the location.  There's a direct walkway (inside the hotel) that connects to Bellagio. And if you step outside of the hotel and walk to your left you're instantly at Aria and City Center. We never had to wait for a cab unlike other hotels.  Vdara is an escape from the typical crazy casino hotels.  When I'm ready to call it a night (or I guess morning in some cases) I like to walk into a quiet area with direct access to the elevator.

I will not stay here again.   It's far from everything.  Yes, the room is nice, but it's meant to be a condo.  Everything is so spread out.  

They gave me a $100 food & beverage credit.  Great!  When I used it to buy an overpriced bottle of wine at the hotel store they said that was merchandise instead of food & beverage.  So really the credit is only for PREPARED food and PREPARED coffee ($4\/cup!).  Of course, they don't tell you this when you buy the wine - only when you check out.  Gotcha!

In the morning, the only place to get a cup of coffee is the ""market cafe"" and the line is LONG!  Who needs that?  But you're trapped!  In the morning you don't want to walk a 1\/2 mile to the nearest alternative?

Never in my life would I had been able to afford this alone, but hey, when there's a bachelorette party you need to plan for, then you try to find the best...

First of all, the place is freakin' HUGE!  I'm talking large bedroom, insanely large bathroom, huge dining room and living room.  As if that wasn't enough, they have a full refrigerator with an electric stove and plenty of cabinet space.  The only thing that's missing to this whole kitchenette experience is an oven, but hey, I certainly hope you don't expect to be waiting around all night for food to heat up in the oven.  And in case, let's say, you need a washer and dryer, well then, good thing you brought clothes cause they have that too!  There's even a half bathroom located next to the dining room, complete with toilet and sink (in case you don't have time to stumble into the other bathroom of course).  We had a total of 6 girls come up for dinner at the room, which we stocked in the fridge with PLENTY of alcohol!  The shower has a sit down area for those ladies (or guys too!) who want to shave their legs as well as two sinks, a separate bathtub, and plenty of towels!  We ordered more towels, though, and some more dishware, which was brought up promptly to our room.  

My only gripe is that there is no self parking for Vdara.  You have to park in Aria or simply valet your car in Vdara, which is easier.  This caused a little bit of confusion for a couple of friends, but once they got settled and saw the apartment like hotel, nothing else mattered except the PAR-TAY!

One other thing, the pool is amazing!  It's crowded by noon, but my friend and I awoke when the pool opened (9am) to enjoy the pool, which also had a hot tub!  It was nice to enjoy before the peeing children and their parents could make their way into swimsuits and make me cringe at the thought of even putting my feet into the pool.

We got a pleasant surprise by being upgraded to a deluxe suite, which surpassed all other venues that we have visited in Las Vegas.  The room had its own dining area, a separate 1\/2 bath, full size kitchen and amazing views.  The bed was COMFY and the room was as quiet as I would imagine a tomb would be.  It seemed as though the hotel was near maximum capacity, yet we felt as though our floor of the hotel was exclusively ours.

We love to walk, so the stroll to the Bellagio or the Strip or the Aria was refreshing.  The Vdara felt close enough to the hustle and bustle of the Strip, yet just far enough away.

We wrapped up our stay with some time by the pool.  It's not a huge area, but large enough to find some space of your own.  The staff was friendly and attentive, offering up umbrellas and drink service.  It was a great place to conclude our stay.

All-in-all, I'm putting the Vdara at the top of my list for future trips to Las Vegas.",0,0,0

We actually met him first while picking up our rental car and he asked where we were staying and so we told him the new hotel Vdara and he said he was also a concierge there. With that said, he offered to help us with some of reservations that we needed that weekend. He was kind enough to confirm with us that we were confirmed to the places we wanted to go and made us feel we can contact him with anything else we needed during our stay @ Vegas. 

The first night we stayed there, it just so happened that their fire alarm went off. And no, there was no fire. They said that there were a glitch on their system. Woken up in the early morning hour, walked down the stairs from the 15th floor wasn't comfortable. But, the workers were kind to assure us that there weren't any danger and double checked every floor before we were allowed to go back to our room. Safety first!! 
It was an experience but not an exciting one. 

The day we were checking out, the receptionist asked us for our contact information, for the inconvenience that happened and their regional manager will be contacting us.

Pros: perfect location if you want to be within close proximity to bellagio or cosmo (5 minute walk to all the action but feels like a private retreat), smells great, no smoking, nicely arranged rooms, beautiful view of the Bellagio Fountains from the Fountain View Room

Cons: food options in lobby are absolutely terrible and overpriced ($8 for bottled water and extremely low quality food - although, it is a pretty quick walk to the other casinos' restaurant options), starbucks' prices are almost doubled, some aspects of hotel are out dated (remotes for TVs did not work, switch for blinds was obviously old and broken when we got into room and had to be fixed twice, remote was broken, some lights were out), the ""black out"" blinds that are advertised are NOT black out and light pours in, I was never blown away by the staff or service - it was just o.k., and valet is pretty slow


I really want to give this hotel 5 stars because the location is great and the hotel itself is so unique to Vegas; however, it is not quite a 5 star experience. I think this place could really be an amazing destination; although, it simply falls sort.

As far as the hotel goes, it is just fine. With no casino, it was a nice quiet refuge from the strip. BUT, LIKE EVERY STORY IN VEGAS, WITH THE GOOD, COMES THE BAD .... (or semi-bad).

Vdara is valet parking only. I can only presume that they have some crazy figure 8 Hot Wheels set up in the parking structure that precludes recreational drivers from parking their own cars.  

Okay, so we roll with the valet. However, when my clean ride comes back, there's a new door ding. Ba-bam! I'm not a sniveler by any means, but they made me use the car jockey. It wasn't my choice. So, I make a claim. And, I have have to say I didn't have any expectations that Vdara (or big brother Aria) would accept responsibility for the damage.

And, what do you know, I - was - right.  Here's my telephone exchange with Aria Risk Management representative ""Al."" 

Al - ""I checked the video and see your car already had the damage."" 
Me - ""Really?""  
Al - ""Yup.""  
Me - ""The ding is about 3\/8 of an inch. How could you even see that?""  
Al - ""We have a hi-tech high resolution video system.""  
Me - ""I'm cool with that, just email me a copy of the photo image from your system.""  Al  ""Oh, I can't do that. It's pr-o-p-r-i-e-t-a-r-y .... They would fire me on the spot.""  
Me - ""Dooh ... So, you can't send me a photo of my own car?""  
Al - ""No, you'll just have take my word on this.""     
Me - (Words not for publication)            

My suggestion - If you wanna stay at the Vdara, park in the Aria garage and walk to Vdara. That way, if your car gets door dinged, you'll be upset, but there's no clear suspect to be pissed at.

IMPORTANT UPDATED INFORMATION

Well I'll be damned!  After I sent a letter, Aria\/Vdara took a second look at my situation took care of my issue.  I won't disclose the details, but I'm presently in a renewed happy place about Vdara.  With that, I'm adding back a couple of stars to the rating.  

I've actually returned to Vdara many times all with positive experiences.  I really like this place. It is well run and without a casino inside (yet Aria close), it is a relatively quiet and mature refuge from the Strip.",13,10,2

We had a wonderful experience and I would definitely stay at Vdara (or any MGM property) again.

Every single staff member was helpful, especially that first day when we were getting use to the lay of the hotel.

Unlike some reviewers *ah hem* I always make sure to read my paperwork before signing up for anything.  Read up on all the amenities, resort fees and taxes and included this in my planning. Just makes sense.

The room was spotless, and was cleaned daily and checked at least 2x a day.  There was an optional turn down service, but we turned it down.  The waters left in the room by staff we highly appreciated! We left a tip for the staff every single day.

The windows were huge and really let you take in the mountains in the background, and the city at night. You could not beat the view from our room. 38 floors up we could see the Eiffel tower, Bellagio fountains and the High Roller (new 550ft observation wheel, tallest in the world atm)

Since we were there a week but only brought carry-on luggage, we also made use of the washer\/dryer.  It is just a small stacked set made to handle shirts and pants, not larger items, which was fine.  The Vdara provided complementary detergent and dryer sheets on request.

There was an in-suite kitchen, and being able to save leftovers and heat them up properly to eat tomorrow was a blessing. 

The Market Cafe in the lobby was nice because of convenience (but you will pay for it of course)

It was very nice to 'get away' from the city when you were ready to sleep.  No casino, no smoking, quite and peaceful.  And if you are a night owl is is a short walk away are Bellagio and Aria, both are excellent properties to visit. Bellagio has the gardens and fountains, both have casinos. Also there is a free tram to Monte Carlo and Crystal Shops.

An upgrade from Caesar's Palace... We stayed in the Studio Suite 1 bedroom and it was amazing! We got a deal on Sams Club Travel so i would recommend booking on their website than Vdara's website.  We were impressed with how modern it looked and how clean it was. It's definitely more quieter than the other hotels since it does not have a casino inside and it is smoke free.  The room was very spacious (about 582 sq. ft.) with a small kitchenette including a microwave, one top burner, small refrigerator, medium sized table, lounge couch, kind sized plush bed and tub in the bathroom. The pool is a good size too but when we went it was too cold to go in. The housekeepers were very very nice too and always came on time or came back when you needed them too. They even straightened up our own belongings and made them look nice!!  The service was great when we first arrived too! The valet men were on their feet the whole time (running to get everyone's cars) even when we needed our car pulled out a couple of times during the week. The front desk employees were very nice and helpful too. We payed an extra $30 to check-in early and it was worth it. Inside the lobby there is a Starbucks and mini cafe to grab a bite to eat. There's even plenty of sitting areas that look like you are in a rain forest lol. Also they have ""hotel guards"" that stand in two places when you enter the service elevators to go up to your room. Sometimes you may need to hold your key card to make sure they know you are staying here. In this hotel you really can't hear anything outside of your door or next to you. It's that quiet! One plus about this hotel is that it has easy access to the Bellagio Hotel since  all you have to do is walk around the corner at Starbucks in Vdara and access the bridge into Bellagio. This hotel is located right next to Aria and Cosmopolitan too so you are right there basically on the strip just pushed back...For the price of this hotel, its worth staying here!

Rooms are big, clean, and the bathtub is perfect for a soak after a day of non stop shopping. The only con is that you have to do a bit of walking in order to get on the strip. Either you can pass over a walkway that goes into the Bellagio, and then out to the strip, or you can walk across Valet parking to the Aria and walk through the Aria to get to the strip.

I come to Vegas on a regular basis and am pretty jaded.  I often come for work, so have to keep it cool for much of the week, as I'm unable to self-medicate with coffee or Red Bull in the morning.  My company had booked a 2 bedroom suite for entertaining clients, and myself and one of my coworkers ended up benefiting from this arrangement.

The view from the suite was amazing.  We were looking due south on the 45th floor, and had a clear view of the 15, the Luxor, the Mandalay Bay, etc.  I pulled rank on my coworker to get the view to the southwest from my bedroom as well.

It's not right on the Strip, but Harmon offers pretty easy access to the frontage road (Dean Martin) paralleling the freeway on the West.  This is a fast way to get around without dealing with the traffic crush and rubberneckers on the Strip.

There is no casino.  If you consider this a downside of this hotel you might have a gambling problem.  There is a casino less than 1\/4 mile from the front door (Aria).  The Cosmopolitan is walking distance if you're craving more clubs and eye candy.  Since the Vdara isn't really a 'destination', the cab traffic can be somewhat light but the taxi lines sort of match, so getting a cab isn't that much of a time suck.

There were only a couple of misfires that didn't really dampen the whole experience:

The wall safe in the walk-in closet was mounted and hinged so that I could not see into it when it was open.  But hey, walk in closet.

There were no outlets near the bed, but there were enough outlets in the bedroom that I just coped with having my phone over on a small table instead of near me on the nightstand.

There were a few problems with the keys when we checked in, but that might have been because of the way we were getting multiple keys for many coworkers.

One of the valet attendants was pretty rude when we asked for the favor of leaving our rental up front, despite us being willing to tip heavily to make it happen.  The rental was an Escalade, so it wasn't the ugly car factor (since there was an Explorer in the front row).

The blinds leave small slits so it's not as blacked out in the morning as I've seen in other hotels.  This wasn't a deal killer, but you might consider bringing a sleeping mask if you plan on partying hard and light keeps you awake in the morning.

Those were very minor, and were washed away by all the greatness I observed.

Service (apart from the aforementioned valet attendant) was fantastic.  Everyone was super-friendly, even the elevator guards.

The suite was fully appointed, by which I mean you could live in it, which I'm led to understand was the original point of the hotel.  Dishwasher, instant-hot faucets, oven, full-sized built-in fridge, range, big built-in trash can, washer and dryer, and a flatscreen TV in both bedrooms and the main sitting area.  It was \/big\/, bigger than any two bedroom apartment I've ever rented.  It had a small half bath in the front and full private bathrooms for each bedroom, including separate shower and bath.  The blinds were remote controlled.  The bed and pillows were exceptionally comfortable.  Exceptionally.

Internet access was free and mostly usable, if you don't mind occasionally hitting a clear http site to 'reset' the connection.

We plugged our laptops right into this fancy access panel under the TV via HDMI and were easily able to deliver presentations.

Walking into a hotel after a long evening in Vegas after a long day working a trade show and being greeted by a pleasant smell and the blissful ABSENCE of slot machine dinging and blinking made the evenings wind down more pleasantly.

Maybe I just like this place because i'm getting old, but I will definitely stay here again!",3,1,1

My husband and I stayed in a corner suite for a total of four nights.The room was spacious and the view was amazing! I also loved the fact that the hotel did not have a casino and was non-smoking! It made for a much faster taxi line, especially when it was raining and no irritating cigarette\/cigar smoke (I wear contacts so all of the smoke was really irritating my eyes).  

Housekeeping was also very friendly and efficient when it came to cleaning our room. They were always on it when we needed something brought up. For instance, the Keurig in our room was missing and they brought one up for us as well as extra cups and k-cups. However, I did deduct a star because my things were constantly being moved. I.E. My hairbrush and facial lotion would constantly move from my side to that of my husband's. 

I also loved that room service was offered for 24 hours a day. We enjoyed ordering room service, but I despised the fact that it would take hours to fulfill an order. For instance, on Saturday night at about 2AM, we ordered two salads. We were told that it would take 30 minutes, but it ended up taking 2 hours. On Friday night, the same thing happened, however, this time, we had fallen asleep by the time that they delivered our food so we didn't get our food, but were still charged for the order. BOO! The other times that we did order room service, the food arrived within a reasonable time frame so room service was definitely hit or miss.

When we got there, we realized that there was only valet, no self parking. But we don't like valet and so we decided to park at the Bellagio. That turned out to be a great idea. The Bellagio is connected to the Vdara, so the parking was really close to our hotel.

We reserved just the basic room, which was fabulous. We were on a lower floor, and didn't hear a single person in another room the entire time we were there. No drunks, smokers, partiers! The room had a coffee maker, with coffee cups. The blinds were electronic, so the blinds could be darkened with a touch of a button. When the shades were up, the view was pretty good. The bed was very comfortable. AND THE BATHROOM IS AMAZING. There is a deep soaking tub and a huge shower with a sitting area. The living room furniture was a little bit worn, but we spent most of our time on the bedroom side of the room. The bed was very comfortable, and they offer a ton of channels on the tv.

So when someone decides to build not just one hotel but a block of hotels, high-end shopping, casinos, it better live up the hype of Vegas.

And sadly, Vdara was just a poser hotel.  Not even a casino.

I stayed here with a group of friends in May.  One of my friends had a code for a reduced rate that came with bottled water, in-room dining credit, in-room movie (like anyone watches TV while in Vegas?), and pre-paid resort fees.  I had high expectations that Vdara would live up to its glamorous marketing images and staying here would be a life-changing event.  

Highlights:
--rooms were generously sized with full-bath, kitchenette, dining room\/table.  I thought it was cute to have a door bell.
--staff was very friendly and hospitable.  And the check-in girls have the cutest business suits on
--workout room was stocked with towel and water (for those who like stocking up on free water and towels) and very clean
--easy to access tram

Lowlights:
--Hotel could have been in Anywhere, USA.  There was nothing distinct about it that made it feel like I was in Vegas.
--I felt like I was at a business hotel, as the check-in staff was wearing suits the whole time.  I get that the hotel is supposed to be professional, but suits?  Let's be a bit more creative, yes?
--So pricey for a basically boring hotel w\/out a casino and a small pool area.  
--You have to request a fork, spoon, knife, plates, cups which although easy, just seems like a hassle to wait for the housekeeping crew to bring a spoon to you  
--Pool was small.  Just one pool and about 20 rows of white recliner chairs.  $18\/day resort fee for something that was just dull.  The people at the Monte Carlo pool looked like they were having much more fun.
--Complicated curtain system that had an operating control on the other side of the room.  
--Lack of restaurants in the hotel.  Yes, I could have walked to Aria, but then I am on vacation and totally lazy.  I don't want to spend 20 minutes walking through another hotel\/casino to find a place to eat.  

I definitely won't be staying here again unless I get a rate for $50\/night.  The hotel was generic and incredibly boring.",0,1,0

Got a cabana at the pool and I must say, for the price of the cabana..it should include a bottle.  I had about 8 people total, the cabana itself was $200 that included an apple, an orange, 4 bottles of water, 1 kind bar, some chips, a safe, a tv, chassis lounge chairs, and a little couch.  When we got our final bill after buying some snacks and a bottle of grey goose($165 for the bottle). The bill was over $600!!! I was appalled. Ive had a cabana at the stratosphere for cheaper and it came with a bottle. I mean I understand location but thats a little ridiculous if you ask me. When we didn't have the cabana we had purchased a couple of pitchers which served 4(my hubby and i shared 2 pitchers and we didn't even catch a buzz) $44 each i think they were. If your gonna charge that much for drinks the least you could do is make them so you can actually catch a buzz\/get drunk.(I mean, why else do people drink alcohol?!) It was a nice hotel with good happy hour in the lounge downstairs but thats about it. We did order room service one time for dinner on my birthday and after we had told her how much we spent at the cabana she felt so bad that she actually hand delivered some chocolate covered strawberries to us at no charge. We thought that was super cool of her to do. Valet was extremely fast when it came to getting our car which was also another plus. The AC worked extremely well and kept our suite nice and cool the whole time.

There was also a half bath and full kitchen equipped with stainless appliances, full size fridge, mini dishwasher and stove top. There was also a washer\/dryer in the room.

Their pool was the shape of a half moon and by Hotel standards it was too small. The spa pool was pretty big for a spa pool( almost as big as the actually pool). There were two or three other pools that looked like lap pools but were considered private. I'm sure at the right price you could get your own lap pool. 

Some negatives there was mandatory valet unless you want to walk thru Aria. Also the valet was always too busy to pull our car and we always had to wait downstairs for them which I believe is another staffing issue. 
The only cafe in the hotel closes at 8pm and I found hair in the bath tub (Kind of gross, but I don't take baths in hotels, so it didn't bother me too much). 

This could be considered a minus point but not for us, there was no casino and this meant it was a smoke free property. ( Yeah for my Lungs!) The robes and slippers are complimentary but you have to ask for them and be prepared to wait 30 minutes. The room is very spacious and it is a king bed with a living room area and a dining room area. Plus you had two closets. The beds and pillows are very comfortable! I thought the shades provided enough coverage, the room wasn't pitch black but it's dark enough. They provided a fridge but you can only use one side the other side is full of stuff you have to pay for. There is a mini kitchen (with sinks, garbage disposal, microwave, and stove with 2 burners).

I just so happened to be the only single person on the trip and missed out on the Southwest Airlines package deal for the Bellagio. So my good friends super Internet savvy neighbor scoured the net and found the Vdara was opening the week of the race. One quick call to the reservation specialist and I had a fantastic suite for less than the Bellagio. 
First sight of the building from the strip and it gleams in the sun with it's curved walls of glass.

Giant LCD TV and windows shades for day or night lighting. But why close the shades it will only hide the sweet view of the strip and the Aria and new mall.

Driving in from OC to Vegas meant that by the time you see the hotels on the horizon you are DYING to get out of the car, into the room and on with the shenanigans! This was definitely the case this time around except here's how my story went.

First, try figuring out how to even get to the Vdara is going to confuse the hell out of you. Granted I didn't write down the street name before arrival, because like all Vegas strip hotels, you should be able to figure it out since its right in front of you. Well wrong story here! There's still a lot of construction going on, so when your coming up the Strip you need to make a left on Harmon. Well, its right next to Aria, but don't be fooled into thinking that the Aria will somehow take you into Vdara because it doesn't. Or if it did, I didn't figure it out...had to ask the valet at Aria how to get to Vdara (take Harmon!),

Get to the valet (I only valet'd as that seemed the only option) and into the lobby we went. We wait in line for about 15min and get greeted by the friendly front desk gal. She tells us rooms aren't ready...and that's when we look around and see quite a few people laying around the elevator\/lobby, which we assume they are waiting for rooms as well. Well this ain't good because I have reservations at Rosemary's Restaurant in an hour. The gal swiftly let us up into Spa Vdara to get ready for free, so I was a happy gal.

Spa Vdara is small and modern with all the spa amenities needed: shower, jacuzzi, sauna, steam room, vanity area, etc. Not bad for a free visit to the Spa in lieu of having a room ready (day rate for the spa itself is $25).

Went to Rosemary's and then came back at around 9pm to learn that they are comping the ""resort fee"" of $15 per day for our troubles and gave us a room facing the Bellagio fountains. Nice, I'll take it.

Here's where it got interesting: Get back to the room at 3:00am and I'm really looking forward to kicking off the heels and going to bed. I'm not in the room for more than a minute and the freakin' PA announcement goes off telling us to leave the room as fast as possible due to an emergency. Not willing to chance it, we walk down with the rest of the hotel guests down 37 flights of stairs!!! Lucky for us it was 37 flights and not 50something like some of the others!

An hour of hanging around the lobby and in a conference rooms leads to a conclusion that there was no emergency and that we can all go back to our room. GREAT...We get back to the room and they proceed to apologize for the inconvenience on the PA system a total of 9 times! Enough already, there were kids and babies that got whipped out of sleep and now you're going to wake them all up again!

Anyhow, morning comes and we head down to eat but guess what, there's only one restaurant (Silk Road), no coffee shop, no nothing...so we ate outside the hotel.

Overall, it was A-OK because its brand new so the rooms themselves are really nice, but its still a bit inconvenient. At least for right now, its seems that the hotel still has some quirks to fix out, like getting the rooms ready for the influx of guests checking in and making sure alarms don't go off to vacate the premises for no reason. But it would be nice to have more dining choices. Also, if you want any food or drinks (Bar Vdara was dead empty...) you're best going to Aria as it is the closest...

1.5 bathrooms, one king bed, a pullout sofa (which sucked -- better to sleep on the reg sofa -- more cushioning), and a kitchen which was perrrrfect for having pre drinking parties. 

Great service (friendly, prompt, and accomodating when we asked for 7 glasses and a whole case of water for the day after) and the hotel staff was super friendly about sneaking people in heehee... 

oh and the gym was pretty naice (though I have never before worked out while in Vegas so I really have no point of reference)

Things Against?
-No casino!! Although it may be a bonus that I couldn't gamble away all my $$
-the pool, while gorgeous, is a bit small and underwhelming
-the room was set up sort of weirdly -- so it felt small even though it was big
-the bathroom with the glass doors everywhere and open toilet -- be prepared to friendship to that next level w your friends

The lobby was comforting as it isnt as noisy as other hotels with casinos along with the smell of cigarettes  (which was a plus since I had my kid with me).

We stayed in a corner suite which was huge and floor to ceiling windows, gigantic flat screens, kitchen, jacuzzi tub, the whole 9 yards.  It was priced right and the air was super clean throughout the hotel.  This is a non-smoking, non-gaming hotel.

For gaming, restaurants and booze we went to the Aria which was about a 2 minute walk across the parking lot.  The sports book in the Aria is 5 stars all the way.  Drink tickets for every $50 bet so we never paid for a drink.  There is a sports bar connected to the book which is really nice as well.

Slight knock for the rest of the gaming at the Aria and the pool was shut down at the Vdara which sort of blew.  All in all we had a great time and will definately be back.",2,0,0

-proper concierge is a plus!

-have to walk through Cosmopolitan to get to Vdara most of the time (not really a Con per se ... but after having a bit too much of adult bevies, and swear you are done for the evenin' or mornin' and Cosmopolitan does have lounges with lovely drinks ... let's face it ...

Location: the location is great in my opinion as you are right on the strip with quick access to aria, Monte Carlo, bellagio and Caesars palace. Most of which you access without having to leave he comforts of air conditioning. 

Hotel: LOVE how this hotel is smoke free! Check in was quick and staff were helpful and friendly, We dealt with Kyle and he was really good about upgrading our rooms and quickly sent house keeping up with everything we needed for the kitchen which was awesome cause we were hungry! Checkout was quick staff was friendly. Concierge was helpful, house keeping was thorough and pretty quick. 

Rooms: LOVE the rooms. We upgraded to a corner suite with a view of the pool, and it was AH-mazing. First off the view was good as you looked out at aria which is a aesthetically pleasing and the pool was really pretty at night. The bathroom was big with great lighting for doing your makeup :-). The living room area was comfortable we watched get hard one night it was hilarious. The kitchen was great it had a full 4 person table, there was a full size fridge (and there was a smaller separate mini bar), a 4 top stove (no oven), a microwave and a small dishwasher. If you call house keeping they are happy to bring up a pot & pan, cutlery and dishes. Also beds super comfy maybe a touch too soft if that's even possible. Pillows were better than any hotel pillow I've had to use before. And I almost forgot I finished almost all my post trip laundry before we left as they have a both a washer and dryer for clothing.

Pool: pool was a decent size with plenty of lounge chairs and umbrellas. The highlight of the trip for the boys was throwing a mini football around the pool. It was fun that they were allowed to do this and they met a lot of cool people that joined in.

Gym: if you like cardio like me this is a perfect little space for you. If you like lifting weights mad require anything. Heavier than 50 lb dumbells and your own body weight then I suggest looking else where or paying to use Aria's gym or driving to Edge fitness on Rainbow. Vdara should really consider asking Aria to use their fitness facility for free on a case by case basis at a minimum as Vdara's gum really has nothing to offer in terms of weight training.

Overall: really loved the hotel and would love to go back if they were arrange something to allow guests to use Aria's gym for no extra charge. I also think that they should also allow cats to stay at the hotel as they are quieter than dogs and typically litter box trained.",0,0,0

We had a nice view on the north side overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Out room was clean and comfy. The day we arrived it was about 110 degrees outside. We noticed our room was a little warm at 76 degrees. We set the temperature to 70 degrees and left for a few hours. When we got back the room was still too warm and the temperature had not gone down. We called the front desk and asked them about it and they promptly sent a technician up to work sone magic. Whatever he did helped as the room cooled down a lot. I was pleased with the prompt and courteous response.

They also accept dogs (cat?) with restrictions (size etc.).  Each room is a suite from studio to penthouse (loft).  We have the ""Dog Suite"".  I guess they designate rooms that are dog friendly to both customers and dogs.  I will talk about this more later.

We had a short stay, 2 nights.  The connection to the tram  (between ARIA, Monte Carlo, Bellagio\/Vdara) and Bellagio is nice because Brian my husband prefers that hotel for breakfast anyway.  it's an option for a casino besides Aria (still higher minimums on the table but slots should be avail in all denominations (Penny and above).  Valet parking is another cost, option is to park in Aria (free if you have Pearl or above designation on your MLife rewards card).  i got to Pearl by gettng an MLife Credit Card.  I discovered this was only valid until the end of Sep 2017 (the bump on the MLife rewards - I only got the cc on end of July). Valet was not covered. I paid $25 a night.  Besides paying more for a Dog suite than a regular suite, I was charged $50 extra per night for my dog.  All this charges add up.  

In comparison, there is no charge for parking in Cosmopolitan, my room charge is normal cost plus the pet fee (which I know I am charged for in any hotel that accepts dogs). The only thing I received for staying in Vdara is quietness (I myself couldn't care less but the other person in the party prefers it and I don't mean the dog).

Vdara views were fine.  The room was decent, clean, and newish. I have seen great rooms (new Cosmopolitan), so so rooms (new Flamingo) and really bad (Rio\/Planet Hollywood). I do have to say that most of those other hotel stays were complimentary so I can't complain about the rooms too much.  I liked that I had a tub and a shower in the bathroom but to only provide one set of towels was a bit underestimation of your number of guests.  Housekeeping was able to provide more towels but for some reason I got two large towels and enormous amounts of face towels.

I would love to love Vdara but as the person paying the bills, I don't know if it's worth it when you wind up spending as much as you would in a nice room in Caesars Palace with my dog.  The only difference is the suite (there is an actual electric stove top) but the small fridge with it's broken door (mini bar broke in all sense of the word) also was a hassle for me.

So Suite Yes (Space was nice)  Costs No (Valet parking, dog fee etc.)  

You shouldn't have to ask for more towels (after turndown for the first night, we did get a set of two large towels and two towel mats - less face towels).",3,2,2

Based on all the yelp reviews, I had high expectations. As soon as I entered the hotel room, I felt I was on a business trip. Although I'm not a smoker nor do I gamble really, coming to Vegas to experience a ""normal"" hotel was not my expectation. Every dark wood ""modern"", ""luxury"", ""sophisticated"" detail did not put in the mindset of vacation nor Vegas, but in the mind of sleep and work. If it weren't for the large windows to remind me it was Vegas, I may have worked the whole vacation.

It's clean and the staff were all nice. The rooms are rather small and dark (I said it twice now) unlike the other ""luxury hotels"" I've visited in Vegas. The kitchenette was ok. The microwave would have come in handy if my left overs didn't spoil in the mini fridge that doesn't get cold enough to chill water. 

The staff was really nice and though I paid for the patio daybed so my daughter and I could fully enjoy the pool without direct sun torch, the pool was small and just ok. 

All Vegas strip hotels seem to have a resort fee, for Vdara I'm still not sure what the fee covered. Maybe includes
 - Access to the small pool where there's a fee for padded seating. 
 - Or maybe it's the 2 burner kitchenette that didn't include any utensils, pans etc. (available upon request for another small fee?)
 - Maybe...the two mini waters
- Free version of the really slow Wifi
Basically I have no idea why the daily fee of 30+ dollars.

PROS -
*Comfortable bed
*Clean
*Pool and Bar food great
*Large Windows

CONS - 
*Small bathroom
*Fairly small room
*Dark furniture 
*No shuttle to anywhere
*Small pool
*Limited necessities (snacks, meds etc.) in the Vdara Market Café

Overall, my 5 day vacation was fine. In comparison to Wynn, Encore, Bellagio or even Caesar""s Palace, I think the hotel experience does not equal the rate for the room. This would be a great boutique hotel for long term rentals, business trips etc. Not really ideal for family vacation or the grandiose feel we normally get when we're on the Vegas strip. I'm not sure if I'd return at the same rate again.",1,0,0

The first thing I noticed when arriving at the Hotel is the fresh smell of roses in the air.  It was wuite refreshing compared to being in the casino hotels where your are breathing in smoke.  The people at the front counter were really nice and informative.  We had asked for directions to a few different places and they gave us the quickest route to take.  There are no casino area so don't expect to do any gambling at the Vdara, but you can just hop on the tram and go right next door to the Aria and gamble away.  I like that it has no casino area because I can sleep at night without having to hear the slot machines going off from my room.  Plus the hotel is not crowded compared to a hotel with a casino.

I stayed in a deluxe room on the 45th floor and it was more spacious than I thought, especially the restroom.  The room was decorated in a modern style.  There was a kitchen area for the people that like to cook their own food or warm up the left overs from last nights dinner.  There are shades located on the glass windows that you can open and close.  A 40 inch LCD TV (with HD channels) mounted on the wall and it displays your name on screen to welcome you.  You can also use the TV to check out.  How cool is that !?!  There were plenty of towels \/ robes located in the restroom.  The bed had plenty of pillows and was comfortable to sleep in.  

The accommodations: You will have access to the pool and gym area.  The local news paper will be delivered to your front door every morning.  Free internet included with your stay.  Maid service is amazing.  We had stuff all over the place and the maid service cleaned up the entire room.  Organized our belongings and provided up with fresh towels.  It was outstanding.  This is coming from a guy that normally does not want maid service when staying in a hotel.

The location of the Hotel is good and bad.  In a good way its located in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip and you have access to anything on the strip within walking distance.  You just have to take the tram to Bellagio or Aria and make your way on the strip.  The bad is it is located in the middle of the strip and traffic is quite a pain on Las Vegas Blvd.  Always busy and congested.  

One last small thing that bothers me about the hotel is they don't provide plates, silverware, pans, or any other kitchen items even though they provide you with a kitchen.  Other than that, everything about the hotel was close to being perfect.

In conclusion, it was a great stay for me and my gf.  A clean, comfortable, quiet place to stay at.  A great hotel with outstanding customer service \/ accommodations.  What more can you ask for.  Highly recommended.  You won't regret it.",2,0,2

I liked the fact that it is smaller and quieter, but still within very close walking distance to the larger hotels. The bridge is great to get to Bellagio with very minimal time spent outside (108 degs!), and we went all the way to Caesars through the mall. Genius idea to connect everything.

The deluxe suite was decently spacious for 4 people. I luckily got to sleep in the bed, which was luxurious enough (not too squishy, firm enough for back support, soft and cozy). The friends who slept on the pull out sofa said the mattress was super squishy, and they probably had aches after the weekend. We had to call for many items: sheets and blankets for the pull out bed, more bath towels, hot water kettle (which they didn't have, gave us a pot instead), and more toilet paper. The house cleaning light is a smart idea, and we turned it on after a couple of days after our room became more... lived in. We had the a\/c on at 72 but it was still freezing. If we turned it off, it became stuffy and unbearable.

The bathroom had spacious counter space, and actual square footage inside where we could all stand in there to brush our teeth at the same time (we have a cute selfie LOL). No complaints about the shower, and I wish I had some bubble bath or salts to use in the soaking tub! We only used it to soak our trashed feet after the clubs ;)

We grabbed a quick dinner to go from the downstairs Market Cafe one night, and our chicken sandwich and fries took 30 minutes to come out. Their take out presentation was very nice though, but seriously, it wasn't even busy. Another day, we chilled at the pool for a few hours, and the food there is the same in the Market Cafe. Pricey but not unexpected, just meh. The pool is a bit small, and the water warm and murky.

Overall, the rooms are nice. It's nice to go home to quiet after a night out.",4,3,3

It was a little difficult to find at first as my navigation directed us to the Bellagio, and then once you pull up the hotel entrance, there are loops and turns everywhere. So it was a tad overwhelming, especially since we were towing a trailer through everything. The valet were very accommodating and helped us get our load settled in the Vdara oversized lot, which not all hotels have so that was awesome! The hotel lobby is beautiful, and the decor is hip and luxurious. We were on the 30th floor and had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains and the bustling city, and our king bed was so comfortable! We had just traveled 7+ hours with a 1 year old and it was a long day, so we decided to stay in and order room service and a movie. The room service was so expensive, even for Vegas, and they charge $4.95 per person to deliver it plus tax and tip. But the food was amazing-best creme brûlée we've ever had-and the portions were big. Pay per view movies are $11.99 which is expensive but actually cheaper than one of the last hotels we stayed at in Disneyland, so we splurged and ordered one. We slept great and it was so quiet, only once did I hear people outside the door. The blackout shades didn't quite blackout the morning light, but I couldn't wait to open them again and see that view! We had a wonderful stay here and will definitely return for weekend getaways in the future. I think they take pets too, if that's your thing.",1,0,0

So when i was looking for a hotel to stay at to celebrate my birthday i thought to myself i wanted to splurge a bit and treat myself to a hotel ive wanted to stay at. The choice was between cosmo, aria and vdara. I chose Vdara but i feel I shouldve chosen something else. 

 So we got in at 1 on march 11th day of my birthday and we get our room keys and the room we will be staying in. So we made our way up dropped our bags off and left to go shopping before we had to get ready for our night. Fast forward to 5pm when we are back at our hotel and i am just getting out of the shower, threw on a tank dress and someone just WALKS right in to our room! Shocked i asked Excuse me in a upset and shocked tone to which without even apologizing for walking in asks me in a very rude and demanding tone what i was doing in the room. I then told her this was my room and to please leave. Startled i walked back in to the bedroom area and then the room phone goes off and its front desk. Again without apologizing i am asked in a demanding tone what i was doing in the room. I then at this point heated answer that i was checked into this room at 1pm and that if they were accusing me of waltzing up here and coming in here on my own withought checking in this was bs. He then finally apologized n hung up. This was 1 of the 4 calls i got. It was then followed by a 2nd call asking how many room keys i had and who checked me in. 3rd call i was asked how i got the room and what time. 4th call i was pissed at this point but what lead after set me off, he then demanded at this very moment i come down with my card because they apparently didnt have my card on file when there was clearly already a charge hold on my card from that afteroon. I then responded that i was not able to come down because i was not dressed and that it would take me a moment to which he then was still in a VERY rude demanding tone tells me YOU NEED TO COME RIGHT NOW. Pissed and irritated i told him that i will be down when i am down and that he will just have to wait until i am ready and i hung up. When i get down i speak to a female and let her know of everything they have put me through in a 4 hrs span. She was polite and credited me $75 in hotel credits and tells me she will be charging my card the full amount of 427. So fast forward to 4am when im coming back from the club celebrating my birthday me and my girl are tired and obviously intoxicted a bit and all we wanted to do is sleep. Well that was not going to happen. We get back and we tap our card and they've locked us out of our room! Furious at this point i make my way down i go to front desk and im telling her about everything AGAIN eveything that the hotel has put me through  and the fact that im literally staying 1 night in this hotel and that this is total fucking bullshit!! Finally we get our room and things back and get to finally sleep. Im the morning we check out and when asked how the stay was i honestly answered with ""the worst hotel ive stayed at in vegas by far"" 

So here i am now 3 days after sunday and i check my bank statement and they charged me 200 extra on my bill. Took me 20 minutes to get someone on the phone to talk to someone about it. 

Its clear to say i am never going to stay at vdara again. I wish i could give them 0 stars but the 1 will do i guess but even that it is not deserved. Honestly not even a 24 hour stay and this shit. Oh and did i mention none of our televisions even worked~ Great Job Guys!",2,1,1

We were so looking forward to the stay after looking at the website and loved that each room had a kitchen and that the resort had no casino.  In the past we've stayed at other nice resort\/hotels in Vegas that had similar set up without the casino and check-in was always so much faster and easier. Vdara disappointed us from the get go. First the entrance to the hotel is difficult to find even on the strip. The signs are tiny, the road takes you in loops and is overall a BIG headache. Most hotels on the strip have a back entrance, not this one. The only way in is from the Strip. That sucks considering the traffic on the strip is horrible. It can take you 15 minutes to go one block! Upon finally getting to the hotel, the only way to park is w\/valet. No self parking? Come on! Sometimes I don't feel like tipping everybody 10 times a day! But Vdara says that's what the resort fee is for. Yeah, right. So the check-in counter was a pain in the ass. 3 long ass lines.  Why don't they get smart and make one line for all of us to stand in. That way we can go to the first available person? 

On to the room. The furnishings are nice and modern. But there were some major issues with the room. 1) No pots, pans, cups, utensils, etc. in the kitchen. Completely bare when you open the cupboards. You have to call housekeeping to bring each and every stinking thing you want up and that takes them at least 30-45 minutes. Such an inconvenience, when I wanted a cup of tea like an hour ago! They don't even give you a coffee maker. Also, the refrigerator is the size of a medicine cabinet. I kid you not. Go ahead and try to fit a few things, and you will see how ridiculously small this is. 2) Bathroom door was one of those sliding doors. Ours was already broken and the lock didn't even work b\/c it wouldn't slide all the way closed. 3) The blackout shades are broken into 3 sections and each section has a 2 inch gap in between that lets in all the bright sun in the morning. Forget about sleeping in past 6am, unless you put a pillow over your head. 4) No robes in the room. You have to call housekeeping to bring it up and that takes 40 minutes. Again, a pain when you wanted to use it a 40 min ago and are now waiting to take a shower b\/c the robes haven't arrived. 

So one morning since there is no coffee maker, my husband goes down to the only cafe in the whole hotel to grab a cup of coffee. The line was about 15 people long and he asked the cashier if he can just order a cup. She tells him no, and he has to wait in the big a$$ line. Another person asks, same answer.. wait in the big a$$ line. So a third person asks and the person says OK. WTH? By the time my husband gets to the front of the line he tells the guy they should be consistent or have a line just for coffee.  The guy rolls his eyes and shrugs with a look like ""I don't give an F!"" So my husband goes to the front desk to see if they have a comment card he can write on. They tell him ""No, we don't have one. You can fill out an online survey that we will email you."" Husband tells front desk, I have my comment fresh in my mind and want to write it down now. Front desk tells him ""Go write it on the room stationary.""  Husband is pissed, but goes up to the room and finds there is no room stationary. Only the little 4x6 notepad. So my husband writes his complaint on the little notepad and said he expects a call or email from their manager. Husband turns the card in to the front desk. Over a week later, we still have not received any response from Vdara. This place just sucks and they don't care about the customer at all.  Vegas is a hospitality town. We had great customer service everywhere but here and we go to Vegas at least 3 times a year.  Go somewhere else until Vdara improves their customer service. Trust me. These little things add up to a frustrating stay anywhere. We will not be returning. Vdara, you lost our business.",6,1,2

The photos online make the Vdara look modern in what seemed like a cold way, but the rooms and lobby were surprisingly inviting. Also, the tub was magical! It was the msot comfortable tub I have ever been in. We had a room pretty high up, and we had a very nice view of the Bellagio fountains, which was so romantic and lovely. While the rooms were not as large and impressive as, say, those of the Venetian, I would rather stay in the Vdara.

Note: Don't let Google Maps fool you. It's not as far off the Strip as it looks. There is a covered walkway that connects the Vdara to the Bellagio; it takes maybe two minutes at most to get from one to the other. The Vdara's location was extremely convenient as it is located basically in the middle of the Strip.

I would definitely stay here again. In fact, I'm rather hesitant to try new properties because I like the Vdara so much.",1,1,2

Staying in their suites means you get to stay inside one of the rooms they originally intended to sell as a condo, you can tell by the washer and dryer. Therefore, if you're gonna stay in Vegas for more than four days for a convention or what not, definitely try and get one of these Vdara suites. 

The rooms are fairly dark; you can see they're going after a very modern feel just as with the casinos and lobbies of Aria. 

Our suite was pretty damned big; a bedroom with one king bed, a living room with a plasma and roll away couch, its own kitchen, and a larger than normal bathroom with a tub, stand up shower, two sinks, and a powder room counter. 

We landed our suite at 180 a night, thanks to Priceline. It's one heck of a bargain, and I think you can consistently land this hotel on that site, as well!",3,1,1

Lots of cool touches
-doorbells on the rooms (nice to not have to hear people knocking at doors down the hall).
-button inside the room for Do Not Disturb and Housekeeping that changes the color of the light around the doorbell to alert the housekeeping staff
-Market Cafe has good food, although they're pretty slow.
-Master light switch that cuts off all lights in the room
-Automatic shades
-two free 12 oz water bottles left in the room each day by housekeeping.  
-housekeeping exceeded expectations with lots of nice little touches (like putting my dirty laundry in a laundry bag).  
-overall, the rooms are very nice aesthetically - but I'm more of a functional guy, so this doesn't carry a whole lot of weight with me beyond that it's clean and has a good TV.  

Things I didn't like:
-The alarm clock is idiotically designed. Any alarm clock that you can look at for more than 3 seconds and not know how to set the alarm is poorly designed.
-The bed is a bit hard for my taste
-There was a pair of dirty tighty whities sitting on the shelf in the closet when I arrived. Seriously. Although I guess this was good for a few laughs, which is  a positive!
-The shampoo\/body wash they provide is in a square bottle, and you can't really squeeze them out. Really, really stupid design.
-uber-cheap towels - felt like sand paper. This is just unacceptable for a place trying to be high end.  More like an EconoLodge.
-Similarly, really cheap toilet paper.  Hey, little things like this are important!  =)
-Drinks at the bar are absurdly expensive (typical for the high end places in Vegas).  $11 for a Jack and Coke.  
-Electrical outlets weren't very well placed - this is inexcusable for a new hotel.  There was no outlet were I could plug in my phone and leave it within reach of the bed, and finding an outlet accessible for the iron was impossible without moving stuff around.

I called ahead of time to see if they could give me an upgrade for my anniversary but they said due to the 4th of july weekend I had to wait until check in to see if there was availability.

So we check in July 3rd and as soon as we get to the room to my surprise they upgraded my room to a bigger suite. I was so happy.

Later that night they delivered a card and chocolates to our room for our anniversary. I travel to vegas a lot and never stayed at vdara but it is by far the best hotel Ive stayed at thus far.

City Center is the new hotspot in Vegas with all the popular restaurants, clubs, hotels all located in one area. While the Aria and Cosmopolitan are nice, I feel like they are overpriced for what you get. 

Vdara has plenty of suite options that are very reasonably priced. I stayed in the 1600+ sq foot hospitality suite and was pretty impressed. With 2 bedrooms and 2.5 baths, a full kitchen and every amenity you can imagine, its a great suite.

I like hotels in Vegas that don't have a large casino you have walk through just to get to your car, a restaurant, the lobby, the strip, etc.   It is nice to go straight to your room.  Clean upscale and simple.

However, the reason I couldn't do five (5) stars is the parking and resort fee scam that Vegas is now implemented on its costumers.  

There is no self parking, only Valet.  To get your car or items you have to wait for the Valet  to retrieve your car.  Very hard to get your stuff in and out of the hotel.  Plus the parking is separate from the ""resort fee"".  

The resort fee at some of the strip hotels makes sense, includes the parking, the wifi, the pools, concierge, common plants, flowers, etc.   

However, the Vdara is a simple hotel, with minimal pool and facilities, yet they have an expensive resort fee.

The rooms are nice modern style.  They have a mini bar, safe, closets, windows with drapes that have electronic up and down.  Each room has a large bed and a separate couch bed with a television wall that has minimal privacy. 

To get to the strip you can walk through the Bellagio Casino or take the ramp.   I would definitely stay here again!",3,0,0

Granted, I got two free nights free from myvegas (just paid the resort fee), but I did still pay for Saturday night, which was a couple hundred dollars - wanted to fly in Saturday, and didn't feel like fiddling with having to stay somewhere else the first night, so I just ate the cost. Arguably worth it, which is something I don't generally say about hotels that pricey.

I was impressed with a number of things staying here: the staff was super friendly, checkin and checkout were super fast and painless, even the cheapest room was still enormous (featuring both a couch and a full desk, a king-sized bed, a giant bathtub *and* a shower, and a dining room area we never used, but still), it was classy as *frack*, with nice art all over, both in the room and around the hotel, there were zero issues with the wifi, and of course, it's hard to beat the location (right off the strip, so it's not full of loud drunk people or smokers, but *right* off the strip, so you can walk out of the hotel and be on the strip in maybe 5 minutes. A bit hard to figure out *how* at first, but it is possible - you walk out, to the left, down some stairs, and in through the Cosmopolitan parking lot, or across and through Aria, depending which way you're going.) 

I even felt entirely like, apart from the ubiquitous resort fee (just part of the cost of Vegas hotels at this point), they weren't trying to nickel and dime you, which is highly refreshing for hotels at this price point - base internet supported unlimited devices and was entirely fast enough, they gave you free bottled water, and there was a proper-sized complimentary fridge for your use that you didn't have to sneak stuff into around the stupid expensive crap in the minibar. Alright, so the tablet they put in your room instead of a booklet to tell you about the hotel, wakes up in the morning and asks if you want room service (no thanks), but it isn't *annoying* about it, so I'll let that slide. And yes, they do charge for parking now, though it's comped if you get their credit card, which, if I were in Vegas by car often, I'd probably just get the stupid credit card, but whatever. Not that many other major cities have ever had a culture of free parking in hotels, so I can't fault them too much for that either.)

It wasn't totally perfect, though. Most notably, while the bathroom door being frosted glass instead of wood looked super modern, it was a *terrible* design choice from a usability perspective - that frosted glass is pretty much the same frosted glass they use around lights, i.e. you turn the bathroom light on, and it illuminates the whole bed area, which is *not* so great if your other half is trying to sleep. Speaking of, the blackout curtains they used had gaps in between, so they totally did not function as proper blackout curtains, which was kind of lame. 

And I did not feel remotely like I got what I paid for with the small upgrade (was about ten bucks) to get a ""view of the Bellagio fountain"" room - I could technically see it, but on the 15th floor, I would call that view ""obstructed"". I expected it to be pretty far away, but I didn't expect it to be about 2\/3s blocked by the back of Cosmopolitan, so that was kinda lame. So yeah, I'd say, if you're thinking about spending a couple hundred bucks a night in Vegas, you could do a lot worse than to stay here, and probably not that much better, but... don't bother with the view upgrade, if my room is anything like normal, view-wise.",1,1,1

Service was just alright. Booked the night before and thought we had gotten a great deal. Best rates are found if you are an M Life member. It's worth joining. What they DON'T disclose, is that your closing bill just may be practically double the cost of the room by the time you check out.

Housekeeping came up within 15 minutes of the request that was made for shower caps (FYI, they don't have these in the bathroom so you have to request it). I asked for complimentary water and she came back with 5 of them instead of just one...nice touch.

Valet was a bit busy but I am blaming it on the holiday and it took about 15-20 minutes to retrieve our car.

The number one reason is that it is a non-smoking hotel with no casino.  We hate cigarette smoke, and we don't gamble, so this is PERFECT for us.  The air inside was as fresh as a Sound of Music mountainside (picture me doing a ""hills are alive"" twirl with a huge smile plastered on my face).  Whenever we came in through the front doors, we would be greeted by a faint, fresh, fruity\/floral scent that would envelop our olfactory senses.  It was a subtle, natural (not chemically-laden) scent, very pleasant and welcoming indeed.  Yes, 100% FRESH AIR inside a Vegas hotel.  Who would have thought this was ever possible back in the day?!

Number two:  We love how there is a kitchen in each suite.  We wholeheartedly made use of ours.  Make sure you call down as soon as possible for your pots and pans, plates, bowls, and cutlery.  We got lots of food from our favorite Indian restaurant off the strip (see my review for Gandhi Cuisine) and we stored it in our little refrigerator, and had perfectly-made meals in our room whenever we wanted!  Again, perfect for us because we don't care for buffets and the typical Americana fare that dominates the strip.

Number three:  The sleek, modern design with dark chocolate wood accents were just in line with our tastes and sensibilities.  We love and appreciate modern design.  And we loved the faux room separation.  It felt like two separate rooms--a lounging area with a desk and television, and a bedroom with the bathroom entrance and television as well.  Our view was very nice, too, of the Bellagio fountains and some of the strip, with the High Roller in the distance.  If we had upgraded, we would have had an even better view, but I was very happy with our view.  We also had no problems with the staff.  Everyone was friendly and courteous.

Overall, a five star experience during our ten year wedding anniversary!  Thank you, Vdara!",3,1,1

What this place lacks is service but what they lack in service, they make up for with attitude. I swear out of the 3 times I have called or have been in contact with them there has been a feisty attitude-filled woman on the phone or a worker who sounds like they are half asleep. I was trying to plan a hotel stay for my parents with the works and trying to get everything together. I planned on booking a penthouse for them, called them and was basically just about to book it until I was met with the third wave of horrible service. The last time I called them the woman on the phone was moody and sounded like she was half sleeping. She couldn't wait to hang up the phone. If this was any indication of what was next to come for my trip, I did not want to take any part in it. The funny thing is, there is no casino, no clubs, basically a non-vegas casino and I would think that would make their service and hotel even more focused in that area. 

But even after all of this, I still would think that the customer service department would be good at customer service and sending me a personal sorry email. Nope, thanks for the automated email. It shows me the care and customer satisfaction that you guys heavily tout, or actually lack thereof.

Here are the perks of Vdara: 

-Vdara signature scent. Okay I totally made that up, but in all seriousness, the second you walk into Vdara, you are enveloped with this light but assertive aroma. It's like walking into Abercrombie...but much more pleasant, less intoxicating, and not at all juvenile. Something you can live with and potentially be addicted to. Is it a drug? Wouldn't be surprised. A spray of some sort? Maybe. Either way, I love it I love it I love it. 

-Technology. Maybe I'm completely behind the times, but I was rather impressed with automatic shades, one switch turning off all lights, not one but two flat screen TV's, and convenient TV check-out. Felt like an episode of Real World: Las Vegas. Wait, that's still on MTV, right, or does that totally date me? 

-Bathtub. Like a scene out of a movie when the female protagonists are soaking in a luxe tub after a long day, Vdara's bathtub is a totally deep, elegantly pristine, white resin bathtub. Looked amazing, too bad I didn't get to try it out. 

-Spacious. Vdara is under Aria management; sitting right adjacent to the Aria hotel, Vdara houses the suites and kitchenettes, as opposed to regular hotel rooms at the Aria.  We got a kitchenette suite with a queen bed for four girls. Pretty sure we could have fit at least 15 girls in there. Not questionable or illegal at all. What I mean to say is that it was insanely spacious for a suite with just one bed. Wow. 

-Sanctuary. Vdara is smoke-free, casino-free, restaurant-free, and essentially crazy-free, so if you're looking for a quiet getaway amidst the raging craziness that is Vegas, stay here. I highly suggest it. With just a 1-2 minute walk to Aria, you can get your dose of pools, buffets, nightclubs, and casinos AND retreat to your quiet abode after a crazy night. 

-Free WIFI. But I must note that the WIFI does feel incredibly laggy and slow. But I am all for free WIFI, and some WIFI is still better than no WIFI, so can't really complain. 

Notes: 
-Go through HotWire, unless you're up to pay upwards to $400-600+ per night for a room. 
-Resort fees are pretty pricey here at $50 a night. No going around this though.
-Valet for hotel guests is free. Just make sure to give your driver a few bucks tip.",9,3,3

I used to primarily stay at Venetian\/Palazzo, but I like Vdara a little more.  With all of the new luxury hotels in Vegas, I feel like there is no reason to stay in a standard sized room. The suites at Vdara are very well appointed and give you a nice sized sofa bed (in case you need to sleep a couple extra freeloaders or kids), a nice kitchenette with a microwave, stove, and usable minifridge, a dining area, and two large TVs. Get a high floor with Bellagio fountain views and you will not be disappointed. The $20 trick worked to get us on the 53rd floor with fountain views  My wife was stoked about the Aveda bath products. If you like bathtubs, there is a nice deep soaking tub. 

Obviously, there are certain things that you have to expect in order to not be disappointed. There is No Casino.  You are about 5 mins from Aria, Bellagio, and Cosmopolitan. I actually think not having a casino was nice, since there was no annoying slot machines, smoke odor, or a half-mile walk to your room. There is also no real restaurant on the property. However, there is a market in the lobby where you can get coffee, wine, cheese, etc. They also serve basic breakfast and lunch options.  You are however within a 5 min walk to about 30 restaurants between Aria, Crystals Mall, Cosmopolitan, and Bellagio.  Room service is also available. The pool area is small, but big enough for the size of the hotel. 

People complain about the location being far from the strip. However, I thought it was super convenient especially if you want to spend time at Aria, Bellagio, or Cosmopolitan. There is also a tram that can take you to the Crystals Mall or Monte Carlo in about 5 mins. 

Service was overall very good. The pool bartender was a little scattered, but the drinks were strong and tasty.  Overall, I would stay at Vdara again in a heart beat.  I think the value is great too, compared to other similarly priced resorts. Got a great deal on priceline.",1,0,0

One girl booked and paid for room so this is my side of the experience. We checked in at about 2 pm, got an 8th floor panoramic suite room since it was ready and we didn't want to wait for the 14th floor suite room but my friend was told we'd be put on the call list the next day to be moved to 14th floor. So we were happy with that and check in was quick. Our first room was nice and stocked and it was great to have a fridge. Second day my friend got a call about no higher room being available but that's not what we were expecting. 
We did end up getting a 25th room floor which was a lot quieter and better view but this room was poorly stocked with few towels and no glasses for water. The washer had stale water in it which I found out by tossing my laundry in to wash. And the dryer took hours to dry which maintenance said was typical of the dryers there. Both our rooms had a king bed and pull out queen sofa bed. The sofa was awkward and not comfortable and the sofa bed which we all rotated on was pokey and not fun to sleep on. 
It's in a poor location and getting to the strip is kinda a pain. You can either go through the Cosmo parking garage and casino or through the walkway to Bellagio or through Aria crystal shops or tram to Monte Carlo or risk your life and walk down Harmon St. 
Overall the positives were: No casino with no smoke!!, modern rooms with suite option and kitchen, comfortable king bed, room service was quick and delicious!, key card check at elevators for security, Starbucks and cafe!

This place is nothing more than a condo building that failed to sell so they turned it into a hotel to generate revenue. This place might appeal to families and people who like a little less hustle and bustle but if you came to Vagas to have a good time there are much better ""5 star"" hotels.

Plus

1. Rooms are spacious and modern. 
2. Huge bathtub was good for soaking
3 Free valet parking

Minus

1. Its off the strip. You have to walk a good 10-15 minutes to get there
2. No casino
3. There is an amenity fee but there ironic thing is there are no amenities!!! The pool is tiny (and I mean really tiny), ditto the gym. There is one overpriced restaurant and a Starbucks in the lobby and thats it! You get more amenities at Circus Circus (which costs $50 a night). 
4. All the rooms have a microwave and a stove but no coffee pot. Seriously. Who comes to vegas to cook on a stove. Space could have been much better utilized. Only thing I want in a hotel is the ability to make a cup of coffee when I want it. Not here
5. Front desk is small and gets backed up at busy times. Expect to wait in line.
6. Hotel does not have a capable 24 hour cleaning service. If you arrive at the Venetian at 7am they will find you a room. Not here. You have to keep to regular hotel check in and out hours. This is completely out of line from all the other hotels on the strip that are used to the 24 hour nature of this city. We arrived at 9am and made to wait to check in until 11am. Front desk let it be known that they were inconvenienced by the early checkin.
7. The doors to the hotel are not very well designed. There are no automatic doors. A minor inconvenience as you are coming and going but a serious pain when you are arriving with luggage. There are no bell hops and so it just made check in and check out feel like a root canal.
8. Master switch was a royal pain. None of the lights would turn on unless this was turned on. Cleaner would turn it off on a daily basis and it just rubbed us up the wrong way.
9. Security guard nazis will not allow you into the elevator without a room key. Seriously, is this Sprint Break at Panama City?
10. AC unit in our room had a hard time getting below 68. I like to sleep in cold temperatures.

The only saving grace about this supposed 5 star hotel is that we used Priceline ($125 per night on a summer weekend) and we didn't pay full price. I was expecting much more but in the end we got what we paid for. I would have been livid had we paid full price.",7,3,2

Loved having a corner suite (811 sq ft) 
however, it would have been better to have a higher floor than the 8th
our view was the Bellagio Pool and the Tram which was a bit noisy at night\/early morning hours. 

Full kitchen and washer\/dryer was a plus. The bed was super comfy besides the pillows.
I wanted to take home the comforter! 

I would have liked the toilet area to have a door so my friend doesn't have to view me while she does her hair or maybe she wanted to? 

The Valet was fast and nice, the bellman was super friendly and helped set up our media output. 

The check in clerk needed a personality and he seemed like he hated his job, he quoted us a $100.00 deposit and ended up charging us a $200 deposit! Thankfully we got reimbursed quickly. 

I walked to the Aria and checked it out, the employees there were so nice and I liked that it had shops, restaurants etc... I think I might stay there in the future, it's also closer to PH and the strip. 

Valet only but you can park at the Aria or Bellagio and walk it. 

Overall this place is solid for it's rooms but their security deposit is ridicules!

The Vdara is only 4 years old.",3,3,3

It was a 3 minute walk to one end of the bellagio, and across the way from the Aria hotel. It is centrally located which I loved and we were able to walk to many places with the stroller. 

The pool was not huge and I found it to be very relaxing, which was perfect for me and my kids. The food at the Market Cafe in the lobby was delicious and kid friendly. The rooms have a kitchen which is also great if you have kids and don't want to always take them out to eat.

She said it would be more convenient since the event I was attending was located in Aria. Vdara is ""set-up"" the same as the MGM Signature Suites (kitchen, microwave, fridge, sink etc) and included parking for Pearl M-Life status. We splurged a little and reserved the 1-King bed Fountain View room. Later on we learned that parking was Valet only unless you are of Gold M-Life status. Self - park is located in Aria self-parking lot. All in all, the room delivered what it promised, king bed, kitchen, good sized bathroom and we had a very comfortable stay. Below outlines pros\/cons, tips for future guests and suggestions for hotel staff. It will explain my 3-star rating. 
1) We stayed in room 37-026. It had perfect view of the fountain like promised for the Fountain View room rate

2) The room has lots of storage space- drawers, closet, even a closet in the bathroom itself.
There are 2 TV's in the room located on each side of the ""dividing wall"" between the bed and the living room area. You can technically have both on at the same time but you might want to have the same channel on both TV otherwise you can hear both the TVs at the same time. 

3) If you love sleeping in a completely blacked-out room when staying in a hotel, the Vdara room is equipped with about 4 panels of shades that open and close together. You don't have the option to open it ""partially."" Since there are multiple panels, when you have them all down in the evening, light still comes through between the panels so the room isn't entirely blacked-out.  Also, they have an Ipad type notebook at the bedside table. With the screen always on, it gave out a lot of light at night! We finally had to take it off the base and leave it face down at night.(I took   1\/2  star off because of these 2 things I woke up earlier than I wanted to everyday!)

4) Hotel housekeeping is a little rude. We requested kitchen amenities (plates\/cups) and our housekeeper forgot cups and insisted we didn't ask. At the same time she was talking to someone else on the phone on speaker while in my room assisting me. She said she would be back with cups and she did return, except she let herself in the room without knocking and by that time, I had taken some of my clothes off. She walks in and helps herself to setting up the kitchen while I stood there half-dressed (1 star off!)

5) The stand--up shower is a little to ""cramped"" especially if you are short, the water comes out of the shower head where I had to stand up against the class to hit it. The shower head didn't adjust enough to allow it to spray away from the glass wall.

6) If you end up with a room with an ""under the counter"" fridge beware- it's a small mini-fridge that barely fits a bottle of wine without it taking up all the space. (The under-counter sink in the MGM-Signature is just dorm-size so we weren't prepared that we couldn't even fit a regular size to-go box in the Vdara mini-fridge!)

7) If you choose to self-park, don't listen to the front desk tell you that ""it's not that far!"" It might not be that far but if you value your time in Vegas- pick your poison. We chose to pay for Valet after the first night. From Vdara, walk to the Bellagio tram (From your room walking down the hall, waiting for elevator, walking through the connecting walkway to Bellagio, waiting for Tram that arrives every 5-7 minutes, making 2 stops on the tram, walking off the tram and a few turns to the self-park, paying for self park ticket- 20-30 minutes later you are finally in your car and waiting to exit the parking garage!"" (1\/2  star removed!)

8) The hotel pool is small but well equipped. The staff even helped us and set us up in lounge chairs. Nice touch.

9)Hotel gym is quite small. A lot of treadmills, one weight rack and a couple cable machines.
There is a Starbucks at the lobby and a small café that serves breakfast type items. Both stores are overpriced. There is also a bar area. 

10) The walk to Aria is very close! Just go out the front lobby and walk around the valet round-about area and you enter right on the Aria casino floor area. 

11) To get to Bellagio, you take a walkway connected in the hotel lobby area (next to Starbucks). The walk is about 5 minutes and goes through the Bellagio convention center and landing you in their lobby area eventually depending on which turn you decide to take. 

12) To get to Cosmopolitan from the lobby, exit and take an elevator (next to Starbucks) down to Harmon Ave. Cross over to the Cosmopolitan side and walk into their parking garage area which lands you on the casino floor. About a 5 minute walk.

13) Vdara does have a great location. It gets you exposed to all the other hotels within walking distance. We also walked over to Mandarin Hotel, Paris Hotel, Planet Hollywood etc and it all took under 10 mins depending how fast you walk.",2,0,0

I stayed here once in 2013 and again in 2016. It is on the strip but slightly tucked away where car and foot traffic is manageable, almost minimal. The main selling point for me is the fact that Vdara is a non-smoking, non-gambling facility, unlike many of the other hotels on the strip, thus making life tolerable for allergy\/sensitive-smell sufferers. Since there aren't machines ringing at all hours, it is a relatively quite place. If one wanted to gamble\/party\/drink all night, the Cosmopolitan is literally a 5-minute walk away and Aria even less...at 2 minutes! HA.

The hotel does offer a lot of amenities. The have valet parking, bell services, a cafe and bar on the first floor. I believe the second floor holds the gym, spa, and pool. The pool is essentially roof-top and secluded from the road, although easily viewed from the surrounding hotels.

The hotel is very modern and chic. The lobby does not have have a huge, ""grand"" entrance area, but it is more intimate and appropriate for this place, in my opinion. Each room is like a mini-condo. Both times I was here, my rooms had a small kitchen area with a refrigerator, stove, eating space. It is usually accompanied by a living room, bedroom, and bathroom. The living room has a pull-out bed and 1 room can usually accommodate 4 people. I am not sure if all the rooms are the same, but this has been my experience.

Each room had window walls and no matter which way the room faced, there was always a spectacular view! I was blessed with a corner room during my second stay...if I didn't have so much planned, I would have loved to stay in the room to enjoy the views! My room was always clean and the facility always worked as it should have. Pricing varies greatly. They do have random deals so I usually book when the deals are available.",1,0,3

The decor was contemporary and the bathroom was luxurious.  The bed was very comfortable as well.

It's the hotel for people who like to find the best of everything, who get around LV, seeking out their favorite spots. This is definitely one of mine.

PS: they have the most relaxing facials of any spa I've visited. Put me in a trance every time! Don't get me wrong, the other services are top notch too, but the facials really stand out. If you only have time for one service, a facial would be my suggestion.",0,0,0

From the moment my boyfriend and I checked into the hotel, everything couldn't have gone any better. The front desk staffs, housekeepers, room service, bellman, spa staffs, and pool staffs were all very warm and friendly. 

The hotel is located right behind the Aria (Aria being the sister hotel of the Vdara). Just a few minute walk from the Aria which is where you can access the strip. A little inconvenient, but nothing one can't handle. Everywhere on the strip is a pretty far walk. We got the studio suite on the 29th floor and everything was so nice and clean. The studio suite has a small kitchen with a microwave, stove, sink, refrigerator and dining table for two. If you want to cook something, just call room service for pots, pans, and utensils. The studio suite comes with two tvs, king bed, couch, closet, and safe. The best part had to be the bathroom. The bathtub is fitted for a nice and warm bubble bath after a long night out. 

The hotel doesn't have a casino downstairs which makes it very quite which is a plus to wind down after being on the strip with loads of people all night. There's also a security that checks your room key before entering your room which makes the hotel feel very safe. Our flight wasn't scheduled to depart until 5pm and I asked the front desk if we were able to check out at a later time. Normally checkout is by 11am, but the staff was able to accommodate and extend our stay until 1pm without adding a late checkout charge. Awesome! 

Overall, I have no complaints with my stay here and would definitely return on another vacation along with recommending this place to others!",4,0,1

It was perfect retreat after spending the day on the strip. We had a little kitchenette, a beautiful view, a simple pool, and it was quiet. It was definitely and attraction and the lobby was always bustling, but it wasn't anything in comparison to the other hotels. Its not clique and we really enjoyed ourselves.

This is my third trip to Vegas, the first trip was for business and stayed in the old Las Vegas Hilton next to the convention center which was just adequate. So back to the Vdara though, booked a flight and hotel package and got a great deal and included free show tickets through an MGM promotion. Got to the hotel and didn't wait at all to check in at the front desk. Service was quick and friendly and was done with the transaction in a couple of minutes. The hotel is connected to the Bellagio by walkway (basically think of it as another tower to the Bellagio) and is really close to the Bellagio conference rooms and convention halls if you're there for business as well. If possible, ask the front desk for a room over the 40th floor facing the Bellagio. We had a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains from our Deluxe Suite room on the 46th floor. The room was spotless and decor was beautiful. Housekeeping was extremely friendly and willing to bend over backwards to help with any request we had.

First off, yes it's past Bellagio and away from the madness, but being there for my 21st birthday and staying out all the time made me run back to the peace and quiet that is Vdara. The very first thing I noticed when walking into the lobby was the smell. They must inject something into the air because it smelled a little fruity, but wasn't too strong. The hotel itself is super modern and everything looks and feels new. Check-in was at 11pm and we only waited about 2 minutes since there was another person in front of us.
Our room was awesome. We stayed in the Deluxe Suite and had a huge TV and a bathtub along with a glass shower and the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. Seriously, by the end of our stay all we wanted to do was take the bed home with us!
Room service was excellent and we never had any problems. I ordered myself a Club Sandwich at night and it was $18!!! A little pricey, but hey, it WAS 3am! We stayed on the 41st floor and our room overlooked Aria, the sister hotel. The Aveda products made it even better and we always had enough when coming back into the room. Props for having the Tram right there as well! That's pretty much how we got around. The pool was only 3ft deep, but I'm not a huge swimmer and wanted to go hang on the strip so that didn't bother me too much.

I left my camera here after my stay three weeks ago. I called the night I left and filed a report with security (don't worry, it wasn't that easy. I was transferred many times before I actually spoke with someone at Aria). I was told that housekeeping had already been in the room and nothing had been returned to Lost and Found yet. So when I received a call the next day, I thought for sure they had found it. NOPE. It was someone else from security, asking me to file a report (this is not the last report I have had to file. How many? Three.).  Because there were food items left in our kitchenette from prior guests, I asked the hotel to please recheck the room, in two specific spots: in the cabinet below the TV and underneath the pullout couch. I've asked 5 times and was told that this was done. Lo and behold, it never was. Now its been three weeks, with no recheck, no camera and no explanation other than, ""You shouldn't have left your camera in the room."" Yes, I get that. But I also expect better service when paying that much for a suite of rooms.

Better luck next time, Vdara.",2,2,0

We were on the 54th floor of this amazing hotel and couldn't have asked for more! Well, I guess we could've.  

The blackout and shades on the windows weren't working properly, the engineer had told us they were all tangled up, but they came and fixed them while we were gone.  They were very quick to fix or replace things when we called and the staff was always very nice.  The rooms were pretty nicely sized and their bathrooms were very nice, but didn't have the bathtubs I was expecting and only had a bathtub in 1 restroom.  Also, the shower head in our restroom didn't have something to hold the head in shower position, instead we had to hold it and didn't realize there was a piece missing until the day we left.  The light in our closet was acting up, didn't turn on when it was supposed to, but stayed on when we closed the door and were trying to sleep.  The safe seemed a little small.  There was a resort fee of $100 a day (Yikes!!) that they hadn't mentioned on the many occasions that my friend called to confirm all of the charges.  The hotel is also valet only, which has it's pros and cons, and with a car like ours with a transmission problem I would have rather self parked it, but they took good direction and we got our car back every time with no issues or dings.  

The suite was very clean and the decor was gorgeous,  the view was exquisite, the beds were soft and comfortable but they were only queen sized beds,  their customer service was awesome, and besides the small easily fixed items I described above, I had an awesome suite experience!

I didn't have to worry about taking a shower again, just because I passed the casino floor like all the other places. The location is central strip and we just walked everywhere (very convenient). Vdara does not have self park at this time. Complimentary valet (awesome).

The room deal I got said two complimentary buffets (thought it was only for a day). Turns out it was two breakfast\/brunch buffets for two people daily (another win). Vdara does not have a buffet, we had to walk to Aria. 

I stayed in the *deluxe suite* with my boyfriend. The decor was very contemporary, however, there were flaws to its design. First example, there is no master light control switch by the bed so we had to walk all the way to the door. Second, the boarder around the tub did not have a drain so when the water slightly overflowed, it'd flood all over the floor. Third, not enough places to hang towels so they were all around our room. 

Bath robes & silverware are available upon request. 

Pool size was a bit small in my opinion. 

Elevators are superb. Very fast & it doesn't even feel like you're moving :)

Pros -
1) Really nice, 5 star hotel standard
2) one bedrdoom suites at MASSIVE!
3) hot shower and separate shower and bathtub, although water pressure could have been better
4) window blinds and shades are very thick and good at keeping the sunlight out
5) Wifi is fast
6) No casino and smoke-free. Nice and quiet lounge
7) Valet parking was very fast and efficient every time
8) Connected to the Bellagio for direct access (although at least a 5 minute walk to the casino floor)
9) Central heating was very good, and also separate heating systems for the living room and the bedroom!
10) Right next to the Crystals mall if you like really high end designer shopping

Cons - 
1) Resort fee - $28!

The room was very spacious and plush. It had it's own kitchen and two bathrooms and a washer dryer in suite, perfect for a long stay. The room was very quiet as you cannot hear your neighbor like a lot of other hotels. Housekeeping was prompt.

Pool was nice but fyi they close the pool bar an hour before the pool closes. The gym here is nice but a bit cramped but who goes to Vegas to work out. 

Wifi was pretty strong, and my At&t 4G LTE was super fast here also. 

Valet only but the were pretty quick, there's a air conditioned waiting room right by the valet window if the Vegas heat is getting to you.

Close to all of city center Aria\/ Cosmo\/ ect... and connected to the Bellagio.

I would suggest this hotel for anyone who wants to experience Vegas but be able to retreat to a nice quiet place and recover.",5,2,2

I was going to Vegas for a work thing, and I decided to add two extra days as a quickie vacation to hit a spa and get some warm weather.  I don't gamble, so I kind of do the anti-Vegas thing.
 
I picked the Vdara because I was hoping for a view of the Bellagio Lake (which I got) at something less than Bellagio prices (also achieved).  I also liked that there was no smoking and no casino, since I wanted peace, quiet, and clean air.  All of which I got.  I signed up for the Romance Package in case my S.O. could make it (that part, unfortunately, didn't work out).  Anyway, there were some minor perks, including a $100 food credit.  I saw different fine print on whether this was $50 for Food and $50 for the ""resort fee"" or $100 food.  I asked  front desk person (Michelle), who said $75, and that it was good for the restaurant and not just room service.

A buddy was at loose ends, and decided to join me at the last minute.  Since she was between jobs, I offered to share my room, since hey, suite, with plenty of space.  (Since I signed up for the Romance Package, they probably figured we were lesbians, but hey, got an upgrade for it or something.)

Anyway, the suite was beautiful.  (Hooray for upgrade!)  I loved it.  It was very much like a condo, which I actually kind of dig on vacation.  There was a guest powder room, dining table, proper fridge in addition to mini-bar, dishwasher, and fabulous views.  Particularly from the master bath, but I'll take it.

We called down to housekeeping to ask for extra streets for the sofa bed, and they said 20 minutes.  We called back 45 minutes later after receiving nothing, and the phone just rang and rang.  Yes, it was late, but they said 24 hour housekeeping, so.  We were tired, so we did without that night.  (We left a note and tip the next morning, so that worked.)

We hit the bar and restaurant downstairs a couple times, since the Vdara Bar was conveniently nearby and had a whimsical swing outdoors.  I also ventured to the spa as well (and really will try to write a review for that and the bar).  

Other than the incident with the extra sheets, I thought all was well, checked out and went to my work thing across the driveway at the Aria.
 
I get the bill emailed to me and there's $156 in food and beverage charges at the hotel, and no credit.  It's not going to make or break me, but I hate being ripped off.  I email back to ask about it, and get no response.   So now I'm cranky, and my goodwill has vanished.  Later, I get an automated survey, which I answer in scathing detail, and leave my contact info so they can contact me if they want, but I didn't expect a response.  Luckily, someone did, a couple weeks later, with a very nice apology, and  they credited my AmEx for the $156.  They offered me an upgrade if I go back, but I'm still undecided if I will.",3,2,1

First thing I noticed, quiet lobby and floors. Normally, you can hear everybody and their momma in a Las Vegas hotel but it was so calm and cozy even in a very packed lobby. The bar was a great place to mingle with other guests. And the market had grubbies and drinks galore. Bellagio and Aria for the casino-action were only a hop skip and a jump away. Walking to any of the other properties wasn't that bad either. 

The beds were so comfortable and the kitchen and bathroom couldn't have been more spacious and accommodating for my weekend.

I also visited the spa to get ready for a lovely night out. I boiled and I sweated for a few hours here. It was very soothing experience, they had all the amenities you could need and its not that crowded during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The spa attendants were actually attentive and very friendly! 

One thing that really saddened me was that I was charged for Room Service I never received. I ordered a late night\/early morning meal, and fell asleep (and I sleep like a rock) before it got to my room. Sometimes you just can't fight sleep no matter how hard you try... I don't think this should have been something that was charged. But it is what it is I guess...

This hotel is smaller than most, most of the amenities are also smaller.  Not really any restaurants in the place, also the pool is kinda small.  But knowing these things going in, we were really happy here.  Everything looked really new and clean.  We really noticed a difference when we went to other hotels and those casinos smelled of smoke.  I never really noticed as much when I previously stayed in them, but it was pretty obvious when going from a smoke free hotel to a regular casino.  

Having a full kitchen was nice.  We didn't actually make any meals for ourselves.  But the fridge and microwave were very helpful for storing and preparing all of the baby's meals.  Hotel was also able to provide a crib (brought our own baby sheets).  We got a 1 bedroom suite.  This was important since it allowed us to put the baby in the bedroom when he was sleeping, and we could still stay in the living room without disturbing him.  It was 811 sq\/ft, but felt a bit small.  Also a plus was that it had a separate powder room, so I didn't have to go through the bedroom to the main bathroom if the baby was sleeping.  

My only major complaint is the pull out bed in the living room.  One night after gambling late, I decided to sleep on the bed on the pull out coach to not disturb my wife and baby.  It looked really old and worn out.  There seemed to be barely any cushioning between the springs and the top of the mattress.  Felt very uncomfortable.  I put the bed back in and slept on the couch instead.  

In terms of location, Vdara was ideally situated on the strip.  There is only valet parking, which is a bit of a hassle for people who like to have ready access to their car like myself.  But we never really needed it since we were able to walk to most every place we wanted.  There is a connected walkway to the Bellagio hotel.  A skytram to Aria or the Crystals mall.  During this trip we saw a show at New York\/New York and Treasure Island, and felt fine with walking to both places from Vdara.  

Staff was professional and polite.  One morning I was walking to the elevator with a tray of coffee in one hand and a bag of breakfast food in the other.  The guy who guards outside the elevators followed me just so he could push the floor button for me.  Not really necessary, but very polite of him to do so.

By the way for those who don't think it is easy access to the strip, that is not true.  There is a bridge that drops you right into the Bellagio. That same bridge also drops you off for a quick tram ride to the Aria.  Go out the front, cut to left and down the stairs by the silver statue and you are at the Cosmopolitan.

3. Tile in front of toilet is raised from surrounding tiles. A barefoot guest can cut their toe\/bottom of the foot on the corner of the raised portion of the tile. This may be a result of the water leaking from the shower.

People are friendly and helpful. Hotels seems to understaff even when it knows crowds are coming or leaving.  I guess no one checks the reservation dates to see when people arrive and leave. 

Mediocre for the money you pay. If you choose this hotel, stay several floors above the tram on the east side - it is noisy and runs about every 15 minutes 24 hours a day.

I stayed here three nights. My room was on the 47th floor. When I first walked in to my room, I was surprised by how dim the room lighting was. It's as if it was intentional to form some sort of mood.

My room had four different rooms - a kitchenette area, a bathroom, a living room, and a bedroom. Both the living room and bed room had large flat panel HD TVs - and with a respectable number of HD channels!

The kitchenette had a small mini fridge, as well as a minibar stocked with water, soda, beer, booze, and snacks. There is also a two burner stovetop and a microwave.

The bed was very comfortable. The mattress was nice and firm, not mushy.

The door has an electronic lock that is activated by a chip in your room card. You wave or move the card close to the sensor on the door and it unlocks. There is also a couple of buttons inside the door that control a light in the hallway right next to the door. The color of the light provides information to the maid\/cleaning staff - as to whether the room is available to be cleaned, or if you want privacy (blue light) or if you are specifically requesting maid service (green light).

The staff are friendly and very accommodating. I had set the light to blue one morning and when I left my room for the day, I forgot to change the light color. When I got back to my room, there was a light flashing on my phone indicating I had a message. When I called to get the message - the message was a query as to whether I needed my room cleaned. Wow!

There were a couple things I noticed right away about this hotel.  Beautiful decor.  No smokey smell.  No loud noises from the casino... it's like an oasis in a sea of craziness!

And the rooms... SO NICE!  They have a kitchen area with a full fridge, stove, coffee maker, and even cabinets.  They have a sofa and a oversized chair, two large flat screen TV's, a big and comfy bed, amazing views, a large vanity, shower, tub, and sliding doors for privacy between the bedroom, living area, kitchen, and bathroom.  

Major plus?  We got a knock at the door around 7:30 our first night there to a full plate of cookies.  Just because.  Seriously?  How cool is that.  And when we called about getting more towels, extra pillows, and extra blankets, they came quickly.  

We got a deal package for ""Winter Wonderland"" since we went in February, and it included $50 credit to use however we'd like.  We decided on room service.   It came quickly, the food was good, and our stomachs were happy.

The Vdara definitely allows you to have your cake and eat it too. The hotel is slightly off the strip and the Bellagio, Aria and Monte Carlo are all connected and the strip is only a short walk. 

The Vdara is a non smoking non casino hotel and is very relaxing, but if you feel like gambling, inhaling second hand smoke or engaging in any of the other activities Vegas has to offer this hotel is so conveniently located that all the Vegas amenities are very accessible. 

The staff was very friendly and the hotel really feels like a spa with modern contemporary decor and utilized clean lines to give a sleek and finished look. 

When we entered the room we noticed a kitchen area and a dinning table but you have to get the pots, pans, plates and utensils from housekeeping. 

We walked past the entry way and there was a king bed , flat screen tv, and a sitting area with a couch, coffee and end tables. My husband noticed that the tables in the room were dusty and when our luggage was brought my husband told the bell hop that the room was dusty when he asked if everything was ok. 

A representative from housekeeping immediately came to the room to remedy the problem. 

The bathroom was large and very attractive. There was a large soaking tub and a separate shower. The two things that would have made it better was if there were 2 sinks and if the toilet was in a separate little room. 

In the evening of our first night we wanted to take a shower before going out and quickly noticed that there were only 2 wash cloths. BTW I hate when I go to hotels that know there are 2 people in the room and only leave 2 towels. I called housekeeping to get more face towels and they said that they would bring them right up (housekeeping is said to be available 24\/7). 

Almost an hour goes by and no towels I looked out the door to see if there was a housekeeping cart in the hallway and got lucky. I went down a few doors and was able to get a few towels off the cart. Yes I did it again before we left but this time I was sure to get enough to last the whole stay. 

The bed was really comfortable unless we were fooled because we were so tired from being in Vegas and being up so late each night. 

There are black out shades that were operated by a switch on the wall and I will agree with the other reviews that say there were gaps in the shades therefore the room is not completely dark but it was dark enough for us and did not interfere with our sleep at all. 

We ate a snack at the bar (sliders, fries, salad), breakfast at the market cafe (bagel sandwich, muffin, orange juice) and ordered room service (buffalo and bbq wings, tomato soup, carrots, celery, bread). The sliders and bbq wings were really good but everything else was just okay.

I booked a reservation with Vdara for Valentine's Day. I requested that the room be covered in rose petals (cheesy I know, but I wanted her to laugh as we entered the room lol). The concierge was happy to oblige. Great start.

The suite was great! Comfy, spacious, modern, and well designed. My only gripe is how far it is from everything. Sure its next to Aria, but I don't even like that hotel to begin with. There is however, a walkway to Bellagio so it made up for it.

My stove top didn't even have knobs installed and the refrigerator didn't get cold, even after turning the controls to max., resulting in spoiled leftovers.  Housekeeping failed to make an appearance until I called them.  Also, the kid at the front desk was clearly an amateur who should be warming up at a cheaper hotel.  Wait, one more problem, the blackout shades have big gaps between them so the room doesn't blackout.

The good news: There is a short bridge that connects to a beautiful, well-ran resort: Bellagio.  Also, the view from the large windows is very nice.",8,2,2

We were in a suite that had a kitchenette with two small fridges (no freezer, 1 fridge was the mini bar), 2 burner cooktop and microwave. It'd be nice if the kitchenette had a roll of paper towels, dishsoap and some basic tools (the way the bathroom does) since we did prepare a little food and snacks in the room. You have to ask for plates and flatware but they'll deliver it, our turnaround time was a few hours which was fine, we were at the pool anyway. 

Our media center was a bit wonky...we brought a 360 for netflix and video games as well as a few dvds (the point of this trip was to relax and lounge, not gamble and get drunk...I've def done those trips!). It was easy to hook up but only certain dvds worked, we kept getting ""unsupported video format"" errors even though the xbox menu worked.  Since the WiFi is a browser login prompt, we couldn't login on the xbox but it was easy on my tablet and phone. 

Tv picture was great, faces the bed flanked by the dining table and couch. The bathroom mirror reflects it so you can also watch from the tub with the door open. 

Bed was super comfy, white bedding that smelled bleachy-clean (that sounds bad but I like it). Electronic shade and blackout shade. 

The front desk was very accommodating; they lent us a 360 controller when we forgot ours, it already had batteries. The flatware was delivered. 

Someone fell at the pool on the third floor. The staff (10 present or so half hour before closing) were concerned and alert to his situation. Hottub is big, fits 10-15 comfortably. Cabanas available with tvs and fans. Pool is heated and by heated I mean bathwater. Very pleasant even in the shade aria can throw on it in the late afternoon. Food and drink allowed in plastic. Nice big pool beds and lounge chairs. Towels provided. Bar counter, possibly a few snacks available. We were also carded before boarding the elevator a few times so it seems lile they keep track of who's supposed to be in the bldg. 

Geographically, it's not on the strip. It's behind (and connected to) Bellagio, across the street from Aria. It has no gaming (a plus for me) & is nonsmoking. It's huge, 56 floors so it's easy to blend in and be anonymous. 

My biggest draw pulling me back to this hotel would be the service. It's world class. I loved cosmopolitan too, I think their bathrooms were a little nicer (i like the special door for the toilet). But vdara has the best soaking tub which I used every single day. I'd return for sure.

Reviews were positive with friendly service, quiet, and great location (connected to the Aria and the Bellagio).  The latter was definitely true. But the service was subpar and frustrating!! 

On our second day, my wife ordered flowers to be delivered.  Instead of seeing them sitting pretty in our room, we had to follow-up twice.  The front desk personnel gave us attitude when we asked if the flowers would be given to us before midnight.  On the third day, a security guard decided to go on a power trip and asked us for our room key. WTH! This is not a hotel worth sneaking into!!  The last straw was there were no bottles of water (guests should get 1 bottle\/day).  Take note that on top of the room charge, you have to pay $29\/day in resort fees. The only tangible benefit we got from these fees were small bottles of water in the fridge.

Suite was clean! It came with a kitchenette and large bathroom. The bathroom had a shower and tub. Score! I love that they had an additional closet inside the bathroom and the mounted magnify mirror was cool. I just wish the bathroom sink drained ok. It was slowly draining, but since I spent my days out on the strip we never complained about it.

The hotel does not have casinos in it. Score! I won't have to worry about cigar or cigarette smoke. This hotel is not on the strip, but within a short walk you will be in the Bellagio. Score! I like how casinos\/hotels were connected so you can walk through in the air conditioned space than outside in the heat. 

This hotel is a 4 star 4 diamond hotel. This was a very nice and clean hotel!  They have security around the elevators. They ask that people flash them their room key so just anyone walking in can not go up to the rooms. Be sure to check the entrance before going into the area with the elevators since floors 4-28 were on the far left and floors 29-up were straight ahead. The pool area is the same. You just show your room key at the entrance to see the pool area. You can rent a cabana or daybed if you want to sit around the pool.

The Vegas strip is forever changed with the building of City Center -- it doesn't have a theme like Luxor (Egyptian), Excalibur (Medieval) or Bellagio (Italian opulence) so I wasn't sure how it would blend in with the Las Vegas strip. It's very contemporary and modern, you may say even complex.  The architectural details found (artwork and otherwise) fit the whole ""futuristic"" Vegas that the brains behind City Center is going for. 

For a non-gambler and non-smoker like I am, Vdara is THE perfect retreat: it's clean, less crowded, quiet and you know what? it smells NICE in here! I bet you, they must've installed invisible mini-sprays that constantly release a fresh scent every time somebody opens the door. (ok, maybe not!) The central location is ideal, connected to the Bellagio by a walkway and Aria is next to it.  Across the street is the Miracle Mile shops at Planet Hollywood and within a $8-$10 cab ride to the Venetian or the Wynn.

Checking in took awhile and housekeeping was slow to respond with our request.  (we were missing our His and Hers slippers in the closet!) Watch out for the mandatory resort fee of $15\/day which gives you the free coffee, free water bottles in your room and free wifi.  Use it! you paid for it.

My biggest gripe was the pool. For a hotel that makes you feel like you're living in a very chic apartment in Manhattan, their pool area was a disappointment. It looked like a pool that you can find at somebody's apartment, complete with views of the garage.  I'm into hanging out at the pool and getting tanned when I'm in Vegas so this is very important to me. However, bonus points for having Aveda toiletries.

Another bonus? this hotel is still new so you can delight in the fact that not a lot of asses have sat on the toilet seat yet.",33,28,28

Now I must preface all of this with this fun fact - I am NOT your typical Vegas goer but I LOVE Vegas.  I don't gamble, barely drink and can't stand the smell of cigarettes.  Yet there is something that brings me back here time and again. So if you must have a thick wafting of cigarette smoke and a loud, hopping casino in your hotel, the Vdara may not be for you.

I found the Vdara to be simply  wonderful!  Clean, fresh, smoke free air abounds in this tranquil, upscale hotel. The bed?  Sooooo comfortable I did not want to get out of it.  The soaking tub, ahhhhh, wonderful!  The service - impeccable.  And we loved being able to walk around City Center. No need for an overpriced taxi that smells like last night's vomit.  There were plenty of restaurants, bars, and shopping in City Center to keep us from ever having to venture on to the strip.  Oh and the quiet.  That was the best part.  No screaming gaggles of drunk girls parading up and down the halls at 3:00 a.m.  It felt like we were the only guests in the hotel until we stepped out of the elevator and into the lobby. And as an aside, we did take our car out and ventured down Industrial Road to find some really cool, vintage Vegas shops...and while you're at it, for a great bowl of ramen, head over to Monta Ramen on Spring Mountain Road where you won't be gouged, just pleasantly filled up with delicious, aromatic noodles and broth!

Complaints?  Minimal really.  The air conditioner in our room was a bit temperamental but two lovely service men took care of the problem efficiently enough.  The cafe downstairs boasts ""Frozen Yogurt"" on the wall but alas...the machines were removed so we took a quick walk to Pinkberry just down the road.

Downsides include the distance from the strip - it's so close you can see it but requires a trip through Bellagio or Aria to actually get there. Taxis are therefore a must and add up over time. Amenities in the rooms are a little light and the touches are kinda cheap. No name hair products, sandpaper tp, two micro bottles of water per day, all seemed a little sparse given what we paid to stay. Also, even though we were four to a room, the foldout wasn't made and it took a couple days before we got four towels. 

Also note that the kitchenette has lots of empty cupboards. No cutlery or plates. Maybe this is standard but made the full kitchenette rather useless. Maybe they would have stocked it at our request...

Before you can get to the elevators which takes you to the rooms, the lobby staff always ask you to present your room key just to make sure you're actually staying here. This makes it harder for people to sneak in and overfill a room passed capacity.

This is my 3rd time staying at this hotel and I still love staying here!
Absolutely love the interior design; very modernize, sleek, and simple. I personally don't like interior design to be TOO colorful, and too much things going on at the same time. 

The room is very new and Vdara had maintained the room very nice and clean. 
It's a non-smoking hotel, so for those anti-cigs ppl, this should be your first choice if you're planning to visit vegas. 

This time I've also tried the room service( since i went during the thanksgiving weekend, everywhere is SO PACKED.... :\)
We ordered 2 entree and 2 appetizers; it took them 30 minutes to deliver it to my room, not too bad huh?
The food was delicious! we had chicken quasadilla, french onion soup, chicken sandwich with fries, and shrimp and pork penne. the presentation and the flavor were flawless. and total only cost us around 70ish dollars. I guess its not TOO expensive for room service?

One more thing, me and my girl got too drunk on the last night at vegas :p, and we wanted to request a late check out. So they gave us one extra hour (till 12pm), without any extra charge :D I guess Vdara does try their best to make you have a wonderful experience while you stay with them.

Yes, there is no casino, but that isn't a problem at all. The point of staying here is to be in the middle of the craziness that is Vegas but have a nice quiet hotel room to stroll into at 6am.  And since there is no casino the rooms are cheaper than Aria. However, don't come here in groups just yet. They don't offer a 2 bedroom room, so it really is for couples. 

The desk and all other staff were very nice and attentive. The parking was confusing which is a (-) but the staff helped us figure it out very quickly(+)

The room is very nice, pull out bed, nice decor and great view. My friends and I were very impressed with the room and ended up laying on the bed and couch, playing with the TV for 90 minutes when we just wanted to place our bags and leave again (maybe childish...but isn't Vegas the adult playground?)

Choices are pretty limited in Vdara. It's not a great overall hotel for a ""Vegas experience."" However, for those who want to relax and enjoy a nice luxurious vegas hotel, this is great.  It's a beautiful looking hotel, but just not my type of Vegas experience.

Sure, they spent millions of dollars on every aspect of the property, and perhaps they feel entitled to 5 stars from each of their guests.  After all, they paid for the votes.
Here's why they don't:  The Details.

First, the pros:  This place is NICE!  Totally modern, each room is a suite, amazing views(available upon request and prompt payment), full size refridgerator\/kitchen, it even has a washer\/dryer.  Seriously, nobody has a washer\/dryer in their hotel room. It's also smoke free and doesn't have a casino in it. This is all quite nice.  The complementray valet parking was also nice. They even have a coffee maker in the room. 

I know, this is America and all, and coffee, along with running water, is standard in every hotel in the country, but in Las Vegas, hotels on the strip usually do not include this basic necessity. They'd rather you wake up w\/ a hang over and come downstairs looking and feeling like dookie to get your coffee rather than providing you a basic cup o' joe in your room, even if it isn't all that good. Because the crappy hotel room coffee is going to make you not want to have a real coffee. 


The cons: The details!  

1) For example, I have a shirt w\/ a button that's starting to pop off. I like this shirt. I want to wear this shirt. I need a needle and thread.  Being a wonderful full service hotel, I call the front desk to request a needle and thread, which I am assured will arrive promptly.
What I get instead is a ""vanity pack"", contents: 3 cotton balls, 3 cotton swabs, 1 emery board.   No needle, no thread. WTF, am I going to sew my button back on w\/ a Q-tip? Try harder.

2) The ironing board has a fixture to hold the iron which has been surgicaly attached to the ironing board in the place which takes up all of the most valuable ironing real estate, making it take twice as long to iron anything. Thank you, but no thank you, thank you.

3) The full size kitchen has nothing in it. For exampple, you have a nice coffee maker(w\/ the usual crappy hotel coffee) but no coffee mugs.  You have to call for it. Hint: poeple like coffee in coffee mugs. Put them in your rooms by default. Or is the coffee mug maker just for decoration?  If someone takes a mug home, charge their card. Put a logo on the mug. They'll want to take it home. Easy money. What are you waiting for?

4) We were a party of 3 and there's no extra bedding in the room for the pull out sofa.  Perhaps they assume all their parties of 3 are into freaky 3 ways or something, as I had to call down to get the bedding , which showed up about 30 minutes after the time I wanted to go to bed(that would be when I found out that there was no bedding).

If a place wants to call themself full service, and wants me to pay more than $600 for a night(a Saturday), then they should be smart enough ask me on check in if we'd like additional bedding sent up rather than making me find out the hard way. hint: we're a party of more than 2, and by defailt our suite only has 1 bed. Either we're into the freaky 3 way, or we need extra bedding sent up. Don't make me find this out after a late night out in Vegas. Ask me when I check in. Be full service.

It all adds up to a hotel w\/ sub-par service for the price. They are missing the attention to detail at a price where they should be paying attention to the details.  My checkin guy Al, the valets, & bell hops all did a great job, though, so thumbs up to those guys.

For the prices of the rooms here, I'd prefer going to Aria or Caesars Palace, which have pretty much the same layout and decor. As for Vdara, I would rate the hotel zero stars if I could.

First off, we were excited to use the refrigerator to store food and save money for the first few days of our trip, but our room had a broken refrigerator. The repairman or ""engineer"", as they like to call themselves, came and said they needed to replace the whole refrigerator, and that they would notify the front desk and have it replaced the next day. For the next four days, no one would ever show up, and the only thing the front desk could say was ""sorry."" Sorry doesn't keep the food from going bad, which it did. Front desk said that the repairman are based on a first come first serve. Are you telling me that for four days straight no one was available to fix our problem?  Management really needs to talk to their front desk and ""engineers"" about accommodating their paying customers appropriately. Not to mention how miserable the employees look at Vdara, from the front desk to the waiters to the guy standing near the elevators. How does the hotel expect their customers to have a good experience, when their own workers look miserable?

Second, the hallways are filled with trash that people leave in front of their doors and all over the hallways. The same bag of trash, dirty dishes, dirty laundry, and empty beer bottles were left by my surrounding neighbors for at least three days before it was cleared. Wth are the housekeepers doing? Is this what this hotel is, a freakin trashcan?

Third, the valet here is HORRIBLE! They are very slowwww. We were waiting to get our car valeted for at least 30 mins before we got to the front, and it took at least 30 mins to receive our car from the valet. Even when there were only one or two people ahead of us. Do they freakin walk to the car or what? I've never dealt with a valet service this slow before. The only reason why we dealt with the horrible valet was because we had free valet. I can't imagine dealing with the BS if we had to pay for the valet. 

Overall, I'd recommend booking a room at Aria or Caesars Palace if you want a nice looking room for around the same price, but with a better experience and environment.

It was a $60 upgrade per night,  but I was stoked that there would be a 1\/2 bath because the one thing I love is having my own restroom. 

The corner room was a very decent size which came with the kitchenette, washer\/dryer, robes, and slippers. I found it weird that the kitchenware had to be requested from housekeeping, and not left in the room.

I cannot comment specifically on the price since it was paid for by my friend's husband as a birthday present, but based on other hotels I've stayed at in Vegas, this was top notch and probably worth its price. There was the iHeart music festival going on the weekend we went, so prices were a little higher than normal for this time of year.

This hotel is a fantastic choice if you aren't a fan the smoke filled casinos that most Vegas places boast. Quiet and smoke free - yes please! All the rooms are suites, and therefore very spacious. We didn't use the kitchenette but was very thankful to have a refrigerator in the room! It was nice that they stocked it with a couple FREE waters as well. BEST PART: the panoramic view from our suite of the north end of Las Vegas\/the Strip.We were able to watch the Bellagio fountain show (minus the music) from our ""living room"". I enjoyed the modern decor, spacious bathrooms, comfortable beds (even the pull-out couch was decent, and queen-sized!) Service was fantastic - from the valets to the bellboys to housekeeping who came at 4am to make up the pull-out couch. It is not far off from the Strip. I loved how we were able to walk to the Cosmopolitan, or take the tram from Aria to either Monte Carlo or Bellagio.

The one complaint: the bathroom door handle was unsecured and kept falling off so we couldn't lock the bathroom. Not a problem so much as an inconvenience when it would fall on the floor with a clatter and wake us up! Also some people didn't like the idea that there is no self-parking. However, valet is free (you just have to tip them obviously!)

Additionally, we visited the Spa and fitness center during our stay. The fitness center is free for guests and is very spacious for a hotel gym. It had multiple treadmills\/elliptical machines that each had their own TVs attached. There were several weight machines and free weights. The Spa was about average for Vegas spas (sorry, nothing has been able to beat Caesars yet!) While I didn't get a spa service, my friends loved their 50 minute massages.

The Vdara is great because it feels like a sophisticated break from ""Vegas"" - you are close enough to the action but you aren't sharing a hotel elevator with 30 people trying to get to their rooms. It is a non-smoking hotel with no casino - great because you don't inhale toxins the whole night, everything that you brought on the trip doesn't need to be dry cleaned once you get home and you have the luxury of choosing an interesting casino to go to, rather than staying at your hotel b\/c it is convenient (Aria is right next door and really nice). 

Each room has a kitchenette, perfect if you want to quickly whip something up - i.e. oatmeal race day morning. 

The rooms are nicely appointed, a decent size and comfortable with incredible views. Aveda products = also good.

The lobby bar is modern and sleek, our waitress was great, as were our cocktails. 

Pool area was great (both pool and hot tubs were open in December and not crowded) doesn't seem like your typical ""Vegas"" pool scene. 

The spa was great! We both had massages that were amazing and the spa & fitness areas were nicely appointed. 

Housekeeping, bell hops and concierge were all very good. 

We didn't eat at their restaurant - we want across to the CityCenter to the Social House and it was - AMAZING. Go there if you like sushi, it is fantastic!",0,0,0

The rooms were extremely ""cozy""...when the pullout sofa was pulled out, it actually touched the regular bed and there was no walking space in between. The pull out sofa was also REALLY uncomfortable! I mean, I've had my trips where I find myself coming back to the hotel room and just falling asleep on the floor, but even that was better than sleeping on the pullout mattress. You could feel the circles on your back from every single spring! It was also very inconvenient that the toilet was not separated from the rest of the bathroom with a door or something. Really awkward having to go to the bathroom while the other 3 girls are getting ready in front of the mirror. :X

The good thing is that this hotel has a connecting walkway to Bellagio which was uber convenient. I also ordered the room service twice and the food was really good! Ingredients tasted fresh and the waiter was very courteous when setting it up in the room. 

Verdict: Room is ideal for couples seeking a quiet hotel to go back to. No gambling and minimal food\/drink options. Not good for 4 Asian girls looking to party.",2,2,2

We're here for our anniversary and I spent a LOT of time looking for which hotel to stay in.  The reason I ended up at the Vdara was because I didn't want to stay at a casino hotel, and their corner suite promised amazing views with wrap-around windows.  It's always about the view for me.  So, I dished out the money to stay at an 800+ square foot suite on Labor Day weekend, when the prices are already way higher than usual.  We got put on the lowest floor available with views of a parking garage and a wall.  I called the front desk and they're sold out.  I know that sell outs happen, but just so, so bummed to have chosen this suite for the view and have nothing for it.

Convenience. You don't have to walk a mile through a crowded casino to the guest elevators because there is no casino! Easy, short walk to the elevators and in your room you go. LIFESAVER if you're a girl in heels and think you might never feel your toes ever again at the end of a long night. 

Kitchenette. A MICROWAVE! Sure, the fridge is tiny and barely cools a drink let alone keep your food at a safe temperature, but it's something. When you have leftovers, it's great to come back in the early morning of partying and just pop it in the microwave and be able to eat in 1 minute time. There's a stove too.. you can request for cooking tools and plates\/bowls\/etc. 

Room Size and Amenities. This is for the regular room- there's the kitchen area with dining table, a living room with a pull out bed\/couch, a queen bed, and a full bathroom with shower and bath. Large windows to enjoy the view. Two televisions! Plus, everything's modern with the touch of Vegas sexy.

Location. To get to Cosmopolitan from Vdara, you exit the hotel and turn left, walk a few feet, go down a flight of stairs, then walk a few more feet and ta-da! you're in front of the Cosmo entrance. Okay. I wish it was closer. But it's not far at all. Actually, we tried to take a taxi from Vdara to Cosmo, and they wouldn't let us. That's how close it is. Aria is just next door too. And there's a tram to Bellagio! 

Rates. Just look it up. Rooms tend to be cheaper than all the other hotels on the strip. Seriously. How? Why? When Vdara is so darn nice!

That's all I can think of for now. I love Vdara and would live here if I could. They do have that option....",1,1,1

The Good: I did the pre check-in I received as an email, yet couldn't find the ""fast lane"" to reap the benefits of doing so. No gambling or smoky lobby! Minimal crowd in the lobby. There's a designated ride share pick-up location which prevents all of the back-and-forth about figuring out where to meet or what exit you are using. The hotel is connected to the Bellagio, which is connected to everything else. 

The Not So Good: $20\/day for a coffee maker is RIDICULOUS. I might as well get the one cup of coffee I want from the Starbucks or Marketplace in the lobby. The hotel is a bit further away from the strip so despite it being walking distance, you have to walk FAR to get to everything. I attempted to go to the bar in the lobby but it seems like the bartenders only want to serve their regulars or friends. Both times I waited about 10 minutes then left.

The Ugly: I had a nice bottle of alcohol in the mini fridge and was using the (complementary) mini water bottles to hold it in the fridge. Housekeeping decided to move the bottles (still can't figure out why). When I went to open the fridge, my liquor bottle rolled right out onto the tile floor and shattered. The housekeeping employee seemed irritated that I caught her in the hall and asked her to clean it up. I spoke with a manager about the incident and her response was ""well I don't understand why they'd be in your refrigerator""....girl, I don't know why either. The manager ended up adding a credit to my room which could be used on food and\/or beverages. Of course, what was offered didn't equate to the entire bottle of liquor on my floor.",7,4,1

I booked via Visa Signature which was supposed to come with the following comps: automatic room upgrade at arrival, complimentary wi-fi, $25 food and beverage credit, VIP guest status, 3pm checkout upon request, $20 daily breakfast credit per person.

Here's how I did:

Automatic room upgrade: I booked two rooms - a Duluxe suite and a Vdara suite - and that's exactly what I received. When I asked about the upgrade they said the ""upgrade"" was that we were getting a better view. Now the view was great but it was not an upgrade to a bigger suite. 

Complimentary Wi-Fi: No problems here. Wi-Fi worked without a hitch.

$25 F&B credit: We applied this to some food we charged over at Aria, even though it was unclear if Mlife property restaurants were eligible. In this case they gave it to me. 

VIP Guest Status: I'm really not sure what this is supposed to be but we definitely didn't get it. We arrived at 9:30am and tried to check in early. The agent tried to sell me an early check-in for $30 and my ""VIP"" status got me nowhere. Eventually I caved and agreed but then it turned out there were no rooms available anyway. She offered to rush the housecleaning and said the rooms would be ready between 11:30am and 12:30pm. I didn't get my call to come check in until 2:30pm.

3pm checkout upon request: I didn't request it, but I did get an obnoxious knock on the door at 10:30am, with someone reminding me to check out before noon. I had no intention to stay past noon, and the ""do not disturb"" light was on, so I didn't really appreciate being disturbed. 

$20 daily breakfast credit per person: We could use this at Market Cafe or Starbucks. Market Cafe wasn't very good (see my other review) and Starbucks is Starbucks.

Again, great rooms but sloppy service and underwhelming amenities. I appreciate the lack of casino but would have liked more food and drinking options. I wouldn't avoid Vdara but probably will stay elsewhere next time.",2,0,0

We spent half the time in the tub. The bed was amazing, the sheets are super soft. The pillows are a little too fluffy, but not bad. 

They offer free wifi and free valet and really fast service. The lobby is really nice too and you're just a few steps away from the Aria casino. So you can gamble when you want but you're not surrounded by smoke at all times. 

What I didn't like: 

I made the reservation the day of, but I made a mistake and couldn't apply the free view upgrade so I called in. When I called, the lady told me that once I check in they can take care of that for me. But when I got to the hotel, the person helping us check in didn't know how to apply it and had to ask the manager. So after waiting for a bit she came back and said she had moved us up several floors and to a better room and that the view would be better but she couldn't get us the good view side regardless. So our view was of the freeway =( 

I appreciate that they upgraded our room, but I really wanted a good view to take pictures and I even offered to pay for it, but they since they had already said they were all out, they stuck to that story. So when we got to the room, I called in for a new reservations and the lady said they had a better view available. I let it go, but it was disappointing. 


We got back really late the night before the check out date so I called in to ask about late check out and I was told $50 for 3pm. And we left at 3, we had our luggage out in the hallway and ask I was taking one last look at the room to make sure nothing was left behind, we got a call from front desk to ask if we were ready, I told them we're on our way out and we left, but we still got charged $60 for half a day. 

During our stay, we took one of the orange juices out for a second to make a drink, but then we decided to mix with sprite and we put the unopened orange juice back in it's place, but we still got charged. 

And the Starbucks experience was absolutely terrible, but that's a different review. 

Overall, this hotel was very beautiful and we enjoyed our time but there was nothing about that would convince me to go back next time. I'm not saying that I wouldn't go back but an other hotel could catch my attention in no time.",12,8,10

Spa: Offered one of the best massages I have ever had. The price was reasonable at $140 for 50 minutes for a deep tissue massage and the ambiance was fantastic with access to the spa until closing.

Room Service: Ordered the Chicken Cesar Salad which took about 20-25 minutes to get to my room. Came with bread and they brought extra ice tea for me as well. The food overall was delicious. 

Market Cafe: Had the skinny scramble, not so great. Pretty crowded in the mornings as a lot of people who are trying to catch flights seem to eat breakfast here.

Checkout: Simple with video checkout from your room.

Overall: Booked this hotel on hotwire.com for about $150 a night. It was a great deal for a Friday\/Saturday night trip. I enjoyed everything at the hotel.

Since it's one of the newest hotels in Vegas, I expected pretty high class accommodations, which is what we ended up getting. However, that doesn't come without some shortfalls.

Pros:

- The rooms are wonderfully decorated with the most modern furniture. The bathroom is HUGE and features a shower big enough to fit 3-4 people for a post-pool drunk shower (swimsuit on of course). The suite comes with a fridge, sink, and all your very basic kitchen amenities. 

- Window blinds come down with a push of a button, which is also a very cool thing to see in such a large suite. 

- The Execute Corner Suite comes with a bed big enough to fit 4 girls or 3 guys, as well as a foldout couch that can fit the same amount, just not as comfortably. These guys know we don't come to Vegas in small groups.

- 2 Plasma TVs, one of which is connected to the sound system that features a music hookup. Being able to play music in your room is a highly beneficial tool when you have 10 people drunk in the middle of the day. 

- The pool is nice and quiet compared to the other big hotels. It's basic and good to go to if you're just looking to get away and not deal with the crowds. However, beware of the Vdara reflecting ray. You don't want to come back from Vegas looking like a lobster.

- Although the valet can take forever on a busy Sunday, the employees really work their ass off to get your car as soon as possible. You see them constantly running, which can't be an easy job to do for 8 hours a day. Hats off to them.

Cons:

- Even though the suite is modern, it's a bit cramped. I've stayed in similar suites elsewhere with more people, and there was much more walking space. Yes this, suite wasn't intended for a group of 10, but there are some areas of it that make you feel cramped even when it's empty. 

- There's no self parking. You either valet or park at the Cosmopolitan. Since most Vegas hotels have self parking, this became very confusing for us and we ended up going with the latter option. We only realized this by the next day, which brings me to my next point:

- If you self-park at the Cosmopolitan, it takes forever to find the Vdara on your first try. There's no signs or directions. You eventually have to walk to the curb outside and then take the stairs\/elevator up to the Vdara. This can be extremely frustrating for first timers. Does it hurt to build a walkway between Cosmo and Vdara?

- Room key checkers at the elevators are useless as always. Anyone without a key can easily slip in with a group and go in unnoticed. This security tactic never works. 

Overall, I had a fantastic stay at one of Vegas' newest and most modern hotels, once I figured out how to get to it...",2,0,0

Inconsistency:
I prepaid the reservation before arrival ( for three Panoramic Suites). I called the day before an asked how much the deposit was. I was told $100 cash deposit plus the resort fee.

Got there and it was $300 cash OR  $100 on a debit card. TO THEIR CREDIT: the money on the debit cards were credit back AS SOON as we checked out.


Resort Fee:
What a bunch of bull. Low speed internet that you have to manually connect to every time your screen times out. Sigh! Not even worth it. Two bottles of water daily for a suite?! Whatevs.

Rooms:
My room looked like it has seen better days. Couch looked very slept on, colors were very muted. Reminded me of aLoft a little. 

To their credit they let us check in to the room at like 11am. Very cool. Front desk people get 3 stars. There were three and they went in order of fantastic, new, newer. Checked into three rooms, were told three different things and had three different experiences simultaneously. 

My mom's room was dirty upon check in. They told her they were upgrading her to another room. When I went to look it was not the upgrade they promised, but I didn't have time to argue with them. 

The concierge was a joke. The cafe was a joke. The bar was also a joke. This reminded me of an apartment building where people sometimes stay as an hotel.

Overall, it was ok. But I wouldn't stay here again. 

Inconsistency from employees really had me miffed.

Housekeeping was a little TOO thorough. They put up EVERYTHING that was out. Sounds good in theory but I don't want my dirty clothes stuffed in my friends suitcase while we are out all day. Spent almost an hour sorting clothes & toiletries from each others suitcases. SIGH! 

Last, but certainly not least, they were checking room cards every time you neared the elevator. This applied to everyone except the hookers. There were so many!  I can't make this up! I guess I am a little green when it comes to how this works, but it doesn't seem okay for them to be openly negotiating prices in the lobby.",4,4,0

- and every room is a suite with kitchen and living area.

- absolutely upgrade to a Bellagio fountain view room (see my pic & video), in the floor 35-45 range. The views are incomparable. I actually sat with a glass of wine at night on the elevated desk for hours watching the Strip's neon lights and that spectacular water show.

Situated a teeeeeny bit behind the strip, Vdara is actually extremely accessible! There is a tram that runs from Monte Carlo (if you need to get to Wet Republic, etc) to City Center to Vdara. It is also connected to the Bellagio through a small walkway. Across the rotunda is Aria, and down the stairs leads you to Cosmo. Definitely very convenient. 

The rooms are nice and spacious. My girls and I tried the $20 sandwich trick and we got upgraded! Our rooms were next to one another, and had a beautiful view of the Aria and In-N-Out (OBVS THE BEST PART). There was a king bed as well as a pull-out queen bed (which was unfortunately not very comfortable). The bathrooms are sooooooooooo big which is a must for getting ready. There are also a TON of mirrors in the room, black out curtains, and a tub to soak your feet as well as a shower - which all added to the perfection of Vdara =) There is also a pretty legit sound system for you to plug in your music.

Vdara is an excellently designed and decorated, with a Scandinavian feel to it. It promotes itself as eco-friendly, which means no extra towels unless you specifically ask for it, and it houses the ""world renowned"" ESPA spa & salon (more on this below).

Our room was generously spacious, comparable to a nice studio apartment in NY. I could live in that space quite comfortably if need be. The room amenities are on par with other hotels on the Strip, and we were pleased. These is a covered walk-way to the nearby Bellagio, and the tram which will go to the Aria. The hotel is just right off the Strip, so access was easy. The restaurants and clubs in the hotel and its sisters are on par with the rest of Vegas.

I deduct a star for these reasons:

- The pool was closed. We could use the pool at its sister's hotel next door, the Aria. But walking outdoor to a different property was not enticing. (There was no indoor path to the Aria.)

- We called the concierge desk to help us get ticket to a Cirque de Soleil show at the Aria and was transferred to the ticket desk for the show. We could have done that ourselves.

- The ESPA spa was way overpriced, even by Vegas standards. The service was not amazing, though the facility was very nice. There was no coed area where the two of us can enjoy the hot tub or spa together. There was a common waiting area as we waited to be called for our massages.",2,1,0

Vdara is, as advertised, a hotel and spa, meaning no slot machines or tables anywhere in the vicinity.  When I arrived, I found out that there were booking issues with the room (as it was on the same weekend as EDC), and that the suite I reserved was no longer available.  Thus, I was downgraded into the standard suite, but given $50 worth of credit to be spent at Vdara or Aria for every day that I was there.  This pretty much paid for all of my food and beer expenses, so that was nice of them.

The suites are decently sized and feature the modern decor that you would expect of a Citycenter hotel.  They include your own personal kitchen, two televisions (one facing the couch, while the other faces the bedroom) and an extremely comfortable bed.  While the kitchen does come with a fridge, it is pretty small, so don't count on being able to store much inside.  Each suite comes with a fold out couch, but I highly advise not sleeping on them, as they're somewhat uncomfortable and don't come with pillows.

The facility itself is pretty cool, with a lot of places to sit and chat throughout the lobby.  I came to notice that the pool sits directly on top of Vdara's entrance, but unfortunately is very small compared to others that you can find around the strip.  That was very disappointing to me, considering that I went in the heat of Summer and was hoping for a large pool area.

It should be noted that valet service is free for hotel guests, so don't spend too much time looking around for parking once you're there.  The valets are also very helpful if you're looking for something specific in Vegas.  Though free valet service is cool, just keep in mind that it can be a pain to leave, especially on Sundays around noon when a lot of other guests are also on their way out.

Overall, Vdara is a pretty nice hotel to stay at if you're looking for a relaxing weekend in Vegas.  This isn't to say, however, that you should not stay here if you're hoping for a booze-filled party fest that most young folks go to Sin City for, though there are better places to stay for that.",3,1,1

We were gladly given an upgrade without any hesitation, thanks to the kind front desk. Loved that this place has valet parking only, which made our trip much easier. The spectacular view made us think about our lovers as it had a romantic touch to it as well!

There is no casino at this hotel, which was not a problem for our party. It will just give you an excuse to go on a little adventure around the strip, hahah. The place doesn't smell like cigarettes, another huge plus!

I mean, I'm going to Vegas to lose money, not stay in my hotel room all weekend. ;) I'll have to say, though, that it was well worth the price (about $340 for 2 nights).

Check-In was a breeze. My friends and I got the Deluxe Suite and my, oh my, was it sweet! We had a party of 8 and were able to get conjoined rooms. SUPER-AWESOME! The room itself came with a king bed and pull-out queen, 2 HD-TVs, a shower and separate bathtub, and a kitchenette! Internet also came with the room, so that's always a plus if you've got some business or social-networking to handle.

We were pretty hungry the night we arrived and decided on some room service. We must have called the kitchen 3 times as a couple of my other friends trickled in. The service didn't take long to arrive, they had set a nice little dining setup in our kitchenette, and the food was good and hot. No complaints here!

The next day, we went out to the pool. We grabbed a cabana (which you can see in more detail from Nicole J.'s review) and life at that moment was just great. Katie, our personal wait staff, was more than excellent. She was super friendly and had a great sense of humor!

Check-out was also a breeze. I was leaving before my friends so the lady who was helping me said she'll leave a note in the system so that they won't clean the room until noon. Great!

My only complaint is that there were no hookups for my ipod\/mp3 player. The other hotels I've been to usually have a crummy radio clock with an auxiliary cable but not Vdara. Out of all places, I would have never thought they wouldn't have this available. I mean, how else am I suppose to get ready with my girls in our hotel room without our own music? Thank goodness I caught my friend before she left and she brought a pair of speakers. The night was saved!

Overall, great experience. It's a nice place to stay if you wanna feel a little fancy and would prefer a non-gaming\/smoking hotel.

I have stayed at the corner suite each time and the view is just breathtaking. If you are going as a couple, it is a very sexy intimate room and you have full kitchen if you need to cook, mix drinks or stock up on some beer. The best part of the Vdara (at least for me) is that there is NO CASINO, meaning that your clothes wont be smelling like cigarette smoke and you don't have to deal with the loud casino noise including the drunks. The only reason I didn't give Vdara 5 stars is because they don't offer any ""loyalty discounts"" for returning guests (the rooms are pretty pricy) and the kitchen is not stocked with any plates, cups or silverware.

1) It is impossible to figure out how to get to this hotel by car. There is only one ramp entrance, and it so well-hidden it would win in hide-and-seek.

2) We paid for the Vdara Suite, but due to the high occupancy on Memorial Day Weekend, we were downgraded to a tiny room WITHOUT being told so!!! Imagine downgrading from a suite that is supposed to have two rooms, a full-sized fridge, and TWICE the square footage of the tiny single room you're ""mistakenly"" assigned to. Thankfully, some angry ranting fixed the problem for the following night, which included an upgrade to the Executive Suite, $100 in room service credit, and complimentary champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries.

3) Free wifi is unreliable on the iPhone.

4) The shower walls are transparent, so if you're taking a dump, you'll get a show. And vice versa, except not so pleasant for the person showering.

But I guess it has some perks:

1) It is ridiculously close to Marquee Dayclub and Nightclub at the Cosmopolitan, so you don't have to taxi back. Just make sure you're sober enough to take advantage of the short distance.

2) Parking is mandatory valet, which is convenient.

3) It doesn't have a casino since it's the sister of Aria, so it's slightly cheaper.

4) The interior is beautiful, hip, and modern.

5) The downstairs cafe has bomb iced coffee, apparently.

Is it a time share?  I am not sure, so if the kitchenette is a selling feature for you should ask.   

Our view was lovely but I am not sure it should be considered a  view of the strip, it was more a view of the Aria (and supposable we had an upgraded view) - no where to eat at this hotel unless you want the café downstairs, which was not at all what we had in mind.   This hotel was a little off the beaten path, but not by much and it felt like wasted a lot of time getting to the Strip & the activities, shows etc. that we had planned, so I probably would not stay here again.

Anyone who has been to Sin City will tell you, there are several ways to enjoy the lights and sounds of this great city.

For this trip, which was the first time we did Vegas with just Joy and I....
No entourage, no commitments to meet people, nothing but the wife and I... Bliss!!! Add the fact this was a 40th year Birthday present to myself and you will understand the fun factor involved....

I knew that I wanted to stay in a high end hotel that would make me feel like a high roller without breaking the bank. To do that I needed to find a ""deal"". 

Whats great about Vegas is if you do enough searches you will end up finding the ""mid-week"" pricing very reasonable...

And so it was I found Vdara Hotel, Mid-week pricing with a Pool side Day bed rental and Credit at the bar.

Vdara is located in the ""city center"" area, and driving into the Valet area already gives you the feeling you made the right decision.

Check in was a breeze, and off to our room we went.
Walking into the room, I already knew that I was gonna love this stay. Modern Decor, 2 flat screens, a huge Bathroom with a tub and shower. Auto Blinds and Shades on the windows and a pretty comfy bed. Oh yeah and a kitchenette. 

We enjoyed the poolside Day bed and used up our bar credit on a delicious pitcher of Black Berry Mojitos. The server, Megan, at the pool was great and easy going, and allowed us to use the ""VIP"" Pool, which is normally reserved for the Cabanas.

The Vdara is also a smoke free, no Casino Hotel. 
Wait, What? No casino? Whats the point. 

Well, sometimes people go to Vegas not to gamble... In fact the whole trip we only spent $40 on the gambling part, and reserved our funds for Awesome Food, Drinks and a show.

Hotel Room service was also great, although pricey, but then again, Its Vegas....

Overall this was a great hotel stay and I can wish that someday I could afford the regular pricing and just stay there whenever I wanted... Someday....",0,0,0

Oh, and the fully automated shades and daily ""turn down"" service was pretty impressive, too!
  
Throughout my weekend stay, service was on point and the hotel staff didn't miss a beat.  Even on my last day, they provided complimentary limousine service to the airport!  Very swank.

My only complaint would be that my darn ears kept popping as I rapidly ascended the elevator to the 54th floor.  But hey the view from that soaring height was worth a few annoying pops in my ear and luckily after a couple of days, i adjusted ;)  

The spa at the hotel was also clean, contemporary and most importantly, relaxing. They had all the facilities i've come to expect from a fine resort hotel spa (i.e. TV lounge with refreshments, expansive fitness room, jacuzzi & whirlpool, steam room, and sauna.  

Located inside the newly built City Center, this smoke free & eco-friendly hotel is within walking distance to all the local hotspots, dining, and entertainment on the main strip.

Our unit also had a washer and dryer which we were excited about, but the dryer took 3+ hours to get our clothes mostly dry. Engineering came to look at it but whatever they did did not help much. 

The in room internet was a joke. It was incredibly slow or not working the entire stay. It was unusable even for basic internet use. 

I spoke to a manager about all our problems and she waived the resort fee (because of the internet) and gave us a room credit. These things helped make us feel better, but I doubt we will go back. There are a lot of much nicer places for not much more. We stayed at Aria on the same trip and had a wonderful experience.

I loved the casino-less vibe and it's tranquil environment. My suite was awesome, eat-in kitchen, sofa, bedroom and bathroom. Great tub for relaxation and a comfortable bed. Room was clean, decor was nice and all window coverings were electronic. One gripe was the bathroom door... it was 'frosted' - in other words 'see through'. I didn't like that, thankfully I was traveling alone, it would have been weird otherwise.

The giant let down in the room was the one thing I paid extra for - the kitchen. After I had flown into town and spent a full day house hunting all I wanted to do was check-in and make myself a nice warm tea. This proved to be quite the drama. The kitchen was not equipped with anything. I had to call housekeeping and ask for a pan (to boil water) and a cup. After waiting the best part of 45 minutes (!!!) room service arrived with a pan... but no cup. Another 10 minutes and one arrived. Of course I could have gone downstairs and bought a Starbucks for less than the housekeeping tip but I don't care for their drinks.

Anyways, my point being, why provide a kitchen if you don't provide any utensils? Why make me call housekeeping for something that should just - be there. It's like giving me a bed without a pillow.

I mean we made slot of noise and security did notify us that there was a noise complaint but they were very understanding that we were having a birthday party. We did from that point in keep it down!

Well, not really priceless given you are in Las Vegas. After having stayed at the Vdara a few times over the years it's time for a attaboy. I had the pleasure to spend three nights in an executive corner suite for about $180 a night all in (including tax, resort fee, and whatever else they tack on these days). The 50th floor room has great views all over south Las Vegas. Vdara is a no-casino resort, which makes getting in and out easy and quick. It's a bit of hassle to get to Cosmo or Aria as there are not directly linked from within the property. 

I do enjoy the Vdara because they offer great rooms at affordable prices in the middle of the new center of Las Vegas. The 800+ sqft suite has well appointed amenities including a big fridge and washer\/dryer combo. The perfect place to have 6-8 people over for pre-dinner entertainment. I noticed the staff to be very courteous from valet staff to house keeping to room service. 

Thank you Vdara for a great stay - we'll be back.",3,1,1

When we first give our car to the valet guy the bell boy helps us with our bags and the last thing he says to me is that I won't be seeing him from this point on and that another bell boy will be taking my bags and with a awkward pause I realize he wants me to tip him immediately. I could tell this is beginning of a bad stay especially since I've stayed at nice places and I know when to tip. It's thanksgiving I get it...

On first arrival of the room there were already numerous large stains on the floor which I feel like they could hit it again with a rug doctor. It wasn't something you wanna see in the middle of the floor when you walk in and out of the room. Already I had the feeling that the floor wasn't that clean. 

Second the bedroom night light didn't work. So either you had to have the entire large room lights on or nothing on by the bed. This sounds like I'm being picky but the entire light and mount on the bed frame was wobbly and falling apart. When they said they would fix it, it would take them an hour possibly. 

The TV was lose at it's hinges and nearly fell off as my wife put stuff in the cabinets below it. I called management and they sent a repair man up who confirmed that they were installing new hinges and the previous team didn't tighten them properly. 

Lastly we have a suite. It comes with a kitchen. I would like to cook. As I call for some utensils the night of to cook it's about 8:00. They ask me how many people will be dining in and thats it. I get a ring at 8:30 and they than give me 2 setting of plates with forks and knive setting and a rather large plastic past spoon to cook with. That's it........ I don't know about you guys but when you cook you need more than just a plastic spoon to cook with. I needed at least some tongs to flip over the steaks. So I call again and request some tongs and some bowls. an hour passes and nobody I call and they said they'd send somebody up right away. 30min passes no body I call the front desk and make a complaint and he is even surprised telling me there is a long line of requests waiting over and hour. Long story short he's on it. 20min later my dinner is ruined.... It's 10pm I decided to cook the steaks without their help. I grabbed the ice tongs from the ice bucket and got it to work. The kitchen btw has like 6 different cabinets with absolutely nothing in them. I feel like I'm at a open house with everything removed...The fridge is not even cold because it's frozen completely so I'm thawing it out.....

Parking is notorious here btw because there is no self parking you gotta pay 18$ a day to valet it takes about 30min to get your car. 

So as I check out I tell the lady how our stay was. We had stayed for 3nights spent prob over 700$ including their daily resort fees. I tell her I'm not trying to be a prick and nicely tell her on. She shows some type of regret for what had happened but brushed it aside and said she'd refund me 2 resort day fees which is like $70 but still charge me for another day and the valet parking and my room service. In all honesty the hotel didn't feel that awesome the staff was alright and I hate to admit this but Trump hotel still ranks better in my book. I've paid less at Trump and got a much better response from the staff. I'm not asking for freebies but when I've already paid for a lot and your response is to the point of hey we'll comp your sodas it's more of a slap in the face than comping me nothing to be honest. Show me you care and believe me . It takes only a second for that. If you know I didn't have a great stay and had to stay in my room numerous times to deal with bullshit that is supposed to be fixed before I get there or make me wait very long times.. Get your manager and show me your gonna try to make this better for the next guess. Your default save cannot be I'll take off the resort fee. That's already a bullshit fee that all the hotels tag on now to make more money. I know some people won't have the same experience that I do and that's because maybe the system wasn't tested at the time but let me tell you when it rains at Vdara it pours.",1,0,0

I wasn't sure about the absence of a casino, but it was actually nice to come back to a calm, quiet building after a long night.  It's a really short walk to Aria and Bellagio, so I never felt too far from the action.

We stayed on the 11th floor with a pool view and found it really hard to sleep once the music started playing at the pool at 8am.  It didn't seem like it would be a problem, but it was actually pretty loud.  I really liked the kitchenette - we didn't cook anything but I liked having an empty fridge for water.  

The pool was really great.  Not too fancy, but there were plenty of places to lay out or find shade if needed.  There were tons of staff walking around eager to help or take drink orders.

After discussing it we settled on Las Vegas because neither of us had ever been.  We were VEGAS NEWBIES who heard tons of great tales of fab vacations, ritzy shows, fine dining & glorious shopping expeditions.  Within 1 week we booked 5 days\/ 4 nights package at the VDARA HOTEL & SPA.  The pkg was quite reasonably priced for air\/limo\/hotel\/showtickets.  The one negative with the package was with the airline tickets ... our round trip seats were not together: 2 COACH tickets & 2 BUSINESS CLASS tickets.  Biz class has a lot more leg room & larger seat but alas they made for QUICK TRADES for the 2 lucky fliers seated next to our coach seats. 

The VDARA is a beautiful boutique hotel.  We booked a Panoramic suite and the landscape view of the strip and mountains, room & amenities were fantastic!  Its a short trot to connecting hotels: THE COSMPOLITAN & ARIA.  True ... rooms are not assigned pre-stocked w\/ the essentials ( kitchen supplies, laundry detergent, etc) but everything was furnished upon request.  TIP: Take stock of what's missing upon check-in, jot down the list & turn it in to concierge.  It will be managed nicely.  Concierge also assisted us w\/ a dinner reservation & 1 day car rental too!  Must also mention how striking the arrangements of fresh flowers, potted plants & live trees were at the ARIA ... mountains & yards of complex colorful arrangements as far as the eye can see.

The MICHAEL JACKSON ONE show at Mandalay Bay was good but not great.  The high majority of the ticket buying audience is ADULT: I'd more appreciate the show's central theme to be a bit more mature Vs. LOST KIDS. I particularly liked how pics of the audience were captured & combined w\/ newspaper headlines projected on overhead ceilings!  I saw my face there several times!!!  Michael Jackson 's hologram performs at show end; its a tad smaller size than expected but a very good reproduction. Very life like & smooth motions.  Thankfully I was seated in row 3!  A keepsake picture is a must!

Half of the trip we ate breakfast\/lunch\/dinners at the ARIA.  The last half we dined b\/l\/d at THE WICKED SPOON inside THE COSMOPOLITAN.  WS WINS HANDS DOWN!!!  Very comfortable dining experience.  We absolutely delighted in the opulent choices of every food\/beverage you can possibly imagine.  Masterfully prepared, showcased and served.  $50 each for breakfast $100 each for dinner.   Trust me you can and will try every food station!  Blew my mind to see diners returning from the seafood station 2 and 3 times w\/ shrimp & king crab legs piled high on plates!

The shopping was divine . . .  we dropped a nice bundle NOT ON THE TABLES but with retailers we frequent COACH, FENDI, LUCKY BRAND, MARC ECKO, etc.  All located within a short 15 min drive from Vdara.  The deals were UNBELIEVABLE - - - a mere 30-40% of retail.

We can't wait to return to Las Vegas . . . the surface was barely scratched!!!  The sooner the better.  I'll add my pics ASAP.",0,0,0

So, I wanted to stay around CityCenter so I can check it out.  I was debating between Aria and Vdara but ended up booking at Vdara because Hotwire had a good rate for the place.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay.  

Pros - Nice looking hotel.  Ambience is nice.  Smells nice!  No smoke!  The rooms are roomy, but smaller than I expected.  The furniture is contemporary looking.  The bed is comfortable and there's a little sheet of paper that said you can actually buy these beds, which cost like $2000 for a King Sized bed.  Hmm...I don't know if they were that comfortable.

Cons - Long wait at check-in.  We arrived around 10pm after a long drive and we had to wait behind multiple people because Vdara only had ONE person checking in guests.  Valet only parking, which is free - just tip the valet.  VERY LOW shower water pressure!  The water was barely dripping out of the showerhead.  

There is a free monorail shuttle next to the lobby that connects Vdara to Crystals(the shopping center), Bellagio, Aria and Monte Carlo which is convenient.  
My wife used the spa facility which she said was very nice.  

Overall, it is a good hotel, but I think if I were to stay at Citycenter again, I would pick Aria.  It's a much better looking hotel with plenty of restaurants and the facility just looks nicer.",1,0,1

They asked us for another chance to stay with them to show how Vdara truly is.  I appreciate the offer, plus the quick response to my issues.  Though we have no immediate plans to visit Vegas, Guest Relations extended the offer even longer due to the distance of where I live. thank you VDARA - hopefully our next stay will be better!


Im not sure how anyone could consider this a 5-star resort. Some employees are obviously not up to par.  But some are amazing.  Front desk and valets were awesome! House keeping not so much. The elevator security may look the part in a suit... but lack refinement.

The first day of housekeeping was a disaster. Mixture of us first forgetting to turn on DND light, forgetting to turn off when we had lunch. We had it done at 2pm when we hit the pool.  When we came back the door was not closed. They left cleaning solution in the room. Nothing was missing, so we decided to just let it be.

2nd morning again we forgot the DND light. A guy rings bells saying he needed to stock mini bar. I told him we were still sleeping...but he was insistent\/rude about being quick. I just let him in so I could get back to sleep. So our mini bar wasn't filled before we got in? And it took 2 days of our stay before you planned to do it? It was locked, so we never bothered to open...and had our drinks at the pool.

The pool...on a Saturday had 2 girls for drinks. We were at the front of the pool closer to bar.  We waited 30 mins for A girl to pass by..then 15-20 for her to return.  On a Saturday? At the Mandalay bay\/Moorea we had 5 girls serving 15 max patrons in a small pool.

The elevator guys need to get that stick out of their but.  If we have a key card in hand..facing you as we walk by...there is little reason to slow us down...even stop us. We did have one incident that was a fault of our friends visiting. He didn't know it was a smoke free resort. So the guy told him to take it outside to extinguish. I could tell the guy was upset at our guest, but tries to hold it in.  Rest of us were still there by elevator waiting, and when he returned without the CIG..we tried to go in...this guy stops us saying he needed to see the room key again. Are you serious? You just saw my card 2 minutes ago.  Either make new room keys that they can see better...or train them better.  I orig gave it 3-stars... but as I drafted this review...I realized how much worse the stay was.  We decided to switch from a Caesars property because of a wonderful stay at Mandalay bay a few months earlier. Paying that much more for 1 extra star...and plain horrible exp....I can't say I'd recommend the Vdara to anyone.

 The positives (2 stats earned). Room was better then avg.  The beds were great. The gym was nicely equipped for us gym junkies. Pool itself was nice. Front desk friendly... valets were friendly.",3,1,1

Even with the bathroom sink and shower going, I was told it will take 15 minutes of water running before the hot water would arrive. Seriously? In drought? I expected more for almost $300\/night.

Otherwise, the view was great. The suite wasn't too cramped. The kitchen was functional. The fridge wasn't cold enough to store food though.

The living room and bed were separated by two huge flat screen tvs. The bathroom had a tub and a separate shower, which is nice. The window blinds and shades are like Aria and can be controlled by a switch.  
I also liked how there is a full kitchen that you can use.
I like that there is no casino in the actual hotel, therefore no smoke all around the lobby, and the elevators to access your rooms are not a half a mile away! The quick access to a tram is nice as well. And a quick walk through the Aria, and you can be on the strip.

There's no casino downstairs so if you're really into gambling, then this place is NOT for you! But if you like modern, clean hotels with excellent service, then Vdara is perfect! We stayed in their deluxe suite and the guy at check-in was really nice and gave us a room with a view of the strip where we could see the Bellagio water show from our room! Awesome!

Our room came with a living room, kitchen with microwave, stove, and fridge, bathroom, bedroom with a king size bed, and the sofa was a pull-out queen size bed. Also, complementary wifi and 2 free water bottles per day. They also have a fitness center that is free to use for hotel guests which is really great! I know the Palazzo has an amazing fitness center but even if you're a guest, you have to pay a LOT to use it.

Vdara is right next to Cosmopolitan so it's perfect if you're looking to eat at Wicked Spoon Buffet or go to Marquee or Chandelier Lounge.

Don't send a mobile check in notification asking when I plan to check in, if you are not planning to consider my response.

I showed up at the exact time I identified in response to your email. The person at the counter said the room was not ready and made a phone call to housekeeping and told them my room was a rush. Went to your bar and spent money waiting for my room to be cleaned. 

Two hours later... Still at the bar, I called the front desk... I explained the situation and thought I may have missed the call or the wrong number was on file to notify me my room was ready. Instead, I received a lecture that the normal check in time was 3pm and they had no idea when my room would be ready. Extremely rude.

We loved having a whole kitchenette inside our room, the bed was comfortable, the bathtub was huge, and the black out curtains were a nice extra. We appreciated how modern everything in the room was.

The suites are modern and contemporary. The bedrooms are a nice size and comfortable. 
Even though it's tucked away in the back of City Center (whether intentionally or unintentionally), you can walk to Bellagio from a walkway connected to the hotel, Aria and Cosmopolitan are walking distance next door, and the City Center Tram can drop you off at Crystals and the Monte Carlo and you're a short walk to Planet Hollywood. 

Service has been superb. If you use the kitchen in the suite, housekeeping will bring you utensils AND cookware!

There is an experience expectation that is an integral part in the rating of a Vegas lodging. 

That being said, the Vdara would be a strong 4 stars in most cities.  It is a new modern hotel. Clean and crisp with dark wood, comfortable beds and spacious rooms. However, for a new hotel it misses the mark on several levels. Coarse uncomfortable towels, lack of plugs by the bed (alert to architects: everyone has a cellphone) and lack of basic essentials such as a coffee maker in the room are inexcusable. The hotel also lacks other basic amenities such as a full service restaurant.  A small coffee shop style bistro is not a restaurant.  The fact that the Vdara staff has to direct guests to sister properties for so much is a problem.  Also, the fact that it has no casino and is offset from the strip may be nice for some, however for most it is extremely inconvenient. In order to walk anywhere at all you need to fully walk through either the Aria or Bellagio or take an expensive cab ride.

Unless you are a troglodyte, stay somewhere else that will give you the full experience... or at least... a meal?",0,0,0

There are no casinos or fancy restaurants in the Vdara, but their room service is good.  The gym is very nice.  The pool is less crowded than the party pools, but has enough people to people watch.  One of my faves.  The spa is beautiful, and well stocked (shower supplies, razors, bobby pins, hair products, nuts, tea, fruit, etc), but on the small side for the price.

We have been staying at the Vdara Hotel for the past 5 years for both business and pleasure. This time we checked in on a very busy day and the front desk staff recognized we are loyal customers and upgraded us to the panoramic view suite that can see both the Vdara & Cosmopolitan pools.  Unfortunately it took close to 2 hours for them to have the room cleaned & ready for us. We waited in the lobby thinking what a waste of time and may be the upgrade wasn't worth it. Finally we got the room around 5pm and it was really hot inside (May be because it faced kind of West). We turned the air con down very low hoping when we return from dinner & shopping it will be nice and cool. When we returned around 11pm it was still over 76 degrees in both the living & bedrooms.  So we called front desk for maintenance to come fix the air con. As we waited my wife said if they can't fix it we have to get another room...etc. Within 20 minutes after I placed the call a knock on the door and we have our help.  The young man introduced himself as Rick and asked very politely if he may enter our room to check our air conditioning for us. He worked on the 2 air conditioning units quickly and without making a mess. In no time we can feel the cool air circulating in the rooms.  As he finished up his work he asked if there is anything else he can do or help arrange for us to have an enjoyable stay at the Vdara hotel.  Both my wife and my self were in the hotel industry in our younger days and maintenance staff we encountered in both the U.S. and foreign countries all have the same tired, sweaty, blank face appearances who can care less about customer service. But Mr. RICK Valencia was very well groomed, physically very fit, and gave us a big smile from the moment he showed up at the door.

I didn't see much of the hotel other than the room and the lobby, but everything I did see looked clean and modern. The only dining options are room service and a small cafe located off the lobby. I didn't try either. 

A standard room is pretty spacious. There's a small kitchenette as you enter complete with a stove top, two-person dining table, microwave and mini fridge. Half of the fridge is used for the minibar (don't touch anything in there!) and the other half is empty. You have to request plates and silverware if you need them. Past the kitchen is a large room with a sofa, chair and bed. The mattress was really soft and comfy, as were the pillows. The bathroom was fairly standard -- nothing to write home about.

I've only checked out a few hotel rooms on the strip but I'd have to rate this one below the ones I've experienced at The Palazzo, Cosmo, and Caesars. All of which have more interesting layouts, design, and amenities. Our room at Vdara wasn't bad, it was just kinda dull. 

One big positive (if you're looking for a place that's quiet) is that it doesn't have a casino or club so there's a lot less noise. Another positive is the front desk. We didn't have to wait long to get checked in and they were nice enough to send up a complimentary bottle of champagne to our room.

The negatives are:
- Few dining options
- Not convenient if you plan to walk to other casinos since it's not directly on the Strip (it's set back behind the Cosmo on Harmon)
- No self parking. It's all valet, which is nice when you drop off your car. But waiting for your car when you want to leave can take a while during peak hours.",5,2,4

The Aria tram makes it convenient to get to casinos on that end of the strip and it connects the other way to the Bellagio and then on to Caesar's Palace.

It's a lot cheaper staying here than Cosmo and Aria and I feel like the ambiance and rooms are just as good. You can definitely get rates here as low as $100 a night even on a weekend night. We stayed here on a Saturday night and the rate was only $109 a night!! Worth it!!!

Upon arrival, one of the things I've noticed is that they don't have a self parking structure like most Vegas hotels and valet only. Since we were only staying one night, I didn't mind the valet. The people here are very courteous and nice and check in was a breeze. The decor of the hotel is nice and modern. I really like the interior of the hotel. Nice and simple. 

The rooms here are one of the nicest I've seen! The kitchenette has a stove top and separate sink and also had a little dining area!!! It was super convenient to have especially since we togo a whole pizza from Cosmo and got to enjoy it in the dining area!! It also has a separate living area with a pull out couch which I really liked! 

The only downside to this hotel is that it's a lot smaller than most major Vegas hotels and it doesn't have a casino. I need my gambling if I'm staying in LV so I need my slots and craps tables. Also, it doesn't have much dining options as well. The hotel is SUPER small so if you're staying here more than one night, get ready to trek across the street to Aria or Cosmo to get your dining or gambling fix bc you're not going to get it here.

What hotel room doesn't have a coffee pot now-a-days???? We asked the concierge if we can get a coffee pot in our room. He said the only rooms that have coffee pots are the suites.  He said he would call and see if there were any extra coffee pots available.  The concierge called while we waited.  We were told there were no extra coffee pots available. So what does that mean, if a coffee pot in a suite breaks, they wouldn't be able to replace it for the guest.  Not likely! So we had to go to the little cafe inside Vdara.  Two small cups of coffee and two danishes totaled $27. Hmmm ~ maybe this is why the Vdara doesn't want you to make coffee in your room.

A day later, we return to the concierge for assistance is obtaining tickets to a show.  This was a different concierge, a lady.  She was practically as useful as the man the day before.  She didn't want to look for the tickets.  She said she has never filled a request to get tickets for The Bodies Exhibit and Titanic.  The reason we went to her for the tickets is because I called the Exhibit to get tickets and they told me the Vdara concierge can take of it for us.  The Vdara concierge acted as if she didn't want to deal with it.  However, she finally picked up the phone and asked another employee and she was finally able to figure out how to get us tickets.

No one really went to my room to really fix it until my last night there. Even after it was fixed, I was still getting boiling water that would sometimes give a touch of cold water.

And when I say ""work"", I'm not in town for large-scale conferences or promotions. Usually meetings and events are off The Strip and I try to steer clear of the madness in this crowded part of Sin City. However, I'm also trying to stay within a certain budget for hotels for work visits, so it just so happened that Vdara's nightly rate was well below most the dates of my most recent trip.

My room at Vdara had seen better days. Both TV's were broken. The side table drawers didn't stay closed. The bathroom had stains on the wallpaper and towels. If the room next door is having a party, you can hear them very clearly through the vents. Upon check in, the front desk attendant boasted that this was a relaxing Strip option... but I didn't feel very relaxed when staying two nights.

The location is ideal for partying in the heart of Las Vegas. Terrible if you're trying to get out The Strip for any reason. I didn't rent a car since it's pretty expensive to park or valet. Picking up a shared ride wasn't too bad, though Uber's app automatically sets you up at Aria across the street. Not the most convenient setup for pick up or dropping off.

The only saving grace was the staff -- they were extremely friendly and did their best to maintain a sense of professionalism. Not an easy feat in Las Vegas! The housekeeping staff was especially wonderful, so extra props to them. 

I wouldn't recommend staying at Vdara again, unless you get a really amazing deal and are there to party hard in the center of Las Vegas nightlife. I've stayed at other Strip properties that were much nicer, at a similar rate, and convenient of you want to escape the hustle and bustle.",11,4,4

Vdara belongs to the ""new breed"" of hotels that have sprung up in Vegas in the last few years, so on the outside, it looks similar to Aria, The Cosmopolitan, Wynn, and Encore.  Nothing really exceptional about the exterior architecture, as it resembles that of a regular corporate building, only much larger, grander, and fancier.

Okay, so what were the things that made my stay at the hotel so spectacular?

1) THE LOBBY: IT SMELLED SO DAMN GOOD all day, errday!! No joke.  The moment you step foot into the air-conditioned flower garden that is their lobby, your olfactory system will undoubtedly be greeted by a pleasant wave of light, sweet floral notes. A wonderful smelling, smoke-free environment makes a hotel just THAT much better. I know my nose thanked me for it.

2) Check-in & Check-out: SUPER SPEEDY. There was no line and checking in only took about 10 minutes tops. As for checking out...we didn't really have to! One of the hotel employees quickly asked us how our stay was, followed by a request for our e-mail address to send the receipt, and that was it! :)

3) The Suite: Clean, fresh, modern, simple, and very contemporary.  Not to mention, we had a FABULOUS view to boot! :) The bed was super comfortable and had green accent pillows, bathroom was very spacious with a shower and a tub. The kitchen was sleek, and we also got complimentary water bottle.

4) Services: Housekeeping was extremely fast and fulfilled our requests for more towels and blankets within an impressive 10 minutes.  I loved that we also got complimentary valet parking :)

I have seen a few reviews with complaints about the furnishings being worn in the rooms and or the rooms not having a good view etc. Well I was completely pleased with the furnishings and view from our room.

The only nitpick I would have would be that the utensils that are sent up to the rooms upon request are woefully inadequate to either prepare a meal and or for seating a meal but that was a small matter compared to the overall awesomeness of Vdara.

The staff is always friendly, and both times I have stayed here, the staff accomodated an early check-in. If you have to wait for a few minutes, you can enjoy an Illy coffee or latte at the market cafe' in the lobby or sit in one of the comfy chairs.

One of my other favorite things about this hotel is that you don't have to walk through a casino to get to your hotel room, the elevators are right next to the check-in area! The rooms are all spacious suites, and there is plenty of room to spread out, set out your clothes, and store luggage. The bathrooms are spacious as well, and I love that everything always smells wonderful, not matter where you are in the hotel.

Big modern suite, amazing view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip, across to Rio and Palms, from the 49th floor. Check in was fast and friendly. All staff very helpful. Very attentive service by the pool on the day we paid for a bed, although the gf got ignored when down there on her own the next day. 

Perfect location IMO, so close to the Bellagio with a direct walk in that if you prefer a modern non smoking environment, there's nowhere better. 

Plus the beds are so comfortable!!!!

Only downside really is a bit of a trek to the strip, and the ridiculously slow lines at the market cafe. Not great coffee either, but a short walk through Aria to the edge of the Monte Carlo gets you to a Starbucks. 

Had one maintenance issue on the first day and staff were up within minutes and it was sorted. 

Will definitely be staying again!

We typically stay at the MGM but have recently begun to explore the other MGM properties. We have enjoyed Mandalay Bay, New York New York, Aria, and The Signature. This year, we booked a penthouse at the Vdara for a 4-day, New Year's Eve stay. While the staff was extremely gracious and helpful and the room was furnished stylishly, we were very disappointed with what we encountered once we settled in. We had to request the basic amenities - washcloths were not provided, the mini-bar was empty (although we never use it, we didn't want to be charged for the missing items), the bathrobes had no belts\/ties, the kitchen had no cleaning supplies (dish towels, soap, dishwasher soap). We were provided with wine glasses upon request, but were told there would be a charge for providing champagne flutes. We asked three times for paper towels but could not get them so we had to use the bathroom towels to dry our dishes.  The 2-quart trashcan in the kitchen did not even hold a small take-out containers so trash had to be placed on the floor. Coffee was provided but no sugar\/creamer packets were included. A washer and dryer came with the room, but no laundry soap. Although we requested the missing items, we only received the washcloths, dish soap and wine glasses.

The bathroom has almost no counter space for toiletries. Although we were encouraged to save energy and reuse our bathroom towels, there was only one small hook over the sink (no towel racks at all). The Internet, while ""free"" with the $25-per day resort free, took more than 20 minutes each day to establish he 1Mbs connection. We are not picky people, but were surprised that Vdara chose style without considering the essentials. We certainly would not classify this as a penthouse experience nor a Forbes 4-Star Hotel as the advertising indicated. Needless to say, we will not stay at Vdara again. For those looking for a condo-like experience, we highly recommend the Signature at MGM. All of the basic amenities are provided at check-in (washcloths, kitchen supplies, etc. coffee, creamer, sugar, salt, pepper), the bathroom, living room, kitchen and bedroom are far more spacious and less costly than Vdara.",7,0,1

Pros:
- Great value for your $.
- Non-smoking, non-gambling. 
- Included valet. Very friendly and will provide you directions to anywhere you're going.
- Modern
- Soaking Tub
- Huge windows with automated shades
- Great bed (feel so great in the morning!)
- Starbucks on premises
- Cafe (although we never went there, too expensive and limited choices)
- A short walk from Aria and Jean Philippe Patisserie (amazing crepes, don't miss out!)
- Easy checkout. You can check out on your TV, just make sure the bill looks right. 

Cons:
- Was not as clean as we'd like. Hair in the bathroom, dirty windows, furniture smudges.
- No in-suite kitchenette. Wouldn't be a big deal if it didn't take over 40 minutes to get anything from housekeeping. 
- We were charged $5 for a tiny bottle of water in the cooler. We thought this was complementary b\/c the description of prices mentioned a specific water brand and that wasn't what we drank. Not a huge deal, but the fact that it was so difficult to distinguish what's charged and what isn't doesn't sit well with me. 
- Walls not as thick as you'd like them to be. Woke up by the screaming sound of someone next door. Not sure if all the rooms are like that, but our was. This is probably a one time thing but I'd like to mention it anyway. 

Overall this hotel has a lot going for it, away from the bright night light but close enough that you could walk there. 

Tips:

Vdara is right across from Aria entrance (there are several). Once you go up the ramp and see Aria, just keep driving around until you see Vdara valet. 

An excellent crepe and other foods place called Jean Phillipe Patisserie is right inside Aria (just go left as you exit the lobby). 

There is a tram that will take you down the strip a ways (easiest access to the strip). The walkway to the tram is inside Vdara right next to the Starbucks. There's no easy way to get to the strip directly from hotel, I recommend taking the tram every time.",3,1,1

I've seen many hotel suites in Vegas before including Caesars Palace, The Palazzo, The Venetian, and The Hotel at Mandalay Bay.  The suite that my friends stayed in had a lot of features that many hotels i've stayed in didn't have.  There was a small mini kitchen in our suite that included a stove top and range hood.  Some other features include a doorbell system that doubles as a ""do not disturb"" as well as maid service signal.  There were also automated blinds that would go up and down with the push of a button. There were also different types of room set-ups with dual 42 inch flat screens that split the living area and the bedroom area that my friends stayed at.  The suite we got only had one flat screen, but felt more spacious.  .   
I have to say the best part of staying in a suite at the Vdara is the view.  The view from my room was a view of the Luxor, MGM, and Mandalay Bay.  The view across the hall had the Bellagio, so we saw a lot of fountain shows when my friends were hanging out in that room.  

Some of the pros of the hotel is that the air is infused with some kind of scent, but i guess it's bad for the guests who want a substance free feel.  The other pro is that the entire hotel is smoke free.  There is also a walkway to the Bellagio and a tram that connects the hotel to the city center which is cool.  

The only con i could think of about the hotel is that it isn't exactly on the strip.  It's a fairly decent walk to get onto the strip.

With the advent of more and more hotel rooms cropping up in recent years... an undeclared all out war b\/w casinos has emerged to attract the average consumer dollar.  Thus, resulting in a win-win situation for Vegas tourists.

Imagine our luck when we stayed at this new and beautiful property for around $900 on a 3 night weekend in July.  I know, there were cheaper options but none could fulfill our criteria in which only this place could provide.

Criteria:

1) Had to be centrally located on the strip: check
2) 5 star or comparable property: check
3) Needs to be a suite with at least a separate living area: check
4) Needs to be a newer property, that's fairly priced: check
5) Needs to be a non-smoking property: check, check and all check

We had the Vdara Suite, a beautiful 811sq ft suite that included a kitchen & dining area, washer\/dryer, separate living area, vanity area, jacuzzi & steam shower, king bedroom and pullout queen.  My first two criteria were the most imperative.  Several friends were staying at Aria, and I wanted to stay somewhere close to them w\/o actually being in the building itself.  Reason being, my girlfriend was with me on this trip, and we were looking for ""alone time"".... sooooo I don't want any extra guests easily crashing over at night.  Which, in turn, led to criteria number 2.  We did have my best friend staying with us, so that's why I needed a ""separate"" room\/living area for him.  -.^   Plus it's in the middle of the strip.  Ideal for everything.  That's probably why I stay at Ceasars or Bellagio often.  The room is very sleek and modern... and unlike The Hotel @ Mandalay Bay (another comparable property) its bright and well lit.

My knock on this property are as follows:

1) I can't have access to Aria's pool.  Vdara has a more elderly\/reserved clientele and their pool is not as ""lively"" as Aria's.  
2) There's only one restaurant on the property.  No 24 hour cafe.
3) It's terrible for pedestrians... stepping out and getting onto the strip by foot is quite an obstacle.
4) Since there was no casino, I had to walk across to Aria to gamble.  A considerable walk in itself.
5) Probably the most important reason for me:  I had to pay for my room.  Didn't play long enough to get my entire stay comped.",4,2,1

Unfortunately there's a wind tunnel when winds are super strong and it makes things loud at Veer.  Our condo is awesome tho and will comp us at Vdara when it happens (this is 1st time in 8 months it's gotten super loud and it took winds of 60 mph - so no big deal ).

Checkin (Tues at 3pm) was super easy and fast).  Requested high floor and she was happy to help even though I'm comped.  Quick ride up to 42nd floor to my suite.

Pros:
You're essentially getting a small condo i'd easily pay $50+ more for this vs a regular room at another 4 star property (MGM, etc)
Really nice layout for 580 sqft.  in the standard suite
Awesome tub
Comfortable furniture and bed, nicely appointed

smoke free :)
no gambling :)
awesome view from palms, rio, across i15 to bellagio, paris, fountains etc

Picky but would be nice to have a TV in the bathroom

The bathroom had great lighting which is something that most hotel bathrooms lack.  And the shower had a seat built into the wall in case you have the need to sit.

It takes a lot to get to the strip from this hotel since it is up on another level attached to the Aria. It was our first time to Vegas and we all booked at the same time so I expected all of us to be on the same floor. The receptionist was not able to make that happen. 1st disappointment of the trip, but I get that her hands were tied. I did not complain!
Then, this was supposed to be a non-smoking place yet several people were smoking inside and outside of the building. My parents were on the 7th floor, and they actually went and complained about someone smoking weed in a room that was next to them. We could also smell weed smoke from someone staying in a room on our floor, but we did not say anything because I seen how the situation was handled when my father told the front desk. Nothing happened!!
Then, there were issues with security who seen me come in and out for several days yet still felt the need to stop me and see if I had my hotel card key with me EVERY TIME we came back to the room. We stayed there for 4 days, I called the front desk numerous times, and I went to the Concierge desk numerous times so you would think they would have known that I was staying there. Yet, I did not see any security when a group of rowdy people (who were clearly drunk) came in yelling ""Aye"" very loudly all the way through the lobby and onto the elevators. It is Vegas- I get it, but don't stop and harass my family and just let these other people go by. Be fair, and stop everyone and not just certain people!!!

When we came back 2 hours later, the room was still not ready. That was annoying but they did give is a $50 credit to accommodate for the inconvenience. 

We booked a corner suite durning our stay. We were very impressed with the contemporary design of the room. The bathroom even had a nice window of Vegas.

Literally I have never slept in such an uncomfortable bed. Turns out that some of the beds have no floor board (not sure if that is the correct terminology) and the beds feels mushy and have no support. 

I don't usually experience back issues after sleeping but this bed made me so sore I woke up and took ibuprofen to deal with the pain. 

After complaining to the front desk and house keeping department and almost booking a flight back to Burbank... (A bad night sleep made me not want to be there any more because I was having day nightmares of the upcoming night) The bed did not get replaced... Then my boyfriend complained and followed up with everyone and eventually the housekeeping department installed the floor board and we had a slightly better nights sleep. 

Should it really take 4 complaints and half a day of waiting to make one's bed sleep worthy? My boyfriend and I are not your typical bad back people and I have never in my life complained about a hotel bed up until now. 

To make matters worse our room was being cleaned around 7pm when my boyfriend got back from his fashion convention and he needed to shower and change. The house keeping department had hours to clean it and it never happened. Needless to say we both were floored with the level of service at what appeared to be a nice hotel on the surface. 

Because of all the tragedies occurring I called Cosmo and was so close to switching our rooms and moving hotels. Since this was a company trip and we were not planning on paying for a hotel elsewhere we stayed put. Also I had all of my toiletries and suitcase completely unpacked so it was not easy to just get up and go. 

Moral of the story is Vdara should put those floor boards on every one of their beds and no one should be waiting hours to make their bed suitable for sleeping. Vdara take note please. If someone wants a mushy bed and back pain then they can call you to have it removed. 

Overall this is a very quiet hotel, do not come here if you want your hotel itself to be lively & fun. The Vdara pool area closed so early that we had to go to the Aria pool. I am assuming Vdara closes early to save money... We went to other pools and they were popping with people and music while our hotel's pool looked like a ghost town. 

Other issues with our company rooms- 
My boyfriends one brother said he had no shower pressure in his shower. The other brother said they got a handicap room- he said the tub was built differently.

We decided between aria and this one and Vdara won our hearts so it was an easy decision.

My friend, his brother and I got to Vegas at the crack of dawn and were worried about their standard check-in time that started at 3pm. Since we were the early birds, the bell hop told us we might get our room early. So my friend gave it a shot and we got the room early with a free upgrade to a suite which made the holiday weekend a little sweeter.

Upon entering the room, the key is not your standard room key but a card that you swipe over the round disc. Once we got in, there is a bathroom to the right, a dinner table, sink with microwave, a stainless steel fridge, and a washer\/dryer. The living room area is spacious once you clear it and use the couch as a bed which is what I did. The room was reserved for my friend and his brother that had two closets, one filled with two bathrobes and one for your clothes.

The bathroom in my opinion is the highlight of the whole room and why not. In the bathroom, there is a bathtub, and a walk in shower with a place to sit down. Two sinks as well for couples if both are using it at the same time.

I had stayed in Vdara in the past and had nothing but good things to say about the resort - good rates, cleanness, great service, amazing view, perfect deco, location etc.

Ever since we stayed in Vdara (we've stayed practically everywhere else on the strip and Aria was our favorite so far), we don't even bother looking into other hotels since.  Sometimes a bad hotel experience could ruin the entire trip, so this had saved us a lot of time and effort searching for a place to stay whenever we visit LV (I usually go to LV at least 2~3 times a year).

However, our most recent visit ended in disaster after we had encountered... BED BUGS (or it could be some other type of bugs).  It is hard to believe that there could be bed bugs in a resort such as this, even I had doubts... but it happened.

We had stayed 3N\/4D and on the second night, I folded out the sofa bed and slept on it.  In the morning next day, I had noticed certain rashes on both of my legs and on my friend's stomach (her daughter also had rash on her thighs - they both used the sofa bed to watch TV the night before).  We first thought it might be something in the linens and asked the housekeeping to look into it before going out to lunch.  Although we had requested for housekeeping on three different ways - 1) left the housekeeping light ""on"", 2) notified the housekeeping who came by earlier that we need it during lunch, and 3) requested to the front desk while waiting for valet.

However, when we had returned to our room, the housekeeping still had not come by yet.  Once we called, they came after almost an hour wait and we had to wait for another half hour or so waiting for them to finish.  Later that night, my rash had gotten worse and it even started to bleed in certain places.  Then it started to sting and the pain was unbearable... it literally felt like I was being stung by dozens of bees at once.  My gf suggested that I filled the tub with warm water and put my legs in for a while, which eased the pain a bit.  Other still had minor rashes, but mine was the worst (I was the only one who slept on it all night).  Once the pain had gotten little better, I spent the last night of my trip sleeping on the floor (everybody was too tired and we didn't want to bother switching rooms or deal with it since we were leaving the next morning).

Next day when I was checking out, I made a quick visit to the front desk to notify what had happened and showed them the pictures of my leg which I had taken over the night before.  The front desk called the manager because this was a ""security protocol"" who had asked me to make a statement with their security dept.  We were on our way out and the valet had already pulled out our car so we were in a hurry but they said it will only take a minute so I decided to wait.  While waiting for the security officer the manager took off the resort fees as courtesy... SERIOUSLY?!  I was in pain all night and practically ruined my last night of our trip and he took $28\/day off for our stay?!  The funny thing is that when I headed to the front desk, I was not expecting any kind of comp because of this, I solely did it because we thought it's something they should be aware of.  But when they took off the resort fee and made it seem like it was a huge comp they were giving us, then the whole thing just felt like an insult.  On top of that, we had waited for over 15 minutes and the security officer still had not shown up.  I told the front desk that we need to leave, and she had offered that she'll have someone call me for the statement shortly.  The funny thing is that it's been weeks and I still haven't received a call for a statement.  And it was the hotel who NEEDED the statement, not me.

We really did enjoy staying in Vdara in the past and there's a good chance that we'll most likely stay there on our next trip, but the most recent stay\/incident made it seem very difficult to make such decision easily nor recommend to others (which I have done so since we first stayed).  

Again, it really is a great hotel with exception qualities but I do not recommend using their sofa bed or if you do, just keep an eye out if you noticed unusual rash or marks on your skin soon after.",0,0,0

Everyone at the hotel from the people who check you in to the spa attendant I would fail all of them. They have NO idea what customer service is and they have no idea how to treat their customers well. If they keep this up they'll be closing very soon. I stayed at the cosmopolitan the night before and it was like night and day compared to the vdara. The hospitality is 1000000X better there and they truly treat you like a king.

I chose the Vdara, reserved the room 2 months ahead of time, and spent a little extra on the panoramic suite to have some quiet, a nice view, and maybe even prepare a gourmet meal in the kitchenette.  

The room I got stuck with was on the 14th floor (not much view at all), just around the corner from the FIRE STATION and the kitchenette had zero amenities, not even a fork!  I complained to management and tried to change rooms but they were completely unable or unwilling to help.  They tried to make things right by sending up a coffeemaker and waving the $20\/day fee (yes, you read that right - $20 extra per day to make coffee in your gourmet kitchenette!)  But of course they failed to send coffee cups.  The in room washer\/dryer was a nice thought, but again, they failed to provide detergent.

As for the noise, not only did we have to deal with the sirens at random times of the day or night, but one of the adjoining rooms had an alarm clock going off for 2 hours before housekeeping finally came in to shut it off.  Apparently the Vdara has the same paper-thin walls as every other hotel on the strip.

Then one morning I went to the coffee shop to buy some pastries & bloody marys to bring to the room, the cafe was unable to make the drinks to go and the bar didn't open for another 3 hours, so we had to skip the drinks.  Any other normal Vegas hotel would have easily been able to accommodate my request, but apparently the Vdara is different.

It was so relaxing staying at a place without the casino dings and buzzers. Also...the Vdara AND Aria smell amazing. I can't explain it, but whatever they are doing, it's working.

The lobby is nicely decorates and well spaced out.  It includes the lobby bar with plenty of seating, inside and out, a cafe and of course your Starbucks.

The design of the hotel and the rooms is really nice, modern and we really loved the smoke-free atmosphere. Plus you don't have to deal with any crowds. If you want eateries and casinos, they are a few steps away at the Aria and the Bellagio, etc.

The beds are comfortable, but having the bathroom door right by the bed was not my favorite, particularly because the door did not close all the way. They do, however, provide plenty of towels and Aveda soaps, lotions, and hair products.

Arriving at the hotel can be confusing, mainly because the Vdara does not have its own dedicated parking lot. Valet parking is complementary, but the wait time, from what we heard, could be about 30 minutes if you needed your car back. We walk everywhere when we're in LV, so that was not a problem. We also checked-out early, so we got our car pretty quickly. No complaints about the valet staff at all - they were all very nice. Check-in was fairly quick and the staff was friendly.

Our main complaint is that housekeeping never came to our room to clean it. We left fairly early on our second day and turned on the housekeeping light, but came back to a room that looked exactly the same way we left it. Thank goodness for the extra towels, right?

For a fairly pricey resort, I find this unacceptable. I am not surprised when this happens at places like the Circus Circus, but here I was not the least bit amused. Also, we would not recommend trying to call any of the hotel desks because you will be hard-pressed to get someone to answer your questions...or at all.

We really liked that it was no as 'Vegasy' due to the fact that there was no casino. Our complaints are very similar to everyone else's. For starters, although every room has a kitchen, there are no silverware, paper towels, or any other very basic kitchen supplies. We ended up having to use the ice tongs to spread our peanut and jelly for sandwiches. Not something we should be doing at a 5 star hotel. Additionally, the phone was completely broken. After having to call the front desk for our luggage, we were told that they would send someone up to fix the phone for us.  They did, but at 11.30 the next morning (remember that check out is at 11). We had requested late checkout (luckily they allowed this) so we had to leave at 12. I was having a last minute shower before I left when the doorbell rang. It took me a couple minutes to get out of the shower to answer and by this time the maintenance guy had already opened the door. Luckily I had caught him when I did otherwise he would have come up and seen my showering....another thing I would not expect at such a nice hotel. We were very happy that the pool was open still and the pool staff was very nice. It was unfortunate that they closed at 5pm because they ended up having to kick at least 5-6 groups out. At least closing at 6 would be better. They also had yellow caution signs around the pool which was not very aesthetically pleasing. The hotel is entirely valet but luckily the valet staff was quite accommodating. After reading yelp reviews, we asked for a room facing the bellagio fountains and higher up.

Dear Ms. Giuliano - 
Thank you for inquiring about our stay at Vdara from Wednesday April 20 - Sunday April 23, 2017.  
My wife and I came to Las Vegas for a business conference, and planned to stay a couple of extra days to see some of the sites and take in a show.  We are not gamblers, and prefer to stay away from the smoke-filled casinos and crowds.  When it comes to a grading a hotel we use Hilton or Marriot as a benchmark, and things can either be better (or worse) from there.  
We chose to stay at Vdara because of its reputation as a high-service experience, with a spa, and a place to have a small meal or a drink.  An added bonus, as described on your web site, we liked the fact that the concierge would take care of securing an Avis rental car for us. For this experience, Vdara charged around $300 a night (plus a resort fee), which was more expensive than other places.  However, we felt the experience and convenience would be worth it.  Unfortunately, Vdara failed to meet our expectations.  
Here's what went well -
1] My wife had a massage at the spa.  The facility and attendants were very nice, and the masseuse did a fine job. 
2] The room itself was fine. The bed was comfortable.  The room was clean, quiet, with a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  Overall, nice modern design. Of note, one the TV's in the room was broken. 
3] The bar at Vice Versa, was fine.  Welcoming staff, drinks were good, laid-back atmosphere.  The Market Café had good salads and sandwiches, and it was convenient.
Here's what did not go well - 
1] Front of the hotel staff. They were non-existent - no valet, nor bellhop - during the entire 4 days we were there.  When it came to checking our bags, hailing a cab, parking our car - we were on our own. To self-park the rental car, we had to go across the way to the Aria.  While we did not find that a big deal, we did find it odd that a high-service hotel of the supposed caliber of Vdara, failed to offer such basic services to its guests.  What was the tipping point?  Having to walk across the Aria's smoke filled casino every time we wanted to get the car.
2] The concierge.  For the last two days we were at Vdara, we inquired with the concierge about renting a car with Avis.  Her answer?  I shall paraphrase, ""...Avis has a counter at the Aria.  They never answer our phone calls. You'll need to go over there yourself to rent the car..."" Our request was by no means extraordinary, and it fact, it is a service that your hotel advertises to provide to its guests.  Any concierge at a Hilton or Marriott would have readily taken care of it.
3] The pool and spa. They were fine...when they were open.  Unfortunately, due to my conference schedule, I was not able to get to the workout facilities between 8am-6pm.  I assumed that the room key-card would allow for access to the gym after hours, which has been my experience at a Hilton or Marriott.  But at Vdara, this is not the case.  Plus, the resort fee is added to the cost of the room.  So, at Vdara I paid a resort fee, for facilities I did not even get to use.  
4] The Vdara website describes a variety of restaurant choices at the Aria across the way.  Indeed, they are good.  But we had to walk through the casinos to get there.  In hind-site, I should have known better.  When staying on the Strip in Vegas, it stands to reason that even in hotels advertised as ""casino-free"", there will be means to get the guests into a casino.  Next time I will know better.
5] On the last day of our stay at Vdara, we were looking for the front staff to help us hail a cab to the airport.  Again, there was no one to be found.  We decided to walk over to Aria, where the bell hop literally saw us walking over from Vdara and came over to help.  He took our bags, hailed the cab, put the bags in the car, was tipped very well, and we were off.   It was a stark contrast from the Vdara experience, just 200 feet away.  I got the impression, that this is not the first time that Aria staff had seen this happen with Vdara guests.
At the end of the day, we paid a premium to stay at Vdara partly to avoid the smoke and crowds of the casinos.  But in reality, between having to go through the Aria's casino to get the car, and access their restaurants, we ended up spending just as much time in a casino while staying at Vdara as we would have had we stayed at Aria or Bellagio.  The key concept I want to convey to you is this... At least at the Aria or Bellagio, you actually get the service (valet, bellhop, concierge) to go along with the price tag...which is something that is significantly lacking a Vdara.  
It is for these reasons, that I cannot recommend your hotel.  I hope this letter assists you to create a better experience for your future guests.",0,0,0

Aria is connected to the Vdara and its so close I don't know why it would be an issue.  People cant be that lazy...ohh wait.  

If you have some time, check the Bellagio line for checking in.  It can take you over half an hour during peak times.  At the Vdara its quick and painless.  If you don't believe me check it out yourself.  

I would definitely recommend Vdara to anybody who comes to Vegas.  Its a luxurious resort where you can get some nice relaxation in with the most modern of amenities and its connected to Aria so you can get your drunken fun and gambling in.

Service here is top notch and quick. Everything from the valet to the room service was perfect for me. If you're staying here, try to get a room with the view of the bellagio fountains or else you'll be stuck looking at the city or the cosmo.

The check in and out processes were fairly painless.

The bed was comfortable, but the toiletries can be improved.  The cleaning staffs did a good job, and everything seemed clean and tidy everyday.

The gym was larger than expected with good equipment to shave off a few pounds after buffets.  The pool area wasn't too crazy early in the day, and we got to enjoy the water.  The overall experience can't compare with MO, but Vdara is definitely worth considering.",1,0,0

We paid a little extra here, but we were going for comfort.  No, not beds or chairs, but allergen and irritant comfort--the Vdara is a non-smoking hotel.  Both my wife and I are so sensitive to smells and odors in hotel rooms that we have had to leave them in the middle of the night in the past and go elsewhere.

For our money, the Vdara delivered in spades.  Not only was there absolutely no smoke smell in the least, we could not detect any cleaning chemicals or disinfectants at all.  The only scents in the room were slight, clean, and non-irritating.  This was a relief.  A number of times before, at places like Motel 6 or Embassy Suites, we have had to deal with allergic reactions, swollen eyes, sore nasal passages, and sleepless nights from cheap hotel room odors.  Others may be able to take that stuff.  We can't.

We are always willing to pay a little more to ensure that we can get a peaceful and restful night's sleep, and we know now that the Vdara can give it to us.

Again:
No smoke smell,
No disinfectant smell,
No chemical odors,
--just a fresh, clean room.  That should help people doing a Yelp search to definitely find this place.  Even if every casino you visit in Las Vegas smells like smoke, you can come here and know that your hotel room never will!",9,1,7

The city view was of the highway and the lackluster industrial zone behind the hotel. Other than that it was views into the suites of other guests at the hotel (awkward). My bathroom smelled like backed up sewage and the landline phones did not work other than they rang incessantly in the morning for no apparent reason. To call the hotel staff I had to use my personal cell phone and that was akin to calling an Indian call center for trouble with your cable bill. The administration of the Vdara is a total clown show. There is no entertainment at the hotel itself and you have to make a trip to go engage in anything noteworthy. I frequently go to Vegas and have tried numerous hotels. The Vdara is a total waste of possibility when it comes to hotel selection. If your into a room with gratuitous space that has no functional design then maybe it's worth it but I would otherwise recommend any other hotel in vegas.

The views were amazing and not to mention the room was spotless clean. I had some special things done to the room for an anniversary surprise and concierge was more than happy to make that come true. 

We checked out the pool and the vibe is very family oriented. No individuals were intoxicated. Everyone was having a good time. One downside is that the pool is very small but great to relax and get away. 

To the people who are scared about the so called ""Death Rays"", yes the sun hits the mirror glass and gets a little warm but nothing that will kill you or toast you like a chicken. It's called sunscreen. You'll be fine.

Aside from the amazing views the room was very modern, clean, simple and just fun to be in. The bed was comfy and big. The pillows were supper comfortable ! And the tv was perfect for watching a movie ($12) late at night when you come back to the room just tired and ready to rest and relax . The bathroom was pretty awesome too the bathtub was beautiful and inviting, just looking at it made you want to take a bath :) the room also had controllable curtain which was nice for privacy and also to keep the room dark in the morning to sleep in :) just the push of a button away.

Room service was nice and convenient . The prices were steep but any dinner in Vagas is just getting to enjoy it in your own room was comfortable and relaxing. We tried the chicken wings and chicken strips one night (pretty good) and for breakfast we tried the breakfast burrito, French toast and tomato soup with sides of country potatoes. ( potatoes were kinda bland. Breakfast burrito was ok . The tomato soup was ok. The French toast was good. A little to sweet, I think the bread slices were pound cake ? ) every meal was brought up with pitchers of ice cold water and plates and sliver wear.

I had a friend die the week prior and still decided to go to Vegas because I didn't want to cancel the trip. We decided it'd be more low key than we planned. 

The minute you walk into this hotel, you notice the smell. It's sweet, but not over powering. It smells fabulous. The bell boys and door men are wonderful. Ask them any question about Las Vegas - especially which buffet to choose and which Cirque show is over rated - and they will have a plethora of information for you. The suite was amazing. Impeccably clean and spacious. The kitchen had everything in it we needed and it was amazing to have one - we planned ahead and had snacks and treats to store there to eat when we were hungry...or drunk :) 

Make sure you use the concierge at this hotel. Thanks to them, we were on the guest list at every club we wanted to go to. We paid nothing and stood in no lines. All of our dinner reservations were made, and they found out which restaurants would have the best vegetarian food for us. It was amazing...I totally owe them for their amazing service.

This hotel has no casino, which is a thrill when you come home exhausted and your eyes aching from the bright lights of slot machines. It's peaceful and quiet - no rowdy drunk 21 year olds or bachelorette party goers in the halls to disturb you. The soaking tub is soothing, as are the products they provide you (Aveda!).

It was a little tricky to get to once we made a turn on Harmon.  The signage doesn't really scream at you to go UP the ramp then on the roundabout through Aria before finding your way to the Vdara valet guys.  Once we figured that out, it was easy to access after the first mistake!

The check-in line for a mid-Friday afternoon moved fairly quickly.  I was just happy they had a room available when we arrived a little after 2pm since check-in time is normally at 4pm.  The guy at the front desk, Tony, was very friendly upon our check in. He asked if I preferred a room toward the lower or higher levels.  It didn't really matter to us, so we got a lovely room on the 38th floor.

Our room was a good size, I'm glad it had a fridge for us to stock our drinks, the room comes with two, twelve ounce complimentary bottled waters that they restocked each morning.  I wish the fridge had a freezer, it would have been great to freeze the ice pack blocks for the drive home, but oh well.

It took a little while to figure out all the bells and whistles of the room, the switch to open and close the shades was near the kitchenette and there's a master switch by the front door of your room.  Connection to WiFi was easy, it's included in your mandatory resort fee, so I'm glad the connection was strong when it came time to check in on things using my iPad.

We had no problems with the room, the housekeeping staff was great with replacing our towels and getting our room cleaned.  I told my hubby not to leave his spare change out on the counter, it might be mistaken as a tip and sure enough, it was gone when we returned back to our room.  It was no big deal for us, we always tip housekeeping, but not until the very last day (and with a thank you note).  When we still had another day to go and he left out around two bucks in change, it was probably confused as a tip for them, lol.

I'm glad that this hotel doesn't have a casino on the main floor, but when we wanted to play, it was very easy to walk over to Bellagio since there was a connecting hallway that didn't require you to leave the property and walk outside.

Overall, the hotel was great, but I'd skip on ordering room service, the prices were astonishing where you'd think you were dining at the Ritz-Carlton.  We didn't dine at the market the Sunday we checked out, but my hubby bought us some food for the road.  A doughnut was $1.95, his not-so-great breakfast bagel was close to $7 bucks, my cheese danish was about $4 and his Red Bull energy drink to keep him awake for the first leg of our drive back to San Diego cost $5 bucks.

The standard suites are a good size. You have your super duper comfy king bed that's separated by the TV from the seating area, little kitchen area, large bathroom and a panoramic window with killer views. My last stay was awesome because I was upgraded to the corner suite (I'm not sure why, but I'll take it!). The corner suite is a one-bedroom suite equipped with a full kitchen, W\/D, dining area and TV seating area. Given that it's a corner suite, you get amazing views of Vegas starting from the doorway all the way to the end of the bathroom. Make sure you turn up your A\/C because these huge windows can generate a lot of heat! 

The hotel doesn't have the same amenities and services that the other hotels have (like a casino, restaurants, large pool, etc.) but it's nothing that a quick walk to the neighboring Bellagio or Aria can't fix.

Many have a kitchenette which makes it feel like a home away from home. 

During my recent visits, I've had the pleasure of staying in the executive penthouse suite and executive corner suites. Both are spacious and clean with nice views. You'll definitely feel ""Vegas"" if you stay here. 

The fitness and spa areas are great features. I've yet to try the day spa but I did go to the fitness center a couple times for a early morning workout before venturing out into Vegas life. They provide bottled and spa water as well as clean towels. Equipment are all in great working and clean condition.

There is no self-parking only valet unless you park at Aria, but the walk carrying your luggage wouldn't be fun. The valet\/drop-off and taxi line are all in one area and close to the check-in desk and the elevators. No walking through smokey casinos.

Another plus is the Tram system that travels from Monte Carlo, thru Aria and returns from Bellagio.

Vdara is a smoke-free, gamble-free hotel that is right in between the Cosmopolitan and Aria, with easy access to and from Bellagio. You are away from the madness but if you want to gamble and get to the craziness, it's literally a 5 minute walk to the three hotels and the strip! 

There is a walkway in the lobby connected to Bellagio's casino. You can also walk around to Aria and Cosmopolitan from the outside walkway which is also connected to Crystal's shopping center. From there you're right on the strip when you want to be.

Free valet, pool\/lounge and fitness center. Pool closes relatively early. We had stove and refrigerator as well.

I've had several friends stay here and they found great deals on Hotels.com and other online travel booking sites.  The beds are nice, the kitchenette is convenient, and some of the views are spectacular.  The view of the Cosmopolitan\/Bellagio\/Planet Hollywood is the best view I've seen in the building.

It's next door to Aria, so there's no casino in the building....you have to walk to Aria for that action.  There's also a separate valet parking area to access the hotel.

We've had drinks in the lobby bar several times.....it's a laid back bar where you can meet colleagues for business or friends for casual conversation.  Good times.

In fact, the bed was so comfortable, I had a hard time getting up and going to work the next morning.  It didn't hurt to have an upper-level room facing Northwest; someone finally paid attention to my request for the most peaceful and quiet room possible.  The bright lights of Vegas are fun when I'm walking the Strip, but once in my room I prefer a view of the mountains and the interesting, natural and ever-changing canvas of the sky.  The room itself was decorated in a low-key fashion with muted, earthy colors, and the lay-out with the room divider holding the television screen reminded me of the eco-friendly contemporary rooms at Cavallo Point in Sausalito.  The kitchenette was full of high-end appliances, but not utilized this visit.  I appreciated the extra dining space, as well as the nice bath area.  (There was a deep tub that unfortunately, again, was not utilized.  Water pressure was fantastic, though!)  The architecture of the hotel is interesting; it is comprised of three ""rows"" of rooms that slightly overlap at the ends.  I wish I had more time to visit the spa or eat at the restaurant on the premises.  Service (check-in) was efficient and professional, and I would have no problem staying here again.

It is definitely not your typical Vegas party hotel, but that's probably why I loved it so much. Don't forget your comfy shoes. It's a quick walk to Aria, Cosmo and Planet Hollywood, and has a connecting walkway to the Bellagio. If you need snacks, toiletries or want a fresh hot meal at any time during the day, stop by the Market Cafe on the first floor. We were there almost every day for breakfast.

Our one bedroom suite had a full kitchen (fridge\/freezer, stovetop, sink, kitchenware), a full bath with tub and shower in the bedroom and a half bath in the entry way. Very convenient  (and almost a necessity!) when staying with 3 other girls. And oh, the bed! Just thinking about it makes me want to ZzZz...one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept on. The quality of linens makes such a big difference. 

By far, the Vdara has the nicest fitness center I've ever been to in a hotel. New, clean equipment with towels and bottled waters at each machine, and headphones available, if you need it for the TV monitors attached to all of the cardio machines. Kettlebells, body bars, free weights...better equipment than I've seen at some member gyms in San Diego. I never enjoyed working out while on vacation, but I loved it while I stayed at the Vdara.

When you come out to visit Vegas you get a lot of the same (with the addition of public drinking and creepy Mexican hombres trying to hand out strip club promotion cards).  Vdara, though located at the heart of the strip, offers a bit of peaceful sanctity from all the craziness that is LV.  It's a oasis in the dessert that is sin city.  A breath of fresh air!  

My friends and I stayed in the penthouse suite for a couple nights for my best bud's bachelor party and a city suite for an additional night.  Tho we really only used these spaces for a few hours for sleeping over the course of the weekend, the actual physical space was great.  Furniture and decor are very modern and fresh.  The electronic powered sun shades and curtains were functionally fun.  The beds, pillows, and comforters were amazingly comfortable and made for wonderful nap times. All the other amenities were perfect as well.

I think my favorite attribute of Vdara was actually its smell.  The facility is that of a non-smoking one.  So unlike all other casinos and hotels, you can walk in the place and literally get a clean, wonderful breath of fresh scented air.  Kudos to Vdara and staff!

... HOWEVER, I DON'T LIKE THESE THINGS... so i would NOT come back!

This is my third trip to Las Vegas, in previous times I've stayed at The Imperial and The Gold Coast... and if you're familiar with those two hotels , you're probably cringing right now, but i like to slum it when i go to vegas.  I figure all I'm going to be doing in a hotel room is sleeping, so as long as it's reasonably clean, then I'm good... the Vdara was a little too clean for me.

This place is like living in a starbucks.  It's clean, it's modern, and it's expensive (well, for me) .. not necessarily for the stay, but for everything around the stay, to purchase in the hotel or for any additional services in the hotel.

I really did not like the fact that it's a little off the strip, and you're forced to walk through the Bellagio, Aria or Cosmopolitan in order to get to the hotel.  Yes, there is a street to walk down to get here, but due to the sidewalk disappearing at a certain point it involves crossing the road and it's a very indirect route.  Initially i thought this would be okay, but then hen stumbling back to the hotel room intoxicated late at night, I found it to be a big pain in the ass.


This is a very quiet hotel.  Don't expect anything to be open after 10pm... so if you're looking to get away from the strip, then perhaps this is a nice choice for you... for me, it was not.

As petty as it seems, i was annoyed by the fact there was no coffee maker in the room.  I had to go down to the lobby wait in a fairly long line just to get my morning coffee.

The pool is very nice! But it's on a side of the hotel where all the sunlight is blocked from the pool deck til about noonish... which would probably be very nice in the heart of the summer, though i stayed here in April, and I wanted sun anytime i was outside, so that didn't work out all that well.

I also bought a Sunwing Vacatation package for a flat rate per night, but then when i got to the desk I was forced to pay an additional $18 a night for various hotel convenience fees such as the ""complimentary"" wifi... clearly they have an odd definition of complimentary here.

Also, the rooms are set-up in a way where there is a sliding door for the bathroom which is not very soundproof... and there is no fan in the bathroom either.  So make sure you're very comfortable with the person you're sharing the room with, cause if you're not, your ears will tell you everything about them by the end of your stay there :)

Bottom line, it's a really nice hotel... just not for me.",3,7,1

We arrived at 1:15 pm after a 4 1\/2 hour road trip to a suite that wasn't ready.  They were apologetic and said our suite would be ready within an hour.  After calling management they confirmed that the suite was vacated, just needed to be cleaned.  They supposedly put a ""rush"" on the cleaning and told us they'd call us as soon as it was ready.  We sat around for another hour and a half in the small lobby but never got a call.  The main reason for our trip to Vegas was our son's basketball tournament.  I specifically mentioned the need to have him changed and at the Convention Center by 3pm before his first game.  They told me he could change in the bathrooms in the lobby, if need be.  By 3 pm the room was still not ready (which happens to be their official check-in time).  Frustrated, I spoke to a manager who offered sympathy and to downgrade us to a lower level suite, reducing our nightly charge by $50.  I specifically booked the corner Executive Suite due to the layout and had the option to book the basic Vdara suite that was being offered,  much cheaper than the supposed discounted rate they were offering!  Typically when hotels mess up, they don't offer downgrades......but usually offer an upgrade!  I refused and told them we were sticking with the original room type we booked.  We left for the game, he changed in car and we received the call at 4:30 pm that our room was finally ready!  When we got back to the hotel at 5:30, and into our room we called for our luggage to be brought up.  That took another full hour!!!! I've never been in a hotel in Vegas where there's so much chaos in the small lobby, from valet to front desk!!! Nice staff but definitely an under-staffed hotel! We typically stay at the Wynn or Encore but because of our 2 teenage boys we decided to stay in a larger room and a hotel without a casino.  Big mistake! After all the inconveniences, they offered to waive our resort fee.  Knocking off $30\/night when you're paying about $400 a night is ridiculous.

It had that sophisticated feel to it. I walked in and I felt instantly relaxed (well it was a long drive coming from a 13-hour shift so...)

We had a full suite, we were greeted with chocolates and truffles when we got settled in the room.. It was a sweet start.. lol. 1 bedroom 1 1\/2 bathroom a full kitchen, washer & dryer and a litle office space with the strip as a view. if I had an apartment I would want it to look this way.. The format was contemporary mixed with finess. 2 of my favorite combinations. Not gonna lie but I think we had way too much fun playing with the blinds and buttons in the room our first hour.

The bed itself is soft and comfty, rest assured that you will have a goodnight's sleep (if you plan to sleep anyway) 

the main bathroom was very spacious,  double sinks shower enclosed with glass doors and the tub that had a view.. It's a nice way to end the night. I was ecstatic ( I love nice bathrooms) the guest bathroom was decently sized and can cater to your ""basic needs""

Turndown service was a plus it was nice coming back to the hotel with the pillows fluffed linens ready for one to retire the day.

We ordered room service for breakfast (pricey, it is room service in Vegas after all) and were impressed with the way they came in and set it all up for us. Even poured ice water and laid out cute little condiments for us. 
Took a while for them to pick it up but when they finally did, they even left extra bottles of water for us.

We got to the hotel around 4:30 PM and after a long flight we just wanted to check in and take a nap. The front desk was very speedy and got us in and out in just a few minutes. One disappointing thing was the 100 dollar a night debit card hold, you can avoid this by using a credit card. It wasn't a big deal but maybe they should put this on their website.

We were debating between Vdara and Bellagio. We wanted a fountain view but didn't want to pay the Bellagio price. The fountain view rooms at Vdara are pretty slick. They give you half a view of the beautiful mountains and the other side gives you a view of the fountains. Although I don't know the fountain view justifies the extra money, it was better than staring at the parking garage on the other side of the hotel. 

Some people say this hotel is the perfect distance from the strip and others say it is quite a walk. To actually get on the strip from the lobby of Vdara might take a 10 to 15 minute walk. You can do this by walking through the tunnel that connects the hotel to the Bellagio or you can walk outside and through Aria's casino or Crystals Mall. Their is a tram that connects Aria, Vdara, and Bellagio. I didn't use it but I guess that's another option. 

Vdara does not have a casino at all. So that means no smoking. And if you have stayed in any other pro-smoking hotels in Vegas you know that you can't escape the smoke. It's nice not getting black lung while I sleep. Anytime we wanted to gamble we walked to Aria, a 5 minute walk from Vdara. It's important to note that this isn't a party hotel per say. You can make your own little party but it isn't like some other Vegas hotels that are a constant rave. 

Overall:
It was clean and comfortable.

The TV in the main bedroom didnt work & neither did the Phone. We told guest services twice & not only did they not fix it, but didn't even bother to give us a new room! 

On top of our 3 day stay, i kid you not - every time we would try to enter our room, the key cards NEVER worked.

We wanted to try a new hotel on the strip and jumped on a really good deal through expedia. Unlike other hotels, this hotel is kinda of tucked away in City Center from all the madness. Plus it was a smoke free hotel so our clothes didn't reek of it! 

Check in was quick and painless. Just like any other hotel in Vegas...you'll be charged with those ""resort fees."" They gave us a deluxe suite overlooking the back of City Center. Not the greatest view, but the room itself was amazing. It was a luxurious condo--kitchen (separate from the room), dining table, sofa, king size bed...etc. It was a very nice and relaxing 4 night stay. 

Parking was the only issue. No self parking for the Vdara, the closest was at the Aria. So valet was the only option. It was very convenient and the guys were speedy....but we would use their service 4+ times a day so it just took a little away from our gambling money.",3,0,0

My husband did his research and picked Vdara for its casino-free, smoke-free, all-suite environment. Equipped with a kitchenette and mini-living room, it was perfect for our little 9 mos. old to roam around freely. And since its in the middle of The Strip, access to other hotels is within walking distance. 

There are only two reasons I didn't give it 5 stars: there aren't any dining options open past 10pm so you have to go next door to Bellagio or Aria or order room service. Also, the bed is too soft for my taste. I prefer a more firm mattress and this one was a bit lumpy.

What I love most about this hotel is the fact it doesn't have a casino in the lobby. It's kind of refreshing no to have to go through a casino to go to your room...
We got a deluxe suite which had a really nice view and was quite big.

My only complaint with this hotel is the cleaning system. There was a light next to the door that you could change in order to have your room cleaned (green light) or if you didn't want to be disturb (red light). We actually didn't really notice the light until we arrive at 7pm one day and the room was not clean. It was not us who change the light to red as we didn't even know... We called the reception and someone came right away to clean the room but still it was kind of frustrating....

PARKING: 
It's valet only, so if you're not comfortable with people touching your car, this hotel is not for you. Traveling southbound on Las Vegas Blvd, turn right after you see Cosmopolitan. You'll continue straight past the Cosmo taxi line UP the ramp to Aria\/Vdara. Keep in the middle lane because you'll basically circle past Aria onto Vdara. TRICKY!

SERVICE:
I've never checked in here, but I noticed the lines aren't excruciatingly long like they are at MGM or Mandalay. Limit 4 cards per room, but the names on the room can always get additional cards later. They are, however, RIDICULOUSLY SLOW with delivering housekeeping related items to the room. My party had to wait over an hour for towels after calling 3 times (my friend was stuck in the shower without a clean towel!). If you're going to cram, I'd suggest bringing your OWN towels. 

ROOM:
I love the layout of the room, and the bathroom is a MAJOR plus. There is a shower head attached to the stand alone tub. Genius! There are two TVs in the room and a small kitchen area. Great for storing those munchies! Apparently only premium rooms get Keurig machines..bummer! The middle class folks deserved coffee too!

They were so much fun and inviting ultimately coercing us into spending more then we intended on their absolutely delicious concoctions.  

The rooms were clean and really nice - although the pull out couch was the worst on our backs.  It was so lumpy!  You'd think the hotel would spend a little more for the price we paid.

Unfortunately, the time that we went there was also the time when the black out was.  We watched two fires and explosions take place within hours of each other.  What an exciting trip!  

The power outage lasted a few hours (late of night) and we were stranded in our room on the 46th floor for the rest of the evening - no sight seeing for us.  

I guess I should consider ourselves lucky since the poor unsuspecting guests who came in late had to share the hotel lobby for the night.  We thought that perhaps the hotel would provide some kind of a discount or comp or something for the hotel guests to show their quality service but sadly no.  

The rest of the hotel service ended up being terrible and the managers were no help at all.  I would definitely not recommend this hotel if you're looking for comfort and quality of service.

Walking, there are only three ways in or out: through Aria, Monte Carlo or Bellagio. Vdara is a non-smoking and non-gambling hotel but to get to Vdara or to get out of Vdara one has to walk through unsightly crowded and loud smoke-filled casino floors with vague direction signs designed to cause you to lose your bearings and never leave the casino floor.

The rooms are amazing - roomy, wall to wall windows, a kitchen, and a split living room\/bedroom area. The view from our room was also beautiful, which included the Rio, Palms hotel, and the Bellagio pools.

A few other things to point out about this hotel is that:
1. The bar on the bottom floor is chic and the service is great.
2. Go left at the Silk Road restaurant to take a walkway directly to the Bellagio.
3. By taking that same route in #2, you can also take a tram to the Monte Carlo and Bellagio.
4. The water pressure is a bit low in this hotel, but hey, we're trying to go green here.
5. If you lose your cell phone charger here, just accept that you'll never see it again.
6. In the gambling mood? Just walk across the way to the Aria.
7. For your shopping needs, go next door to Crystals.
8. Want to go clubbing? Go to Marquee right next door in the Cosmopolitan.

I booked the room through Expedia and when I checked-in Vdara it was a  breeze. There is no self-parking, so valet is mandatory if you drove. Checking-in took less than 5 minutes and our luggage was delivered to our room in about 10 minutes. I appreciated how efficient Vdara was. 

For the most basic room, it was VERY spacious. As you enter the door, you first enter the full kitchen then as you walk past the kitchen there is a living room with a couch that pulls out into a queen bed. Finally, the king bed is on the other side of the living room next to the bathroom.

For the past 15 years, since i turned 21, I've been to LV about 15+ times and each time i don't stayed at the same hotel because i wanted to try and experience all the nice one there.

For the price that i paid recently for Weekdays stay of 2 nights, it was cheap for 5 Stars hotel.  I booked the 270 degree city corner suite after seeing a few YouTube video reviews of the room.  Let me tell you seeing the video is NOTHING COMPARED to the real thing.  This room is excellent condition being still new and the surrounding view INCLUDING in the bathroom was just additional PLUS to the whole experience.

The bed bit dusty and so is the side table in the bedroom but it could probably mean not many people stay recently.  I'm sure it gets packed in holidays soon.  personally the cost of this in the holiday is ridiculous and i wouldn't pay for it BUT at the price level of $140\/nt, it was great.

the only downside i hate in LV with all the hotel is the resort fee of $25\/nt plus tax (yah...no kidding) so came out to additional of $28 on top of the room cost BUT it did include 2 small water bottles a day and free wifi throughout the stay.

I would stay here again, it's a NON-Casino hotel so very peaceful quiet, smoke free and easily connection to Aria across the street OR internal connection 5-7 mins walk to Bellagio.

The rooms are quite large, very clean, and have an updated\/modern design.  The service is exceptional, and they really take care of guests.  By far the best hotel experience we have had in our five or six Vegas trips.  They check room keys at the elevator banks, even at like 3:00am, which is nice.  

There is no casino at Vdara, so depending on your perspective that is either good or bad.  To me, it's good, because it makes the hotel less busy with random people wandering around.  But if it's your first time in Vegas, it may detract from your party experience - it's really neat the first time to have a hotel right on the strip, where you can walk right out from the elevator and be in the middle of the action.  Anywho, Vdara has a tram that runs until 4am that goes to Aria and Monte Carlo for gambling, while the Bellagio and Aria are both a fairly short walk away from Vdara.  So, if you want to briefly escape the chaos for a bit of sleep, Vdara offers a somewhat calm escape that is very close to the 24x7 action.  

We stayed at Planet Hollywood the last night of our trip, which offered a stark contrast to Vdara.

Staying here worked out really well. My friends had planned on going to Marquee and eating buffet at Bellagio. Vdarra has a direct access breezeway to Bellagio and is about a 1000 foot walk to back entrance of Cosmo. Just be careful with the back entrance because the crosswalk is not very visible to drivers, so you have stick your head out a bit and make sure they see you. Don't step off the curb until you are sure they will stop. 

The rooms are suites and are about 600 square feet. There are two big screen TV's, a king-sized bed and a kitchen. Dishes are available upon request. I didn't try out the spa or the pool so i can't comment on that.Wifi and robe and slippers are free. Well technically not free since there is a mandatory $20\/person fee for services that include the wifi and slippers.

 Regarding the curtains, apparently they are operated by a light-switch. I feel like a doofus because I read a review for Vdarra that said there were not any block-out curtains. So when I looked for the curtains and couldn't find them, I just gave up.

Why have kitchens when you don't supply kitchen supplies? We asked three times at the front desk for them, finally called down to get some, and then the housekeeper comes in with plates and glasses. Another trip...then we get a pot and a pan. Oh, and NO wine glasses in the suite. Really? We have to ask for those, too...and then housekeeping takes them the next morning.

The upholstered chair and couch were dirty. The bed was immaculate, though.

There wasn't any dishwashing detergent, sponges or towels for cleaning the dishes.

Had to call downstairs to find the blow dryer (immediate thought was that there wasn't one). 

I guess we got spoiled with the level of service at Encore, where every need is anticipated. Vdara felt like they were just hoping that no one would ask for things.

On the good side, the location is great...right next to Aria, close to Cosmopolitan (great happy hours), walkway to Bellagio. 

Special kudos to the servers in the Marketcafe--service (and food) was amazing.

No casino, no club, no chaos that you'd expect at your typical place on The Strip.  Instead, you're greeted with a quiet place that's not so hectic.  Check-in was very easy, no crowds, no fuss.  Just showed up after a long flight and they were ready with the room keys, etc.  Very prompt, very courteous.  Everyone at this place was willing to assist.  We had a deluxe room this trip and it was pretty spacious.  Separate sleeping and ""living area"" so after a long day, we could relax a bit before having a night out.  The bathroom area was fairly large, though I did wonder why there was 1) no vanity area for the girlfriend, and 2) single sink rather than double sinks.  Not quite a deal killer but an odd omission considering the property is rated pretty high.  

Just a couple of things to consider:  It's not directly on The Strip.  You have to cut through the Crystals and Aria to get to it or even the Cosmopolitan depending on where you're stumbling back from.  If you're driving to it, you have one exit on either side of Harmon Ave. to get to it.  Miss it, and you go around.  If this makes you pause, then maybe consider another place.  If you're staying at Aria and need a cab in a hurry, you can cut over to Vdara and catch one from there.

We go to Vegas a few times a year to do weekend getaways or special occasions, nice dinners, drinks, shopping, parties, sexy times in our suite all day or all night. Vdara provided all the things I need! No complaints! 

One of the newest hotel & spa in Vegas, located in city center, sister hotel of Aria. The entire hotel is Euro style modern contemporary, I like it a lot, very short walking distance to Aria and Bellagio. 

Best part of this hotel is that it is smoking and casino FREE! I am very allergic and sensitive to cigarettes, I hate smoking, after a long walk in any casinos, I can smell smoke in my hair and skin, it makes me sick! But here at Vdara, I can totally relax, the air is sooo fresh, it actually smells like cookie! very sweet. :) They provide free Wi-Fi, it came very handy with our ipad 2 use there. 

My experience at Vdara was very pleasant and satisfied. the service was over the top! From valet, bell service, front desk to housekeeping, never once we got a below average service, everybody was very friendly and helpful, they answer all your questions pleasantly with big smiles, and did a little chat with us here and there. our luggage guy was a very pretty blonde girl, how interesting!. 

The lobby is not big, there is a market store located in the lobby. it is so convenient to get some drinks, snacks, food, wine, beer or whatever you need on you trip. And bar Vdara, they have nice specialty cocktails n light fare. 

We had an executive corner suite at 50th floor, its a bit of long walk from the elevator, but it was worth it, the suite was big, nearly 850 sf., full kitchen, living room with windows from entrance door all the way to bedroom door, imagine the amazing view we got! A dining table, an extra powder room, bedroom with comfy king bed, big closet with safe, and a huge bathroom with the entire view of city center, soaking bathtub is right next to the window, I took a bubble bath with an amazing view every night. :) Don't worry about the sun light hurting eyes, they have shades cover all the windows of the entire suite, there is a few control panels, you can control however you want your shades to cover, even make it blackout :) 

What I love the most about our suite is that it has so many floor to ceiling windows!  Almost the entire right side of the ""walls"" are actually windows, even the bathroom has windows and amazing views, just add Champagne, roses, chocolate and bubbles, a romantic intimate evening is all set! 

I really enjoyed our 4 nights stay at Vdara the past holiday weekend, and I especially want to thank housekeeping, I have a lot of things when I travel, they made everything clean and perfect in my suite, even put my shoes in order, that was very nice of them. :) In my opinion, the staffs provide good service to everybody, hubby travels so much, he always gives more tips, do that we get better service, he tipped $10 on housekeeping everyday, maybe that's why I had my things all organized the entire weekend, smart :) 

Vdara now is my favorite hotel stay in Vegas, will stay there again and again, will try other bigger suite next time, panoramic suite is a very nice choice. :) 

The rates are a little more expensive than some of the top hotels in Vegas, especially on holiday weekends, Saturday night on Labor day weekend was $400 for our executive corner suite, but the studio suite rates are much cheaper, sign up their email list, you get special offers from time to time. 

Ps. I love their bathroom so much! You don't see too many bathroom with views in Vegas. Beautiful tub with beautiful Vegas skyline and city center view, bubble bath with Champagne every night!",13,3,5

Overall, I was incredibly happy with this hotel and with CityCenter in general!

- Vdara is a non-gaming hotel. I'd never stayed in one of those in Vegas before, but it's clean, quiet, smells good, and is a VERY nice retreat from the hustle, bustle, noise, and lights of the casinos.
- CityCenter is huge, but it's in the middle of everything, and getting out of it really isn't hard. You can a) take the walkway to the Bellagio, b) use the tram, which goes from Vdara to Aria to the Monte Carlo, c) take 3 minutes out of your day to walk from Vdara to Aria, or d) take a taxi, which will get you anywhere else you need to be. I don't know anyone who's willing to walk for extended periods of time in 110+-degree heat... even if your hotel is right on the sidewalk of the strip.
- Super friendly staff! Very helpful, very knowledgeable.
- Rooms were beautiful and well-appointed. Every single room has a kitchenette, and they have an extra mini fridge where you can stash all of YOUR drinks... this is almost unheard-of in Vegas hotels! They do give 2 free bottles of water a day (included in the resort fee), and while they're small, this is more hospitality than others show. While the Venetian is still one of my favorites, pretty much nothing is included in their room fees.
- Nice decor.
- Fairly small, fairly quiet pool. Like I said, you can go over to any of the other pool parties in town and get your dose of house music and binge drinking, but the value here is in being able to escape that.
- Cheapest pool cabanas in town! My girls and I got one for about 250, which included a fridge full of drinks, some frozen fruit, a goodie bag of sunscreen and skin products, and a couch\/tv in the shade all day long. Anywhere else, you're looking at at least 500, if not more... we did our research before we booked this one!
- Everything is close to the lobby: all of the elevators (compare this to Luxor, where if you walk in the wrong door, you might walk a mile just to find the right elevator), the walkway to Bellagio and therefore the tram station, the restaurant... everything is very, very convenient.
- The gym is small but nice. They provide you with towels and water at no charge.

The only thing I took away stars for is that housekeeping didn't always fulfill the daily freebies requirement; one day, we'd get our free waters and newspapers, the next, we wouldn't. One day, they organized every last thing in our messy room, right down to the fake eyelashes, and the next, they left everything in it's un-proper place and just gave us some fresh towels. I'm not incredibly picky about that sort of thing, though, so it's only one star off.

Overall, I would absolutely recommend Vdara! It was a great experience, and as part of CityCenter, it's close to everything brand new and red hot right now in Vegas.",1,0,0

As far as the actual hotel room goes, I couldn't have asked for a nicer room. We had the CITY CORNER SUITE and it certainly was SWEET!! This room literally was like an apartment. The suite came with a bedroom with a king size pillow-top mattress and a separate living room with a pullout mattress on the sofa. Also, it had a full functional kitchen (4 stove ranges), a dishwasher, sink, and a FULL size refrigerator! Oh, I almost forgot --it comes with a washer and drier in the room! So Legit. I haven't even mentioned how beautiful the view was from the living room, master bedroom, and bath. It was especially beautiful at night. The shades came with 2 options: ""shade"" and ""blackout."" Pretty self-explanatory, if you want to create a dark room choose blackout, if you want a shield from the bright sun-but not darkness pull down the shade and down comes this sheer shade. 

Okay, onto the bathroom--the bathroom encompasses two sinks, a bath, and a shower and toilet. It's a pretty huge bathroom. What i didn't like though was that there was no door to the actual toilet itself, since the bathroom was so big I think the space would be better utilized if someone was able to do make-up and drop a deuce at the same time without having their privacy violated, but again --no biggie b\/c the room was GORGEOUS. 

FREE WI-FI! 

Also here, they seem pretty strict in monitoring who goes to the elevators. They sometimes ask to see your keys. Which I guess is a good thing for your own security, but it makes it a little harder if you have friends that want to come visit. 

I subtracted a star b\/c they don't have their own parking lot (they share with ARIA) so you have to take a tram. B\/C of this, it makes it a little difficult to get to (i.e. from the strip).",1,0,1

Every room has a kitchen, which is great for those leftovers. There's a microwave, utensils, stove, dishwasher, and fridge. Basically, everything that you need. Also, the $25 resort fee includes wi-fi usage and water. The resort fee also includes gym use, which is great. 

The pool is small, but it is not as crowded as the pools in other facilities, so it is nice to be able to lay out and relax.

Vdara is right now my favorite hotel in Las Vegas and most people I know have never heard of it.  Why? Because it has no casino, no destination bar, restaurant or club, and although it's on the Strip in theory, it has no Strip facade and nearly no signage.  

Yet its location in the City Center complex is nearly ideal.  Cross the driveway and you're in Aria, down the stairs and into the swanky new Cosmopolitan; stroll out the back, down an open walkway and you're in Bellagio.  The only downside is you have to go through one of these hotels to even reach the Strip in a legal fashion on foot  -- there are no sidewalks down Harmon Dr. that take you to Las Vegas Blvd.  

Why, then, does Vdara make me so happy?  Well, it's not the pool, I can tell you that.  Perched on top of the lobby, below the mirrored southern facade of the hotel, it has no real character, virtually no shade and seems designed to bake you like a boneless breast in a solar oven.  It's very fine to hang at the poolside cafe at breakfast time and then it's time to go elsewhere. ( I've managed to get into the pools at Bellagio and Aria as well as Monte Carlo while staying at Vdara so all is not lost.)

No, what Vdara gives us is a completely non-smoking property (awesome) and big, stylish modern luxury suites for the price of a mere room at most new hotels.  People go other places in Vegas to play at being rock stars or hip-hop moguls for a weekend.  At Vdara you can live like a movie star in quiet seclusion until you're ready for your close-up.

Designed to be condos before the market went ass over teakettle, the suites are completely livable homes - and LEED certified no less - in the heart of the Strip.  It's almost as if you're not in Las Vegas at all!  Full kitchen, washer and drier, and really, really nice bathrooms - you get a lot for your money here.  I love the big windows with automatic shades and the cool lighting. 

I used a coupon to get upgraded to a one bedroom corner suite that actually had TWO corners and a 250 degree view.  Sure, the view was of the freeway and west Vegas but also Red Rocks, and Aria and Bellagio pools.  And yes, we all have to pay a $18 resort fee per day but that does include wi-fi, use of the very worthy gym and spa, and water bottles restocked in the fridge every day.  But really, I pay more than that for hotel parking in a lot of cities and at Vdara the valet parking is free.

The lobby is a nice hangout (smells good, not like second-hand Lucky Strike), the staff were all super-nice, and the rooms were nice and quiet.  I only mark it down from 5 stars for the average pool and the challenging pedestrian path to the Strip.  Would I go back?  Uh, like, tonight, if somebody hands me the plane ticket.",9,4,4

When we pulled up the Valet was not around for a good 5 min I was not sure if they even had one at this point.  When the guy came up after a few he was nice and had the Bell desk come get our luggage.  Then we went to check in to our suite and started to notice the crowd was a little different.  More like a party hotel and not a 5 star.  People were checking in with cases of water and beer with ice chests.  But we just figured ok they are ready tp party.  The send us up to the room and as we walk up some lady walks out of our room and says our room is not done and walks away.  ?  Mind you front desk told us to go up and its all ready for us.  The lady never came back and never said anything else.  So we then go back down to ask what is going on and the front desk apologizes to my wife and I and up grades us to a (Pent House) really just a larger room.   We get all the way back up and OMG smelled like the party was still in the room.  Smelled like throw up and was not clean and rundown.  At this point we just wanted to go home after all this.  Went back down to let them know we wanted our bags and car so we could just leave.  The front said well we have to charge you 300 but let me see if I can get it waived.  The manger came out and waived the charge then we walk out and had to wait for ever for our car and then they tried to charge me for the car and again had to get the manger.

Vying to get back to where we left off, I thought we'd try our hand at Vdara.  Across the beautiful fountain playing centerpiece connector to the sister resort to Aria; they follow the same modern artsy tone next door.  The hotel contains all suites without a casino and no smoking allowed.  

You read that right, no casino.  Take it in for a second.  This may bug many, but I didn't care much.  Simply step foot in any other casino if gambling is on your mind, it's harder to find a place without smoking allowed than you'd think in Vegas.   

Like any resort, they do have a pool and spa.  The pool area is moderately sized with only one main pool.  While disappointing compared to the one at the Aria and other hotels I've visited, food can be served to you while soaking in the sun.  I didn't partake in any spa related activities, but used their fitness center.  

The fitness center is somewhat limited yet had enough for a to the point workout.  Some ""reserved"" signs were on the treadmills; that's a nice benefit.  In the free weight section there is a gigantic eye gluing television which extended my breaks between reps longer than expected.  When all said and done, why am I even commenting on their fitness center?  It's Vegas.       

Downstairs in the lobby besides the front desk, there are only a few things worth mentioning.  They have a bar, the name I do not remember, most of the people staying at the Vdara got their drink on there.  On the opposite side, there is the Vdara Marketplace.  This is their general store and café mixed in one.  Want a roast beef sandwich or some band aids, you'll find them both there.  Since we didn't find a gift shop downstairs, I guess that was it.   

With limited things to do, Bun and I spent most of our time away from Vdara.  A handy walkway toward the Bellagio and a tram that stops at City Center and Monte Carlo is around the corner.  That was the easiest route toward the Strip.  Given the price of the stay, it was worth it.  The resort fee is somewhat of an annoyance, yet many places have the fee anyway.  Vdara is a reasonable value stay and more appropriate for the older folk.  For the same price or close, I'd rather go back to Aria.",9,6,5

You get a fancy Bosch microwave and even a stovetop, but unfortunately no pots plates or utensils are provided. 

The deluxe rooms have a partitioned living space with bed on one side and couch and coffee table on the other. There are 2 TVs one on each side. The desk is built into this partition, but is little high and has no convenient power outlets. 

The one bedroom units also have a washer and dryer in the room. You can pack your dirty laundry and bring it with you to Vegas.

The Bellagio Fountain View rooms really do provide the best view to be had of the fountains.

The hotel is back behind other hotels on the strip, which pretty much kills the strip views but gives you a buffer. Because of these features, this hotel draws a certain clientele that is non-smoking, possibly less interested in gaming, etc - you get the point. It feels more refined than the typical vegas joint. It's vegas without the part of vegas I don't like - no bachelorette girls and hard partying wannabees. (Yes, party if you wish but don't bring it back to the room next to me.) None of that at Vdara. We ventured out to other hotels to visit but always enjoyed coming back to our hotel where it was calm and smelled great - kind of a peachy-vanilla scent.

The rooms are modern, clean, stylish, and quiet. An oasis away from the strip but close enough that you can participate if you so choose. I thought it was great but Vdara would be a mismatch for party animals and those bent on living the 'stays in vegas' dream.

The only negative (assuming you are the Vdara-type as I am) was the sofa bed. It's got to be the worst sofa bed I've ever seen. Thin and completely uncomfortable. If you need more sleeping space, triple up in the real bed or get more rooms.

Also there were a few stains on the carpet and some white stains on the back of the pillow in the couch,  which i can only imagine to be either drool or jizz. House cleaning didn't clean it just turned it around.  Good thing im paying so much got the room. 

Also nice bathroom, where's all the toiletry yay Isiah comes with hotels? Only thing they had was toilet paper.  No shampoo,  no soap of any kind,  they have a kitchen buy no dishes,  no utensils.  Why do you have a dishwasher yet no soap for it?

I chose Vdara because the price was relatively cheap compared to the other hotels and had what I wanted which was a large tub for me to soak in. Vdara is also smoke-free and without a casino, though Aria is in walking distance if you want either option. There is also free wifi for guests (included in resort fees). You just have to put in your last name and room number. It worked great when I was streaming Netflix.

I had to look up how to get to Vdara because I had never been there before and the map and directions were on the website. Turn left on Harmon if you're coming in from the south then follow the signs to the hotel. It can get a little confusing, but I managed. Vdara only has valet parking, but it's complimentary and that's what I did with my car. From the valet to the front desk, everyone was very friendly and enthusiastic. The person at the front desk was efficient checking me in and asked if I wanted a room on a low floor or high floor. I wanted high for the view and got a room on the 50th floor.

The room itself was huge and had a mini fridge as well as a kitchenette if I wanted to cook (I didn't, but always good to have). The window shades are controlled by a remote that is on the wall between the kitchen and the bedroom. The view? Amazing. My room was located where I could see the south end of the Strip.

I had always wanted to order room service and decided this was the time to do it. I ordered Organic Airline Chicken and two sides: Mushroom and Herb Risotto and Sauteed Spinach. It took about half an hour to arrive and when it did, the person who brought it was friendly. She came into the room and placed my food on the table in the kitchen along with a flower vase. At first glance, I thought ""Oh no, the chicken is smaller than the sides it came with!"" However, I couldn't even finish my meal and had to save it for the next day. Both the spinach and risotto were delicious, no complaints, but the chicken, while crispy and yummy, was just a tad on the side of salty. Still good though.

Bonus: As a Vdara guest, I was offered a 40% discount to watch the cirque de soleil show Ka. I've been wanting to watch a cirque de soleil show since forever because I've never been to one before, but I especially wanted to watch Ka. You bet your butt that I jumped on this deal and I was not disappointed.

I loved everything about my room and this hotel, from the large tub to the people working here. There were two minor things that I didn't like, but didn't really detract from my experience. One was that, because I had a room on the higher floors, I had to take those super fast elevators that my ears did not appreciate whatsoever. Also on my second day, I had gone out to eat breakfast and lunch, but housekeeping never showed up in my room. That was fine. However, when I went to watch Ka at MGM Grand late in the afternoon and came back, I was disoriented because I couldn't turn on the lights (housekeeping had turned off the lights using the master switch which I didn't use) and everything was cleaned up. Including my makeup on the bathroom counter which got organized. I honestly didn't expect housekeeping to show up so late in the day and it wasn't a nice surprise because I wasn't expecting it.

If I ever decide to do another staycation, Vdara is definitely a hotel reservation option. Love this place!",0,0,0

I stayed in the hotel in June 22-24 under Bae soo yeon which was my friend's name.

But it came to this point where I have to write something about the situation about the customer service because nobody is helping me to solve the problem and since nobody is in charge every time I called over 10 times. 

They said that they will send me a check by mail and it is gonna take 10-14 business days. but the problem is that It's been over a MONTH. and I had to call them so many times if the check is on the way or they sent the check or not. I left my address, name and number EVERY TIME i called. Even today, I tried to call to figure out why the check has arrived, they said that they are STILL holding on the money and somebody who is in charge is not there yet. Then how am i supposed to get the money back? 

Please explain to me, why the hotel is not sending back customer's money even after so many of the request over a month? I will write down here so that I don't have to explain the whole situation to every person on the phone.

Logistically, you are within spitting distance of Aria (across a roundabout), but the hotel is located far enough away from the Strip to keep the noise, hustle and bustle, street performers and riff-raff at bay.  

Vdara is primarily a hotel for adults and serious travelers.  There's no casino, no food court, no pool parties, no lazy river and no side shows.  Most guests seem to be couples, business travelers and well behaved tourists from overseas.  

I have always had a pleasant and relatively quiet say in the refuge Vdara provides.  If you want to go to a casino, there's easy access to both Aria and Bellagio.  For me, the only downside is Vdara is 100% valet parking, so if you come and go in a vehicle, it can be a bit of a hassle.",3,2,2

The rooms are sleek and include a little kitchenette with 2 flat screen TVs. The bathrooms have dual sinks and a lot of counter space. The toiletries are mediocre, but that is to be expected at most hotels. 

Just be aware that there is a $25 daily resort fee that will be charged to your credit card after you check out.

The room: absolutely beautiful! The walk is a bit annoying and is at the end of the floor, but the view will be worth. You are greeted by a long hallway when you walk in.
-The kitchen: nice big fridge, microwave, stove, and dishwasher. I think it's kind of pointless to have a kitchen without any plates, cups, or silverware...or papertowels. Make sure to bring your own
-The bathroom: clear shower, tub, two sinks, closet and toilet in one room. 
-The bedroom: comfy king bed, a desk table and TV

-$25 resort fee that includes internet and the valet-only parking

The rooms are large and reasonably priced. The hotel vibe is very Zen and the staff is extremely accomodating.

I really appreciate the fact that the hotel is smoke free and is conveniently located to several other gaming hotels. Vdara has a walkway to Bellagio right next to the Silk Road Restaurant (which is no longer open for dinner); you can walk outside to the left to Aria; or walk outside and take the stairs to the left of Silk Road and you are at Cosmopolitan...all in less than 5 minutes. So who cares that Vdara has no casino. I actually prefer it this way.

Hubs and I have stayed in the Deluxe Suite overlooking the Bellagio Fountains (room 34.034), Vdara Suite, City Suite and Executive Corner Suite. The Executive Corner Suite was my favorite by far - especially since its large enough to host a few friends for pre-clubbing cocktails. However, the rest of the rooms are pretty comparable. I liked the Deluxe Room and felt that the layout of the Vdara Suite was too circular - so between these two I'd probably choose the Deluxe (with the divider - you get 2 t.v.'s instead of 1) based on the price.

While I love the Strip and all its luster....its a bit like relatives. You want them just far enough away to appreciate them.   5 min cab ride or a 5 min walk and you are on there. Smack Dab in the middle. Aria, and Cosmopolitan complement its location with great food everywhere (and close by).

Its in great shape and the staff are helpful when called upon. 
Noise levels were low, with a lack of smoke and gambling in the lobby, it was a nice place to come back to.

Room Tip: If you are in a room with a Kitchenette, immediately request silverware and plates (and cookware if you intend to cook).  With Take out boxes in aluminum bottom boxes, you need something to transfer it to at the least, if you intend to microwave.",1,0,1

The rooms are all suites, and yes they are gorgeous. 

The rooms had excellent views, loved the decor, and the comfy a$$ bed. My favorite was the kitchenette and the bathrooms. The bath tub was huge and I liked how the showers had a built in bench. I really enjoyed getting ready for a night out in this bathroom!!!! Lighting was perfect for make up ladies!!!! 

I can't really think of anything wrong with the room except that you need to call room service for silverware...kind of lame considering the size of the kitchenette...I really am almost tempted to just call it a kitchen.

The room, the beauty of the hotel, the luxurious aura, location etc that all gets 4.5 stars, but the service here is what lacks. 

We were the only group in line for check in, and I know I was waiting at least 45 minutes. Thank goodness for the cozy beautiful seating area.

*****Important!!! It wasn't an issue that they only have valet parking-but the drivers clearly didn't know how to handle a car with after market modifications and lowered cars.They scraped the bottom of our car while taking it to the garage and when bringing it out. The valet dude yelled at us and told us that it should have never been parked in the garage since it was so low and pointed to an area just in front of the hotel where they have a few spaces reserved for certain clientele I am assuming??? OH OK thanks for letting us know after our stay there and when we are leaving!!!!

It's smoke free so you can actually breathe and it's smells awesome.

The major downside is that there is no casino, sportsbooks, etc. here. Only a massage\/spa, pool and shopping area.

Our room was one of their standard ""suites"", with a king bed, a queen sofa bed and a kitchenette.

The room would be great for two people; any more than that and it loses some of its allure. The ""living room"" really isn't separate from the ""bedroom""; they're the same space with a divider (open on the ends) separating them. There's a 42-inch flat screen (with HD channels) on both sides. The kitchenette has a two-burner cooktop and a tiny fridge, and I overheard a front-desk employee tell someone that you can request cookware and dishes to be brought up.

The room itself is nice, on par with any new, modern hotel. It's certainly nicer than rooms I've been in at MGM, Mandalay Bay and NY-NY, but there wasn't anything especially ""wow"" about it. Nice decor and furnishings, the bathroom is really spacious and nice.

The biggest problem was the noise. We were on the 41st floor, and were the next to last room on the western end, on the north side of the hall. This meant our rooms were very close to I-15 and the Bellagio's HVAC system -- so there was a constant din of noise, enough to keep me awake for most of the night. I can't imagine how it would be on a lower floor. To add to this, somebody started up some sort of power tool about 8am, further intruding on my attempts to sleep.

All of the employees we encountered in the hotel were very friendly and helpful, and the non-smoking non-gaming nature of the hotel makes it a welcome, quiet respite from the buzz of the Strip.",1,0,0

This is probably one of my favorite places to stay, and I think the Vdara has some of the most breathtaking views out of all the hotels in Vegas.  Our group of friends recently stayed in a suite, which had a queen size bed and pull out couch. We had awesome kitchen accommodations, including a water filter inside the refrigerator. Other basic kitchen amenities included microwave, stove, sink, refrigerator, freezer, and plenty of storage space for drinks and snacks. 

The major downside was the bathroom, which is a central part to getting ready for a night in Vegas. The features inside the bathroom were awesome, though. We had two sinks, a bathtub, standing shower, toilet, aaaaand a separate full mirror with plenty of counterspace for doing makeup, hair, and whatever else people do in front of a mirror. However, all of this is enclosed behind two doors, so technically, only one person can be in the bathroom at once if they are using the toilet, tub, or shower... unless your group members are super comfortable with each other. Plus, our sliding door was broken, so that was awkward.

The bedroom has a plasma TV, which was useful for watching movies in the morning or bumping music at night. The hallways and walking spaces are a bit cramped in the suite, but if you don't have too many people moving around, it's not too big of a problem. Room service is good, and they are quick to bring us any additional amenities upon request.

The most DISGUSTING part , when I opened the drawer in the bathroom , there was a plastic bag inside and when I opened it , there was a USED WOMEN'S UNDERWEAR in it. YUCK

The only downside might be the location.

The walk is completely doable, but becomes a little inconvenient after 10 hours of drinking and gambling. Throw in heels and forget about it.

The only disappointments were the fitness center size (quite small and not much strength training equipment) and a bit of slow service when requesting additional soap\/shampoo\/etc. The lobby cafe is quite pricey for the quality and quantity of food (for example, $10 for about a six inch plain sandwich).

We visited in mid-March; at check-in, it came up that we were visiting for an anniversary. We had booked a standard room and didn't expect much -- the front desk assistant said he'd see what he could do to give us a good room. We ended up on the 53rd floor (out of 56) overlooking the Bellagio fountains. It was gorgeous and absolutely breathtaking, especially at sunrise. It can be hard to tell when they're really upgrading you and when they're just giving you the room you'd have had anyway -- but I know the fountain view was a different price point when I looked, so we were super appreciative of the assignment.

The rooms here are exceptionally clean and well-maintained. Rooms have a kitchenette area with a two burner electric cooktop, stocked minibar, under-the-counter refrigerator, and sink. You can request kitchen equipment through housekeeping, if you'd like. There were two TVs, a king-size bed, and the bathroom had both a shower stall and a large tub. Housekeeping was phenomenal, going beyond basic touch-ups to even organize items - whether straightening bathroom counter toiletries or wrapping the cord up on my hair straightener. It was just really great.

It's a non-smoking, non-gaming hotel -- which was awesome. Why not go have your fun elsewhere and come back to a clean, quieter hotel? It is dog-friendly, and we saw a couple of pups during our stay. There's a Starbucks, a lounge, and a cafe on the first floor - Starbucks is expensive, but prices were consistent across the Strip. The fitness center was clean and well-staffed. Lots of guests were taking advantage of the treadmills and weight room, yet it was large enough to accommodate demand. The pool area is very nice, with a large pool, hot tub, and cafe\/bar. On a particularly windy day, the pool deck was closed but we were able to go across to Aria and use their pool instead (which is also gorgeous).

Perhaps the only downside is that it can take a long time to get out to Las Vegas Blvd. You can either go out the front doors and take an elevator or stairs down to enter Cosmopolitan through the parking garage, or you can take the connecting bridge over to Bellagio. The perk is that it's only a short walk to the tram stop that runs to Crystals and Monte Carlo.

Lastly, it should be noted that Vdara has amazing staff. It's like they scooped up all the friendliest people working in hospitality and dropped them there. Whether it was the desk, pool, or fitness center staff, everyone was so very kind. It definitely made an impression on us, and we'll for sure keep Vdara at the top of our list for future visits!",6,0,1

It felt like a nice little one bedroom apartment! The bed was super comfortable. The blinds were controlled by a button! Ooo fancy. On top of all that, it was a really good price at $229\/night for a nonpeak weekend.

Service exceeded my expectations. I had made a reservation online earlier with my AAA discount (10% off). When I checked in at the front desk, the guy told me that I was an Mlife member (I didn't know that) and told me that I could get an even better discount (15% off). He took the time to create my Mlife card and even changed the rate for my friend's room as well who didn't even check in yet. He was super friendly and gave us his opinion on Drais since we were planning on going that night. I think his name is Dominic? Also, all of our luggage arrived pretty quickly to our room. The bell boy asked if the fridge and everything was working and if we wanted him to get ice for us. 

The only con was that since Vdara is valet parking only, Sunday morning around checkout time was a bit hectic. There were so many people waiting outside to get their cars. We waited about 20 minutes.

Tips
-No self parking but valet parking is free
-Dog friendly hotel
-There is a security guard that checks room keys by the elevator
-Free wi-fi for up to 4 devices (your last name + room number)",6,0,1

What a treat...the hotel was wonderful! Conor helped us check in, and after requesting an upgrade and mentioning our anniversary (and giving Conor a nice tip), we were off to our room with a view of the Bellagio fountains (with no extra charge!).  The room was great...very spacious, elegant and modern, and the bed was so comfortable! Conor  even called later and left a message to make sure we were satisfied...great customer service! My only complaint about the room was the construction going on outside right below us. We were on the 23rd floor and I was surprised how much noise came through the windows, starting very early in the morning, and all night sometimes. Otherwise, I did not hear any other noise in our room which was great. I really enjoyed that Vdara is smoke-free and non-gaming.  It was so nice to come ""home"" after a long day\/night out, and not have to navigate a huge, loud, smoky casino to reach our room. And the lobby smells amazing! We had the $75 resort credit which was perfect for coffee for 3 days, snacks, waters and beers here and there.  We didn't even use the whole credit.  Housekeeping was very friendly and did a very nice job making up our room while we were out. It was cool to come back to the room and find our bathroom items neatly organized...cute little touch. I thought Vdara was in an excellent location, and the walk through the Bellagio to reach the Strip was quick and pleasant. My husband and I had a wonderful anniversary at Vdara, and agree this will be our new go-to hotel when we visit Vegas.

Located in the City Center, its location absolutely kills the Skylofts which is at the end of strip.  Unfortunately service slightly soured my experience here.

The trip started off on a slightly bad foot.  My boys were flying in from New Orleans while I flew in from New York.  Our arrival times were 15 minutes apart.  They arrived first, and the limo service from Vdara rushed them and wouldn't wait for me.  They sent the limo back out to get me, but it ended up being a 30 minute wait.  By that point, I just decided to catch a cab.  Definitely was pretty pissed off the limo driver couldn't wait 15 minutes.  It turned into a 45 minute ordeal and an expensive cab ride.

For this last trip, we were able to get a corner two-bedroom penthouse suite.  The rooms are nice.  Amazing views of the mountains, the strip, and The Cosmopolitan Hotel.  Super spacious, clean and modern.  The bedrooms are slightly smallish but overall quite comfortable.  The one downfall is the dreaded hotel iron.  That shit sucks balls.  In-house washer and dryer was pretty money though.

As for the Hotel itself, the energy was slightly missing without a casino downstairs, which meant we spent a considerable amount of time walking to Aria.  This wasn't a big deal, but merely noting, if you wanted something a little bit more high energy, this place might not be for you.  Also there aren't any buffets so that meant more walking to get fed.

For a room, it's about as good as it gets.  Super comfortable and spacious.  For an experience, there are probably better options on the strip.",1,1,2

-The smell of the lobby well....it smells good....like flowers
-Quick elevators with no one in them
-Nice rooms with small kitchenette, steam shower, excellent view of the Bellagio fountains 
-No weird people because there is no casino and it's a little out of the way 
-Really enjoyed pushing a button for Do Not Disturb or Maid service.   Also enjoyed the electronic blinds
-comfy bed

Cons about Vdara
-No self parking garage only valet.  We used Aria's and took the tram over 
- Pool closed due to inclement weather.  Not Vdara's fault that there was too much wind our entire stay 
-off the beaten path so you really have to hoof it if you want to get down to the Strip

I've stayed here twice while in Vegas and enjoyed myself each time. The rooms are some of the largest I've ever stayed in. Easy for the three of us who were sharing this last visit. The entire place is non-smoking and doesn't have a casino so it's very serene.

The location is on the southern end of the strip and is a little isolated back behind Cosmopolitan. It's a bit of a walk to get to the Strip, and they certainly didn't make it convenient to walk to Cosmo, but getting to Bellagio is very simple.

I guess I like a little more energy when I'm staying in Vegas, but catering to a more calm demographic will keep this hotel nice for a long time. Even the pool was pretty calm compared to a lot of other Vegas pools.

I'd easily stay here again, especially since it's so easy to figure out when this hotel is the ""mystery"" hotel on Hotwire. Just look for a south strip, five-star, non-casino hotel and most likely it will be Vdara!

On the last leg of my recent Vegas trip, I spent three nights at Vdara, one of the many properties in the City Center Complex.  Though this hotel does not have its own casino, its sister property Aria, with its casino and many bars and restaurants, is only a short walk away.  

We had a corner suite with a spectacular view of Aria and surrounding areas.  Amenities of our suite included:

*A kitchen area complete with refrigerator and small dining area\/table.

*Small living room space with a sofa, flat screen television, and coffee table.

*Spacious bathroom with dual vanities, soaking tub, make-up counter\/area, generous closet space, and a roomy stand-up shower.

*Push button controls for the blinds\/shades for the entire room.  Very convenient and helpful.....there was just a wee bit of difficulty locating all the various controls.

*Complimentary (and very comfortable) bath slippers.

Overall, I liked our suite very much.  The kitchen and living room areas were a very decent size, while the bathroom was much larger than I expected.  There was also a placard in the kitchen area stating that kitchen utensils and accessories (pots, pans, etc), were available on request.  As far as the bed is concerned, it was soft and extremely comfortable.  

I feel my only gripe about the room is that we had some difficulty, initially, locating all the controls for the blinds.  Also, I did wonder why two doors were given access to the bathroom (one from the bedroom and the other via the kitchen).  I thought that was a bit odd, though the door access from the kitchen could be locked from inside the bathroom.  Lastly, there was a slightly vinegar odor in the room when we arrived, and so maintenance was sent up to the room with an air purifier type device.  Thankfully, the smell disappeared later that night.

Lastly, some hotel amenities I took advantage of were the Starbucks and convenience store\/coffee shop in the lobby.  I commend the baristas at the Starbucks, as they exhibited much teamwork the morning I visited.  Adversely, the store is part coffee shop and part convenience store.  You're able to order pastries and coffee, while there is a self service section for water, juices, sodas, snacks, etc.  Items are a bit pricey, but hey, you're paying for the convenience after all.

BOTTOM LINE:  A pleasant 3-night stay at the Vdara Hotel.  I wouldn't mind returning to stay on a future trip.",10,5,8

We both loved that it is a non-smoking, non-gaming hotel. Simply walk into the lobby and you feel instantly refreshed and soothed, a stark contrast to other properties on the strip. It is a bit of a walk out to the strip but we didn't mind, it was a good way for us to stay active! Although, we also used the fitness center in the hotel and it was pretty well-equipped. During our stay the temperatures reached 117 degrees! Yikes! But we didn't go down to the pool (despite my pleading) but I guess it was better that way since I've seen reports about the death ray that reflects off the building and onto the pool area lol. But anyway, our stay was wonderful and management and housekeeping were very accomodating. The only issue I had was at check in when I requested a room facing the Bellagio fountains but was told there are no Panoramic Suites on that side of the building. I was very disappointed and wasn't quite sure if this was true or not but whatever, we still got great views of City Centre. The Marketplace in the lobby is great, we picked up breakfast every morning there and I loved their bagels! It took me a couple days to notice that there was someone standing by the elevators checking peoples room cards (most just waived them towards him) but I never did, whoops! Concierge was very helpful and got us spectacular seats to Cirque Du Soleil Zarkana. They also printed out our tickets to a Beyonce concert as I had forgotten them at home.

There is also a designated pickup for Uber and Lyft if you use it.

Location wise, it's pretty centered on the strip. If you feel like gambling you have access to Aria and  Cosmopolitan. You're also near the Miracle Mile Shops in case you want cheap-ish food and want to go shopping.

The bed fit 5 girls and we almost missed our flight. Nice TV with a plethora of channels, including a radio that was a nice way to pre-game before a crazy night out. Loved it!

It's funny because this hotel does not have its own casino but it's right next to Aria and fairly close to Bellagio. That could be good, and that could be bad. It's all relative.

During CES\/AVN weekend, I was able to book 2 nights here for $169\/night, which was the best value on the Strip for that weekend. The City Center hotel is just over a year old, so the rooms are really nicely appointed with modern amenities. Although there is no casino and not much in terms of dining options, it's conveniently located next to The Cosmopolitan, Aria and Bellagio, so it's just a short walk to some of the best gambling, clubs and restaurants in Vegas. An additional upside is that the hotel is clean and smells really nice when you walk through the lobby because no smoking is allowed and they pump this lovely scent through their vents. I wish my house smelled like that. 

My BFF and I enjoyed our suite; bed was super comfy, bathroom was really nice and stocked with Aveda products, and there was a mini kitchenette, great for heating up leftovers at 4am. Our other friends stayed in a similar sized king room that had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains so we got a great view of the water show at night.

There were 6 people staying here, and at $600\/night, it was such a steal. Like I said, you can feel like a big baller without breaking the bank here. Unfortunately, their check-in process was a bit of a nightmare as the suite was not ready at 3pm, but they did give them spa credits.

I was here for Super Bowl in February and I loved the Hotel. 
I am not a big fan of Hotels that don't have a Casino.....but this place is really nice.
I really loved the room and we had a view of the Bellagio fountain. It was a beautiful suite and very comfortable. The bed was soooooo comfy!!!!! 

We loved the bar downstairs, we ended up watching the Superbowl there and had a great time. 

The only thing I wasn't completely excited about is the fact that you have to walk so far to even get to the strip. You either have to gown down to the Cosmo, walk through their parking lot, lobby, casino..... up the stairs..... you get the idea...... 
Or you have to walk over to Aria and pretty much do the same exact thing. 

Definitely will be booking this Hotel again",2,0,2

The room was spacious enough to definitely hold 3, maybe 4, people comfortably if people don't mind doubling up on the beds. Kitchen area was nice for having a ""bar area"" and storing\/re-heating leftovers.

The one tiny complaint I had was that the room was pretty dusty, so maybe management can make sure housekeeping goes over all the surfaces. There were definitely layers of dust on the nightstands and over the phones, but not a huge deal.

Its location is doesn't sacrifice the  feeling part of the ""strip"",  yet provides a feeling of getting away. It offers a touch of class, value,  and flair. 
 We stayed in the Vdara suite,  which was a $50 upgrade from our $90\/night Hotwire Deluxe suite reservation.  The 51st floor room offered an expansive North side view of Las Vegas, in addition to a clear view of the Bellagios famous fountain show. Our room came equipped with 2 flat screen TV's, a separate living room with a pull out couch,  washer\/dryer combo, a full kitchen, tub\/shower combo, Egyptian cotton robes, and complimentary slippers. In short, more than enough amenities to make the stay extremely comfortable.
 The pool: I was iffy about this before,  because I once stayed in at Mandalay Bay and thought,  how could a pull ever rival that. Although Vdara does not offer a wave pool,  and lazy river like Mandalay, what it offers is equally as appealing. There are 3 seperate pools, one being a sauna spa pool, and the other 2 waiting pools.  Its located on the 3 floor and offers a slight view of the entrance way among other things. Overall the ratio of people to pool made the experience overall more relaxing ......there was no struggle to fight for space.

The bulk of our group has traveled to Vegas multiple times, and we've stayed at the Venetian\/Palazzo for the past few years.  We thought we'd try the Vdara for a change.  My thoughts for the Vdara for a group trip:

-While the hotel is super nice, it's better for couples who enjoy quiet time, or young families with small children (under the age of 2).  My husband and I had our own room, which was nice, but the rest of our group shared a room for four people.  This was a bit tight, at least in the standard room.  If you want to stay four people to a room, you're way better off with the Venetian\/Palazzo, whose rooms are much bigger.

-The pool is small, but there was no shortage of seats on Saturday or Sunday.  We rented a cabana on Saturday, which supposedly has room for eight, but really, it's better for under four.  There are only four sunbathing chairs (direct sun, no umbrellas) and you *might* have room for another four in covered TV room, but it was tight and just not comfortable.  So NOT worth the $200 (or $250 on a holiday).  The upside was getting use of the little rectangle pools in front of the cabanas, but again, not worth the cost.  On Sunday, we reserved a couple of day beds, which are wide chairs that sit two or three friends comfortably.  This is a much cheaper option, as you only have to meet a $100 food\/bev minimum, but if you're with a group of three or more, you can EASILY spend that on cocktails and water.  You don't get use of the little rectangle pool, but you do get umbrellas and your own waiter who never lets your drink get empty.

-The location is fine, you can access the hotel from the Cosmopolitan (gorgeous!) or Bellagio.  I was worried about walking to the hotel in the July heat and it was so not a big deal.

-They still have service issues.  Our friends had two adjoining rooms - one got cleaned, the other did not.  My husband and I were woken up at 8am on Monday morning because room service kept banging on our door.  When we finally let them in, they gave us a couple of coffee pods for the coffee machine.  Problem:  the room didn't have a coffee machine.  When we called the front desk, they didn't know what we were talking about or why they delivered the coffee to us.  Mistakes happen, but at 8am, it's a bit tougher to overlook.  

Overall, I would not stay there again.",0,0,0

I stayed at Vdara back in December with my Travel Buddy. We stayed in the Vdara Suite (which ended up being the handicap room) and we loved it! One bedroom with a huge bathroom and a comfortable king bed! Nice living room with a pull out couch. Another bathroom which was handy when it was time to get ready. The kitchen was nice even though we rarely used it (only the fridge to store our liquor he he he). 

Vdara is off the strip but easy access through the City Center tram and connected by a tunnel to the Bellagio.

I would definitely stay here again, the room was nice and comfortable. BUT I don't recommend staying here when it's cold in Vegas. The walk of shame in the freezing cold back to this hotel is no fun!

Great view, on 49th floor -- room is newish and clean, so no complaints in that department.

Update:  everything has been smooth since original post, I've up'd my score.  This is a nice place, but a few bugs exist.  On the bugs side is basic things like having a kitchen (a plus!) but absolutely no plates or anything of value to use it.  Bathroom and kitchen sinks have a nice modern look, but not very functional - they don't drain very well.  The shower is nice, but takes 5-10 minutes before hot water arrives.  The location is great, but no self parking -- basically, you must park at Aria and take 10 min tram.

Overall, this is a nice place, but more expensive than advertised due to no parking!  If you are driving, plan on an extra $20\/day to park.

The pool area is nice - get a cabana for $250 all day -- it's a bargain compared to what you'd pay at other hotels. With the cabana you get a bag of sun goodies (lotions, etc.), a fully stocked fridge, access to the private pools, four chairs and towels, and a shaded cabana with a big screen TV.

I was there for my 50th Birthday with my sisters in law and one of them recommended the hotel.  I had booked a few months early, so the rates were really good (went through their website). So, I was able to get a Corner Suite.  Let me tell you, the view was amazing!  I had a view of the fabulous Bellagio fountains on one end of my view and the rest of the city on the other.  The room was like a one bedroom apartment.  Clean and sleek in decor. The bed was amazingly comfy (and with  enough pillows).  The water pressure in the shower was perfect (the water was always hot).  The only thing about the bathroom I'd change is the lighting. Not used to the lower lighting in a bathroom, but maybe that's me.

We got there early and the VERY helpful front desk was able to get us in to a room as early as 1pm. Not as early as we liked, but with as many people that were checking in, it was just enough time for us to have a bite to eat and explore the area.  The Bell desk was happy to hold our bags until it was time to head to our room.  He met me there just as soon as I walked in the room.  Talk about speedy service!  The hotel was able to accomodate our late check out, as well (two hours longer does make a difference, when you're in Vegas).

I loved the scent of the lobby.  They pipe a certain fragrance through the AC (we believe) that's fresh and exotic (not too obnoxious).  The Aria Gift shop has some of the scent sticks, but alas, not the ones for Vdara.

The only Con I have is with the Marketplace Cafe.  Yes, they move people through the line quickly.  However, it's such a small area, it clogs quickly and you're waiting for certain things a while, since it has to come from another kitchen.  The last day I was waiting for a Bagel with Salmon and cream cheese: 20 min later (even though they told me it would be 10) I asked where my food was.  Turns out no one one told the food runner!  Food is ok, just not worth $7 for a Sausage Egg bfast sandwich.  Service was also slow at the pool restaurant\/lounge area.  I think it was just that there was only one person for the entire area.  The other Con was the WiFi, just horrible.  Wasn't sure if it was the location of my room or my carrier or act of God.  Didn't bring a laptop to plug in, so I couldn't compare the difference. The Wifi was just slow (even for texting).

Staying in a non-smoking hotel makes such a difference in the quality of sleep. Super comfy beds and much more reasonably priced than the Aria or Cosmo. I really enjoyed the ESPA even though the couples massage was an arm and a leg. But you do get what you pay for and the treatment was bliss.

Kinda missed that when I stayed here. Another thing is that there's no direct self parking, it's the city center parking and it's a bit of a walk so I just did valet which was a nightmare as well, you're going around in circles and circles hoping you finally land in front of the right hotel (i obviously missed it the first night).  

The rooms are really nice, a kitchen though they didn't come with cooking stuff, I think you have to request those.  They had plenty of outlets by the bed, YAY!  BUT one thing that did really irk me was the switches.  There's a master switch...by the door...so you have to kind of maneuver yourself in the dark after you turn the lights off...unless I am an idiot and didn't know how to work the lights, which is also possible but I am pretty sure they were powered by the master switch only.  

I didn't get a chance to but they do have an amazing bath to bathe in...it's humongous! definitely wouldn't want a ""What Lies Beneath"" situation in that tub!
Overall, I think I would still prefer Bellagio or Aria, just because it's so much easier to find the location and there's more options for things around those hotels.  But it's not a bad place, and if you do hate the crazy scenes of the casino, you should definitely check this one out.",4,1,1

Booked a room at Treasure Island but really wanted to be in the middle of the strip. Checked out Vdara and the views of the suites are impressive. Loved all the windows and it doesnt make you feel like you're a prisoner by walls and a small window like other hotels.

Booked the City corner suite but got upgrade to the Executive suite and got the VIP treatment. My host Teresa comp me $100 to charge to my room and was very courteous showing me to my suite. The king size bed was so comfortable and relaxing. Flat screen in master room and living room. Stand in shower, double sink and deep bath tub is very nice. It had a nice kitchen with a electric stove, full size fridge with freezer, coffee maker. Living room had a queen pull out bed, and it also had a half bathroom. Very spacious and modern look.

When trying to look for the valet it was a little bit confusing and it reminded me of LAX airport. The valet was is the best then any other hotel I been. There is no Casino here but have it at the main hotel at the Aria and is a few minutes to Bellagio hotel which you can take a little bridge and you are inside the hotel of Bellagio. Room service was quick and was set up in our dining room. There is a starbucks located in the lobby.

Vdara should put a sign or mention it to the guest that you have to show your keycard to the attendant standing next to the elevators. Stopping people going to to their room while there hands are full and stopping to look for the keycard can be a hassle. 

 I would recommend the Hotel to family and friends. By the way I had family spread out the strip and some at old town and were jealous of the views and the suite. Good job Vdara\/Aria.",5,0,0

There is an indoor walkway from the Vdara to the Bellagio, so when you're ready for the strip and the casinos and the crowds you'll have easy access to it all. It's the best of both worlds. 

The decor is modern. There are mini kitchen facilities in the rooms and a small market in the lobby where you can buy affordable snacks for the microwave and fridge. The only downside is that there didn't appear to be a full restaurant on the premises (just the little market, bar food and room service). Worth noting but ultimately no big deal since this is Vegas and there are restaurants all over the place.

We have stayed at The Signature probably the last three times we've visited Vegas and prior to that we always stayed at the MGM (until we experienced major issues on our wedding day) so I'm glad we finally tried something else.  

My husband was impressed with how the front desk staff handled check in as they were discreet in letting him know the suite was decorated as he had requested.  There were chocolate covered strawberries and Champagne on the table when we walked in as well as rose petals on the bed in the shape of a heart.  There was an issue with valet parking fees when attempting to retrieve our vehicle every day but that was also resolved at check out.  

The room had a fantastic view.  We could see Bellagio, The Cosmo, the Eiffel Tower, and so much of the strip that it was nice waking up and hanging in the room at night with all of the bright lights.  

I thought the bed was comfy and he did not.  My husband liked the shower and I did not.  We both loved the double sinks.  I appreciated the long mirrored area in the bathroom becasue I was able to spread out all my supplies and make a royal mess of the place.  The large bathtub was nice but for some reason the water splashed out easily.  

In the evenings we could hear music though we were on the 53rd floor.  I am unsure where these tunes were coming from but I was able to sleep through it so I wasn't bothered too much.  My husband, on the other hand, was annoyed.  

All in all, I loved the location as it had easier access to all the places we frequent on the strip.  We walked down to the Venetian one afternoon after eating at the Bellagio buffet.  We had dinner at the Monte Carlo one night and that was an easy walk as well.

The staff is incredibly helpful and professional, some of the best at any Vegas hotel.

The girl had a bit of an attitude, but it did not bother me too much. She set us up on the 28th floor, which is the top floor that one of the elevators will take you to.  I had booked Vdara through their online promotion for $20 food credit per person per day.  I had to tell the girl that I made the booking under this promotion so that she could give me the voucher.  Otherwise, she would have forgotten!

I read the fine print on this promotion before I made the booking. It said that you could only use it for breakfast and lunch.  Unfortunately, the girl noted that the credit could not be used on the day you check-out.  Obviously, you could not use it on the day you check-in because of the timing.  I was disappointed because this meant I could only use it for one day!  Fortunately, the girl told us that you could use it for dinner but you would be responsible for the extra cost.  We end up using the credit for dinner on the first day and lunch on the second day.  The credit could be used at certain hotels only including Aria, Mirage, MGM, Luxor, Monte Carlo.  The credit could not be applied towards taxes and gratuities.

Room:  We had the deluxe suite. It was nice and spacious. A clean room.  We had a view of City Center.  A kitchenette and microwave was available but you would need to ask for kitchenware.  There was a nice tub, separate shower, and lots of towels.  The bed was very comfortable.  

Internet:  Free for guests, okay speed  

Parking: Valet only, no self-parking. Free for guests but we tipped the valet.

Check-out process:  I checked out and reviewed my charges through the tv.  I was e-mailed a copy of the charges instantly.  I left the keys in the room.

Other:  

Resort fee of $20 + tax per day which includes Wi-fi, water, and valet.

We tried out their gym facility.  The threadmill and bikes had individual screens.  There were iPhone connectors on the machines so that you could charge your phone\/listen to your music while you work out.  Towels and water were available.  Weights were also available.  The gym closes at 8 pm.

This is a non-smoking and non-gaming hotel which is one of the reasons why I booked it.

Things I liked were : No casino in hotel. No lines at check in the night we arrived. Over all calm at the hotel. Close to Bellagio, Aria, and Cosmopolitan. House keeping, when they showed up, did a great job. Also when we called for anything it came up right away. Of course, the main reason the price (regular nights). 
Things that made this place get the poor review:
Too loud music in the lobby the night we arrived. No slippers or bathrobes in the ""suite"".  The black out blinds had  2 inch gaps, making them not black out blinds. Sofa bed length was too big for the ""living room"" space. The sofa bed mattress was unusable making the room not as advertised four person accommodations. Which normally we would not have had people share that kind of space but it was New Years and last minute so there you have it.  Small area in bathroom and one sink. Kitchen and entry area were rather large areas and wasted space, they could have used in any other area. Closet area was small and had weird placement of small safe. The room felt compressed and New York sized. Very few food options, especially after 7 PM.  My phone never worked while there and no ipod deck in room.",2,0,0

Valet parking only so if you want to self park, park at the Bellagio or Aria.  Both are a short walk away.  The Bellagio is actually connected to Vdara through an outdoor walk way.  Its a very short walk, although it can be quite dreadful on a scorching Vegas day.  I don't know why they didn't connect it like they do at Paris\/Ballys - indoor away from nature's elements.

Smell of the hotel is nice.  Non-gaming, non-smoking resort, very refreshing.  Check in was relatively quick.  I liked the uniform the front desk clerks wear. 

Room is nice with a kitchenette.  Very convenient  to have a frig to store your leftovers.  Bed was comfortable although I found stains on a pillow case - not a fan of that.  Bathroom has a separate shower and tub.  I did not like the fact that I was able to look into the bathroom while laying in bed.  Kind of grosses me out, but that's just me.  Bathroom could have been cleaner, but it was acceptable.

Housekeeping is super friendly and replenishes your frig with bottles of complimentary Vdara water.  The water on the mini-bar side is not free, so make sure you drink the correct one.

Elevators were super hot for some reason.  They need to find a way to get some AC up in there.  Either that or turn the lighting down so it doesn't warm up.

Overall the Vdara was nice and I wouldn't mind staying again, although it would not be my first choice.  I like the convenience of being able to come down the elevator and already be in the casino.",2,0,0

I found it kind of unusual that they had a sliding door for the bathroom, but i guess they did it to save space for the room.  The couch is actually a kind of sofa bed so the suite, though small in comparison to a suite at palazzo, was comfortable for 4-5 people to sleep.  Also, the vdara staff was kind enough to give us complimentary champagne for both of the rooms our group stayed in, since two of us had birthdays last weekend.

on saturday we went out to the pool since we got a cabana for the day for around 250 I believe.  It's pretty cheap I believe, I remember that we asked how much it would be for palazzo and it was definitely way more (it could've been because it was memorial day).

However, it was pretty unfortunate though because during that day when we were at the pool it was really really windy in vegas.  It actually got pretty scary for a bit when one of the umbrellas at the pool area flew off of its base and nearly stabbed\/slammed itself into the white fence things, almost hitting two guys who were ballsy enough not to shit their pants and run off at the sight of what appeared to be a final destination scene.

the place is walking distance from aria, since it's literally across the back taxi\/valet drop area for aria (about a 500 ft walk?), vdara is connected to a tram that takes you to crystals\/aria and citycenter, and it has some sort of a direct connection to bellagio (i'm not sure because I never walked that way, I just saw signs).

Don't bother complaining to the shift mgr because they could care less.

      Its really to bad, because the hotel is convient and the rooms are really nice. The fridge is useless and the blackout shades have gaps in them.",5,0,0

I stayed here this weekend for free with an Entertainment Group called Night Access with 150 girls to just simply rage for Spring Break. No Big.

This place is very modern with amazing architecture. There are cool sculptures and artwork all over this damn place. I don't know what Vdara means but I think it has something to do with water of some sort. There was this really neat looking yatch contraption and the hotel was decorated with an aquatic vibe. Our rooms were so so so so nice. 

2 flat screens.
Window view of the strip.
2 King Size beds.
1 shower, 1 jacuzzi, with a full bathroom set. 
A living room.
Closet with bathrobes and slippers.
Microwave, a stove, sink, and a refrigerator. 

SEE WHAT I MEAN= Unbelievable! 

I have no idea how much it is to stay here but I bet it is expensive. I know there is a spa, health center, and a pool\/lounge area. Also, the place is located at the City Center and is one of the newest and hottest hotels in Vegas. It has like 50 something floors. Elevator rides here was like riding the roller coaster at Circus Circus! So if you are looking to spend a little extra, book your shit here. 

The only -1 star point is that there is no food court inside the hotel. You have to go across the street to Aria, which still doesn't have legit alcohol soaking food. All that Vdara had was a bar and room service with was way pricey. 

But the staff were super helpful and friendly. I felt really bad for our maid. We trashed that place up. Well, what do you expect with 8 girls in one room. Complete CHAOS!  Water is free here too. Bottled water I'm talking. If you need extra pillows or towels, just holler at the front desk and service will come immediately. 

Like I said, this place is VDARA-TASTIC!",1,1,2

Pluses:  Nice rooms with kitchenettes, good mattresses, washer\/dryer, flat screen TV.  Also, the health club was nice and the lobby area, although small, was comfortable.  Valet parking worked very efficiently.  The wifi was okay - but not great.  Finally, the staff were all very pleasant and helpful.  

Minuses:  Hardest place to get to (via foot or car) in City Center.  Seriously, who designed the entrances and exits to this place?  There's no easy way to walk or drive into and out of this hotel.  The kitchenette is cool but why not stock it with basic kitchen stuff like pots, pans, bowls, silverware?  Instead, you have to call housekeeping to bring it up for you.  Then, after you've used it they take it away and don't replace it.  So, you have to keep calling and requesting stuff.  Annoying.  Also, I am not sure if it's because of the kitchenettes or the fact that there is no casino, but this place seems to attract a kid-heavy crowd.  Not to get too snobby, but it was a bit like the Beverly Hillbillies were there when dealing with the elevators and lobby.  We needed to change rooms too because our first room was on a low floor that was just above the monorail station.  Having paid for a ""corner city view"" room, we felt a bit cheated.  The good news is that the staff was very gracious in working to move us to a better room later in our stay.  

I doubt we'll be back at Vdara any time soon.  There are just too many other good options in Vegas - even within City Center.",1,0,1

The rooms were nice, clean, and big. The ladies did a great job making it look brand new each day after a long day of strolling around the city. 

There was a security guy guarding the elevators at all times making sure you actually stay there..which I thought was kind of silly Bc there's better things to do in Vegas than run around big hotels for no reason. 

What I really liked about this hotel is that after a long day...I can enter a building that smells clean and smoke free. Every time I entered the building it smelled really nice; it reminded me of a spa without being at the spa: relaxing.",1,0,1

PROs:
-gorgeous view of the bellagio fountain from our suite, especially at night! 
-verrrry spacious suite with full kitchen. Great for making ramen after clubbing!
-washer n dryer inside our suite (altho we didnt need to use it. Haha)
-very quiet throughout the hotel
-by far THE most attentive and polite staff I have seen in Vegas! 
-Super short taxi lines

CONs:
-some maintenance issues in our suite. (ex..The bathroom doorknob kept falling off)
-sofa bed is super duper uncomfortable! (some othet hotels in vegas actually have pretty comfy sofa beds)
-tub in bathroom wasnt very big and comfy

The bed and pillows are just perfect and the heating and cooling system rocks, not loud and temp stays consistent. Upon check in we were given a room early around 10:30am, that was +++. We were placed on the 22 floor and the view was very nice, especially at night.

I love the non gaming aspect. After a long night or day out you can enter this hotel without having to go through a crowded casino to your room. The no smoke smell is a +++.

Conviently located near the monorail and walking path to Bellagio.  Starbucks is downstairs and a small market place.  Not many dining options in this hotel, but all our meals were planned outside of the hotel.

I had a really relaxing stay here and would definitely stay again.",0,0,0

This hotel is the BEST NON-GAMING hotel.  It is very much so a spa type place.  Great to go and relax, non-smoking, quiet, definitely not a place to party.  The reason my friends and I chose it is because we knew we would be out and clubbing and partying super hard elsewhere and we wanted a nice, calm, luxurious room to come back to after.

The staff was all friendly enough, my favorite was a bartender at the bar downstairs.  Unfortunately I don't remember his name, Dave was it?, anyways, he was amazingly nice and funny.  We stopped here to get drinks before we went out at night and each time he was wonderful.  First time I told him I had never had a tequila drink I liked and he made me one that he told me would shange my mind.  It didn't but he just tossed it and made a completely different drink for me. 

Its great because the hotel is connected to the Aria which everyone knows is amazing.  It's also connected to the Bellagio, it was just a great location overall.  The view from their panoramic windows is nice. 

So basically, I would recommend this hotel to people that want to be in Vegas but don't like casinos.  You can still party, just do it elsewhere.  Vdara is for relaxation.  Its beautiful, its sparklingly clean, and classy.

Oh, but it has a horribly small pool.",1,0,0

When we checked in last week, we were greeted by Alyx at the customer service desk. She was very friendly and helpful. I asked her if we could get a room with a view and she immediately said she will do her best. My husband mentioned that most hotels we've been to aren't as open to look for a room with a view (most of the time they say no). Alyx did her best and got us a nice room on the 49th floor. When we saw the room, we were so taken back because Alyx pulled through for us. She got us an amazing room with views of almost all of Vegas. The Bellagio\/fountain was right in front of us, Caesar's Palace, Paris Hotel, High Roller, Rio Hotel, and many more. We loved the fountain at night. We had an almost unobstructed view (the far left side was difficult to see). My daughter and I sat and watched the fountain during the day, which I think were practice runs. 

Amenities: I was bummed I did not get a massage. Next time! But my daughter and I did go to the pool. We enjoyed it. Since it was 116 degrees out, the pool water was warm.
 
Food: The cafe offered plenty of snacks and food options. I ate the chicken and waffles 2x. I love the little crown maple syrup bottle they gave me. It was so cute. The chicken and waffles are flavorful. The shrimp scampi also delicious, the shrimp are fresh and juicy. Lots of great foods but they are pricey. Bottled Fiji water was $10. But compared to the water in the room-is a better deal (Fiji water in room is $19). Yikes! Dasani (half bottle) was $10. 
I did wish the cafe was 24\/hr. There were nights I really wanted food and everything was closed. In addition, my favorite place is also located in the hotel...Starbucks! Open until 8pm :( but very convenient for my morning pick me up. Though the lines do get long. 

Parking: Valet was pricey. $25 per night plus tips each time we got the car. I did like their automated valet system. We can to scan the ticket so the Valet can bring the car instead of interacting with them in person. 

Vdara is centrally located, which make walking to some places easy. Vdara is right next to Aria and you can walk through a tunnel\/pathway to get to the Bellagio and Caesars. The pathway was convenient since is was scorching hot. 

Overall, we had a great stay. Great customer service, in a family friendly, smoke free centrally located hotel on the Vegas Strip. Oh and pet friendly!",0,0,0

New, modern décor (a sleek, free standing tub and square sink in the bathroom. Leather, armless chairs, and dark wood dressers) Like other Yelpers, we got a room that was smaller than the pictures Vdara boasts online. We also got a non-strip view. Kind of disappointing but we were on the 34th floor which was nice and high and the night lights of the rest of Vegas were still impressive (though maybe I have lower standards than some).  
Both this hotel and the Aria have a theme of fascinating fixtures and architecture. It's not made to look like Paris, or Italy. It's made to be modern, interesting. I spent most of my time walking looking up at light fixtures or staring at colored glass walls. 

Details:
Complimentary champagne was delivered to our room. Nice.

If you put 4 people in this room, the queen pull out bed? Not comfortable. I want to complain a lot b\/c I hated it but my boyfriend was fine with it so that should be noted. We stuck 3 people in the king bed and they slept comfortably. (of course they did. It was a pillow top that I coveted from 1 foot away)

This is a short walk to the Bellagio. Very short. It has a convenient sidewalk connecting it to the Aria. The Aria is connected to the Monte Carlo. What I'm trying to say is, I thought it was relatively close to a lot of casinos. At the beginning of the night we walked to NYNY, Paris, took trams to MGM etc. with ease. At the end of the night an $11 cab ride didn't hurt at all. 

Guests:
The people who stay here are not some guy in his boxers walking the halls on his cell phone (thanks Venetian). They're mature and quiet. The pool side was relaxing. Oh, but there were a few children (some people care about that) I didn't mind. One of them was speaking Italian with his mother.. Can't hate on that!

Service:
Front desk was great. Guy at the Business Center was wonderful but the Concierge (when I asked if there was an evacuation.. the fire alarm lights were blinking) was an @ss. The woman who, at our request, gave us towels and shampoo in lieu of cleaning our room was great too. 

Ultimately, 
This is the place if you're trying to go on a romantic getaway with your significant other. It's not the best for squeezing a ton of friends in the room to go party. It's almost just as convenient to get around as any other on strip location. It's new. And if you're lucky you'll get this through hotwire and have a great hotel at an even better rate. (less than $180\/night) I did. And I was oh so happy with my amazing weekend.",0,0,0

In short, I'll tell you whats great about this hotel and what some might see as a downside.

AWESOME PARTS:
*Every room here is a suite, and the rooms are not outrageously priced. I would compare the pricing with MGM (obviously, they're sister hotels) or any other of the MGM sister hotels!!!
*Even if you get a one bedroom, there is a couch that turns into a queen pull out bed, and it is STILL just as comfortable as the normal bed.
*The AC actually works here.
*The room service is GREAT!!!
*The views are fantastic, and if you request a room on a higher level, they are usually willing to accommodate, and hook you up!!!
*I have never had a long wait for check in, not even once, and I have stayed here 4+ times now (and I'm staying here this coming Saturday!)
*All rooms come with a small dining area and a small kitchenette. 

PARTS THAT COULD BE QUESTIONABLE, BUT THAT I FIND AWESOME:
*No casino (but the Aria is RIGHT across the way, less than a five minute walk and they have a casino.. so..)
*No smoking (I smoke, but even I can appreciate a nice clean smell when walking into a hotel)
*Quiet 

Vdara is conveniently located as well. It is literally in the same circle as the Aria, and a 5 minute walk to the Cosmopolitan. It's centrally located in the middle of the strip, which is nice, or I think ... if it's not in the middle its pretty damn close.

The only thing was that darn sofa bed. That thing belongs in the dumpster, not a luxury hotel. The hotel might as well not have a sofa bed in the room. No way someone could have a comfortable nights sleep on that. The plan was for my daughter and I to sleep on the room bed and my sister on the sofa bed. The sofa bed was so uncomfortable, we all slept on the main bed.  

Just a note: There weren't any extra sheets for the sofa bed. Also, I had to call housekeeping to get extra towels. The room was only stocked with two bath towels and two floor towels. (No hand\/face towels). Not a huge deal, but just fyi.",1,1,0

This time was for our Anniversary and wanted to treat my wife to a nice hotel away from the casinos and smoke.  There are fees for almost everything, but nothing we didn't know about going in.  Yes, I don't care for these resort fees as we don't use the amenities, but it is what it is.  The Valet is efficient.  The front Desk is friendly and efficient.  The rooms are clean, the view is not the greatest.  What I do like, that is under-appreciated, is the thickness of the walls between the rooms.  Both stays, noise doesn't travel easily from other rooms, like you may experience at other hotels, which is nice.  

5 stars, but when comparing my stay at the Wynn.  The rooms and beds at the Wynn were a huge step up.  Both hotels are 5stars .... but there is free parking at the Wynn.  When balancing these factors with the price .... I believe Vdara is a good value and we got exactly what we expected.",0,0,0

Cons: only accepts credit card or cash for security deposit. Does not accept debit cards. Since I like to travel using only my debit card, this was a drag for me to pull on $300 cash to put on hold for the rest of my stay. This hotel does NOT have a casino, so walking a bit further is required if you want to do a little late night gambling. 

Pros: this hotel is breath taking. Since it was my first time at the city center, everything was so classy, big and modern about this hotel. The number one pro: cleanliness of the room! It smelled so good. Since these hotel rooms were originally to be sold as condos and not as a hotel, you totally scored on having a huge room while paying at hotel price!! The room is literally a little living space. for the cheapest room, it comes with a tiny kitchen, dining area,  washer and dryer, full closet, huge bathroom and a tv. The technology was amazing as well. The black out curtains with a touch of a button on a remote control was much needed for the next morning. The touch buttons near the front door to indicate maid service or not (as opposed to the traditional tags you hang on the door knob). The flat screen tv mounted on the wall was excellent as well. The modern design was breath taking. The doors to the bathroom was double French doors with frosted glass that are made from expensive wood. Seems like all the furnishings were top notch quality. Since this hotel dos NOT have a casino, you get a a very quiet nights sleep. 

Conclusion: they have a washer and dryer in the cheapest room. This completely sold me and I cannot ""go back"" to any other hotel but this. By far, the most beautiful\/awesome hotel I have ever stayed in.",1,0,0

Vdara wasn't my first choice in the options that I could have gotten, but I had no choice since I'd already paid the $$$ so I went in with a positive attitude!

Honestly, everything about Vdara is amazing from the quick check in, to the great views from the rooms, to the room itself with the kitchenette, and the bed was amazing to sleep in too (veryy soft :).  I liked the tram you could take to Crystals and Aria too.

The only complaint I have was the customer service wasn't good.  We literally called the concierge and no one ever answered.  We had to call the front desk a few times if we wanted to talk to them before someone would pick up.  Also, there are hardly any late nite food choices so if we forgot to eat before going back to the room we just didn't eat.  The bell desk and valet on the other hand were quick.  

If I had paid $280 to stay here like some people I would have been pissed because for that type of money the Venitian or Wynn or Encore would be a way better choice (much bigger rooms and better service), but for $80 a nite I really couldn't complain!

From the complimentary valet, check in, the whole course of the stay and check out the service was seamless. Everyone that served us were all so friendly and attentive. Especially the bell boy we had (extra tip for him!)

We stayed in a corner suite and the room definitely felt like an apartment... soooooo comfortable and very modern especially the bed!! I wish we had the view of the Bellagio fountains as we had previously had, but we had a view of South Strip (you know.. luxor, mandalay) which was okay but they were really busy that weekend so, understandable. What was funny was that my bf was gonna do the sandwich trick upon check in, and had the $20 ready between his ID and card, but when the front desk girl told us that it was really busy and all the upgrades were booked that weekend, he quickly took back his 20 before handing over the cards.

The robe they provide you with in the room is soooooo soft!! I wanted to take it home :[ I know you can buy it but its probably expensive and I'm low on the funds by the end of my trip.

What was really a plus for us was that vdara is actually pretty reasonably priced for a 5 star and since its in the middle of city center and a short walk over the bridge to Bellagio, you pretty much have everything there. So what if theres no restaurants or casino inside, Aria's like a quick walk away. We were able to go to haze, marquee dayclub, liquid dayclub (at aria), bank, and tao beach (after we checked out). Best part no drunk driving or worrying about catching a taxi!! :] We walked everywhere, which I didn't mind.

Room: We booked (through Jetsetter) a deluxe suite, which comes with a king bed, a pull-out sofa bed (by request), and a kitchenette.  I really liked having the kitchenette so we could put our leftovers and drinks in the mini-fridge instead of an ice bucket.  The decor is very luxe but modern, and the rooms are very clean and new (since the hotel is only a year or two old).  Bathrooms were very spacious and came stocked with Aveda toiletries and a huge tub & shower.  The view from our room (I think we were on the 30 or 40-something floor) was awesome as well.  Overall, I was very pleased with the room, especially for the price!  Much nicer than most of the other hotels I've stayed at within the same price range.  My only complaint is that the comforters were a bit stiff.

Amenities & staff: The front desk staff is great at Vdara.  They are very attentive, friendly, and helpful.  Concierge and housekeeping are a little slower (so it took a while for our extra towels & sheets order to come through), but the experience was forgivable.  The pool is actually very nice; located on a rooftop, there's always a nice breeze going.  It's a fun atmosphere, with loud music playing and bikini-clad waitresses walking around and taking drink orders (a little less kid-friendly).

Location: Vdara's location is OK.  They are a little bit further down the strip and you have to take some detours to simply walk out of there.  Most of the time, I ended up taking the tram around Crystals to get out... it can get a little complex.  But, if you are planning on shopping and\/or hitting up Marquee for the dayclub\/nightclub, Vdara is in a great location, with the Cosmopolitan right next door.  There are no cheap food options within the hotel & the City Center, so you're gonna have to walk out on the strip to find any food-court type places.

Overall, I really liked Vdara and would recommend it as a more affordable option among the nicer hotels in Vegas.",8,5,5

I have probably been to Vegas 50 plus times in my lifetime and have always stayed in the high-end hotels. Yet, 50 plus times I have been awoken in the middle of the night by a drunk, inconsiderate group coming back to their room at 3:00 a.m. But not this time. No casino and no giant bar scene at Vdarra mean THOSE people are staying SOMEPLACE ELSE.  I didn't hear a peep from anyone for three nights.

It's also really easy to hop back on the 15 and head home, which we really appreciated, since no one has the patience to sit in traffic on the strip after a getaway.

We visited over the Christmas Holiday and the weather was very cold and windy, so I was disappointed they didnt have a covered walkway to the Bellagio and Aria, but I guess its not worth the expense since its not that cold regularly in Vegas (this was just a gripe for us because we have a 1 year old and its painful to watch him get whipped in the face by harsh winds as we dash between hotels).

The hotel is bustling with families and those with dogs, and the lobby can be a bit crowded at times. However, this is expected, given the fact that Vdara is a pet-friendly, non-gaming\/non-smoking facility.

The cafe downstairs sells overpriced sandwiches, salads, soups, coffee, tea, pastries and sundries. The price Point is expected in Vegas but the food quality is actually pretty high and we ended up eating there a few times during our stay. The biggest problem with the cafe is it's extremely long wait times for the food to come. We waited 45 min for a grilled cheese and half an hour for a scrambled egg, al la carte :(

The staff is very professional and courteous and they handled the few issues (housekeeping and with keys not working) we came across swiftly and they were very nice about it.",1,0,0

VERY close to Cosmo and Aria as well as Monte Carlo and Bellagio.  I was worried about where it is situated, but I shouldn't have been.  

No smoking and no casino BUT you are right next door to Cosmo, Bellagio and Aria.  Literally less than 5 minute walk.  I love that I can play in Aria and Cosmo and escape the craziness (Cosmo is freaking insane) back to my quiet plush hotel.

I am very impressed with the hotel. I am a smoker myself but i loved the fact that it's a non smoking area. Very clean and unlike the other hotels, didn't have the horrible cigarette smell. I honestly couldn't breathe in the casinos so it was nice to stay at a fresh air place. We had the vdara suite. It consist of a bedroom, 1 bathroom(shower, large tub, 2 sinks) living room, kitchen,sitting place and another small bathroom. The bathroom in the bedroom was very nice and stylish, very big also. 
The prices were pretty cheap when booked with the flight together. We were on the 41st floor so great view of Vegas.

We originally booked 2 nights in April. My brother and his family came too, and the staff was kind enough to place our rooms near each other. Because of this, our suite was upgraded to a corner view to allow us to stay by my brother. The room was stunning. 1.5 bathrooms, deep soaking tub in the full bathroom, a full kitchen with stainless appliances, and expansive living room. The views from the bedroom and living room were incredible. Windows all over. At night when it was time to get the kids settled in for bed, and sleeping on the sofa bed, we realized there were no sheets on the bed and none in the closets. The same was true for my brother's room. The hotel makes you call down and request sheets. Really? We waited 20 minutes for them to bring the bedding up. Really annoying. The same was true for the kitchen, you had to call down for plates, cutlery, etc. I think for this caliber of a hotel, it should be stocked and ready to go. Especially for what we paid for a Fri and Sat night. 

The hotel itself is gorgeous. I loved the pool and the café in the lobby. We ended up staying a 3rd night when we saw the rate for a Sunday night for our room, approx. $120. It was odd, we had to settle our bill on Sunday (original checkout) even though we extended our stay by a night and notified the hotel. With the original booking, we had a $75 room credit. When we settled our bill, nothing on the itemized room charges reflected the credit, even though the front desk told us it had been applied. It was only after I went to the front desk, still confused about it, the girl told me they don't show the credit on the final itemized bill and kept it separate. Apparently, it is not normal procedure to give you that part of the bill. I don't know, it would have been helpful for me to see everything we charged to the room, I including the credit. Very confusing. 

All in all, I loved staying in the hotel despite the annoyances at having to request bedding and kitchenware. It was great for a family friendly stay.",0,0,0

We requested a room with a view of the Bellagio fountain which they were able to accommodate, partially anyway. 

Hotel staff at the front desk, market cafe, bellmen, valet, housekeeping were all very friendly and helpful.

The only thing which was subpar was the bed. The mattress was was clearly in need of replacement. I thought maybe it was just our room but our friends said the same thing about their bed.

This is a nonsmoking, noncasino property but a few minutes away are Aria, Cosmopolitan and Bellagio if you're in the gaming mood. As for nearby restaurants we ate at Todd English PUB, China Poblano and Estiatorio Milos which were all superb. PUB has a happy hour from 3-6pm which is worth checking out.

Vdara now charges $18 for 24 hours of valet each day you stay. Which isn't too bad because you can valet your card with any other hotel that is associated with Mlife. 

Check-in: 
Our check in was a breeze. We were in and going up to our rooms within 10 minutes. They even had the bell desk take our luggages up to our rooms. The desk service was really courteous and quick with their work. 

Room:
-1 star for the room. When we walked into the room we notice it wasn't fully cleaned. There was a couple of dirty towels left there from previous guests (assuming). Everything else was clean; hopefully. It was just concerning to see dirty towels. 

Service:
The -1 star is also for the service. We had to call house keeping about 4 times before someone showed up to re-inspect the room and clean the dirty towels. The rest of our stay, we did have a little bit of trouble calling house keeping\/ service to bring us necessities. Each time we called we had to wait about 20-30 minutes. Which i was not happy about because we wanted to go out. 

Restaurants:
They do have a couple of restaurants, but we didn't get to try it. Hopefully, next time we will be able to. We did buy Starbucks! If you're going to buy Starbucks in Vegas expect it to be a little more than your average price. 

Overall:
We had a great time and we loved that the hotel was a nonsmoking and didn't have a casino. Only downside is that valet is $18 and there is no self parking and that our hotel wasn't clean in the beginning. We will consider coming back to Vdara in the future.",1,0,0

First of all the television in our room did not work so we called the front desk and they said they would send up a technician to look at it but no one ever came. We called a second time and they just told us that they were very busy. I mentioned it a third time when we checked out and I was simply told that everyone's tv was broken that weekend. I was never given any compensation or even an apology.

Another issue we had was that every time we called room service after 10pm the line was busy. They didn't have call waiting! We had to keep calling back every few minutes hoping that someone would answer. 

Lastly, when I arrived I requested to have late checkout on the last day of our visit but when the day came we decided we did not need it. That morning we checked out at the front desk around 11:30am and I asked for them to remove the charge. The man said he would and then printed out my bill and handed it to me in an envelope. It was my mistake to not look at the bill right away because I later found that the $40 charge was never removed.

We checked into the Vdara on Tuesday. The lady at the reception desk was perfectly pleasant yet seemed highly indifferent to our special occasions. Nothing was offered to help us celebrate, even at an additional cost. 

Upon arriving in our room, we perused and noticed that the room is plenty spacious and the beds are extremely comfortable. We were somewhat disappointed that the format of the room is not the same at all as they were shown online. It had rained the day before our arrival and our rooms windows were quite filthy and spotty as a result. While our view was of the interstate, and nothing special, it still served as a distraction. Also, having a kitchenette with no flatware or dishes unless you specially request them is completely absurd. 

The $28 a day resort fee covers the internet and two free bottles of water a day, unless they don't clean your room every day like we experienced. Then you're faced with needing to call back down and request something that should already be in your room, like a plate or a fork.

Cab fare was $20 from the airport which I don't feel is bad at all.  The hotel staff was very nice upon arrival and we were able to easily check our bags as we got in early.  Check in was very easy as well.  We requested a high room that overlooked the Bellagio fountains (per the suggestion of other Yelp reviews) and were not disappointed.  When we came back later in the day, our room was ready and waiting.  The hotel is not your average Vegas hotel.  There is not a slot machine to be found and it is free of cigarette smoke which we liked very much.  We do like to gamble though and were able to walk right around the front circle to Aria to their casino but it was nice each evening to come back to our quite hotel.  Vdara is so close to many other hotels and casino's as well, definitely within walking distance.  They have a great little place for breakfast\/lunch\/desserts\/coffee and also a hotel bar and Starbucks.  The only downside is that both the little restaurant and Starbucks close early so after a night of shows and roaming Vegas, if you want a bite to eat or a cup of coffee, you will want to pick it up on your way back.  I really feel that these should be open 24 hours as pretty much everything in Vegas is 24 hours.

Our suite was very clean and comfortable.  Huge windows offer great views but there are also automatic blinds that, at the push of a button, give you privacy or douse the lights of Vegas.  Having two bathrooms was great and having the garden tub in one was wonderfully relaxing after a day of walking.  

There is a coffee maker, however, they only leave 2 k-cups (1 decaf\/1 caf) each day so if you want coffee you may want to bring your own or I'm sure you could request more as they are very accommodating.  There is an ice maker and a microwave\/convection oven and a stove top.  Loved the washer and dryer as we were easily able to get the wrinkles out of our clothes before we went out for the day or evening.

Our room was not only spacious and comfortable, we got an awesome view of the Bellagio fountains so we could enjoy the show from our hotel room--YAY!  I loved that it was a bit quieter and non-smoking as well.

The are two considerable cons in my book.  One is that it's tucked away from the main street and even with the corridor that leads you up to the tram and\/or into the Bellagio, it can add some considerable travel time wherever you're going.  I speak for my feet that incurred massive blisters after I ran down the strip in 4 inch heels to make our restaurant reservation in time--Alas, the MGM looked so close on the map.  The second big con is the lack of food in the hotel.  Skip the market cafe (I did get sick from a salad I bought there) and head over to the Cosmo, Bellagio, or Aria for grub.

Beautiful rooms. We got the penthouse suite, and it was HUGE. 2 bedrooms with modern amenities and classy decor. Bathrooms were gorgeous (although our bathroom scale was broken). Living room was great, but what really captivated me were their huge windows and view. We almost had a 360 view because we were a corner room. There is a slight ledge next to the window where you can sit and just gaze out over Las Vegas.

Rooms were clean and service was spot-on. Definitely recommend Vdara to my friends. The only complaint that some people might have is that they do not have casinos, and it's a non-smoking property. HOWEVER, this might be a great benefit to others. Just something to consider. Aria and Bellagio are within walking distance though, so it's not as if you're isolated from the action. 

*** REVIEW FOR SPA ***
Small but sufficient. 

Staff is courteous and friendly, ready to assist you. The area is super clean and organized. They offer complimentary tea, lemon water, and spa snacks. They have three small areas - hot jacuzzi, sauna room, and steam room. I think the temperature of everything is perfect. Not too hot, which I prefer. Call me crazy, but I don't like to be scalded. 

They have clean showers and have a well-stocked area with hair supplies, so you can get ready for your big night. 

They provide all the towels you could possibly need, a robe, and slippers. 

If you get free passes, definitely take up their offer, but I don't think it's worth an exorbitant amount of money.",2,0,0

I wanted to like this hotel since it has the modern appeal, but that's pretty much the only thing it's got going for it is the looks... I stayed at the 2 bedroom Hospitality suite with a group of friends for my weekend party. The biggest room they offered. Everyone liked the suite and the size is about 1600 sq ft for $800\/nt. The view was nice we were facing Mandalay Bay and the I-15 freeway. 

The problem was with the front desk\/staff they were absolutely horrible. I had called a day in advance to tell them I will be there the next evening so save me the corner Hospitality suite. The girl tells me sure we could that for you... I got there Friday evening to check-in the Front Desk guy Anthony (this is a shout out for you) was rude and did not greet any of the guests. I walked up to him and I said 'hi' he couldn't even squeeze a hello or a smile or anything. Someone must've rolled off the wrong side of the bed this morning. I told him I called and requested for a corner Hospitality suite, without checking his computer he gave me a quick answer no. I was like, what's the point of calling in and making a request if you guys don't even care for it? I'm not even asking for an upgrade this is more of a lateral move from one Hospitality suite to another. I did not want to start my stay here haggling with this guy, so I asked for my keys and moved on.

So my group and I got the room and we found out that they we needed an extra rollaway bed so that a couple of the guys won't need to sleep on the floor. I called the housekeeping, they forwarded to front desk, and front desk guy says they don't have any roll away beds. Wow, I'm astonished by what they told me. I asked him seriously in a new facility this big and you don't even have a single rollaway bed? I asked to speak with the manager; with a little talk they finally dropped off a roll away bed which they told me they have none... it was like pulling someone arm. I was beginning to think what kind of Hospitality these guys are really offering. More like lame excuses\/poor service and zero hospitality. 

These were actually the minor issues we had the real problems are to come next...

The lobby is tiny compared to the other nearby hotels i.e. Aria, Cosmo, and Mandarin, and not to mention the Vdara was very difficult to get to by foot or by car. By car you would really have to slow down or stop your car to look for a single sign that points you to a single lane ramp that takes you to the front of the Vdara. By foot some of the sidewalks are closed off and you have to walk through the Cosmo casino to get back to Vdara from the strip. So either way by foot or by car it is actually difficult to get to Vdara. Seems like an engineering blunder when they attempted to link Vdara to the Las Vegas Strip.

Vdara staff\/house cleaning STOLE $500 from our room. I reported this to their front desk, security, and risk management, all were quick to make excuses and give me the run around. No one cooperated. The front desk girl Kelli even refused to give me her hotel manager's name and refused to let me talk to her..... She wouldn't even let me talk to her assistant manager! She kept me on the phone for an hour and nothing came out of it..... just more frustration. The theft was reported on Monday 4\/23\/2012, I waited a week they did nothing and they found nothing. I told security just check who entered my room on 4\/20\/2012 between 11pm - 2am. They have surveillance and an advanced key card system. Yet they did absolutely nothing to help out. 

I live in California; I go to Vegas often like 3 times a year often in various different hotels casinos going on 11 years now. Never, have I had this many problems with a single hotel. This is by far the first of all-times low in overall Vegas experience. 

The LAST problem was they over charged my credit card; they charged $1050 when the rate was $800 with their lousy Resort Fees and taxes.

Being in City Center, I expected this hotel to be an excellent choice to stay in. From the photos and video tours on their website, I would be a fool to think otherwise. I was a fool. Vdara's standard check-in time is 3pm, but I had called (twice) earlier that week to confirm early check-in. The front desk staff confirmed it would be no problem. The day of, I called again on our drive there to confirm it was okay. When we arrived at 12pm, the room was not ready. Not only was it not ready, the front desk attendant claimed they have a strict, no early check in policy -- who were those people telling me otherwise ALL week then? A little annoyed, but decided to let it go.

At 3:15pm when I came back to the front desk to check in, the girl looked up our room (I saw on her screen that it was marked as uncleaned), but she gave me our keys anyway and (discreetly) radioed her colleague to check out the room ASAP because we were coming up. When we got in, the floor was wet, the garbage under the sink was not taken out, there were empty soda bottles in the fridge, and there was VOMIT (yes, VOMIT, PUKE, THROW UP, whatever you want to call it), on the bed. Disgusting and unacceptable? I think yes. I immediately called the floor manager and she was beyond rude. She said the room wasn't cleaned properly because I rushed her staff (isn't their policy ready by 3pm? I showed up at 3:15). She tried to have me not involve the hotel manager at the front desk, and she was very snarky and unapologetic, like I had done something wrong. I wish I had remembered her name (I would post it here), but all I remember is that she had a Russian accent & we were on the 10th floor. It took about an hour of going back and forth between her and the hotel manager at the front desk before our room was properly cleaned. They did offer us some hotel credit to use at the restaurant to compensate for our troubles which was nice. We didn't get moved into another room like we wanted though. 

This was probably an isolated tragedy, but even so I would probably never stay here again.

So what were the pros of this hotel? 
1) the view from the panoramic room were pretty spectacular 
2) the bellhops were SO nice -- extra star just for them
3) hotel manager did his job -- he apologized for the inconvenience and made it right",1,1,0

I do my hustle and bustle else where so when I need a place to rest I want it to be quiet and clean. 

No smoking definitely works for me and for the 5 nights I stayed, I haven't heard any noise in the hallway which is definitely a plus.

Also I do like that there is a kitchenette in the room that I can use.

However on the downside , this time the room I was given had very spotty wifi signal so I talked to the front desk and they gladly waived the resort fee for me. Since I am not in my room 24 \/7 checking my phone, it works out fine ,At least they are being very reasonable.

There is limited dinning option on the property but aria is just 5 mins away.

This hotel has no casino but that's ok. You have Aria, Bellagio and the Cosmopolitan all near by with casinos and within short walking distance. Down by the lobby there is a market cafe, hotel bar and starbucks. There is no restaurant here, but they do offer 24 hour room service. 

I got a chance to use their pool and gym. The pool was nice, lots of seating and not overly crowded. The gym was small with three sections. The first section as you walk in, you have the cardio machines. The cardio machines all had personal tv which were nice. The second section had some more treadmills and a few weight machines. Last the third section were the free weights and a few more weight machines. They offer towels, mini water bottles and headsets if you need them. There was also a smoothie bar, which offered about 4 smoothies so not too much to choose from. 

The employees here were all very helpful and nice. From housekeeping, to security, to the concierge and front desk. One employee Amber at the Front Desk was especially great. We had the vip arrival and I would say it was worth the extra $$$. Amber greeted us right away and showed us around since it was our first time staying there. We got there early morning and she told us that our room that we originally booked was not quite ready yet. We waited 4 hours till we got a room. Amber upgraded my vdara suite to an executive corner suite due to the inconvenience and waived the resort fee which was a nice touch. Our executive corner suite was on the 27th floor and it had a great view of the strip. Other than that little issue, we had no problems with our stay. We would definitely stay here again.",1,0,1

There is no casino which is fine because the Cosmo is right next door.  They also dont allow smoking which is awesome because you dont have to worry about your room smelling like cigarettes.

Because it was my best friend's bday, we asked if they could give us an upgrade and they did.  We ended up on the 52nd floor and the view was amazing!  I could even watch the Bellagio water show from my room which was pretty cool as I've never seen it from that high up.

I did walk by the pool to see how it was and it was really chill.  If you want to relax and not have loud music bumping in the background, this pool is nice.

I did workout at the gym twice while I was there and it was fine.  They had some good cardio machines and enough weights to get a decent workout.

The reason I gave this place a 4 was because the pull out bed from the couch was broken.  I didnt realize this until it was really late.  Yet the hotel did offer to send someone up to take a look, it was late so I said it was ok.  They offered to come up the following day as well, but I declined because i honestly felt that sleeping on the couch would be more comfortable than pulling the bed out of it.  I know, what can you really expect from a pull out bed?  Either way, I didnt like it.  Also, the layout of the living space and the bedroom was separated by a wall which made it feel really small.

With all that said, I had a good experience and am a fan of the hotel.  Just not ready to give it a 5 just yet.",6,1,0

We had a few issues with housekeeping.  One day we had to call to have the room made up in the very late afternoon since it wasn't done earlier.  We also asked for some lotion and water (they supply free bottled water) and neither was delivered.

We were told to come back because these issues were out of the ordinary. 
We gave them the benefit of the doubt. Bad choice. On our most recent stay, we were told upon check-in that the pool was closed for our entire stay for maintenance. Seriously. It's 90 degrees outside and we have to squeeze in with the rest of the crowd at the Aria pool next door.  That's something that should have been explained when we made our reservation. 
There are too many good choices in Vegas to be treated this way. The pool is down, fine, but tell people so they can make a better choice prior to booking. It's clear they are all about the money and could care less about you the customer.

Buddy of mine booked a room (#46-034) via Priceline for about $125.  Simple, modern, functional...sterile and a great view of the Strip including Bellagio fountain...aromatic esp. the shampoo which literally smells like red starbursts.  An indoor hallway connects directly to the Bellagio.

Cons: 
1) I have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis after 3 nights on the couch bed.

For the big picture, two things... check-in, check-out was terrific and while the room was nice enough, there's no real ""wow"" factor besides the view from the huge windows. 

As for the fine points...

The good: 
- kitchenette with a decent sized fridge for your own stuff.
- good bathtub for soaking.
- fast elevators (for you frequent travelers to Vegas, you know how annoying it can be to have to wait forever and a day for an elevator).
- those windows and the electric controls are fun to play with.

The not-so-good:
- even with blackout shades, the room was far from being ""blacked"" out. When I'm in Vegas I sleep till late morning and the sun starts to come in at 5:45 am.
- no one came to clean our room on our second day despite turning the ""do not disturb"" sign off.  We had to call for supplies after 1am when we arrived back to find no toilet paper (the only roll supplied was the one on the hook - I searched everywhere!).
- No one likes to watch their significant other use the toilet (or as my husband would say... drop a deuce) while they try not to watch\/listen from the bath - no matter how much you love them. Why oh why didn't they build a separate toilet closet? This for me is the deal breaker.
- Hard to access from the strip. I got stuck in the Cosmopolitan a couple of times and the major douche bag factor there is just way too much for me to handle. 

Though Expedia (whom I booked through) classifies this as a 5 star hotel, I would slightly disagree.  4\/5 stars. I think the whole Vegas star system is slightly different then the rest of the world because by no means is this in the same caliber as a Ritz, Mandarin or Four Seasons property.",5,4,2

PROS;

It was quite refreshing to walk into a hotel in Vegas and not smell cigarette smoke and hear a bunch of yelling-there's no casino or club here.

Even with partial to no views of the actual strip, the city views are quite nice. We stayed on the 50th floor. And when we walked out of our room we were met with a direct view of the Bellagio's water show. Awesome.

We were greeted with a bowl of fruit and extra waters on our first night. Sweet. But don't get too used to it, it's only on the first night :-p 

Friendly helpful staff, contemporary yet warm design, spacious suite (we stayed in the Vdara suite) and easy access to all the places we wanted to go.

CONS;

There's a sofa bed in the living room area, but no linen. Bummer. You have to call down and request for them to bring it up in a big ass black garbage bag. Yikes.

There's a nice kitchen, but no flatware, no plates. Gotta request those, too.

The final bill is a bit confusing, even after explanation.


All in all, it's a VERY nice place! Just know that if you plan on someone sleeping on that sofa bed to ask for the linen when you first arrive so you don't have to be aggravated later when you really need it and have to wait.",5,0,0

We stayed in the Hospitality suite (2 bed, 3 bath) for 3 nights.  There were 5 people that stayed in the suite and we were all comfortable.  The beds are very comfortable and so is the sofa in the living room.  All of the staff are friendly and we also got a complimentary limo to and from the airport.  

For our group, we always try to get a 2 bedroom suite which are pretty hard to find on the strip.  As compared to MGM Signature Suites which are also 2 bedroom (not truly a 2 bedroom but 2 suites joined) I definitely prefer Vdara Hospitality suites just because it is a true 2 bedroom suite with a living room connecting both bedrooms and is on the strip unlike MGM SS.

Vdara is great.  We've stayed here before and both times in the Panoramic Suite which is an end unit with windows on three sides of the room.  Room was very clean and well maintained.  The hotel cleaning staff are not only excellent in their work, but also very courteous and flexible with their cleaning schedules.

Our room included a washer\/dryer and we did wash some clothes.  It was easy, we just called housekeeping and they sent up some detergent free of charge!  The room also had a full size refrigerator, dish washer, sink and mini-bar.  It lacked a coffee maker though.  Having a coffee maker would be a nice improvement.

The room included two televisions, one in the bed room and one in the sitting area.  The TV in the bedroom did not work.  We called maintenance and they said it worked, but it didn't.

The price of the hotel\/value for Las Vegas was a bit high.  Also, they now charge for parking.  Valet parking is $18\/day and self-parking is $10\/day.  Unfortunately, the Self-Parking is not located at the hotel itself, it is at the Aria hotel across the street which seems like a short distance but is indeed quite a mess to get over to, especially if you have a lot of bags\/luggage.

There is a lack of good food places in Vdara, but luckily Aria, across the street, has plenty of eating places to choose from.  One tip would be about bottled water.  You can buy it in the hotel lobby for about $5\/bottle in the Market Café or $6.25\/bottle at Starbucks or you can go across the street and stock up from Walgreens for about $1\/bottle.

It was our first stay at this resort and we will stay here every time we come to Vegas in the future! A few highlights:

We booked a corner suite and were facing the strip - it was amazing! The rooms are well laid out, very clean, and the service is exceptional. We ordered room service almost everyday that we were there and were blown away. The service was fast and the food was delicious. 

We also booked a cabana with the plunge pool 4 days during our stay and it was one of the highlights of our honeymoon. I recommend booking the plunge pool because you have access to the pool right in front of your cabana instead of having to walk to the big pool (which isn't far). The cabana host service was top notch, the cabana was clean and well stocked, and the food was great. While we were there, the water misters did not work, but we just dipped in the pool when we got too hot! The pool atmosphere is relaxed and a nice break from the pool parties at other resorts.

If you are looking for a new Vegas experience, I highly recommend staying at the Vdara! We cannot wait to come back!",0,0,0

There is a clean and pretty scent to Vdara, along with a modern decor. The staff was super friendly and totally quick status when we needed extra towels, comforters, etc. The cleaning staff was so generous; they stacked our shoes, organized all our straighteners and curling irons, and even folded our clothes.

We booked the Deluxe Suite, which fit us (7 girls) comfortably. It has a full kitchen including a microwave, stove top, sink, refrigerator and dining table. I didn't see a coffee maker, but I'm sure it was there hiding behind all the alcohol. The room was partitioned into two, which had a plasma TV on either side. The room also came with a blackout\/shade option; it felt like 4AM when it was really noon. As for the bathroom, besides the fact that the shower had clear doors, it was pretty reasonable for 7 girls. I fell in love with the bathtub, which was my best friend at 6AM after a night at Marquee. 

There is only valet at Vdara, but they are super quick. We checked out at peak time (12PM) and it took us, literally, 5 minutes to get our car. 

Even if you love gambling, I highly suggest you check this place out. Plus, the walk to Aria\/Cosmopolitan is 3 minutes. Seriously, I timed it. In heels.

One big negative was that our a\/c was broken and we called them 4 times over a span of 3 hours and the person at the front desk kept saying they were sending maintenance over to fix it.  My butt!  The thermostat read 82 degrees inside when we set it to 50 degrees.  We were sweating our asses off.  That's truly unacceptable, especially for claiming to be a ""luxury"" hotel that charges exorbitant room rates.  Plus, once the maintenance guy came, he said he was only notified about the problem 15 minutes prior!  We were pretty cool about it, but once my friend complained, we got our resort fees waived.  It's the least they could have done, but honestly, they should have just done their job instead of jerking us around saying they ""sent"" someone.

The room otherwise was fine. The downside of my experience was the spam mail from MGM international. The Vdara hotel concierge asked me for my email address to send me my invoice after my stay. I specifically asked them if that was all it was to be used for. They said it was only for billing and no solicitations. Well, 3 months after my stay, I'm now getting advertisements for Vdara and Luxor (all MGM properties).

They were cleaning my room\/supposedly shampooing the carpets as it didn't meet their standard of clean. Ha. At 7:30, I had to call them on the status of my room. They forgot to call me.

We got the City Corner Suite and it was nice at first glance.  The hotel is clean and relatively smooth in terms of access to and from your room and to the exits.  The location is convenient with it being a few minutes to the Bellagio and the Crystals Mall.  

What I didn't like about the hotel was the service.  First of all, when you are in a suite, it probably should go without saying that you would expect glassware.  When I called down to them about this, the response was ""well, we are a green hotel.""  Ok, so does that mean that I am supposed to cup my hands and use that for water?  You provided coffee cups so are those more green than wine glasses especially since you included a corkscrew by the ice bucket?  Maybe just own it next time and say that you didn't have your housekeeping do an inspection before approving the room for guest arrival?

Moving on to the kitchen.  It's interesting that when we came back with food, there was nothing there to actually use to eat it with.  There are 10 drawers but nothing in any of them.  Again, a call down came back with the ""we are green hotel and we don't want to wash the silverware for each guest,"" thing.  Again, this is a suite and you have facilities but in order to use them, you inconvenience guests who are paying a premium to be there.  This isn't Budget Inn & Suites here.  Another irritant.

The last thing was the Wifi.  When you advertise Wifi, perhaps you should make sure that it is actually working.  After spending 15 minutes with the tech support, who were nice by the way, it was finally up and working.  It's the little things here that are annoying.  In Las Vegas, competition is tough for guests who are used to spending a lot of money.  

It's doubtful that I will stay here again because there are so many choices in Las Vegas that it would seem pointless to do the same thing again if the first experience was less than stellar.",5,1,0

The pool is okay- but not a great place if you came to Vegas to party. Closes around 6. :(

There's a spa- but not in my budget. That's okay, though, because the bathrooms are awesome!

It is connected to the Aria and the Bellagio! That's a plus. Trams are pretty cool to get between those three and the Monte Carlo.

The reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is bc I don't like the location. It seems to take forever to get to everything on the strip from here. I know it's in ""Center City"" but it still isn't located in the most convenient areas (Caesar and Linq get higher scores here).

If you want to experience Vegas, but sleep in a peaceful area, this is your best bet!!

Pros:
- It's a non-gambling hotel which is super quiet. Bellagio, Aria and Cosmopolitan are all about 5 mins walk away. In fact I loved the peacefulness when I walk into the hotel lobby from a long Vegas day, but some people would not like it.
- It's non-smoking.
- Rooms are in good condition since the hotel is quite new.
- Price is cheap... in fact cheapest among Vegas 5 stars.

Cons:
- Not as luxury as ""Venetian"" level. The modern decor feels like a 4 star NYC hotel instead of lavish Vegas.
- Walking to casinos is short, walking to the Strip is long since all the casinos are giant.
- Water pressue in the shower is bad! This is in fact my biggest con. 

So overall I liked it, and in fact I have booked with them for another trip in the summer. Their low price certainly helped with the decision, but if you can get Wynn \/ Venetian \/ Cosmo for less than $50 more a night, then I suggest going with those.

P.S.: 

I saw 7 or 8 crazy bitter Californians who just signed up Yelp to claim ""their friends were robbed"" at this hotel and give it 1 star.... 

Look, I am sorry that you are robbed, and I hope for your best if you have called 911 for the investigation, but 7 or 8 people signing up to just rate it 1 star?

After we spent a few days deliberating where to stay, we decided Vdara was the best in terms of price for what you get. 

We originally booked a city corner suite, but a few weeks prior to check-in we were invited to upgrade to the executive city corner suite. 1 1\/2 baths, dining space for 4 people, full kitchen, living room and bedroom.  Ridiculous for two people? Yes. But isn't Vegas the place for that kind of ridiculousness? 

The rooms are all about being seamless: almost everything is controlled by pushing a button or flipping a switch on pad of switches per room. Whether it's just turning on the lights, drawing the blinds or changing the temperature.

I also really love that Vdara isn't a casino hotel.  It feels so refreshing to walk through the entrance and not feel like I'm upping my chances of lung cancer by the minute.   I think that is one of the reasons it's a great hotel for anything spa-related.  It's just clean. comfortable. nice. 

The only thing I wish it had was a more ""complete"" restaurant or bar.  Both the small cafe and the bar make you feel a little on display by everyone lingering in\/walking through. However, Aria is just a few steps away and have all the amenities of the bigger casino hotels.

The costumer service is impeccable and the entire resort is an elegant and quiet retreat from the madness of The Strip.  I am not a smoker or a gambler, so the fact that is is a non-smoking hotel without a casino is a huge draw for me.  My room was spacious, clean, and the soaking tub helped soothe my aching body after a long day of walking.  I booked a Fountain View Suite and it was just lovely and included a bowl of fruit.  

The one issue I had with with my experience is I paid for the VIP Arrival, which includes pick-up at the airport and early curbside check-in with bag help.  Unfortunately, when I arrived at 9 am, I was informed my room was not ready.  No big deal since we had brunch reservations.  I was told it would be about two hours.  Again, no biggie.  They gave me the keys to the room and said someone would call when my room was ready.  I took my time during brunch and two and a half hours later no one had yet called.  I found a place in the lobby to hangout for awhile and the mimosas and red-eye flight from Alaska caught up to me.  I dozed in my chair with my sister seated nearby.  The elevator security approached us and asked if we ""belonged"" there and stated people were not allowed to just come in and hang out in their lobby.  I was pretty offended, one because I was spending a nice chunk of change for my stay, and two, the only reason I was hanging out in their lobby was because the room they promised was't available hours after they said it would.

Long story short, I was able to get into my room 6 hours after my arrival during regular check-in time.  If I had known this was going to be such an issue, I would have selected a different flight or made alternate plans--or just taken a cab.  And while I understand they note on their website that early check-in may not be immediately available, two hours is a gross underestimation from 6.  The front desk offered to take off a few days of resort fees and reduce the hold on my credit card, but honestly, it all felt a bit off-putting.  Once we were checked in, everything was perfect.

I enjoyed my time at the pool and reserved a daybed, which I am glad I did because the chairs seemed to be taken up quickly.  The service was great and the food was tasty.

I have another trip to Vegas coming up in August and I am staying at Vdara once again.  However, this time I booked through a third party and I most certainly will not be adding their VIP arrival to my itinerary.  However, this one bump has not deterred me and I cannot see myself staying anywhere else on The Strip.",4,0,1

They have a cafe that stocks fruit and has lots of nice snacks that you can't find in the casinos. What's not to like?  Well, I'll tell you.  

The Vdara seems to have a policy of only hiring the terminally-befuddled.  Every single transaction involved the person behind the counter staring at their computer as though it was the monolith from ""2001; A Space Odyssey.""   I'm not 100% sure how I ever wound up in a room, with a meal or even a beverage, but somehow they worked out how to complete the task and we got there in the end.

For the patient-deficient, this can become a test of character.  But stay strong, for the good does outweigh the bad.  It smells nice for one thing, which isn't something you can say about most places. The gym was nice.  After a workout, one might be tempted to order a smoothie.  I succumbed and, again, the blender-contraption proved problematic for the smoothie technician and what should have taken a short amount of time became an epic challenge of mind over matter.

Check in; painfully slow.  Cafe; ordering eggs (their computer register confounds every employee), to waiting an inordinately long time for eggs...  DON'T order anything there if you need to be somewhere in the next, oh, two hours or so.  DO order there if you like watching the person behind the counter mystically rise to the challenge of taking your money.  

Once in the comfort and quiet of my room, everything worked well, I had no problems with water pressure and the view was nice. I enjoy complaining and people seem to enjoy my little rants, so I think everybody wins here.",4,6,2

We weren't let down. 

We were able to get a very early check-in for our 34th floor suite, and we took advantage of it to get some very relaxing bath time in. The bathrooms are gorgeous and spacious; a standing shower next to the ginormous bath tub, dimming lights, and use of glass and mirrors makes the place very romantic. Giggity. 

I know people say that a room is just a room, but they haven't stayed at the Vdara. The staff is beyond polite and helpful. There isn't any gambling on property, so the entire hotel smells fresh and smoke-free. The rooms have full cable tv access (I didn't check the movie channels, though - got stuck on Comedy Central), and there is a small, fully-functional kitchenette. We brought snacks for our visit, to help minimize food and drink expenses. 

The last time we stayed, we utilized the concierge service to book dinner on the patio of Prime Steakhouse, located in the Bellagio (the patio is on the water, facing the fountain show, by the way), all planned by the concierge - and we loved her for it. This time we had something more specific in mind, so we didn't need a concierge. 

The location in the City Center makes the rest of the strip fairly accessible. There is a monorail within the City Center, going from the Monte Carlo to the Bellagio, and across the street is a station for the city monorail system, inside of the Paris. We never needed the bus or an Uber\/Lyft. 

I will always love this hotel.",2,0,1

We were so excited about staying in this chic looking hotel with the newer city centre section of Vegas. Two other people that I stayed with stayed at the Aria and immediately stated that the two were not comparable. Meaning Aria was way better especially service wise. When we checked in the hotel attendant welcomed us with a smirk and got on the phone to ask about giving us an accessible room as the deluxe booked rooms were all sold out. Ok, my friend mentioned that we were celebrating her birthday and the attendant states that she would see what she could do. When we reserved our room we booked through the hotel's website we thought we were taking advantage of the stay two nights and get a $50 food and beverage credit. However when we checked in we had to remind her or the offer after she said she didn't see anything like that. That really gave me a bad first impression vibe and little did I know the room service would be even worse:( when we finally got to our room on the 20th floor we had a nice view of city center. The decor was nice and we had a kitchenette for our convenience. Since it was accessible space wasn't an issue. Later that night we requested extra blankets and towels and never received them. So I'm the morning I was stuck waiting again for towels and could not shower or anything until they came. That night we found that the pull out bed had springs sticking out and decided to go to the front desk to express our concerns. The attendant apologized and promised when they cleaned the room we would have two extra feather beds for the pull out. To our surprise that evening we had nothing. So we called and express more concern and they informed us that the promise of two feather beds should not have happened due to the fact that the two could damage the bed but that they would honor what we were promised. After 30 mins they brought the beds and other requested items. Our last incident came when we left the next day and called for our room to be service after we left around 3pm. When we returned at 6:30 our room had not been serviced. We called once again and they apologized which at this point meant nothing...gave the resort fees back, bottles of water and more towels...our trash was over flowing and dirty towels were everywhere...it was a gross feeling all night and morning. I ran out promising never to book the Vdara again!",4,0,0

Ok now to the room, it's like a condo! A full size stainless steel fridge, microwave, stove, cabinets and a washer and dryer! There was a couch and 2 chairs in the living area and a flat screen on the wall. The bedroom is separate from the living area. It was a nice size with another flatscreen on the wall.

When I checked in, the gentleman was fantastic and very nice....THAT IS THE ONLY TIME ANYONE IN THE RESORT WAS NICE.  Most of my interactions with staff were very short and they were very rude.  The worst- is the amount of children roaming lobby, halls, strollers everywhere....I love kids and if you have them-this may be a fantastic place for you to stay...because it is a lot like one giant day care center.  On my floor....there were babies crying 24\/7 and kids literally bouncing off of the walls....all times of day!!  It was almost as if someone left their kids in the room next door to me for 3 full days...morning, noon and night.  If you are looking for a romantic time...or a fun get away...or rest and relaxation---DO NOT STAY HERE.  Now to the food- AWFUL, bad and AWFUL.  I would not waste a penny on food at this place- ordered room service breakfast---$40 and it was awful.  Had a grilled cheese sandwich- $13 at the café and it was burnt and had one slice of store bought sliced cheese on it...AWFUL.  Do not waste any money on food here.  It is amazing to me that their little commercial on the TV in the rooms say....""elevate your expectations"" at the Vdara.  The rooms were ok....but not anywhere near what they advertise...they try to advertise like it's the Ritz or 4 seasons and when you walk in---it is IKEA, AT BEST!  Another very annoying detail....if you are going to have security ask you for your room key each time you enter the elevator bank---EDUCATE them.  Let's see ---I was at a business conference in the Vdara, so in and out of the room several times a day.  If they see the same person 4 times in an afternoon---WITH A NAME BADGE ON AND A BUSINESS SUIT--one would think they would recognize me?!?  hmmmmm ....I sure could tell you who was standing there all the time.  So annoying and really just amusing that they need that much security?  Or what has happened there?  And why on earth when you see the same person 3 times within 3 hours you do not recognize them?  I find it amusing on some of the other reviews they mention 2 free bottles of water---??  Never saw them???  Also- no coffee maker in the room- NOTHING?!  I recently stayed in Vegas at the Golden Nugget downtown Vegas and they had a great little one cup coffee maker in each room.",1,0,0

We stayed at the City Suite -- 800 sq ft with the comfiest King bed you'll ever sleep in, pullout Queen, kitchen\/dining area, vanity area, and jacuzzi tub\/shower, washer\/dryer for $189 a night, plus $50 in resort credit to use at the City Center. What a steal!

That, plus a $20 sandwich upgrade for a corner suite view of the Bellagio water show and Vegas strip, non-smoking room and hotel, no casino, nice pool area, Aveda bath products, robes\/slippers for him and her made me feel like I was living the luxurious life.
The girl at the front desk was also able to accommodate my birthday by bringing in a complimentary chilled bottle of sparkling wine! Extremely friendly staff. :)

Apparently these suites were made to be timeshares but demand wasn't high enough.. therefore, you'll be able to find really good deals online. It's a great location, as the walk to Aria\/Bellagio is minutes away, and there are trams to take you to Monte Carlo if you're headed that way.

Things to know before you go:
-Vdara is located behind Aria, therefore the entrance is on Harmon. Google maps will tell you that, if not all the signs.
-Valet is the only option at Vdara. This could be good or bad based on what you prefer, but self-parking at Aria or Bellagio is another option to consider. Valet was just extremely convenient for girls in heels :P
-There's a mandatory $15 resort fee, although this seems to be the new ""rule"" in Vegas, as another hotel charged the same fee. At least here at Vdara, $50 resort credit was included which bought 6 of us lunch at Jean Phillippe's next door :P
-You need to request plates\/utensils and cookware, but the staff was very quick with bringing it up.

Highly recommend this hotel based on service, location, and overall quality. 5 stars from me!",8,2,6

I lived for 2 nights with a view upgrade- (I checkout tomorrow)
Con
1)view is fair- most of the scene is rather distant
2) Noise- sirens and engines can be heard clearly- what's really bad however is a sucking\/whirring noise at the bottom of the ?power plant?
3)1 bed standard+1 sofa bed 
4) Bath tub- terrible architecture- prevents you from lying down comfortably and sinks you 
5) Controls for lights and shade is located near the front door unlike other hotels which is next to the bed
6) dialing room service can sometimes put you on an answering machine
7) Room service can be rather slow- :\/ waited 20mins for towels to shower in the morning
8)the shade doesn't block the sunlight all the way- it leaks a lot of light into the room on the sides- ruining my sleep
9)1MBPS speed wifi... Any faster is $15.95 per night

The large king bedroom and pull out queen sofa bed house 5 of us girls for the weekend.
