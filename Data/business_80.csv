The rotating\/vertical stages are a unique central element that is well utilized throughout the show.  The storyline\/plot is linear, unlike some other Cirque shows.  I do admit to reading Wikipedia afterwards to understand some of the intricacies (""Oh, THAT'S what they were trying to show!"")

Favorite parts: the sparkly long-haired guy (fairy prince?) swinging around and the dreadlocked pole fighter jester\/bodyguard guy, especially when he's doing the shadow puppets with the prince.

The theater is exceptionally cool looking, and the pre-show ""scary warriors"" are not as stupid as the two clowns at O.  The theater's snack and beverage bars are combined (unlike O's), so the lines can be long for a bag of popcorn and a water, but the bartender-cashiers are exceptionally fast and professional.  There isn't a full gallery exhibition, but they do have a collection of Ka costumes and a few pre-show musicians\/performers out in the theater lobby outside the snack bar.

I found the humorous bits less boring and obnoxious compared to O's (the beach scene wasn't awful).  Ka has more of an action\/martial arts focus compared to O's diving\/ballet.

Ka was also a cheaper ticket than O for me.  I also liked that I could pick up my ""Will Call"" ticket at the Concierge instead of waiting in the box office line, though I don't see why MGM uses Ticketmaster for O but physical tickets for Ka, unless it's a money saving thing.",1,0,3

Unfortunately, the experience did not live up these rave reviews at all.  It took a good 30 minutes for the show to interested- and by then my bf was deep asleep.  The show really needs to be reworked- the stupid baton scene as well as the beach scene with the sea creatures was totally ridiculous.  Overall there were like 4 really interesting scenes, but I definitely feel like Cirque is holding back on us.  

In the past I've seen O and Mystere- and those are really amazing and the performers totally push it to the limit.  I also have NO idea what the story line for this show is supposed to be- it literally made no sense while I was watching it, so I made a mental note to just disregard the story line and just enjoy the experience.

I did come into this with a bigger expectation only because the first show I've seen was O. O has a much larger stage and audience seating and it was a water show. Ka on the other had is more focused on the choreography of martial arts combined with some aerial stunts However I did not walk out disappointed. The story line of the show is pretty obvious. There was not a single second where I didnt understand. I did read some of the yelp reviews and I still dont understand how some people can miss the storyline. They do have a narrator explaining the two characters in the beginning of the show. 

The stage is small and the audience seating isnt quite large however it plays an advantage to the audience because there really isnt a seat that has bad viewing. We had a seat in the back tier but it was still pretty close to the stage. There is no balcony seating.  

The production of the show I think did a good job. Switching from one scene to another following the two characters was done gracefully and if you pay attention to the scenes, the softer scenes & the more action packed scenes contrast very well. 

Because the production is smaller, it allowed the actors to interact with the audience. They come off the stage and interact with us which I thought was cool! 
The staff that helped us to our seats were organized and in character. 

During the show there was a part where it was all video. It is suppose to be a fighting scene and it is normally performed by the performers. However about a year ago, there was an accident involving one of the performers so now they do that scene using video rather than the actual performers. So hopefully that explains alot before jumping into conclusions saying that it was stupid.

They had the same giant wheel scene that I had seen at a different Cirque du Soleil show in Houston but the performer here didn't seem as skilled and I feared for his life. He was jump roping on top of a giant spinning hamster wheel but his jump rope got caught and he lost it and had to get another one which kind of scared me.

Located in MGM, I believe this is one of the older shows. The theatre itself is beautifully constructed with bright walkways on both sides. Before the show begins, fireballs are constantly spitting out of the center the the stage area and was pretty cool! We sat in the center third row and got an extremely good view of everything without craning our necks or straining our eyes. A lot of the performances seemed to take place on this stage that was flexible to become a ship, a beach, a wall, and all sorts of other set ups which was pretty cool. 
My favorite scene was probably the shadow puppets they made ( super cute) and also when they were chasing each other around on the platform with the spikes poking through the floor. Otherwise, most of the scenes I really cannot remember too well since they all blended together. Some of the costumes and decorations reminded me of my ancient chinese dramas. There was one last part that they showed using some type of projection I think instead of acting due the death of their actress during the performance so that was a good move on their part to make it safer for their performers.",1,0,0

As they say, you can see and experience it but you won't believe it. 
This gravity-defying production takes adventure to an all new level.

From the warriors running and jumping from the walls around you to the rotating stage that brings you from location to location in an instant, you are left in awe.

- Entertaining Storyline
- Interesting Set Around Audience
- Rotating Stage
- Breathtaking Acrobatics
- Worth Every Dollar

My wife and I scored some amazing front-row seats on the cheap and we are Cirque du Soleil geeks, so we were excited from the start. Depending on the show, sitting in the front at a Cirque can be a bad idea, but not with KÀ.

I was looking around, wondering what the pre-show gag was going to be as there is always some level of crowd interaction. At first I thought all we were going to get was a character waling around and warriors on the wall. They ended up doing a bit where they confiscated a camera from the crowd and tossed it over the edge. It was plausible until the end when they guy dove over the edge after his camera.

The overall storyline is so over-the-top adventurous you can't help but to wonder what they will do next. The show takes you on a journey of love and conflict, set within a dynamic stage.

If you have any doubts on how good it will be, just watch the teaser trailer. 

While I had many favorite parts, I really enjoyed when the characters washed up on the beach, when they climbed up the stage to evade enemies and the rotating cages.


When the characters wash-up on the shore after their boat sank they encounter fun creatures like sea turtles and crabs. The most memorable part for me however, is when the sand dumps off-stage and the characters struggle to stop from falling.

During the climb, the characters are being chased by archers and and warriors in choreographed movements up a wall. The stage is constantly rotating and lifting while people fall off-stage. There are arrows being shot at them and then used for footholds. Amazing.

Near the end there is a rotating slave cage scene where you witness many gravity-defying feats. As the program explains it ""The two artists balance and control the spinning of the apparatus from their opposing cages attached to the center axle. As one runs and jumps on the outside of one cage the other controls the speed by walking or running inside the other cage."" This took a lot of skill and the artists didn't trip-up once.

Though reviews seemed to be overwhelmingly positive for the show, i didnt really see any that recommended it for kids as young as 5. (My kids are 12, 9, 5). 
So very glad we chose this show! Maybe the other Cirque shows would be just as good, but i can only say our whole family was amazed and entertained. The show was varied and each and every aspect was worth seeing and done really well. the show doesn't really play to any specific interests or audience, it seems like it would be universally appealing. (note that it has almost no dialogue or singing though...)

The seats we got were considered ""standard"" but ended up being awesome. I was concerned because, even though we were relatively close to the front, we were almost all the way off to the side of the theater. It really didn't hurt the viewing experience. The seats seemed great. (Be sure to ask for booster cushions for your little ones. They saw us walking in with little kids and brought us some.) 

Even my 5 year old couldn't take his eyes off the show. Would recommend to anyone.

Note,
Go ahead and arrive a few minutes early. It's  worth it just to look at the stage, the ""harp"" players on the lobby, and interact with the actors as they roam the theater in full character.",1,0,0

I originally was leaning towards LOVE, so I purchased at Best Buy the DVD showing the making LOVE.  The CD is great and I recommend the DVD, but I would rather create my own images of the music.  And LOVE, like most other Cirque shows, did not have a story.  That is why I chose KA.

So, was the story great. Not really. Basically, brother and sister are about to go through a rite of passage when the ceremony is ambushed, their separated, and after going through various environments, they are reunited.  But this is enough to give a spine to great acrobatics, incredibly costumed performers (snake, turtle, etc.), a fantastic sound system, and, most of all, a technological marvel of a stage.  

I bought the DVD after the show (yeah, at $30 it is overpriced) and was even more impressed with the production.   To understand my biases, I love great effects shows like Fantasmic (especially the Disneyland version) and shows like Phantom and Les Miz.

Last month when we were in Vegas we saw LOVE, and it was excellent. So off to another Cirque Show. We bought the tickets on line from the MGM and got a bargain. First I went down to the concierge in the Pallazzo, and got a bullshit price of one hundred and seventy-seven dollars ($177.00). So we go on line to the MGM and buy two tickets for one hundred and three dollars ($103.00) per ticket. We saved over seventy dollars a ticket! Thanks (for nothing) Pallazzo Hotel. Well not exactly nothing, I did have a suite comp, and food credit, and slot credit for the g\/f. Guess I should be more understanding.

We sit down to two very good seats and prepare ourselves for the fun and excitement of a Cirque show. We weren't disappointed, it was a fabulous set, with very artistic acrobats and martial arts performers. I thought the storyline was great, but didn't come off as well as I would have liked.

There were even one scene where the performers were doing standard Peking Opera routines of kicking spears around on stage.  To non-Chinese audience, many of the acrobatic acts seem amazing.  But they are no surprise to Chinese audience.

However, I must give 5 stars for its amazing production.  The high tech pivoting stage that also serves as an interactive projection system, the surround sound system on the head rest on every seat.  The story line seamlessly glued together a collection of seemingly unrelated standard Chinese acrobatic acts that are no longer recognizable as Chinese.  The choreography was so good that most acts looked like a  dance. It brought you to a fantasy world with great entertainment values.  It even includes several scenes designed for kids.  Our kids loved the comedy on the ""beach"" and the shadow puppet show.  I am particularly impressed by the bird eye view of the battle scene.  The actors played out the battle on wires in front of a vertical wall.  They played the scene so effortlessly and you thought you were really looking at a battle from above but in reality you were only looking forward.  Such scene is no big deal in a movie, it is just a different camera angle.  However, imagine doing it live on stage.  That is amazing production.

When  we walked into the theatre, we were greeted by ushers that dressed in costumes that matched the costumes in the show. It was like they were trying to immerse you into the show. Right before the show began, these two artists played this very interestingly made ""instrument"", if I may call it that, atop the entrance inside. There is a nicely talked bar, where you can order drinks and alky to enjoy inside the show, which was awesoome!

When we entered the auditorium, we were greeted by even more ushered dressed in really cool dressing uniforms. They were very friendly too!  If you asked, they would allow you to take a picture with them. 

We got floored seats that were close to the front. Word of advice, the best seats for this show is definitely floored seats, but sit a little farther back from the front. I think around 15th row is perfect because the stage is so high. I will not reveal anything else about this show because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone. 

There was DEFINITELY a definitive story line. Sorry, but anyone who says otherwise does not know what they're talking about or obviously did not pay attention. Why pay so much for a show if you're not gonna focus!

To think they paid $220 million to develop this show. Paying $165 a pop for this show is worth it for something that costed so much more to make.  If you don't believe me, check Wikipedia! No kidding, ha!

The story at times was a little hard to follow, but that had mostly to do with the fact that I was slack jawed trying to figure out how they were pulling off what they were pulling off. Brilliant. 

Ticket's were definitely on the expensive side, but I can honestly say it was well worth it. I would spend it again. As is with most first time in a specific theatre experiences, I can also tell you that really any seat in the house affords a perfect view. It's not entirely necessary to spend big here. Also, a lot of the action happens ABOVE you, so sitting front and center is probably not the best position, even if it's the most expensive!

Before heading into the theatre, you get your photo taken which you can look at and purchase after the show. For $45 you get two separate shots in a beautiful book style frame.

I had concerns about why it was significantly less expensive and so many people we spoke to in Vegas recommended O. I'm sure O is spectacular, but you won't be disappointed with KA. ITS EYE CANDY!!!

When comparing the two from reviews, most people indicated how KA has a story line. This threw me off- I kept thinking it would be more of a Broadway show type. The ""story line"" is pretty insignificant....so don't let this deter you! I did have moments where I was trying to make sense of the act (where does this fit into the story), but knowing what I know now......don't bother trying to read between the lines. It's all artistic expression- just sit back and enjoy!

Also- don't break the bank trying to sit in the lower section. In fact, I sat in 201 and I would have to say this section would be the best for viewing ALL of the action.

The set design is awesome! The stage seems like it's a performer it does its own tricks. We got there late and had to sit towards the back, which wasn't really a bad thing. The stage is massive so I think all the seats are good.

When you walk in, it looks like it will be amazing. The architecture looks like something out of disneyland, I took my seat and could hardly wait for the show to start; then, the show started.

Several members of the cast are out of sync which is highly distracting. During almost every scene you will see the entire cast which is present at that moment just standing still while a single performer does repetitive moves that are not entertaining for excess of 5 minutes. Randomly, some porn-star Tarzan enters the storyline for no apparent reason. Several of the scenes, different members of the cast would mess up, again, it was quite distracting. The room was too hot, they need to turn up the AC. There is an impressive dragon outside of the theater entrance but sadly, no dragon ever comes into the show. Wait, no, scratch that, if you like shadow puppets, you'll see a dragon for about a minute before some horrible fight scene occurs.

Everything about this show is outdated. The music is like a bad 80's rock style opera that has enticing highs and melodic lows. Honestly, the music was the best part. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, eager to leave and call it a night after that disappointment. 

For what you get, this show is extremely over priced. Trust me, don't go and waste your time or your money.

BE WARNED!!!!
There is a scene (probably 30 minutes into the storyline) where a bright, hot white flash occurs. It blinded me for over five minutes and gave me a headache. At the end of the show, they set off hot white fireworks that blinded not only me, but every single person around my area. We were all looking in other directions and shielding our faces.

I heard that there was good fire scenes in this show too, trust me, there aren't It's mainly just bad storyline with over drawn scenes that will put you to sleep.

Here is the real deal since I have a feeling that some of the reviews on here are bogus. Sorry that I didn't know about the revised ending before spending the money, I know better now. 

First, I've been to 5 Cirque shows 2 this weekend in Vegas (O and KA) sadly I saw O before KA and my expectations were high but the bubble burst quickly with the start of the show.

Let's start with sound, they have a sound system worthy of a Paul McCartney concert and at times they actually use it but from the start it was obvious the main players either weren't miked or they didn't feel that they need to be in the PA at a respectable level because they really weren't. At other times in the show I was able to hear people eating popcorn several rows behind me when the music should have been more prominent, damn they even have speakers in the seats how about using them!!! Oddly later in the same song it was thunderous. 

Next, the show gave the impression of a fire show from the pre-show warm-ups that never played into the performance at all which I found to be very odd. But what really had me scratching my head and wondering why I just spent 600 dollars for my 4 person family was watching 'finger puppets' for 5 minutes, yes 'finger puppets' and I'm not one to spoil the show but seriously Cirque that's the best you could do and incorporate into a top billed Vegas show! WTF guys!!!

Another thing that I found to be very annoying is that most Cirque shows feature acts with some intermissions, this show is all the intermission skits and some performances tossed in, really backwards and kind of annoying when you pay big bucks for big acts not baton twirling! 

What I came to see was the big fight at the end on the moving platform, that sequence is still in the previews that I saw all over town on DVD loops yet when the big scene came into play I was treated to a video, an F'in video not even in HD video of a previous performance but a really crappy low rez version, then suddenly fireworks and it's over. Everyone in the house had the same reaction, this is it, it's over, aside from 8 guys that stood up and yelled and clapped like they were part of a previous cast, nobody was really even thinking it was over! This show was very anti-climatic to say the least!

The platform not only rotates horizontally but also rotates vertically as well.  Which such a dynamic platform to utilize, the acrobatic stunts are stunning.

All in all it was 90 minutes that seemed like an eternity for all 4 of us.  I think I almost fell asleep 4 times, which is really disappointing because I've really enjoyed all the other cirque shows that i've seen.  Skip this one and pay the extra money to go see O.",3,2,1

SEATING TIPS **
We got tickets in the 3rd row which was awesome, however for this particular show I would suggest sitting as far back from the stage as possible. 
Part of the performance is done towards the middle of the audience so if you don't want to have to crane your neck backwards sit further back. 
At the beginning the stage also rises for part of the performance and again it's a bit harder to see if you're sitting close to the front.",5,1,1

In a nutshell, the set, props, stage IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!

The stage rotates a complete 360 degrees in every which direction and the actors utilize this with fierce talent.  Out of the 6 Cirque shows in Vegas, this is the only one that has a storyline.  Which is ok, they can't talk, which makes telling the story complicated. Luckily, it's a very simple one.  Two twins get separated & it's their journey back to one another.

I will have to say though, there are some slower sections with ""obnoxious"" acting, you know that acting that you see in live performances where the actors must make their emotions as big as possible so the person in the back row can see them.  But if those few parts were removed I would have given this show a 5.  It accomplishes what it sets out to do, amaze the heck outta ya. 

There were a lot of man butts in thongs, which I could have done without.  And one of them is in an all glittery costume. Not hot, but feminine & sparkley enough that I would rock that if I were a stripper, kinda reminded me of the one Britney Spears wore.

Pyrotechnics, really neato!  There's a firework show at the end that puts this show out with a spark. hehe no pun intended, but get ready for it when you feel it's ending, you'll burn your corneas.

Puppetry, actually quite spiffy.  There were a few characters dressed as beach creatures, they were cute, added some humor. 

Martial Arts, this is an Asian inspired show, so there's sparring, swords fighting, stick fighting etc.  

Be careful, before it starts there are actors that try to scare you. Jumping up over things, picking people up & throwing them over their shoulders, screaming....etc.

The best part was toward the end when the big spinning wheels are brought out and there are two men with a death wish run around in them, out of them, jump rope, skip, basically make me nervous as h*ll watching...but soooo impressive.

This show is a great addition to Vegas & mainly because of the stage & the very talented actors.",2,0,0

This was the first show I've ever watched in Vegas, as well as my first Cirque du Soleil show... and I do believe it set the bar too high!

I was mesmerized... at least while I was awake.  Sadly, I had worked the night before, and was going on my 23rd waking hour -- my eyes simply closed on its own.  I think I had to have nodded off 4 times toward the end.  But this only means I can enjoy the show a second time someday, as if I was watching it for the first time!

*Nerd alert* If you're a fan of RPGs, I swear these French guys got a lot of inspiration from Final Fantasy X.  Think: lost at sea and washing ashore, to find yourself on an island with weird monsters with cutesy music int he background.

The show has a lot of ""martial arts"" influence, but those who do study it may be displeased to see how ""weak"" the fight scenes are.  This is no Jet Li movie.  If you can appreciate that they draw inspiration from martial arts to include it in their dance, then you may be less disappointed.

There were some performers running around the theater looking menacing, but you would be ignored and forgotten if you sit near the front half of the theater.

The show itself was spectacular, and a very good introduction to Cirque du Soleil. It has a very clear storyline to follow easily, not too big a stage so you can mostly focus your eyes on one thing and not have to worry about missing out on the rest of the performance. The effects were great, and I think the sound was amplified since we sat right in front of the speakers.

This is a relatively small theater, so don't limit yourself to the expensive front row seats. Another advantage for seating towards the back is you can actually see the performers jumping down from the side stages, instead of craning your neck up and getting a view of their lovely behinds because you sat in the premiere seating.

The only downer is that they don't allow any photography inside the theater.

Ka actually has a storyline, unlike certain others that just show random acts.  There are everchanging sceneries and the entire performance from start to finish will hold your interest.  There were different types of performances other than the typical acts.  With other cirque shows, I've gotten a little bored of seeing the same old things.

I sat in the 7th row and I loved where I sat.  I also don't care for the audience participation that seems to be the norm in cirque shows.  Ka picked one person who was obviously a part of the show and it was a very quick little thing.  There was also no intermission with this one.  It went straight through, which was a nice change from most live performing arts shows.

What we experienced, however, was one of the most boring shows we've ever seen. The storyline was trite and even hard-to-follow at times. While the stage was incredible, as many have said, the fighting was only ok, the acrobatics were average, most of the aerial work was boring and repetitive. The music was low energy, Enya-sounding, sleep inducing instrumentals. My wife and I forced ourselves to keep our eyes open because at $70 per ticket including fees (that was a discounted price) we figured that was 77 cents for every minute we were snoozing. But the guy next to be snored through the entire second half. He woke up for the final battle scene, but even though the live fight has been reinstated (no more cgi which everyone seemed to hate), it was not what I had hoped--mostly people rappelling up and down the wall and jumping over each other.

So the two stars are for the amazing set design, costumes, wheel of death, and the drumming scene was cool and unexpected. But the boring storyline, sleep-inducing music, and mediocre acrobatics left much to be desired. Wish we had seen LOVE instead, as we only had two nights here.",0,0,0

This was definitely theater. Costumes and environments beautiful and various. Vertical stage was a good idea to help transition something from as simple as a wall to reflecting water, to becoming a mountain. I appreciate something as small as them simulating the person falling to the bottom of the ocean with lights and screens to look like water and bubbles and animals. I love the story idea- some of the cirques have story lines, but not as solid as this...they're more of a ""theme"" in most or mini stories within the theme to do inbetween stunts. It actually was very touching to see this coming of age of two separated twins and who they become. No narration or dialogue here so you just kinda have to fill in the text and connect it yourself.

Now this is kinda an objective rant about almost every single Cirque show but I feel like I should say it out somewhere: 

A lot of people just look at how big are the stunts- but I judge shows overall and in things that some people don't care about or dont know how to appreciate. So long as you do just all crazy crazy stunts and more flashing lights and more and more dazzle thats all they are concerned about. I hear this about every Cirque that it's not enough stunts on reviews and from some people I know (*cringe*). Cirque Du Soleil was made to combine circus  with theater to create a rounded sensory experience and those subtleties will be lost on people who can't appreciate both.  Also, I don't think people realize how hard their job is and how quite a few of these stunts that aren't ""complicated"" enough for some people actually can easily cost their life (and on a few productions have taken lives of performers). There's some crazy stunts possible to do in movies and even in regular circus where you can have all safety measures in place, but in a live performance theater where you cant have a billion harnesses and pads blocking the aesthetics, it puts it down a level on whats possible and manageable to do safely. Maybe some people who watch too much dazzling stunt TV, not enough theater and arent athletic don't realize how amazing and difficult some of these things actually are. Desensitized to realities so then more impossibility is expected and short attentions of the ADHD generation seems to be more of the problem than the performers. I appreciate the heart and passion of people who give their all, discipline their body and put their art for everyone to see. I recommend this and really any cirque for people who are romantics to the small details in visuals and skip it if you just want dazzle stunts- go to the regular circus and a dinner for the same price as a Cirque ticket.  Gah, I'm just tired of hearing this chimed in all the time of wanting more and more- I worked on the strip and dont anymore because I'm sorry but it gets annoying to hear the bitching about this, I get it enough from tourists I'm unfortunately associated with through blood\/friends\/etc to just have enough to not rant back finally. 

Also another mini rant about ticket prices-I get comments that oh they're upcharging so much thats why its too expensive and probably not worth it.  Does anyone realize how expensive to build a theater with all these moving stages and props costs(O theater\/ production was financed by Wynn for $100 million!) ? Do you know how much maintenance is? Have you seen how many people it takes to operate the show backstage along with the big casts of people? They don't just get up on stage for 2 shows a night- did you know these people practice and exercise and discipline their stunts daily? It warrants the price to even cover their expenses and make a bit of profit. If it's too pricey by budget- hold out for a sale or a discounted ticket at value ticket booths all over the strip. If you pay full price then your choice to make the call but don't do it if youre not sure this is your thing.

A good performance is always good value , but only if it's something you can appreciate otherwise I guess my rant and their performance is all for null. I guess I'm saying is skip it if you don't ""get it"".",4,1,4

As a warning, I will be mentioning specific scenes in the following review, so if you care about spoilers, it's time to bail out.

The story is a bit hard to parse at times, and seems to have some otherwise rather superfluous sections that might have better been replaced with plot or more acrobatics. The male twin's storyline is the one that makes sense, while the female twin's storyline is meandering and seems to largely exist to insert the slapstick-y portions for children (like the giant beach critter scene, everything involving the two clown attendants and the nursemaid, and the snow-dwelling fishermen plus their flying machine bird thing that drops her) and whatever flotsam and jetsam performance features they couldn't sensibly cram into the story (like the conehead iguana people and sparkle-Tarzan). It's particularly difficult to parse the ""fight"" scene where the stage is positioned such that the audience has an overhead view, but leaping back and forth is probably all that's really safe in that situation. I think it might have made more sense to have cut sparkle-Tarzan entirely and have made the female twin's love interest the evil advisor's alchemist son so we could get a little more investment in that guy (because his death or injury was quite blah) and potentially have a clash between the twins. Given how much personality this character has in the opening portion where he supposedly chucks an audience member who is filming the performance (and his camera and phone) into a fiery pit, I was hoping for more out of him. It seems like a lot of wasted potential.

Confusingly disjointed story aside, there were some legitimately awesome scenes in the show. In particular, the arrow fight scene where pegs come out of the platform to represent arrows shot at the protagonists and the stage shifts such that the players must use the arrows as hand-holds to move around. I was also a big fan of the grinder scene where the caged captives help grind the gunpowder-like substance being produced by the evil advisor's alchemist son and the foremost two, who are not caged, perform acrobatics on the spinning arms of the machine. Pretty cool :)

Anyhow, overall it's a good show, but I feel like Cirque shows in general suffer from disjointed writing, as though they start with a couple of acts they want to include and then attempt to stitch them together, often in an incongruous way.",0,0,0

This abstract and interpretive acrobatic show really made our trip to Las Vegas special. From the very beginning when you're entering the theatre to the grand finale, the performers are interacting with the crowd and providing unique and inspiring entertainment. 

Some of the stunts look so dangerous that your fingertips get tingly and you want to scream\/ cry at the same time.

I have seen many Cirque shows over the years and all of them are different, yet all of them feature amazing acrobatics and daredevil stunts too. Some have a solid story line, and some it is barely comprehendable. KA fell into that category. A thin story line, but wonderfully talented acrobats and gymnasts.

When I saw this show not too long ago we had center orchestra seats that offered a great view of the stage. In fact, the stage is the big star of the show. The technology use to create and move that stage into all sorts of motions is incredible. The cast is terrific and the scenes are like a mashup of ninja moves and adventure flicks. As always, the trained physicallity of the cast is beyond belief. I would be sent to a hospital in traction if I attempted any of these moves!

I also liked the venue. Nice seats with good legroom. Seems like every seat has a great view. Cranking air conditioning too.

The costumes are colorful, great set design, the Wheel Of Death is thrilling, the music is wonderful, the hydraulic stage is cool technology, and the story itself is like watching a Chinese opera. With exciting ninja acrobats!",3,1,3

This is a nice change of pace for CDS fans.. especially if you get bored from plain acrobatic performances like me.

I've attended several of the Circus Du Soliel productions and I built up my excitement for KA. However, to my understanding the show performance has changed since the tragic fatal incident a year and a half ago and understandably so. I'll start off with the positive: the entire staff very pleasurable, in character and the set glamorous with another fantastic floor The unfortunate, it lacked the WOW factor and was absent of the well known contortionist, acrobatics, music and storyline. I clearly observed the fight scenes and the performers had a huge gap without contact and delayed reactions, it was totally cheesy FAKE and the two main characters had love interests with other characters that didn't seem believable since the two main characters appeared to be extremely young with much older individuals that made it very uncomfortable to watch.

 The BEST of the Circus Du Soleil I have seen is ""O"".  The ones I would PASS is KA and Love. I would also PASS on the traveling productions especially Kooza. 

Luckily, I obtained ""bogo"" tickets for KA online through MGM. Tickets where $88\/per ticket, 3 where purchased with and added surcharge of $40. The same tickets, seats where $195 for the original price. 

I went with two others for their first time experience and they enjoyed it, but one repeatedly looked at the time. It's a 90 minute show, so looking at the time regularly is a clear sign of wanting it to end and being bored. :\/",5,3,4

It has a story line, as people have mentioned, although we often said, ""Who's that?  What did that person do?""

As others have mentioned, there's definitely a story here, unlike many of the other Cirque shows that are kind of a mish mash of stuff. Loved the rotating floor...it's really something to see. Wait for the part where it goes vertical - awesome. 

I wished there was a teeny tiny bit more in the way of acrobatics - aerial silks and other aerial arts arts are my fave part and there was only one section of this. But, that section was pretty awesome. 

For you fellow lushes out there, they have a deal where you can get like a 32 oz beer for $11 or something with $7 refills that you can take out of the theater onto the MGM Grand floor. Sweet!

Before the show starts, there's this REALLY awesome thing that happens over by the bar area. Just look up, you'll see what I'm saying.

Unfortunately, I didn't get around to buying the CDS tickets until we arrived in Vegas. ""O"" - our first choice - was sold out. The concierge at our MGM-affiliated hotel, Aria, told us in an OH-so-unbiased manner (uh.... right) that the MGM-resident ""Ka"" was just amazing, totally worth it, etc. So we plunked down $119 for Ka tickets.

Man, were we underwhelmed. Where was the majesty, the beauty, the physical feats that make you wonder whether you've been transported to a lower-G environment? 

Ka is about a bunch of Asian-stereotype folks running around a stage, spouting psuedo-Asian gobbledygook, with fake giant sea creatures, human hamster wheels, and a human-sized peg board that rotates every which way. And that's about it. Really.

Sure, but really, if you could follow the colors of the costumes figuring out who was who and what was going on wasn't all that difficult. The only English is with an opening paragraph in the opening sequence that was announced over loud speakers, and the rest was in an Asian language (sorry I don't know which one). It has a little bit of something for everyone. My dad was amazed by the stages (yes, there were several, and they moved, and that's all I'm going to give away). My mom loved the acrobatics. I absolutely adored the music and themes there in. My boyfriend loved the martial arts and liked that there was some sort of story to follow along with.

A few things to note: 
-The show is about an hour 45 minutes (totally passes by so fast!). Don't go on a bathroom break! You'll miss stuff. 
-Bring a jacket, because it does get cold in theater.
-Look EVERYWHERE. The sets are designed for all the seats in the theater.
-Look for deals on great seats! When I went I saw a promo code on travel zoo for 30% off orchestra seating. It was a great deal and we had really great seats. I've never paid full price for Cirque tickets because there are usually deals on every one of their shows. 
- Check for seating online and by telephone. I also called in and spoke with someone to book my tickets to the show. They gave me better seating then the ones I found online. So it's good to do both to snag better seats!

There were a few truly awesome moments of gravity-defying, action-packed fighting scenes during the show, and that made it more memorable.

High-flying acrobatics, a compelling storyline, choke laughs, and a huge platform that can rotate 360 degrees.  

Plus, if I remember correctly, there were intermission breaks so I could take a pee\/crap if I really needed to during da performance (unlike Zumani-tits).

It was so far from the stage, I might as well have been watching it on a small screen TV in my living room. If you're going to go see this, get seats in the first 10 rows in the front, otherwise, it's a waste of time and money.

This was my first Cirque experience, and I was falling asleep towards the middle and end of the performances.  Oh, and the 90s-ish rock n roll music for the 'bad guys' was kind of cheesy in my opinion. Rock n roll is as relevant as jazz music nowadays, sorry to burst your bubbles. 

Another annoying thing, people coming in LATE to sit down. Have some common courtesy and be ON TIME.

Not interested in seeing any more Cirque shows. First one and last one!",1,0,0

After having seen La Reve and a traveling Cirque du Soleil production (Corteo), I was very excited to see Ka. We had good seats, about half way up (which is where you want to sit). The production value was good -- the stage itself was very neat. However, the music wasn't great, the acrobatics were OK, and it was just a little boring.

I don't need a plot -- Corteo is a dream sequence -- La Reve doesn't have a clearly articulated plot. But this just didn't do enough to amaze me, excite me, entertain me, etc. Both my wife and I couldn't wait to get out!",0,0,0

Both shows were excellent and we noticed no drop off from the first time seeing this. The story is compelling and not as abstract as some of the other CDS shows we've seen - which is refreshing. 

What really takes this over the top for me, making this one of the best shows out there, is the amazing use of the massive mechanical stage and effects. These are mind blowing live effects that really have to be seen. 

Both of our showings we did sit pretty close (3rd row and 20th row) but think seats around row 20 are preferred to see everything comfortably. Being too close did strain our neck some to see some things overhead. 

One thing is for sure, there is nothing like this show and my memories of it are worth the dollars spent on the ticket.",0,0,0

I felt that the performers in the front were not very friendly like they normally are. The seat usher was extremely rude to us and our out of town guests. So we already had a bad taste in our mouths before the show started. 

The was just good Nothing spectacular. They have changed so much of it and removed so many good parts. Not sure why, I thought it was amazing when it first opened.

The only part that actually stands out in my mind now as amazing is the baton girl and the 2 people doing the hand puppet light show.

I had row L tickets, smack in the middle,. VIP seating for $165 a piece,. good thing my buddies are high rollers and we had them discounted. ;)  We were practically the only one in our row,. 

The seats are padded with built in speakers,. you can feel and see all the action; no matter where you are looking within the stage,.  

I don't want to reveal much but it takes a lot of skills and practice to perform with no error.  I love how the performers are filled with confidence in the skills they possess and how they value SAFETY FIRST! 

After being spoiled and sitting so close to the stage,.. I think the tickets are well worth it, even if it would mean I have to pay full price for them next time.  If you sit all the way in the back,. ""yes you can see everything, yes you can see the stage"",. but you can't see and feel the facial expressions of the performers and you're missing out on the little details that you can ONLY see upfront.  

Sitting in the back, reminds me of watching a basketball game, where all the players below you are tiny and you just rely on the big screen tv to watch all the action.  You hear the crowd goo ""AWWWE"" and you wonder what you missed?! It was the smaller details you can't see on TV,. do you catch my drift?!

The music, the story, it all brought me intense waves of emotion. I've never felt anything like this with ANY performance I've seen, and having been in Theatre most of my life that definitely says a lot!

Levels of walkways surround the seats where performers propel from and entertain the crowd before the show. It's just so aesthetically pleasing, and makes the audience feel as if they are a part of the action and adventure!

And then... the stage. It's a hydraulic stage that moves up, down, slanted and even VERTICAL; It's unbelievable how talented the performers are to stabilize themselves and act with such grace. In other cirque shows I usually see many mistakes, but at KA not a single one! The actors were so well rehearsed and on point!

I am itching to go back to Vegas just so I can see the show again! It's almost a manic obsession... Well worth the price, and you can get great deals through MLife.

I can't even pick a favorite part, but the battle scenes were beyond brilliant. 

If you're in Vegas and looking for a show, I highly recommend this. You're going to spend the money any way, so why don't you put a few down and treat yourself to a beautiful, amazing, colorful experience that far surpasses any of those tired magic shows that lace the strip.

Ka was my first Cirque du Soliel show.  Saw it at MGM.  I enjoyed it because it was a lot better than the Celine show; however, after hearing so much rave reviews, I was expecting more. Yes, the performance was nice, but the story was hard to follow.  I didn't understand the people in the sand part.  I didn't know how that related to everything.  I did like how it started out and how it ended and the underwater sequence (makes me want to watch ""O"").

The moving stage was great to watch.  Some of the scenes looked repetitive though, like the fighting scenes.  The scene where the performer had died was replaced with an animated sequence that looked very repetitive. You see people fighting, but they go back and forth for what seemed like forever (and they don't die or something?)

The guys on the moving hamster wheel thing reminded me of what I saw at the Ringling Bros Circus (which I do not recommend), so I wasn't blown away seeing this as I have seen this stunt before; however, one of the guys almost fell because he was trying to jump rope, so that was an edge-of-your-seat moment.

We went Thxgiving holiday weekend (busy time for Vegas). We sat in the right section mid way up (A tad too close). If you go to watch this, you'd be better off sitting further back in the mid section, probably cheaper tickets too and I would only go if you can buy cheap tickets.

This show would be a FLOP without the moving stages and sets built into the side of the auditorium. The storyline and performances or lack thereof would not be able to sustain itself without the amazing stages. The moving stage is the highlight of every scene with the performers incorporating themselves into it to give the illusion of moving landscapes, etc. The last battle scene and maybe 1 or 2 other scenes using the moving stage are the best.

The entire performance is lacking with imbalanced energy levels from the entire cast. Some performers are extending themselves giving great performances, not spectacular however, whilst others seem to be going through the motions; it was palatable. Either the performers are bored with the choreography or the show in its entirety. There is one main evil character who looks like a cross between a Kiss rock band member and a Japanese warrior, he barely did acrobatics and wasn't in a lot of scenes but when he was on stage, he was captivating...he had stage presence. There was a baton twirler...yeah, a baton twirler who was ok but not anything special that I haven't seen a 16 yr old girl do during a street parade.

I'm still trying to figure out how the ""Spongebob Squarepants"" scene with people dressed in beach animal character outfits was Cirque du Soleil'ish, they hardly did any acrobatics or feats of the imagination. It was more of a Tom n' Jerry comedy skit...I'm guessing they needed to burn time somehow to prep next scenes but I'm still puzzled by how cheesy this was executed given the opportunity to showcase their ""talented artists."" Another scene which was ""visually"" captivating for about a whole 3 minutes but lasted 10 minutes way too long was a rope hoisted performer controlled bird contraption where they dragged a screaming main character around (not doing anything acrobatic in nature) the entire front of the stage...bawwwwring!

At the end of the show, whilst performers were taking a final bow...many of the performers started undressing right there on stage, taking off masks and clothing. Really?!? ...geez, talking about spoiling a supposed illusion filled performance with undressing performers during audience applause; how unprofessional!!

For what the tickets cost, I don't recommend going to this show if you can't get tickets under $75 pp. It is expensive and not nearly worth the $150+ per tix cost that is charged on most sites. Not a lot of acrobatics that I hear most other Cirque shows are known for and I think that's due to the limitation of the size of the moving stage.",7,2,0

There were a few very minor things that were just ""ok"" for me but please don't let them take away from the main point which is over all this show was beautifully crafted and performed:

1 - The fireworks at the end were extremely bright and painful for my eyes.  This was my problem, not the shows i'm sure, but just wanted to make you aware.

2 - The story line for small sections kind of dragged on a bit too much.

A lot of reviews say this Cirque du Soleil shows differs from the others in that there is a storyline\/plot. If you do not read the storyline ahead of time you'll be thoroughly confused during the show. But if you do read the storyline it spoils certain parts of the show. So its a Catch-22. 

That being said the show has some amazing acrobatics and had many cool scenes. I only paid $62.50 for my seat which was in the first tier to the right side. While the seat wasn't bad it did not offer the best view of all the action. The middle section of the second tier of the theater is the best for seeing everything. 

Hunt on-line for deals especially if your not going during peak Vegas season. Don't concern yourself too much with the plot and just enjoy the artistry and one of a kind stage and you'll walk away happy.",1,0,0

The Production and the staging were pretty cool.  However, the lack of dialogue (and when there was, it was not understandable) made the show go slow and hard to follow .  After lots of fighting scenes, there was an act with giant animals that was kinda funny but totally random and out of place.  I'm embarassed to admit that I even fell asleep!

This show is very dramatic and there are a lot of intense moments. The drumming alone creates an atmosphere where you feel like the stakes are high for the show. The storyline is good, and unlike many other Cirque shows, it has a direct and chronological story that makes it easy to follow and easy to know which characters to root for. 

The acrobatic work is great in this show as well, and there is a campfire scene that is surprisingly one of the coolest and most poignant moments in the show. There is a great boat scene that is scary (and if you're prone to getting seasick this will make you queasy) and the big battle at the end is very cool to witness. The best scene, however, comes before the end when the performers try to ""escape"" from hunters by going straight up and down a wall using arrows to make their way. It's hard to describe, but expect lots of somersaulting and last minute saves from branches that appear out of nowhere. 

The theater is good and helps enhance the show experience, though don't even think about having a phone on because the staff is crazy on top of any extraneous lights. The show was a bit long, but it didn't feel like it was long for no reason so we were ok with that. Finding the theater is a bit challenging in the MGM, so allow yourself a few extra minutes to navigate the maze that is this casino.

The concept is totally different, and after doing some research, I found out $165 million was spent just to build the stage! I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but try not to sit too close to the stage, or you'll miss out on the action going on in the back. 

I was sitting in the 8th row, and I could feel the heat from the fire fountains on my forehead, so I can't imagine  how hot it must have been for those in the first row! The staff are very strict regarding NO photography, so remember to keep your cell phones out of sight! 

This show was conveniently located within the MGM Grand, where I was staying. They had a special offer to buy one and get the second ticket for $15, so in total I only spent $200 between me and the boyfriend! Also, I suggest going to the restroom prior to the show starting because there is no intermission. There were so many people getting up to leave for the restroom, which was quite distracting.

OH YEA... it also has the COOLEST STAGE EVER!!!  Absolutely amazing... the stage not only spins and goes up and down but, they also turn it completely on its side and use it as a screen to change the landscape.  The costumes have a great Asian flare and the music is a perfect complement to the story and excitement.  Oh yea... each seat has its own set of speakers... an excellent plus!

Seats in the middle of the theater are a good money saver.  We went during the week and we didn't sacrifice much by saving $25 per ticket ($125 mid theater VS $150 for the front section).

The story is easy to follow, despite the fact that it has no dialogue. With that said, the story line sucked; Too cheesy, simple, and unoriginal. Strike one. 


The fight scene. Okay, you don't have to really hit anyone, but I would have enjoyed some swords, or weapons. Com'on, this was supposed to take place during a Imperialistic Japan, where are the warriors?!? No, instead, we have shadow puppets and walking starfish. Very childish 

The good parts of the show: Despite the fact that Tarzan and Jungle scene was very left field, and didn't fall into the plot at all, was still visual and acrobatically cool. The strength between the 110ish pound women, holding a 150 pound man, above the audience with no safety cords, was  astonishing and bewildering. 
The moving state was nice, costumes were visually appealing. 


Who would I recommend this to? I would take my 6yr. old nephew and 8 yr. old niece because of the simplistic story line, childish tone and silly humor.

Although you can tell that the story is by no means polished and there's some unnecessary filler (with some flat humor), the show is both an ambitious triumph in artistry and technology that literally took my breath away.  

So what is Ka?  The basic premise follows a prince and a princess who gets separated under an initial attack.  The show follows their journey as they find out who was behind the attack and their many meetings and encounters with the strange and fantastical world of Ka.  

The first thing you'll notice when coming into the theater is that there is not only a stage that constantly changes thanks to the many movable props and a super-awesome moving stage but also some great features that extend towards the far ends of the entire theater and has parts played into the show.  Really cool.  

The second thing to notice is that crazy moving stage.  I've seen very few other productions like it in which the stage acts as so many different elements (a rock-climbing section which I won't spoil too much of here is nothing short of awe-inspiring).  And in connection with the stage of course is the actual performers themselves who simply rock.  It almost seemed as if one of the performers near the middle of the show in a complex section was about to fall off but luckily, he recovered and was the only 'error' that was noticeable.  The other effects are pretty awesome when they appear and surprisingly, comes quite often.  Ka makes smart use of both the complex and the simple (a scene near the beginning 'underwater' is one of the most clever 'underwater' scenes I've seen).  

My biggest complaints with the show lie in it's story and filler.  I hear that this is the first Cirque production that tries to incorporate a story and at it's foundation, it's not too difficult to follow.  However, although the context is appreciated in connecting the scenes together, expect to either feel a little lost as scenes tend to fly around with some recklessness and little guidance.  The filler didn't help either with the humor usually falling a bit flat and feels like it wasted some time in just setting up the next big stunt (which again, is understandable, but a really neat shadow play section shows that smart filler space could have made all the difference.)  

Service-wise, my biggest complaint has to be the lack of a 'will call' line, at least when we came 15 minutes before the show started.  Most of the line could have moved much quicker if the ticket counter were able to separate those that needed new tickets versus those that bought tickets beforehand so do take note.  Luckily, the inside staff is very kind even if you come in a bit late.  Not only are they 'in character' but they also lead you to your seats with flashlights at the appropriate moment.  Price-wise, do try to book early (they had a special $10 off booking about 5-6 weeks in advance in the summertime).

With the ads we have seen featuring this show, we figured it would be mostly fire related. Even when we sat in the audience waiting for it to start, there was fire shooting up from below the stage every few minutes. You could feel the heat from where we were sitting, about 50 feet away from the stage. So not knowing anything about the show, we assumed it would be fire themed, like ""O"" is with water. To our surprise, it was more theatrical and included lots of action, costumes, acrobatics. And the stage - wow - all I will say to not give anything away is the stage itself is a character in this whole production. It was 90 minutes long, but it flew by and we never got bored.

The only thing is our necks got kind of tired looking up. There is so much to see all around the theater. Kind of wished the seats reclined a bit more. But, all in all, extremely entertaining and well worth your time. I say this because usually when I go to Vegas, I'm all about the gambling and eating... So to take me away from the slots and tables to watch a show - it better be worth it! ;-)",0,0,0

I was more mesmerized by the stage that keeps flipping up and down and even turning from horizontal to vertical than the majority of the performances from the actors\/actresses. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy their acrobatic performances and stunts, but the moving stage is the main highlight for me. I have never seen anything like the stage at KA before and its just breathtaking how it was able to transform with each part of the plot. 

One of my favorite parts from KA was when one of the sibling was doing shadow art with his hands.  He was turning his hands into the shapes of a bunny, kitty, etc and it looked really cool. Another of my favorite part from KA was when the girl sibling was flying over the stage on ropes with her love interest. The scene was very romantic and I was amazed by her ability to flip and turn on the ropes. 

Like many of the reviewers on Yelp, I am still a bit confused on the entire story line. I wish there was some narration to explain what was happening throughout the performance. All I know is there are two siblings who got separated and then they found each other in the end. Please fill in the middle for me. 

Overall, I did enjoy this 1 hr and 30 minute show. I was entertained throughout the performance and I am glad that I was able to catch this show in Vegas.",3,1,1

Yes they had a major accident last year with the death of a cast member. But as many yelpers have mentioned they literally took out the best scene in the entire show and replaced it with some cheap blurry CGI wannabe fight scene! I mean cmon isn't this suppose to be Vegas?? Go BIG OR GO HOME! The show also seemed to lack that energy level I remember when they first opened. Maybe they've lost that passion after performing for so long. Yes i was literally falling asleep instead of staying engaged during our show. 

Knowing the and personally knowing and meeting the original caste members they would definitely be disappointed in what the show has turned into.

If you are considering watching any show by this production group go for Ka. The show has a storyline and the magnanimity of the show will just blow you away.

Practical tips- try to get the tickets at tickets for less. You may end up saving 30-40 bucks. Try to get seats in section 2 for a great view and decent proximity to the stage. Too close does not work too well !

The pseudo-360 degree use of the theater, the acts OVER the audience, the gigantic moving stage, and the pyrotechnics certainly lend this show a very over the top atmosphere. It's also one of the few Cirque show that follows a linear storyline, which was fairly easy to follow.

I had some of the best seats in the house (the back of the middle front section) and the show certainly didn't disappoint from there. At least visually. As you may garner from other reviews, Ka's main weakness is the actual acrobatics. Nothing really stood out here except the two men in the rotating cages, and perhaps the human plinko machine act. Contrasting those was 10 minutes of a girl twirling her baton(s) and slightly more climbing up and down of the wall than I thought was necessary.

Overall, though, I found Ka very enjoyable and would easily recommend it. There is no other show that will do spectacle like Ka.

Just an FYI: I booked my tickets through a Living Social promo that redirected me to the MGM ticket site.  The tickets were only like $65 a piece. The map on the website showed that our seats were in the first row of the 200s sections, near the middle of the theater.

I had front row seats. It was nice being able to see the performers up close and personal. I don't know if it was just my seat, but it had embedded speakers behind my ears enhancing the sound experience. Some Yelper mentioned that the antagonist looked like Marilyn Manson. I think the antagonist looked like Criss Angel who happened to be lost because he was in the wrong show. I felt tortured after watching 10-15 minutes of shadow puppetry.

Turns out I know one of the lighting techs, so I was actually paying attention to little details as much as possible. It sounds like depending on when you see the show, it might be slightly different. A friend of mine who saw it near its beginning asked if there were ninjas at the beginning of my show. I said no, they were more like pirates, doing lots of swinging and swirling around. His were hugely acrobatic, mine were not, so that's interesting, I know they have to keep it fresh somehow. 

I think I am kind of a Cirque purist, in that as much as I enjoy the crazy theatrically technical stuff they can do, I would really just rather watch people do over-the-top physical stuff. Unfortunately, KA only has about 20 minutes of truly amazing physical feats. For me, there is just too much plot. I'm not really at a Cirque show to see a story, especially a story that is occasionally abandoned, (um, where did all these random green creatures come from?) That was actually one of my favorite scenes, but it was a giant non sequitur save from the fact that the girl meets her future, very glittery, husband. 

The stage and such truly are incredible- it does very amazing things. Again, though, there are times when the stage is shown off more than the people. The scene were the performers basically climb the stage with all the arrows, (this is after there is a fight scene on this wall. This is in the Arctic scene), is nice and all, but I mean, they are hooked up to a cable while they do this hand-over-hand climbing. It was one of those moments where I thought, hell, I could do that. Not as easily, of course, and not as quickly, but that's just not something I want to say when seeing a cirque show.

Again, the truly acrobatic things were amazing, but I don't think I'd really care to see it again. I was really excited to see the martial arts involved but they were SO stylized, it was more like dancing. I think it was totally worth seeing, but once is enough.",0,0,0

I think it is best to sit in the back so you can see all that is going on. If you sit in the front your vision is limited. 

The best thing i thought was the rotating platform. It would change colors, and spin and doing some sweet shit. The story was a little confusing at first, but it came to me. Also what was pretty cool to watch was the two dudes on the spinning circles things. There were jump roping and doing some crazy shit. Good job dudes!

We were able to get an incredible deal as part of the end of the year 2015, it was buy one, get one $15! Awesome. We actually went to the MGM Grand ticket desk to get tickets and the guy was very helpful - he gave some recommendations on where we should sit due to the uniqueness of the stage. We were in section 202 a few rows back, right in the middle - EXCELLENT seats, I recommend. The stage and show go up really high so you don't want to be too close and have to crane your neck up. And another plus about our seats is they weren't in the most expensive tier, yay for saving money!

The show was....unbelieveable. It was amazing to see these acts live. The skill, acrobatics, showmanship, music, everything, bah, just fantastic.

There is a story line, which I sort of followed, but then just made up the rest in my head as the show went along. I wasn't too far off base when I looked through the Ka companion book after.

I also loved the characters! Strangely enough I can't put into words why, but I just did.

The stage itself was incredible: It is a a geniously gigantic, rotating platform that moves and switches sides so that sometimes you get to see the action like you were above it.

As the acrobats showed their martial arts moves, I couldn't help but wonder, were all the acrobats Chinese?  That's how accurate and awesome I thought this show was.  It almost feels as if you're being put into one of those old Chinese movies and watching it live. 

I was worried that this show would be hyped up too much and I would be disappointed since everyone I knew who had seen it said it was awesome.  There was no let down here.  There's no way this show can be hyped up so much,  it's that good.  I've seen other Cirque du Soleil shows such as Mystere and some traveling shows in San Diego, none of them come close to being as good as this show.  Most of the other shows I've seen don't really have a story line, but this one is pretty easy to follow and understand.   

Trying to save some money on these pricey tickets?  Try the Half Ticket Booth, this is actually the first time I see them offering Cirque du Soleil show tickets on a weekend at discounted prices.  Although it's for tickets for the same day, you save some money and might just get really good seats.  I payed around $90\/ticket when they're originally around $165 and I was in the 11th row.

After the wonderful experience we'd had at Zarkana, I was more than glad to shell about almost $300 on tickets for my mom and I to enjoy this even closer. When I think Cirque du Soliel, I think the height of human gymnastics and acrobatics, beauty and the wonders of the body. 

The show starts off pretty promising. There's a lot of fancy pole work, extravagant tumbling, and spinning. And then it stops. It then becomes all about the impressive technical aspects and stationary visuals. Giant moving tables and great music and costumes..... But they rely too much on prefilmed visuals and not enough on what makes CdS the wonderful powerhouse it had been know to be like. 

I realize not everyone can be on their A game always, but the jump roping rotating figure-8  guy just gave up midway through his routine. Since I could never do anything remotely like that, I won't hold that against him.

As a student majoring in Entertainment Engineering and Design Technology  at UNLV, everything Cirque Du Soleil is nothing short of fascinating to me.

Upon walking into the theater, you feel like you're transported to another world. The theme of KA is fire, and as soon as you set your sights on the stage you see, and if you're sitting close enough, feel it. Large fireballs rise from what appears to be a bottomless stage area, creating a sense of excitement and curiosity. 

The show displays the theme of fire through out it. The way the songs for this show were composed, in my opinion, mimic the growth and expansion of a flame. They start off small but crescendo into much more, giving the listener different feelings as the song progresses. If you don't get what I mean, try listening to Love Dance, one of my personal favorite songs and performances during the show. 

The technical aspects of this show were absolutely magnificent. One of the things I found most interesting was the Sand Cliff deck. Not only can they move this stage around using hydraulics, but there are touch sensitive panels installed in the stage allowing it to track the movements each performer makes. That stage is truly a work of art. 

If you are in Vegas and looking for a show to watch, definitely give KA a chance. If you are a lover of music, art, or technology this show will be very pleasing to your ears and eyes.",3,0,2

This was the second time I watched this show. Me and my boyfriend got this Vegas package deal that came with free tickets. Since it was free, we got crappy seats all the way in the very last row in the middle (section 202 row NN). The first time I watched this show, I sat half way up in the middle (paid $80). I must say, i did read reviews about how there is no bad seats in the theater which might be true... but I would rather pay more to sit closer. I could not really make out a lot of the facial expressions\/costume details from the last row... I would even pay $120-$150 for the okay seats! Well worth it!

The show itself was amazing! The stage transforms many times... horizontal stage changes to a diagonal and vertical stage! Amazing engineer work!

According to WIKIPEDIA it is: It describes the story as ""the coming of age of a young man and a young woman through their encounters with love, conflict and the duality of Kà, the fire that can unite or separate, destroy or illuminate.""
That explanation is in VERY SIMPLE TERMS!!!  The show is HUGE!!!  
As you first enter the theater your eyes are filled with reds and gold. The sights are vast and towering. I felt like I was walking inside a bay of a huge mother ship but this is not of that genre or era.
Lights come up and the music starts. First thing I notice is the amazing sound that seems to be coming from all over. That magic is partially created by the speakers that are embedded in the extremely comfortable seats with lots of leg room I might add. People start crawling up and down walls and from the ceiling. Drums beat and your pulse increases as you anticipate the next marvel of sight, sound and yes....color. 
Up through the floor, main center stage a boat appears, you see people on the deck and you think in your mind, this is great, people moving around in a quasi almost 2 dimensional state. Can it get any better than what I am now seeing? Yes it can, and it does.  The boat lifts up and you see people below decks climbing up to the upper decks working. This show is a constant mind bender utilizing light and space. It is kind of like the artist M.C. Escher in the here and now, on steroids and in your face.
I can go on but I would not be doing this must see spectacle any justice describing the show. If you enjoy a good 3D movie some of the effects and staging in this show will impress you. Me being a Television \/Theater tech guy, I kept asking HOW? Lighting, Sound, Staging, Sets, Martial Arts and let's not forget a GREAT PYRO TECNICS show was amazing to experience.
I would suggest this show more for people maybe 13 years old up so they can truly understand what is going on.
I give this show 2 thumbs up!!

The show had plenty great Acts but they also had uneventful scene fillers.  The show had some acrobatic acts, but not as intense as other Cirque shows.  The stage moved just like every stage, but this specific one had one part of the stage that was used so much because it was able to tilt.

When Ka ended, I felt shortchanged and wanted a refund. If I could give 0 stars I would just to try bringing this high rating down. Ka in no way deserves 4 or even 3 stars.

I get the program and I'm like ""Why in the blue hell is this asian play made by a white guy? Oh well...lets not judge....lets give it a try I guess.""  

My god Tyronnnnnnnnnne! This play\/cirque du soleil moonfry was just OK....I loved some aspects of it like how some of the characters come out to you and blah blah blah, but it slows down a lot at times and I actually almost fell asleep.

I mean, this show is worth $20, not no damn $100.

It was still a great experience for me and my lady, but shit...that over $200 we paid should have gone to other things or atleast towards a bad-ass concert or wrestling or UFC event! hahahaha!

KA is an Americanized Cirque Du Soleil and if you have money to throw away, then check it out I guess... I would rather try the Cirque Du Soleil with the water.

Especially after having gone the night before to see Criss Angel's Believe which gets 1 star. The difference in shows was unbelievable. 

Entering the theatre, you immediately begin looking around as the set projects out and over the seats. The ushers in costume are friendly, even when cautioning guests not to take photos. Indeed, as part of the show, a clueless patron gets first his camera tossed into the fire pit, then his cellphone and finally, he's tossed too! Of course, he's part of the cast, but the message about no photos and turning off one's cell phone is dramatically made. 

From that point on, the action never stops. Two cast members do a shadow puppet show that was funny, sweet and clever. Fight scenes are well choreographed and at times, riveting, particularly as the stage floats, sometimes being at a 90 degree angle. 

Our tickets were $165 which isn't cheap, but if you can afford it, it's a treat that's worth every penny.

Some are odd (Mystere), some are dreamy and romantic ( ""O"" ) and some are just plain fun. ( LOVE )  But Ka is really the only one to follow a linear story line that doesn't confuse the audience.

It's a story about a brother and sister separated during a celebration and the awe inspiring adventure they endure while trying to find one another after that cruel event.    Please to not take lightly that i said  ""awe inspiring adventure.""    We witness sinking ships at stormy sea,  a thick jungle full of tree jumpers and giant insects and snakes,  a flying bird machine composed of fir and people flying through a real snow storm and an epic battle remnant of any top notch magical Asian cinema.

My first time watching KA was back in high school--it was also my first Cirque show ever. We had second row center seats, and I remember wanting to join the circus afterwards. I recently watched the show again with my boyfriend for our anniversary and sat a little further back. 

Seats wise, I actually think it's better to sit a little further back because this way you are able to see all the stunts\/activity going on in the side towers. When I sat in the front, you had to turn your head around to be able to see what was going on.

I love how interactive and special the stage is. They manage to do so many things with the moving stage. My favorite scene is definitely when they're fighting with the arrows shooting at the 90 degree stage. A lot of the scenes made me hold my breath because I was so anxious.

That is a tuff statement for me to make. I do not want to show a lack of respect to all the performers and the separate elements of the show, and i certainly don't want to show a lack of respect to the deceased performer and her family... But the show just is not the same.

Awhile back there was an episode of Modern Marvels based on Ka. It was very clear, in the episode, that what set this show apart from the rest was the advanced theatre and stage technology. A significant display of that impressive technology, was the amazing finale. This is literally what  lured me in to see Ka in the first place, and i was not disappointed at all!

TIP: DO NOT PURCHASE FRONT ROW SEATS. This is a production you want to be sitting a little far back from so you can really appreciate everything that is going on. 

This turned out to be an amazing show! The stage is really something else, and the digital visual effects are AMAZING! I heard the stage cost them $200 mil to build, so you can imagine when I say it really is 'someting else'.

It is seriously so bad, so BORING, so confusing and pointless. My boyfriend fell fast asleep and stayed that way for the majority of the show. Are you serious?!!?! 

Before the show started, the guy behind us pretty much summed up how the Cirque du Soleil experience SHOULD be: ""I don't care about a story line; I only care about how close to death the performers are. The closer to death, the more entertaining for me."" EXACTLY.

At no point was anyone close to death during Ka. And I shouldn't have to follow a boring dialogue-less story to watch a Cirque show!! The moving stage is only cool for about 2 minutes.

I can't believe this show is so much more expensive than the traveling shows. I have NEVER been disappointed by a traveling show. I most recently saw Kooza in Santa Monica, and it was breath-taking, hilarious, and jaw-droppingly amazing. Don't settle for less. 

SKIP KA and enjoy Vegas!",2,0,0

Great blend of acrobatics, Capoeira dance, martial arts surrounding towers and moving platform captivates an audience. The elaborate costumes were unforgettable. Ka is an experience...a do not miss opportunity.

Tips:
-- Purchase tickets through Half Price Tickets the day of the show (7  locations on the Strip \/ $75 for level 2 seats which are normally priced $120)

--Don't get seats too close...they make great use of the stage and it'll feel like you're sitting in the first row of the movie theatre.",4,2,1

The ""floating"" stage was a pretty cool element, but overall the whole thing was more ""showy"" than traditional Cirque-acrobatic. 

Plus, they should really work out an alternative ""live scene"" to replace the one where the tragedy took place last summer, if they feel it's unsafe to perform. The CGI version of that fight scene at the end was a big disappointment - especially for keeping the show at full price.

Hubs and I were really excited to see this show. We got there extra early and were at the front of the line. The ushers are hilarious and full of character. It made waiting in line more bearable. 

We sat in our seats for some time while the rest of the guests were coming in. The stage looked impressive and there are speakers in every seat. Cool! I was a little disappointed that there was no clown for this show. 

The good:
+ It's fire themed and there's a clear storyline
+ Good performances
+ Impressive rotating stage

The bad:
- Not enough acrobatic performances
- 1 whole scene was CG'd

A few months ago one of the performers fell and died. I'm assuming that the scene where they CG'd the performance was the one where the lady died. Ok, I can understand all the complicated things associated with that scene, but if you're going to CG it you should probably cut the scene out altogether or shorten it. It was so boring watching a CG projection for 5 minutes. I don't mean to be disrespectful to the lady who died. I know these performers are doing risky stunts etc. The audience does pay a lot of money for a spectacular show. If the scene is deemed unsafe etc they shouldn't wastes the audience's time. You can still have a good show without that scene. 

Some people really enjoy this show. For the hubs and I, we thought it was so so. We would recommend Mystere over this one.

I had seen the show before but it was completely different knowing that somebody's mother died while performing in this show. 

That being said, this show is beautiful and the story arc is one of the best in the Vegas silent shows that we're so famous for. It's about a brother and a sister so of course my familial heartstrings are going to be tugged. Short too--about 90 minutes or less--so you can get back out on the casino floor and into the restaurants.

That is really a unique idea and introduces some interesting elements that make the show different then the others.

The show tricks are really focused on the stage and the (as one person posted) the human hamster wheels.  This is different then some of the other shows that have four or five other major stunt acts.  There were a few slower parts of the show, but I thought they added to the story and made for some good acts.

+ The HUGE stage set!  ...loved how the center stage along with the sides of the theater were all used in the show.  I literally felt like I was part of the show!  Awesome. 
+ The rotating stage!  ...I'm still scratching my head cuz I can't figure out how they got the whole thing to rotate and how the performers performed on the stage without showing any signs of nauseousness?  ...much props to CdS, I'll say!
+ The beach scene!  ...the funny turtle and the vibrant little crabs were quite entertaining.  Cute.
+ The SHADOWS vignette!  ...this brought me back to my childhood days and it totally outdid my childhood memories too.  These shadows put my finger shadows to shame.  
+ LOVED the acrobatics & martial arts!!!  ...I'm notorious for falling asleep during shows.  Idk.  I suppose I just get comfy in my seat and then suddenly, my eyelids want me to drift off to dreamland...  But I was actually entertained & awake during this entire show!

MINUSes...

I just sat there wondering how anything that large could be that maneuverable.  I am still in awe.  I loved the engineering that must have taken place to make this show possible. 

Ok, yes, this show starts with narration of the story, and yes, it's the only Cirque that does this that I have seen (and I've seen MANY).  So What?  Should all the Cirque's be identical?  The costumes were cool.  I loved that the show has people shooting faux arrows from columns in the audience.  I love the fire blasts that are used throughout the show.  You can feel the heat on your face.  I love the scene where the sea organisms are in the sand.  I love the boat with people in the edges.  I love the whole thing.

In a Sentence™
KÀ is the worst Cirque du Soleil® production in Las Vegas and possibly on planet Earth. (I have been to many of them.)

Quick Review™
+ Hopefully no one dies at the KÀ performance you attend. I am not a praying man ....

- KÀ is boring. It will literally put you to sleep (at least it did for me*). (*Detail about ""customer experience"" : I fell asleep, as a customer.)

- KÀ's story sucks. Give me a Cirque du Soleil with no goddamn storyline if it is going to be this piss poor. It is as of they conspired to present the most confusing, pointless, and uninspiring 'story' just to prove they could make mountains of profit off of shitty storyline.

------------------------------------------

If you are a grown adult, you may have to take copious amounts of methamphetamines in order to mitigate the immense amount of boredom that this piss poor, shitfest of a 'storyline' is going to induce in your cerebral cortex. Or simply: be prepared to fall asleep if you are not chewing coca leaves, Inca-style.

Let me be clear: KÀ is terrible. It's terrible that someone died in this extremely shitty production. It's terrible that so many people think this is the greatest Cirque du Soleil that has ever graced Earth. It's terrible that KÀ is so terrible. 

Worst Cirque du Soleil I've been to, and for contextualization: I've been to handfuls of performances. Thus far, I have been to: KÀ, The Beatles LOVE, Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour, Mystère,O, Zarkana, Zumanity, and multiple times to several of those. 

This is the only one where I fell asleep at. My brain must have been protecting itself from the continued damage it was incurring from KÀ. Pro Tip: protect your own brain and just acquire tickets to something better.

More customer experience so that the morons at Yelp® headquarters can find enough to refrain from removing review:

1. I walked from the parking garage (Free parking at the time) to the interior of the resort. Then, I walked to the box office. There, as part of my customer experience, I waited in a short queue; talked to a young woman at the box office about purchasing tickets with a local's discount, then personally handed her my credit card so she could swipe it and hand my two tickets to KÀ. 

2. I walked into the theatre, after being scanned in by the door. I sat down in a seat after being directed to them by a finely dressed usher. I watched and listened to the show from those seats until the conclusion of the production of KÀ for that particular night. To finish the ""customer experience,"" I participated in egress. Participating in egress was the most fulfilling part of my experience. 

3. I waited for years to go to all of the Cirque du Soleil productions before beginning to organise my final assessment on each show.

Pro Tip: get tickets to another show. There are much better Cirque du Soleil shows.

------------------------------------------

Tourists
Tons and tons and tons of tourists here* -- naturally -- since it's the Las Vegas Strip. (Locals are allergic.)

Kids
Not good for kids*. (*Kids can't appreciate someone dying performing for entertainment.)

Dogs
Not good for dogs*. (*Unless it's French-Canadian.)

I understand the wall-battle finale was done with live performers until a couple of the performers fell to their deaths back in 2013.  The producers replaced this sequence with horrible CGI video that they map onto the giant moving stage like a movie screen .  It's really bad and very confusing for the audience.  

For those not familiar with Cirque Du Soleil, it is basically an acrobat-based opera.  You will see some amazing acrobatic performances, but it's mostly a lot of choreographed dancing and marshal arts.  If you have the extra money to spend, I think it's worth seeing once just to say you saw it.  Those on a tight budget should reconsider until the production companies bring down their ticket prices.

I LOVED KA!  It had a great story and the action really kept me on the edge of my seat and turning in circles to see the action all over the theater.  I was anxious to see the big fight scene at the end.  I had read about the performer who died last year during that scene.  So I have to admit that I was disappointed that they replaced that whole scene with a video.

But... I get it.  A person died.  Maybe that was the resolution to ensure everyone's safety and still keep the show going.

IT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF SHOW THAT PEOPLE WHO HATE CIRQUE DU SOLEIL HAVE BEEN TELLING THE COMPANY TO MAKE. I saw 6 Cirque shows before this and I'm honestly feeling this may be my third favourite of the bunch, because I'll admit it's a show where the brilliance really hits you after you've seen it. 

Kà is indeed the most accessible Cirque show to date, and I do think it's a good staring point. The storyline is pretty easy to follow, given that you pay attention of course. Some of what happens can be rather scatterbrained (the focus between the goofy clown family and another family being one), but that doesn't really matter- the visuals are what really count. There's one scene where a curtain covers the stage and video effects make it look as it a dangling acrobat is drowning. 

Of course the show loses a point because of the final battle scene being entirely CG. It's easy to see why they'd do this- the accident that happened earlier this year, however the CG battle scene the lighting was really dark and blurry and that made it hard to tell what was going on. I got the gist of it but I do think they should brighten the video a bit. However, that aside, the video projections were amazing- there's a scene where the screen is being shot at with arrows and the projections ""react"" to where the arrows landed. That, blended in with characters sliding and flipping effortlessly on the screen was awesome!

And the two acts that really left me thinking- the GORGEOUS aerial strap scene. That was just beautiful. The costumes especially from the ""forest people"" was just stunning to look at, and of course the wheel of death. I spent THE WHOLE SCENE watching through my fingers and yelling ""OH SHIT!"". Only Cirque can make me do that.

In total, while not a perfect show, it's fun and worth the money. Alright, $87 is A tad pricey, but you do get what you paid for. I'd recommend it, but I'd see Mystere first. 8\/10

PROS: 
-amazing stage, effects And pyrotechnics
-awesome acting
-THE MUSIC. Nuff said. And that guitarist's double neck guitar was one of the sexiest things I've ever seen
-the wheel of death
-beautiful video projections

-CG battle scene, either restore the actual battle with safer harnesses or brighten the video that plays",6,0,0

I don't want to say too much to spoil it but the theater setup was pretty amazing. Though I would not really recommend sitting too close because the pro is that you get to see the actors face and all the details. but when they are flying above you, it can totally be a neck cramp.

This was my first Cirque du Soleil show, and I'm really glad my sister and my friend recommended that if I were to see only one Cirque show, KA is the one.  And they were right on the mark!

Everything about this show was badass!  Acrobatics, martial arts, cool costumes, pyrotechnics, great music, a touching story, shadow puppets (really cool ones) and a mechanical stage that flips and rotates to change the setting (gotta see to be impressed).

It's not cheap that's for sure, my ticket cost about $135 for 3rd row seats, but it was worth every dollar.  A high quality production.

Speaking of stage, the stage for this performance is amazing. It's awesome seeing something so gigantic being moved in all sorts of positions.

This show is great for everyone. There are parts of the show where it is quite entertaining for children. The fighting scenes are captivating.

Cons:
I was bored out of my mind. If you're expecting something along the lines of Shanghai Acrobatics or Absinthe, don't.

I give KA props for the spectacular set (incredible moving stage), beautiful costume design and makeup, but unfortunately there are hardly any difficult acrobatic acts until the very end of the show. I was so bored I fell asleep until the aerial straps and wheel of death acts came on stage, which were pretty much the last 10 minutes. The rest of the show was just performers gesturing towards each other, throwing sticks, or climbing up and down the moving stage....the opposite of excitement. I wanted get up and leave at the silly starfish and seaturtle scene.

Personally for me there is only so much aesthetics can do. And while alot of people love Cirque exactly because of the magical costumes\/grand sets\/makeup, I couldn't handle the same monotonous fluffiness for 1.5 hours. I was hoping for more excitement in the form of acrobatics which sadly did not come.",9,2,1

It's different from the tradional Cirque Du Soleil in that it's more of a artsy story than showing off jaw dropping skills over loud music.  The stage and the art is amazing.  I may even have to say that if you can only watch one show in Vegas, it should be this one.

As other reviews state, it's true that compared to 5 years ago, they seemed a little trimmed down.  No sand on the stage, the village show (martial arts, etc.) isn't as sharp, no jumping tree stomps, and I can swear the death wheel guy looked like he was going to die 5 years ago (which was better).  That said, this show is still a great show to watch.

We attended the show last year in September and had meant to write a review. We purchased tickets in advance thru Travel Zoo and had a Summer discount. I think it was $88 plus tax for each ticket. It was pretty much front row seats towards at the far left section. 

As I was standing in line to pick up my tickets at Will-Call, I overheard the cashier giving walk-in guests low rates on the day of show. Lower than what I paid for. $70 plus tax. Wtf. It's probably for seats in the back of theatre but still. If I would've known, I would have waited and purchase mines on the day of. But it's too late and the show could've sold out. Who knows.

I had wanted to change seats because of the negative reviews for front row seats. I bought the tickets before reading Yelp. A lot of people are saying to sit towards the back of theatre to see everything and I was bummed out that I bought front row tickets; thinking these are awesome seats at $88 each. The cashier told me no. I can't change seats. If I do, it will be more expensive than what I paid online. In my mind, yeah right! You just quoted that person $70. Now you're over-quoting me?! Ridiculous! I said forget it. I will keep my seats and took my tickets. 

Well, our seats were 4 rows from the front at the far left side. It wasn't that bad as people think.

The acrobats in KA were either new or poorly trained because one of them missed a stunt and when he finally got it right he cheered for himself. I felt extremely nervous after seeing him miss his mark. Most of the show was choreographed fights, shadow puppets and love scenes which were extremely boring. I was waiting for the momentum to pick up. About 30 minutes into it I realized it was not going to get any better and unfortunately I was right.

The other Cirque shows usually involve a circular stage whereby the audience sits around the stage and the acrobats showcase a full-on production and make complete use of the air space. This one lacked creative use of all the open air space in the theater and limited the show to just the front stage area. 

Best scene: when the main platform tilts and rotates and warriors begin to attack by shooting arrows at the tilting platform. The acrobats then use those ""arrows"" to hover around the stage.",0,0,0

Why this show is better than the rest?
1) This one actually has a story line

4) The songs and story line are very touching.
5) The costumes are festive and catches your attention
6) Wherever you sit you are going to have a great view. Everybody is in costume and may sometimes be in your aisle.

Overall 
5 Stars

Gold medal - Moving Stage
Silver medal - Exciting show
Bronze medal - Great lighting 

I've seen almost all of the Vegas Cirque Du Soleil shows and this has to be one of my favorite.  The worst being the Cirque Du Soleil, Criss Angel, Believe show.  Avoid Believe at all cost.  I somehow managed to fall asleep watching Believe, after paying $80 for my tickets.  $80 to sleep in a nice theather = no good! 

Now back to the good, KA.....................

This show was amazing.  It had a moving stage floor.  Yes, moving stage floor!!  The entire floor of the stage would move up, down, side ways, slanted (fully slanted at a 90 degree angle), while the actors would still be standing on the slanted floor.  How? Magic or was it invisible ropes?  Believe what you want to believe, but it was truely an amazing sight.  The actors would move and use the stage floor to manipulate all their movements.  It was unbelieveably exciting and a joy to watch.  My eyes were crying, ""MORE MORE!!""

The show was very exciting full of love and action.  There was many cool fighting acts.  

The great lighting with the stage and the show together made an unbelievable show.  I loved the show, so much.

I would recommend this show to anyone looking for a Cirque Du Soleil show to watch.  This is one of their best in my opinion.

HAPPY CIRQUING!!",3,2,3

The Good: Overall awesome show, talented performers, some great ariel stunts, cool special effects, and a crazy stage with moving parts.   

The Bad: Slow dull moments at times, not quite enough acrobatics or human stunts, under utilized star talent, and just average martial arts demonstrations. 

The Ugly: The men's wigs...they all had 80's Rockstar hair, gross!

Tickets are on the pricy side due to the stunts and risky acrobats found in a traditional cirque de soleil. One can find deals at the discount ticket booths around Las Vegas. 

This show arrangement runs similar to others offering a picture for payment before entering theatre. Staff help direct you to the seats fairly quickly. They even seat you during the middle of the show. It's incredibly distracting from the shows entirety.

The show has an elaborate stage which is synced to the story. Lots of acrobatics and choreographed show. Few mini stories and a main story which are easy to follow.

I love that there are speakers in the headrests - that extra base and surround sound environment really makes you feel more aware of what is going on in the show.  I love when the speakers pick up the shooting arrows.  It sounds so awesome - like they are zooming by your ears.  The music is also really cool - lots of drums and even a heavy metal electric guitar song.

The stage feels like a futuristic Matrix or Mad Max environment.  This is a saga about a royal brother and sister that get separated when marauding tribesmen kill their parents during a summer festival.  There is a distinct Asian theme to this cirque.  The tribes people are tattooed like Hawaiians or the Yakuza, there is a Kabuki looking evil lord, and lots of Chinese style acrobatics.  The boy is guarded by the main family warrior who is this yoked shirtless hottie cakes with dreadlocks and a spear.  The girl is guarded by their overweight big breasted nanny and some clowns.  

The stage is a 360 degree revolving platform that moves horizontally and vertically.  The floor at several points is the wall.  There is this one scene where they are at the beach and then the beach turns into the wall and a zillion pounds of sand slides off of it along with one of the clowns who drops about 30 feet down.  There is another scene where the stage is supposed to be a mountain and the girl and her entourage is trying to climb to the top to escape the evil peeps.  As they are climbing up the wall there are evil people shooting arrows at them from the audience which in turn makes pegs pop out of the wall to simulate arrows sticking out of the wall.  The climbers swing in really pretty circles around the pegs.  The girl gets to the top and is sheltered by these Mongolian looking people.  It is now winter.  

Meanwhile the boy and his stud warrior guardian hang out and make really cool shadow puppets.  They subsequently get caught by the tribesmen and get put in wheel shaped cages.  In the process there are a couple of other scenes including this one where guys are running and jumping rope on the outside of these hamster wheels that are revolving like a Ferris wheel about 30 feet in the air.  That may be the best acrobatics scene in the whole show.  While in captivity, the boy falls in love with the tribes' princess, who looks a little butch.  She releases him so that he can find his sister and then she does a cool baton twirling dance.  

The sister also falls in love with some dude in that sheer Britney Spears outfit with the little diamonds all over it and a red thong and they flirt with each other while flying around the stage from one of those hanging sheets.  Visually it is really pretty, but the dude looks like he might be a little light in the loafers with his long flowing hair and rhinestone outfit.

I don't know how the brother and the sister reunite, but they do and they regroup and go to war against the evil Kabuki lord with the help of the tribes' princess' troops.  I forgot to mention that somewhere along the way the boy rescues the princess' dad from being captured by Kabuki face.  The bad people that tried to capture the boy and the girl are now on their side.  They go to war; the stage is again a wall and of course they win, get their kingdom back and the boy and the girl get married and all of the costumes are really pretty. 

Some other cool scenes include a boat on the stormy waters, an insect inspired rain forest act with swinging acrobats, and a flying contraption made to look like a bird that is operated by 5 people.  This is a must see theater production.  It was so worth the $340 we spent on tics",3,2,2

The whole show was beautiful and captivating. Before the show, they had crew come out and entertain before the show started, which was nice. The show itself was really funny and compelling. They have a storyline which keeps the show interesting, and not just about the flying people or dancing. 

We sat in the the second row from the stage which had its pros and cons. Though you are super close to the stage, it can be bad. We missed some stuff since we were so close and had to crane our necks to see the flying acrobats. I think the best seats are probably the ones in the middle of the theater.

I'm certain that anyone interested in Kà could readily read about much of it via Wikipedia, but I think it bears repeating that this is not your standard Cirque du Soleil show.  It's the only one of the lot that I've ever seen with any sort of serious plot that ties together the numerous acts; it's also the only show I've seen where the musicians aren't visually present throughout the performance.

Highlights of the gig:

- The exorbitantly elaborate set, including the two giant LCD panels that swivel and move in a seemingly limitless number of configurations; the rods that piston in and out are like gravy to the already stunningly satisfying technomagic that these mobile stages proffer

- The Wushu and various other martial arts featured -- I've always had a fascination with Kung Fu (although, oddly, it's one of the few martial arts I've never studied) and it lends itself supremely well to the grace and artistry of Cirque

- The shadow puppets took me on a roller coaster of emotions.  Err... about as emotional as I get from watching a show, at least.  From confusion to curiosity, then into laughter, sadness, and elation.  This act, though brief, was possibly my favorite.

- The magnificent majorette, although she did drop a baton just once during her act, was still jaw-dropping.  I marched all through high school and college, and my undergrad Big 10 band currently has a phenomenal award-winning majorette.  This was better.  Her precision, poise, and talent easily outshone anything of the like I've ever seen before

And although I'd consider it a splurge, I will say that the boy was absolutely right about going for the expensive tickets (which ran around $180 at the time we were in Vegas).  Being in the front of the balcony in the second row gave us an unobstructed view of all of the action - performers swinging wildly in from the wings, all of the flames and fantastic action on the main stage, and plenty of entertainment before the show, with acrobats skidding across the wall in front of us, not ten feet away.

I wouldn't head back in a year, or even two... but Kà is easily a show that I'd recommend checking out at least once - drop the dough for a memorable, one-of-a-kind evening that you'll be sure to rave about as you exit the theater, if not much much longer.",12,2,14

We even had great seats (in the middle, not too close not too far) and the show was slow, boring and confusing.  There were some decent fight scenes and some talented performers but overall it was incredibly boring.  I can't beleive this was made by cirque de solieil and someone actually put it together and said yes this is what I want.  There was a period of about 45 minutes in the middle where we almost fell asleep and wanted to walk out.  The only reason we didn't is beacause I heard so many great things so I kept waiting for it to get better.  It was a joke.  We were in disbelief when it ended.  I felt like I was robbed of my money.  I had a locals discount of $130 for 2 tickets and I still felt robbed.  I wouldn't have even enjoyed it if I paid $20 per ticket.  It was that bad.  Seriously, I have always loved Cirque de soleil shows but this one was so boring.  There were hardly any acrobatics or anything that you couldn't see in a B rated kung fu movie.

I see every show that comes to town, and I have seen most of the traveling shows. This is one of the few Cirque resident shows that I have seen. With that being said, I liked it... But there have been much better. 
The set design in the theater was cool and had a bit of a steampunk vibe to it. The stage rotated and made some scenes extraordinarily cool. 

I had a little trouble following the storyline. Most cirque shows have a loose plot line or theme, but I usually can follow along. This one I had a little trouble and couldn't tell some characters apart from our seats. We had pretty good seats as well.  I expected more acrobatics or performances.  I feel like other shows have more.
Now that I look back on the show,
I think they relied on the motion of the floor for some of the cool acts and that should be recognized as an aerial stunt more than just a cool scene.  The chase and battle scene were awesome scenes and visually very cool. At the time though I didn't recognize them as performances like a circus, I viewed it as choreography.  These had a lot of skill and should be given the credit that they deserve, but at the time I was left feeling the show was a little lacking outside of those scenes.

The theater ambiance is very cool - the moment you walk in, you immediately sense that they're creating a new world for you to be immersed in. I felt as though I was walking into a coal mine on the Forest Moon of Endor (Star Wars geeks will get the allusion), and the cat calls by the performers gives a real sense of depth and huge space that you're now a part of.

From the moment the show starts, you know it's going to be different than any experience you've ever had before, and it will be. I don't want to give away all the suprises you'll be in store for, but let's just say that you're going to be hit with a completely new dimension of performance, and you won't need 3D glasses to enjoy it. Anyone up closer to the stage will really have a great show (although I'd recommend you do NOT sit in the first 10-15 rows, as you'll be too close and not have as good a vantage point as those behind you).

I was most struck by the boat prop, and how everything about the scene made me feel as if I'd really been transported into their world. The scene was GORGEOUS, very moving and very dramatic. I was left with a real sense of the community being presented to me, and the easy-going and happy lives of the players... and then, much to my surprise, drama! 

Indeed, I didn't expect for Cirque to present such a brilliant and moving story, but they delivered in spades. I really wanted this to keep going, to follow the characters as if I was reading a book. If this performance was a movie, I'd want a sequel, and another, and another. It was really brilliant.

Cirque's costumes, as always, are genius. And they always find a new way to suprise and impress you. KA is no exception. It definitely delivered a fun experience.

That said, there was one thing I was disappointed about. The first disappointment was probably more because this is a stage show that gets performed night after night after night by the same cast, whom it seems some might have been bored of repeating the same thing over and over. (I had the same problem with the Penn & Teller show at the Rio - they seemed bored from over-repetition). But I think that's a criticism of the nature of these Vegas shows, not a criticism of KA itself.

My first Cirque experience was Dralion, performed under the big tent in San Francisco, and it completely blew me away - perhaps the most powerful and awesome performance experience I've ever had. KA doesn't match the intensity and power of Dralion, but it definitely has its own unique flair, it's own brilliant new innovations, and will definitely entertain you, no question about it.

Tickets can be expensive, but I urge you to dig in and get seats closer to the stage, but avoid the first 15 rows or so. The sweet spot is in the rows immediately behind them. Trust me. You'll love it there.",1,0,0

The show was amazing, the actors were superb and kept me entertained the entire time.

After an accident last year, they've changed the last big scene. With the new scene the show feels cheap and unfinished. I wish they would rework it to create another impressive ending.

The story was a little bit tough to follow at times, as there is no (English) spoken dialect, but the choreography and stage effects kept us entertained the entire show.  There were a couple of slower parts which seemed to drag on a little longer than I would have liked, but they were quickly followed by some dramatic scenes with pretty amazing special effects.  Throw in a couple of funny scenes, and we were left feeling very well entertained.  Even my boyfriend liked it, and he is not generally the ""show-going"" type.

Unfortunately, I was sitting next to a couple who seemed more interested in playing grab-ass, whispering, kissing, and giggling with each other than they were in actually watching the show... so my experience may have been tainted a bit by my desire to punch both of them in the face.

The story was very engrossing and the music was exciting throughout. I do agree with many other Yelps who disliked the show being that there were very few acrobatics, but the few stunts that they've pulled were entertaining nonetheless in my opinion. Ka was like a very fast paced, action filled movie. It was beautiful at time, sad at time, funny at time, an emotional rollercoaster once you get into it. I was impressed by how well the performers interacted with its dynmatic stage.

The theater is very big and nice, and so is the stage. Obviously, the farther back the less you see, but it seemed like you could get a decent view of the acts from anywhere you are. Try checking on discount websites to see if you can get deals on closer seats.

Acts: Aside from LOVE, this show is also visually pleasing. It's not one of the more colorful ones,  but the fact that the stage is constantly moving keeps you constantly engaged. Your heart skips beats when acrobats are hanging from rods and moving from one to the other. It's like a human pinball machine, or a human plinko if any of you guys watch the Price is Right. Each act is very different from the other, and they get more and more daring and impressive, which I felt was something lacking in ""O"" and other Cirque shows.

The only thing I would complain about is the price of photography. They do this thing where they take a picture of you, airbrush\/photoshop it to make you look stunning, then try to sell you a booklet (with like, 3 photos in it) for $40. It just makes you sad, mannnnnnn.

The final scene was mesmerizing, as it felt like the audience had a birds-eye view, but the performers were performing the show entirely on an almost vertical surface. Simply brilliant!

That's really close to the stage. I could feel the heat from the fire stunts and also the breeze from the acrobats swinging by. I was in awe. There were times when my heart raced because I was nervous for the casts whom were doing extremely difficult stunts. The backdrops were like magic. Everything on the set moved and looks realistic. I was so amazed that something like KA could even be created. This show is beautiful, romantic, lots of action, visually dynamic, extravagant...grand...and is the definition of perfection!

But why didn't I give this show 5 stars. Truthfully it's hard to explain. In the end, I guess I only gave it a 4(well more like 4 1\/2) stars because I guess I expected more from it. Maybe I just overhyped myself to believe it was gonna be superb. Now the reason for this is because I saw Cirque's O at the bellagio, and THAT Cirque show was purely perfect, so when I hear people compare these 2 as the best ones and that they were hard to say which one was better, I thought it would be just as good if not better. But for me it wasn't close. O was far and away better to me.
   But, like any review, this is just the opinion of one man. Me. I just never felt the emotions and the feeling of being in another world like O made me feel. and I think that is the reason I dont give Ka as high a praise as i would liked to have. Ok with that being said, I still thought Ka was highly incredible. The acrobatics were insane, but what sets Ka apart is without a doubt the moving stage and the incredible visuals. I had pretty decent seats in the middle near the right side, But much like all the other Cirque shows, Any seat is a good seat. Ka was the last Cirque show I really wanted to see.

Their ""pre-game"" show (or whatever you call it) was really amusing.  The actual show was kinda odd and confusing, though.  Sure, the performances were great, but the plot was not well-developed or even interesting!  From what I've heard, Kà is supposed to be the most plot-heavy of all the Cirque du Soleil shows!  yikes...

Kà is basically a story of two imperial twins who are separated and by an event and they each go on their own adventure where they make friends and fight enemies.  But whenever they speak (which is not often), they are talking in some gobbledygook language.  The stunts are pretty neat, especially combined with the fancy floating-stage-thing.

At one point, each person in my group had fallen asleep which turned this into the most expensive nap ever.

 The show relies too heavily on the effects and lacked the awe-worthy performances that they are known for. The ""great acrobatics"" and ""physical feats"" that cirque is known for downgraded to people jumping up and down while attached to strings the whole time. Nothing amazed me. The twirling acrobats, I've seen that at other shows but better. The spinning wheel was in Kooza and was better there.

The story follows a prince and princess running from an evil character looking to capture them.  Acrobatics, martial arts, and aerial feats are all incorporated.  The action runs across the stage, and above the stage.  They make use of mobile platforms to create illusions that are really a wonder to see.

We realize that a performer died during the final epic fight scene back in 2013. The problem is that over a year later, they don't warn you that the very reason to see KA has been replaced with a pre-recorded, CGI performance on a what amounts to a giant TV screen. It doesn't help that the projection is dim and blurry either.  We did not pay nearly $300 to see an out of date, low-res video game cut scene. I've watched way better cut scenes on my PS3. 

They eviscerated the show by removing what was once the primary selling point. It is even still sold as if the final scene is live by having advertising and promo material still featuring scenes of it from older performances. Nice bait-and-switch. 

Someday maybe they'll do the right thing and redesign the show to make it worthwhile again. Until then, see any other Cirque show. In fact, see one two or three times before seeing this one. And definitely don't pay full price.",2,0,0

 Still a fun show with some surreal moments and bits of comedy mixed into the action.  However I am perplexed by their decision to replace the final battle with a poor projection.  I understand the reason being the fatal accident last year but other parts of the show use the same wiring and harnesses and the main issue really is the poor quality of the projection.  It's out of focus and seemingly low quality, it really detracts from the overall enjoyment of the show.  Honestly it ruins it.  Instead of a big epic finale, you get a long boring bad quality projection that you can't tell what is happening so you just wait for it to end.  I hope the producers of the show read these reviews and find a way to rework the show with a different scene instead of using that awful video.  It completely cheapened the expensive experience and I cannot recommend the show until they make changes.  I would have appreciated a note citing the change to the production before we purchased tickets.",7,0,2

This will be a hard review to write, because it comes on the heels of a tragedy.  Most of us have heard by now of the tragic fall by the performer in the recent performance of KA, this, should not be ignored or taken lightly.  It is a sad thing and my prayers go out to the family of the performer including her performance family.  

With that being said, something else needs to be said.  I had long put off seeing KA on my Vegas trips in deference to other Cirque shows...Love, O, Zarkana, Mystere, etc.  

KA was always that show I denied because I wanted to leave myself KA, sort of like leaving that last bite on the plate of your favorite ingredients.  You're saving it for last because you know it will be the best.  

But the accident apparently changed everything.  In lieu of what happened, Cirque changed the entire finale of their show from a high flying sword fight to a convoluted marriage ceremony featuring some truly horrible facial acting.  

I wouldn't care about any of this had this been announced or stated in any way whatsoever when I was purchasing my expensive tickets.  You see, I purposefully asked no only my concierge but also numerous representatives that I spoke with about whether the show had changed or not and they assured me that no, the running time was still the same. 

What they failed to mention was that indeed, the entire finale had changed, and that, a story line that is building you up to something remarkable is no more.  

If you needed to change your story because the show is too dangerous, I get it, fine, I have no qualms with changing the ways things are done because of the risk to the performers.  But when your entire reputation is built upon talk of a finale's to top all finale's, and when you promptly delete this from your program without telling the people who are buying the tickets, you are pulling off an elaborate trick.  

Indeed, the show is devoid of stunts with the finale gone...the best one that Cirque pulls off with the current version of the show is the high flying BAIT AND SWITCH which is exactly what happened on our recent visit.  People all around us in front and back sort of just looked at each other when the show ended as if to say...""Was that it?""  

Yep.  That's it.  Honesty will save your business...not extended amounts of Buffoonery by your ice fishermen.    

Stay away from this show until they can figure out how to salvage what once was...or, LOWER YOUR PRICES TO PROPERLY REPRESENT the new show you are staging.",16,0,1

I didn't know what to expect from ""Ka"".  There's always a certain idea of a whimsical, fanciful trip to be had during the show, but you always wonder what each new show will specifically bring to the table.

The stage itself is impressive.  From looking like a ship as you're walking into the theater, to a theater that looks vaguely reminiscent of the Ewok Village from ""Return of the Jedi"", the setting is elaborate.

The show itself is wonderful.  I do not believe in divulging plot details out of courtesy, but even a ""Cirque"" veteran like myself was left saying ""Wow"" a few times.  The level of technical detail left my jaw hanging open.  For a seemingly small stage, they manipulate the setting in ways that I didn't think were possible.

Of course, the costumes are great, the music is wonderful, as are the stunts and the overall storyline.  While there are certain themes seemingly presented in all ""Cirque"" shows, they still have a tendency to surprise, from epic and elaborate, to unassuming and charming.

""Mystere"" is a beautiful show with its surreal dreamscapes.  ""Love"" captures me with the music and my general Beatles fandom.  ""Ka"" is simply breathtaking as it seems the most daring and (dare I say) dangerous looking stunts so far.  It's is well worth the viewing, and highly recommended.",7,1,3

After grabbing one or two 32 ounce G&T's, after walking in the sheer magnitude of the showroom is evident...or so you think.

When that curtain rises and things begin to happen and it is then you ask yourself if your eyes are playing hell with you.  It is then that you realize just how big this production is.

Not wanting to give anything away I will say that the spectacle of stunt performances, special effects, music, costumes and the ohhhhh so impressive multi functioning, rotating, shape shifting monster of a stage is pretty damn incredible.

In addition to the sights and sounds, you'd swear you could also smell & taste the performers. (don't try touching or you'll be touched and forcibly removed).  This specially designed theater at the MGM Grand for Cirque du Soleil has the most sophisticated stage mechanics I've ever seen on a massive scale and in 3 dimensions.  You could also say it was in the 4th dimension because you are transported to a mystical land removed from time & space.

This is a rarity for a Cirque Du Soleil performance that has a nice back story.  KÀ tells a tale of good & evil, of a prince & princess in a far away, exotic land.  The story, performance, set pieces, music and costume cultural influences are clearly Asian and African with that unique Cirque twist.  Crane your neck up, down, left and right or you'll miss a lot of the action as aerialists are flying over your heads, performers pop up in the aisles next to your seat and disappear again into the pit of the stage.

One disappointment of the show was the vertical battle scene, which was just a virtual projection on the vertical stage.  The live scene was removed from the performance due to a fatal accident of a performer that fell last year.  It is sad that someone died during a performance, but it wouldn't have been noticeable in the current show if they had restaged or replaced the scene to make it safer.  That thrill of danger is what we've come to expect from their shows.

The ticket prices weren't bad since it was a Monday night. I paid $100 per seat and we were in the front row. 

Before the show, there is a professional photographer that takes pictures of you and you can buy them once the show is over. It was expensive but I loved how the pictures turned out so I bought them. They came in a black, embellished folder that opens up. 

You can buy drinks at the show and bring them into the theater which is awesome.

Yes. Maybe this was the main reason for our coming to Vegas... to watch a Cirque Show.. and it was amazinggggg. 

The theatre is gigantore. It's huge! And because I wasn't down with throwing down big bucks... our seats were near the back. But it was great! Because the stage rotates 360, and even goes parallel straight up your breath will be taken away more than once! 

Make sure you come early and get seated. They do a small preshow and have people flying through the theatre. Warning... when you try getting into the theatre, there isn't a line. People just mash up into the doorway. So no need to go stand in line. Go towards the wall, there's never  a line for that.

Thank you KA for making our trip soooo memorable. Watch the later show... there tends to be less people! If you stay at MGM you may also get a 2 for 1 deal with a player's card.

Minus one star, for some annoying people in the crowd.

The story line was good, and the entire theater had a Steampunk feel to it. The cast members have a lot of moments where they're very close to the audience. Before and during the show's start, there were acrobats dangling from the theater's pillars and swinging back and forth over our heads. They also shot arrows back and forth at each other between opposite sides of the theater. The villains of the show are fairly menacing tattooed acrobats. The use of the stage, music, and fight scenes help put the audience right in the action and invest them in the story. The stage moves and rotates throughout the show, and is used cleverly to add suspense and surprise. At one point, it's almost a complete vertical wall acting as a peg board, while the protagonists leap and fight to escape those chasing them. A lot of the stunts were pretty dangerous. If you're worried about not being entertained, it would take a giant snob to not get at least some surprise out of the danger involved in some of the skits. There's comedic relief, of course, which is absolutely one of the best parts.The ending had a really simplistic and beautiful fireworks display on stage.  I feel Cirque did a great job with balance and projecting a simple, but enticing story with this show. While it might not live up to the the hype of ""O"", we were really pleased with our choice. 

While it is true that Cirque tends to recycle acts and use them again and again, this show in particular added new flair and dimension to acts I've seen before in their other shows.  We managed to sneak down to get closer to the action, since it was a less busy day and there were empty seats.

Although it is not a ""typical"" Cirque style show with acrobatics, high wire acts, juggling plates, etc. This is more like an an amazing play that has heart racing acrobatics as part of the story. 

And trust me, it is truly amazing! The show begins before the seats are even full.
Performers jumping, chanting, and swinging around the incredible structural set that encompasses the entire theater. This is just to set the mood!

Then with a BOOM! The show starts! Sit back and enjoy!

I guess it's a good thing there are so many different shows so we can all be happy!

I've seen KA twice.  The first time was several years ago with a group of friends for the late show after a long day, big meal and some tasty beverages.  Needless to say, between the late hour (etal) and the very loud music, I found myself dozing through most of it which was super disappointing.  mostly because I paid for the show and also because people always ask how I liked it and I had to admit I snoozed most of the way through it.  Darn that loud music!  It lulls me to sleep!  So, THANK YOU MyVegas for having some free tix!  

The husband and I decided to go again and asked the parents along and we all got to see it for free.  THIS time I selected the early showing and THIS time, I stayed awake (even with the loud lulling musica).  Here's what I like about KA, the sets are freaking awesome and amazing.  I really think that is the best thing about this show; they are very beautiful and interesting.  i also like that this show has a story line.  Unlike some, I like a story in my show and shows like Zarkana that is all about jumping and flipping around without a story can be boring to me.  This is probably because I've seen too many of these shows and they all start blurring together after a while.  But, this one does have a story.  Not saying it's an amazing story, but I liked it.  Also, I love the loud music, lulling as it may be.  I'm not a big martial arts fan, so the fight scenes might be a plus or a minus for some; I enjoyed them as part of the story, but I could have done with less of all that.

Overall, its a pretty good show with decent pacing and a good duration.  For free it's a no brainer.  I'd recommend.",0,1,1

The time finally came that we were convinced by friends to have a Cirque Du Soleil experience, and they recommended KA for our first time. 

I was not disappointed! In fact, I was pleasantly surprised when I was drawn into the story and all the different ways they used the mechanical stage. It almost became like a game to watch what all they could do with the stage. 

The seats have speakers built into them, which we didn't notice at first, but it makes the sounds amazing and definitely contributes to the experience of being drawn in.

First star is for the opening sequence. Just prior to the show the audience is treated to some acrobatic antics, and even a comedic reminder to stow the electronics. Paired with helpful staff in costume and character helping you to your seats, and a breathtaking stage to take in sets your heart pumping for a great show. The opening scenes don't disappoint. The martial arts in the first couple scenes are amazing to watch, and soon you are treated to a boat scene that is also fun to watch. 

Second star is for great acrobatics with the ""death wheel"" (you'll know it when you see it), and some more cool action sequences to close out the show. 

Third star is for the stage, which is a character all to itself. A massive monolithic stage that is on some sort of hydraulic mechanism that allows it to move, rotate, and lean in amazing angles further shows off the athleticism and skill of the actors as they use the stage to show a variety of talents. The stage can also be lowered completely out of site allowing for cool aerial acrobatics as well. 

Now for the last two stars that this show lacks. First off, you better listen carefully to the few lines of narration at the beginning of the show because that's all you'll get. While it does give the outline of the plot I still found it extremely difficult to follow the story line, and in fact there were several scenes that seemed ponderously slow and even repetitive without advancing the story in meaningful ways.  You never really understand why the enemy attacks, but they attack again and again, and normally in the same repetitive fashion. There are also two scenes, the beach and the shadow puppets, that are awkward and feel completely out of place. 

Second, with the exception of the first 10-15 mins and 5-10 mins towards the end, the show's acrobatics seemed to be just ""OK"". There were ""wows"" and ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" in each section there, but often there were only a few and sometimes featured too early in a scene and repeated then without the same wow factor. With such an impressive stage and hints in the pre show antics of ways to use the stage and even the space above the audience in amazing fashion, the show itself left me with the sense that there was so much more that could've been. 

All in all I was entertained but I can't say I enjoyed it, especially in comparison to other Cirque du Soleil shows and expectations. It's worth seeing for the stage if you can get a good price, but be prepared to feel like you over invested 90 mins of time. In another city and without the CDS mystique it would probably be amazing and awe inspiring, but in a Las Vegas world where ""Too Much"" is often ""Just enough"", I felt like Ka was just a little lacking.",2,0,1

Tickets were for a Saturday night and they only ran us about $60 something each. Don't ask me how we got it for that price but I was blessed enough to be taken to this show. Of course I had to put out at the end of the night (it's worth the pay off).

I don't think there are any bad seats in the house. We were in section 201, DD and it was fine. The stage and action is big enough for you to see even in the back row. You'll be quite impressed with the rotating, shifting, vertical rising stage deck. Sitting way in the front might give you a cramp in your neck because you'll be continuously looking upwards.

There's a simple story line to follow and not just a bunch of random monkey acts put together. The show runs under two hours and there wasn't an intermission in between.

You'll see it if you see the big dragon head. I have to say, I was pretty amazed by the performance. Everyone was simply amazing from their costumes to acts. My favorite character was the nursemaid. She is so funny. Also, the stage platform, sandcliff deck, is my favorite. I was confused as to how the ""arrows"" stuck onto the stage but all was explained when I attended the KA demo, which they have every Tuesday and Saturday at 11am.

I suggest going to the demo after the show so you can conclude some thoughts. By going to the demo, they give you a gift if you purchased tickets to the show, and a 15% off merchandise at the store. If you saw the show a few days before the demo, you can still get the gift. Just show them your tickets (that's what I did). The gift is a car charger and headphones. Pretty cool souvenir. 

KA did leave me a little confused at the storyline. I understand most of what happened but there were some scenes that confused me. Like the wheel of death... yeah idk what happened there.

As for seating, if you are sitting towards the side (not center) I suggest avoiding the aisle seats. For the first quarter of the show, the late people walking up the stairs trying to find their seats, blocked my view. I was so mad because I was missing all the action and they were taking a really long time to sit down. It also didn't help that the usher walked up and down and blocked my view too.",6,2,4

I was never drawn to the idea of spending large amounts of money just to see people do tricks in the area and dance around, but after seeing this awesome show I'm now hooked on Cirque du Soleil shows!  I want to see more!!!

What made this show good was that it had a central storyline.  I've seen only one other Cirque du Soleil show, the Love by the Beatles show at the Mirage, which didn't really seem to have much of a plot to it, more like random music videos.  I don't want to spoil the story so I won't say too much...but there was a narrator in the beginning of the show who said a few words to set up the storyline, and after that there were no words spoken in English the entire show.  It's pretty cool how you can still understand the central plot when no words are spoken!  That just speaks to the complexity and greatness of the show (and I guess that's why tickets are so pricy).

The stage is awesome (it moves!) so they played on that factor a lot for their crazy stunts.  Sometimes they would be doing ridiculous tricks and I would look closer and realize that they're not harnessed to ropes!  WHAT?!

The theme was also cool, with tribal-like crazy costumes for everyone including the ushers.  Love that everyone stuck to the theme so much!

I didn't find the martial-arts influenced acrobatics nearly as exciting as the more traditional acrobatics I've come to know and love because of Cirque productions.

For me the best part of the show was the stage which was absolutely amazing -- it's giant and moves in what seem to be all directions.  Hard to describe, but it just seems like a triumph of engineering to be able to fluidly move such a large object so quickly and diversely.

Is Ka a great show?  I don't think so.  Is it a bad show?  No.  It's just not the show I wanted.  I would personally recommend checking out a different Cirque show over this one, but by all means, check this one and out and decide for yourself if you're interested.",0,0,0

The audience was moving about the theater throughout the entire show.  The show also allows people to roll in late.  I found that very distracting.

My thoughts:

- Very comfortable seats!

- A little too much fighting-oriented for my taste.

- The hand-shadow part was touching and beautiful and clever.

- Call me a dunce, but I really didn't follow the story line at all.  Okay, two sides... some bad people trying to kill the others, but that's about all I grokked.  And the Cirque folks are too damn cheap to give out even a small program?  That's a piss-off after such pricey tickets.

- Yes, the stage was unbelievable!  I know it may sound silly to gush about a moving platform, but... really, you won't appreciate how amazing this is and how much it adds to the performance until you see it.

- Costumes, music... very impressive.

- Theatre... oddly not so impressive.  Except for the amazing stage and comfy seats, pretty uninspiring.  

By the way, I was easily able to obtain tickets the day of (albeit not-outstanding seats), so if you're not picky, you probably don't have to worry about booking far in advance.  Then again, this was for a Tuesday night, so if you're arriving on a weekend, your mileage may vary.",2,0,0

The main feature of Ka is it's moving stage. It is truly a triumph of engineering. The stage rises, falls, twists, turns, and contorts in every which direction. This makes it all the more impressive that the performers move seamlessly and in perfect coordination with it. Unlike O, which only vaguely hints at a story, Ka has a very strong narrative. It's about a prince and a princess who are on a journey of survival and are trying to restore their kingdom. Throughout the show, I cheered, laughed, and even almost cried at one point. 

Where Ka falls short of the standard O sets is the physical feats. Not that they weren't impressive, but the acrobatics performed in Ka lacked the style and boldness of those performed in O. The one exception is the dude near the end of the show who was jump roping on the giant wheel-looking contraption. THAT was impressive.

Regardless, the costumes are gorgeous, the makeup is intricate, the actors are fun, and the rotating stage is a must see!  They use the stage in so many different ways, it's very creative.  

One of the highlights was actually the door guy who was dressed as a KA soldier, I believe?  I talked to him, but he wasn't allowed to speak so instead made gestures.

This was my second Cirque show and I left feeling like I had definitely gotten my money's worth. I agree with other reviewers that the story line has its lulls and the specifics are hard to follow if you don't read a summary before the show. However, it's incredible engineering and technological features combined with the baton-twirling, Wheel of Death jump roping, insane acrobatics characteristic of a Cirque performance can be appreciated even without context. Ka also weaves oriental costumes, capoeira dance, and martial arts into this unique experience. The theatre is huge and built specifically for Ka. It has dynamic, movable stages - one weighs 50 tons, rotates 360 degrees, and tilts from flat to 100 degrees. Once vertical, 80 rods sprout from the platform like a Plinko board staging one of many battle scenes. The story also injects humor into its dramatic soundtrack. The performance runs about 90 minutes. We paid $88 per ticket (after fees) for the second to last row of seats in the theatre, but 15 minutes into the show, we relocated 5 rows up when it was clear there were lots of empty seats. Despite being located nearly as far back from the stage as we could possibly be, we had no problem seeing the performers. Being in the upper level has its advantages in that you can see the entire stage and everything that would otherwise be in your peripheral vision, or above you in the lower level. There are 4 pre-shows beginning when the doors open.

I saw some of the other comments about the show being a little odd, but that's how all the Cirque Du Soleil shows are. It's all part of the experience. Being awed and a little confused all at the same time. 

As for the refreshments of the theater, they have popcorn, candy, soda and alcohol. We purchased the 32 oz. alcoholic drinks because you can get refills for only $10. That's quite a deal. Be careful though, there are no intermissions to the show, so don't drink too much!",1,0,0

I have been to the Broadway's Lion King, Cirque du soleil O, Mystere, Saltimbanco, and Alegria, so I have seen what Cirque's got. Which KA is totally different than the rest. It has a bold story line! If you are first timer at Cirque show, this is not a circus. This is a performance by world class artists, designers, technicians, composers, directors, and of course the performers! 

I hate seeing other reviews saying how it was confusing and this show was for kids... Because to be honest, if you are not a kid then how did you not get the story? Like I said, the story is bold for a cirque show. It is easy to understand if you follow the show. The only reason why it might be confusing is because the scenes change, but just know your characters then you are fine. Someone from the other review said they did not understand what they were saying, this is because in almost all Cirque shows, they are not speaking a language!! It's actually called Cirquish which is basically gibberish mix of different languages. You might hear a word from latin, Japanese, African languages, and such. 

Now for the kids, they would love it too. In fact the first performance I saw from Cirque was the O when I was 9 years old and LOVED it. I still remember the details of how the theater looked, smelt, the performance, and music. [ I found out O uses special aroma for the theater by a company called Aromasys to cover the water smell, which is very elegant and rich smell which I still can not forget and loved. That is why I researched this when I got older because I just loved it so much.]

For those who don't know, the music from all Cirque shows are live. Which you will see in KA on the stage and off the stage. 
The performance itself is very unique and amazing. The stage moving, the performers flying around, acrobats, the music, they are all world class performance. Try to enjoy the whole theater because it is filled with many things going on at once. Pretty much every seat is good because performers are everywhere not only on the stage.

this is the second cirque show i've been to. although the first was about 12 years ago in germany I still rememeber it so I had high expectations for this.  and ka by far exceeded what i had in mind for it.

the mechanics of the performance were out of this world.  this giant 100ft+ stage that was able to silently rotate and interact with the storyline.  it's weird to think of the stage as a character but ka managed to do just that. ridiculous.

the performance itself was just insane.  there are so many scenes going through my mind right now i can't even begin to describe them.  the one to die for performance was by these guys in this human-hampster like contraption rotating it as the did acrobatics in and out of it with no harness.  granted there was an assumed net out of sight i was just inebriated enough to believe for a sec they could fall to their death.  imagine someone trying to jump rope on the frame of a rotating carnival ride.  now imagine that person getting caught in the jump rope mid air seemingly 5 stories from the ground.  spectacular and mind-blowing.

for the cost.. i would have expected to pay and would have paid double to see it.  this will definitely be a redo next time i come to sin city.",0,0,0

I fell in love with this acrobatic troop many years ago when my family took sis and me to our first show at treasure island . And since then, we've seen almost every of their shows on the strip as well as many of their traveling troop shows in SoCal. 

It had been many years since I've been to Vegas but I recently returned to celebrate a friend's birthday . We booked three tickets for Ka via our hotel ( gotta love the $15 per ticket convenience fee charge ).  There are two show times : 7p and 930p. We had to take the 930p due to dinner reservation time . 

We were so excited to see the show which I was pretty sure I had seen many years prior . 

The theatre is beautiful and well organized . We had decent seats and were directed as such. That being said...

The show was bizarre and, gosh, boring . All three of us fell asleep more than a few times ( and this is coming from a yelper who never naps). 

Few notes :

- it felt like we were being told a story by people who were tripping on mushrooms and we, as a sober audience , had no idea what they were trying to say 

- there was no cohesiveness to the story : it felt like a lot of fake fight sequences that seemed excessive and the 'bad' people constantly tying to over take the 'good' people 

-keep in mind that we didn't even know who the heck were the good or bad people 

- there were a few cool parts in the show but again , just a few : won't give them away but only one part came at very end that was awesome and reminded me of the acrobatic shock value cirque offers (it was the two guys in the metal revolving circles)

It was my least favorite show but maybe it's because I'm no longer a kid watching this show . Who knows. All three of us left confused and disappointed though . 

Will this take away from my love of cirque . No way . I still love Cirque and perhaps just saw a show that wasn't fit for me and friends that night . I'd still try another show if I was back in town . 

Again the theatre is cool with wonderful sound (I think each seat has its own surround sound?). The acrobats work hard and I'm sure others enjoyed the show .",7,2,1

There's absolutely nothing like it.  But I have to agree with a fellow reviewer here: There wasn't much of a storyline.  I came with my family: One of us was enthralled by it, while the others actually fell asleep during parts of it, hehe.  Full disclosure: We were jetlagged, but we all agreed certain scenes dragged on for way longer than necessary.

I only liked 3-4 parts of this 90-min. show: The funny beach scene, the shadow puppets, the Tarzan scene (amazing), and maybe the Wheel of Death.

I was expecting more jaw-dropping feats of human strength and flexibility.  A lot of it just seemed to involve actors sliding around the moving stage though.  I'm sure it's no easy task keeping your balance on that rotating platform, but 50% of the show was kind of boring to watch.",3,0,0

They have a harp show near the entrance 15 minutes before the show.  My girlfriend and I only saw a couple minutes because to us it sounded like a bunch of random notes being played.  Okay I guess we are not artistic enough to understand it.  

As soon as we stepped into the theater, I was amazed by its structure.   The technical aspect of the show is also great.  I loved how the main stage kept rotating horizontally and vertically throughout the show.  

However I did not get the storyline clear enough.  They give you very little information about the show and expect you to understand everything going on the stage.

After that, we decided to try to check out as many shows as possible. This would be my 3rd show and I must say, this was the most action packed out of the other two. 

Right when you walk in to the auditorium the place just looks like something crazy is about to go down. They have this big pit at the front of the stage that's spitting up fire. Strange ninja like warriors come out and start looking and crawling around the audience while people are getting situated. Our seats were located in the front of the middle section but in the very last row for disability purposes. My girl had a roll out seat which made it very easy to get in and out of her seat with a broken leg. 

The staff was VERY helpful and attentive to her needs and even gave us better seats than what we originally paid for. After the show, one of the workers followed us out and even stopped traffic so we could get out of the building quickly. We thought that was a very nice gesture.

As for the show, we loved the creative use of the stage and the stunts performed in this show the best. In Love, your more captivated by the music that goes along with the stuns and the visuals. Here you are untangled in this fascinating story that takes place with these amazing transitions used by the stage in various ways, creating these illusions that blow your mind at times. There are a few slow and simple parts but I believe those were transitions to set things up for something epic.

I'm sorry to say that this was the first time I have ever been disappointed in a Cirque production.

Mind you, the theatre set and staging are amazing.  They can do some pretty awesome things with the stage - it rotates, tilts, moves up and down, and does other fun things.  However, I come to Cirque productions to see more than just the stage - no matter how tremendous it is - and that is where this production seemed to fall short.

Perhaps I have become jaded in my years of attending different productions, but aside from a few new items made possible by the stage, most of the stunts and choreography seemed pretty run of the mill for Cirque shows.

Although there are often scenes in Cirque productions that seem disjointed from the rest of the show, this particular show seemed to all of us to just be an amalgam of scenes that were rejected from other shows.

Due to the lack of tourism as result of the current economy, we were able to get fantastic seats (third row center) at a discount rate off from the Cirque du Soleil Society which was very nice, since the regular ticket prices are pretty spendy.

I've seen many productions several times and this is the first I've left not wanting to see again.

Hands down, KA is my favorite. There was a recent accident in which a performer died in the final battle scene, so that was replaced by a video that is blurry and confusing. HOWEVER, I have to say everything else was phenomenal! 

The theater itself is literally breathtaking. When I walked in, I was just overwhelmed with how beautiful it is. The mechanics of the stage is incredible - rotating, spinning, etc. Just incredible. 

I was lucky enough to sit in the center, front middle. I like this more than sitting in the front because I can see the performers running around through the crowd and next to me. This spot is also great since you can get a full 180 view of the show without needing to twist your neck around.

The performance had a great storyline where two royal twins - a male and female - who were separated when the antagonist attacked and how they find their way back together as they come to age, with the help of some allies. It's cheesy, but I still adore it. They have beautiful music and the acrobats just blew me away. I think because of the accident, my review may be different in the fact that this performance was more theatrical than acrobatic. People complain about the finger shadow show but if you are following the storyline, IT MAKES SENSE PEOPLE. The kid, a prince, and his protector are lost in the woods, alone, with just a lantern. In order to calm the young prince down, they do an adorable finger show. 

I definitely spent majority of the show pointing, poking my friends, and whispering, ""oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!"" Only Cirque Du Soleil can make me do that. 

I'll never take stars off because there is no way in hell anyone can do a performance like Cirque Du Soleil can, regardless of the CGI or no storyline or anything. BRILLIANT.

my first las vegas show,
or better yet...my first cirque du soleil show.

man. i wanted to watch more after this.

my friends and i stopped by vegas on our way back to los angeles from a snowboarding trip in utah. we were all pretty beat from days of snowboarding and the long drive. so, we opted for a chill night in vegas by watching a show. we were able to get our hands on some tickets for this show and let me tell you, i was pretty skeptical about spending some big bucks on tickets, but it was well worth it.

from the moment i stepped in to the theater, it was pretty crazy. unfortunate for oneof my friends and i, we had a little complication with our ticketing, because as they were scanning our ticket, i guess it showed up that our seats were taken? anyways, after a couple minutes, we were seated and well on our way through this KA journey.

being my first vegas\/cirque du soleil show, i really didn't know what to expect. all i knew, were there would be a lot of acrobatic stuff. and sure enough, there were.

honestly, while i was watching it, due to my extreme tiredness, i dozed off a couple of times.. BUT NOT BECAUSE IT WAS BORING. i was DEAD tired =\/ sucks for me, my friends informed me afterwards that the parts i dozed off, was the BEST. o well. nevertheless, i was thoroughly impressed by the production. and even missing the best part, i thought it was amazing.

another confession, i didn't understand the story line TOO well. there were parts where i was really confused. but, thanks to MGM, we were watching this show on TV back in our room. they were showing like a ""making of KA"" show, and it clarified a lot of stuff for me. watching that, made ka even better.

go watch it.

but, if you really want to know what i liked, its the part with the wheels, and then the chairs you're sitting on has speakerphones. totally tripped me out. hahah and, also. i was on this trip with a bunch of engineers, so we were looking at the mechanics of staging and such. man, it was pretty crazy. i don't know how they did all that rotating, and effects biznazz. tiight.

KA, is bleeping fantastic. Is more than a show is more like an experience of a lifetime! No show has the rotating stage in which performers utilize in such a skilled and clever way. I have seen this show twice in the last few years. Both times unforgettable. 

This is a show worth the money spent.

Perfect show for the family as well!

The venue is set up nice, roomy theatre style seats in which you have space, not dry humping legs with the person sitting next to you. Not really any bad seats in this venue. Not only stage presentation but also arial acts as well, sitting in the front rows is NOT neccessary for this show. I could feel the fire and ice from the stage 10 rows away which was perfect seating in my opinion.

The stage, the scenery, the costumes all amazing. But when looking at the video for this show, it looked really action-packed and it was not to say the least. Besides two guys who jumped on spinning cages and maybe one fight scene, it was all a ton of people just swinging around. I agree with another user when he stated that it was hard to follow as well as one of the scenes presents a almost naked man covered in glitter who just flies around.

It is still a very very slow start to the show, but it didn't really pick up.  Last time we went the greeters and the people who helped to seat us were very funny and were involved in the pre-show activities.  This time they seemed tired of their jobs.  

They also didn't seem have the same quality or quantity of actors in the show.  I also noticed that they didn't have a live band playing the music this time.  They had a handful of musicians on the stage during parts of the show, but they didn't have the live band this time.  The music was much better last time, this time it was more of a recorded sound session.  

The stage itself is very impressive, how do they do it?  It is crazy!

My wife and I both shared the same opinion, the person next to us even fell asleep!  I would not recommend this show anymore.  I would recommend visiting another show.  I even thought Mystere' was better than this.  We also really enjoyed Criss Angel and La Reve.

So many people here complain that the show's storyline was difficult to follow, but my friend and I (admittedly a couple of theater geeks) had no trouble understanding what was going on. It's basically like a condensed version of Avatar the Last Airbender, except with twins instead of one central hero. Everything is going great, but then the ""Fire Nation"" attacks, and everyone except our two heroes and their closest friends survive. They get separated and go on their own journeys in which they find love, grow as warriors, and then reunite kick some ass. The end.

Anyway, this show will light a fire under your ass and make you believe that anything is possible. The focus here is less on a constant barrage of acrobatics, and more on creating beautiful, jaw-dropping imagery and killing the audience through imagination rather than flash. I've heard the criticism that the stage is the real start of the production, but by itself the stage is nothing more than a technologically impressive rectangular slab. It only truly comes alive through the performers' interactions with\/on top\/along the sides\/dangling for dear life on the edges of it. There is one scene in which the performers engage in what I can only describe as ""Human Plinko"" as dozens of arrows are fired at the now completely vertical stage, and it was one of the most thrilling live sequences I have ever witnessed. Yes, the stage was essential to making that happen, but if the performers were not technically proficient enough to survive such a scene whilst selling the hell out of it, that entire scenario could have been one deadly dud.

If you are on the fence about the show because of complaints about the pacing or the story, just go see it. When you know what's going on, the show's pacing feels spot on. In order to tell the story, the need to give the audience time to breathe -- moments to relax in between the high action\/intense ones. The comic relief portions might not be for everyone, but that's just kind of a Cirque thing, isn't it?

This show is amazing!  The athleticism and production are nothing short of spectacular.  The performers' abilities to maneuver on the revolving stage is something to marvel at.  There is so much to take in at this show that a second viewing is probably in order.  The performance does occasionally extend out into the audience, such as the pre show and some of the battle scenes.  

The story is very cohesive and easy to follow.  Every performer has their moment in the spotlight to showcase their athleticism.  Well, almost every performer.

This leads into the epic vertical battle scene near the end that is now displayed as a projection against the vertical stage because a performer tragically fell to her death during a performance.  I applaud their attempt to ensure further safety to their performers but that battle scene is definitely missed.  The projection is blurry making it hard to distinguish the performers from each other, save for the imperial twins due to their green and red costumes.  

YouTube KA live battle scene and you'll be able to see what really happened during that battle scene.  For instance, SPOILER ALERT, I did not know that the forest creatures and the glittery dude were aiding the twins in battle!  I thought it was the Imperial guards versus the tattooed archers.  And the prince's body guard\/companion was also lending them a hand here too!  I also knew the counselor's son was taken down by the twins in this battle but I couldn't make it out  clearly from the projection.  So because the LIVE battle was cut, you don't get to see the counselor's son display his athleticism in the show.  His other scenes include walking around with a huge bravado, laughing maniacally and making grand gestures with his arms.  Such a shame because the performer was so good in this role! Also, the firefly boy (glittery dude) and the creatures didn't get much time to do some cool aerial scenes.  Sure, they had some trapeze-ish moments in the forest when they make their first appearance, and while they were very beautiful and graceful, they were really tamed.

The soundtrack is also incredible.  There was a blend of opera, rock, ballads and hyms.  I particularly love the music whenever the counselor's son was center stage, the rock opera number was so grand and powerful and portrayed his character so vividly.  Again, the performer did a phenomenal job in this role (and such a shame that he didn't get more live time due to the cut scene).  The other comedic twins, (chaperones maybe?) served as comedic relief and had some interesting scenes.  They also even got their moment on the VERTICAL stage.  

So despite the blurry projection, this show is still worth seeing.  Prior to the show, I knew the epic battle would be modified, but I got to admit that when the projection came on, I was still a bit disappointed.  

And finally, there is not one bad seat in the theater.  My party sat in section 201 (side seats), row GG, and we could still see everything!  The theater isn't massive and the revolving stage allows everyone in the audience a clear view.

This distraction was a positive one because I could see all of the detail that was put into this show. I loved it all.",2,1,2

Since it received a high rating, we expected alot from it. We were disappointed. First, the costumes were very ugly and stupid. The style was a mixture of tribes, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese Opera. What was wrong with the designer? The storyline was lamed. The acrobat stunts were not very impressive. You could see much better skills in any other Chinese circus. The only impressive thing about the show was the engineering on the stage movements. It was interesting to see the stage tilted vertically. Overall I enjoyed Le Reve much more than KA.",1,0,0

The theatre was beautiful and architecturally breathtaking - like the inside of a steampunk ship. There were some pre-shows to enjoy, and the main show was 90 minutes long. Ka has a 7:00pm show, and a 9:30pm show, held at MGM Grand. MGM Grand guests also enjoy further discounts from their tickets.

The show itself was a bit story-heavy - I found I was trying to interpret the story as we went along, rather than simply enjoying the acrobatic skills. My interpretation of the story is below (spoiler alert!) 

I took my family there, and I'll admit, my parents fell asleep at certain parts of the show because certain scenes dragged on, but the jungle scene, the flight scene and the wheel scenes were spectacular! With the discounts, it was not a bad deal, but I've seen better shows in Vegas. 


~SPOILER ALERT~ Stop reading here if you want to see the show AND be surprised!

The real show opens with a voiceover that tells you about the Imperial Twins during the downfall of the kingdom. The twins are sparring with each other, and then they arrive in the Imperial Court. Here, we're introduced to the court, like ""Split-Skirt girl"", ""Dreadlocks"", and a number of other martial-artist types who demonstrate their showy fighting as the Twins and the Royals watch on. Afterwards, the big bosomed ""Mother Maid"" is introduced, good natured and scolding everyone. This is when you realize that they're speaking a Sim-like language AKA undecipherable.

Suddenly, during a group hug between the Twins and the royals, they are attacked by ""Rebels"", killing off the Royals. Mayhem ensues as arrows fly about, and they attempt to board a ship, but in the bustle, He Twin is tossed from the ship - good thing Dreadlocks loyally follows along too. She Twin is on the ship, along with Mother Maid - the ship is invaded with Rebels, and the fighting continues amidst a sea storm. Finally, the storm takes down the ship, and She Twin is tossed into sea (beautiful scene, by the way). Luckily, she survives, and also manages to rescue Mother Maid from drowning. 

Meanwhile, there's the Rebels. Hold the phone....Khal Drogo, IS THAT YOU?! Khal Drogo is the head of the Rebels, and has his daughter with him. Apparently, the Rebels have quite the industrial mentality - their head engineer, Marilyn Manson, introduces the Rebels to his latest scheme in miniature form - spinning wheels? Interesting.......

He Twin and Dreadlocks are now on the run from the Rebels. They finally stop to rest, and perform a shadow puppet show with their lantern using their hands (???) Unknownst to them, Khal Drogo's daughter is hiding off to the side and is entranced by their show. Soon after, the Rebels catch up and imprison them in cage-wheels.

After the shipwreck, She Twin, Mother Maid and two Jesters wash up onto the beach. The two Jesters encounter a giant crab, giant turtle whose egg they try to steal and other sea creatures. Comic relief at its most obvious. However, the Rebels manage to catch up and the group separates in their escape. She Twin is rescued by the Mountain Fisherman, who take her up to their tent high up on the Mountain walls. Luckily, Mother Maid and the jesters are also found, and they reunite again! The Mountain Fisherman share their fish (or at least, whatever they didn't drop) and they celebrate. Suddenly, the Rebels appear again! LUCKILY.......the tent somehow turns into an airplane and they escape. (again, GORGEOUS scene). Unfortunately, She Twin falls into the jungle.

Her brother and Dreadlocks has been captured back in Khal Drogo's factory - however, Khal's daughter is curious about He Twin because she loved his shadow puppets, and hands him a flute. He plays it. She falls in love, and releases him - he then jets off to release Dreadlocks and escapes, but not before giving the flute to her (I thought this was kinda dry...she gifts you the flute, and you give it back??). She puts some serious baton-twirling skills out there in her dance.

During her fall into the Jungle, a sparkling Tarzan swoops in and rescues her. They fall in love during a fantastic ribbon acrobatic show, and you begin to wonder where this girl's luck comes from.

Back in the Rebel factory, the wheel cage is now life size, and is powered by the captured Court. Marilyn Manson proudly shows off his masterpiece, and demonstrates how all this slave labour produces..........................a hunk of rock?? Khal Drogo is overthrown by one of his own, but brother Twin comes to the rescue and defeats the newest Usurper. Khal mysteriously dies though, hmmm...

A final battle, with the Twins, Tarzan, Dreadlocks and jesters attacking, and winning! 

The Court is reunited and Kingdom at peace.",15,8,9

1. Amazing soundtrack
2. Superb acrobatics
3. THE MOVING STAGE!

KA still remains my favorite show in Las Vegas even after all these years, because everything about the show is phenomenal. There's a solid storyline that it easy to understand\/follow, and the story is brought to life through fluid acrobatics, unique props, and fight sequences. In addition, the costume and makeup for KA is intricate and colorful. Even sitting far away from the stage, you can still see just how much detail they put into each performer's face and clothes. The style actually reminds me a bit of Avatar: The Last Airbender, so that makes me love this show even more. 
 
Finally, one of the biggest assets of KA that also makes it so unique is its rotating stage. There will be several scenes where the performers will be defying gravity with this stage in phenomenal ways. I don't really want to spoil your experience, but I'll just tell you that it's truly mesmerizing.

I really hope to watch this show again soon, because I've only seen it once a long time ago and I definitely need to refresh my memory about KA again.

They sell drinks and popcorn for the show, so grab a beer and enjoy!

Honestly the show seemed to go by so fast because you're having so much fun watching it! about 60+ performers and the plot is cool

This is more of a musical Broadway kind of show with storyline. If you are looking for more acrobatic stunts then I suggest Mystere.

Before the show, there is a professional photographer that takes pictures of you and you can buy them.

You can buy drinks at the show and bring them into the theater which is awesome.

Tickets & Pricing:
You can buy them online or buy them in person from either the KA box office or ticket selling vendors out on the strip. We got our tix from Tix4Tonight at $87\/person, but if you have a party of 4 or more, you should definitely get your tix online! We saw a deal online for the same show at $69\/person for a group of 4.

Location & Theatre:
You have to travel to the south side of the strip to the MGM Grand Hotel. The entrance to the theatre itself is colorful, and the guys that check your tickets and let you in are all dressed up in costume, too! Then they send you either to the left or right up a ramping hallway into a huge and dimly lit theatre.

Once you're in the theatre, even before the show starts, there's fire shooting up from the ""stage"" area, performers running around the pirate ship-esque scaffolding to the left & right sides of the theatre, and whispering sounds coming out of small speakers IN THE CHAIR behind you head! The whispering totally freaked me out at first because I thought I was hearing things...and my bf's response at first was ""What sounds? I don't hear anything..."" lol. 

Performance:
You definitely have to think about Cirque shows as a circus performance on crack & steroids and with a storyline. That being said, there were acrobats, choreographed fights, sliks, a ""clown"" type scene, balance acts and more.

My bf is an engineer and he LOVED the stage itself. I don't personally understand how it works, but it was essentially a large platform that could move in whichever direction you could image---up, down, left, right, it tilted at all angles, and at one point became a wall (instead of a floor) that people were performing on.

Tons of special effects throughout the entirety of the show. Fire, mist\/smoke, wire work, a jungle scene where huge ""vine"" poles came down from the ceiling, a bucking ship (imagine a bull machine in a bar...but it's a small ship w\/ ppl on it), a flying bird machine, and all kinds of fun stuff.

The one trick I'll always remember from the show though, was the human hamster wheel on crack. Two human-sized hamster wheels connected across a center point around which they can turn (like a fan). One guy in each wheel, they somehow manage to get the entire ""fan"" to rotate, then one guy gets OUT of his wheel to start running around the OUTSIDE of the wheel instead of running inside. It was crazy! Then he starts jumping rope while on the outside of his wheel, while it's spinning around the center point. I swear he almost fell at one point...

Overall:
Anywho, it was a great show and I had a great time! I don't like spending a lot of money upfront when I don't really know what I'm spending it on, but I totally understood what I was paying for after seeing the show!",9,3,9

(Varekai, Corteo, La Nouba live) (Dralion, Alegria on DVD). I am very happy I made a last minute purchase in the airport on my way to Vegas, scared of the negative reviews on Yelp about KA.

I don't recommend listening to the naysayers. Come to this theatre without the expectation of a life changing experience and enjoy the creativity of the masterminds of the show. Where do I start...

Plot: The story is simple, sweet, and very fun. It involves murder, lost and found love, betrayal, action, discovery and revenge. KA has a story you can follow more so than all the other Cirques. They do an excellent job of portraying the tale of royal twins. Naturally the story can't be too complex since no words are used, but it is an entertaining one. Those who come in expecting a intricate storyline that is comparable to a broadway production will be disappointed, KA is limited to body movements, facial expressions, and set changes. The lack of script hinders one's ability to weave a web of events, but KA does an outstanding job without it.

Acrobatics: I will admit, there are more flips, body tossing, limb contorting, tight rope walking, and furious cartwheeling in other Cirque shows. However, why not take a step off the beaten path and see something unique and different? That is what so great about KA, they took a chance doing a different kind of Cirque presentation, and in my mind it paid off well. It took an immense amount of imagination and work that was invested to make it the way it is, and I can appreciate it. Don't get me wrong, most of the stunts a typical viewer would need a miracle to pull off, it's just less flashy than some of the other Cirque shows. If you want to see lots of gymnastics, go see the 15+ year old Mystere, or Chinese acrobats.

The Stage: Before I watched KA, I was curious what 160 million dollar investment into a set would buy you. Wonder no more, the scene changes, from the roaring sea to the sunny beaches, up to the icy cliffs, arrow covered mountainside or the colorful jungle, are all amazing to see. The transitions are flawless and very impressive. The stage itself is a technical marvel. Even when the music is temporary off to change into a different score, the 100+ ft stage rotates, raises\/lowers, flips, and glides without a peep of any sound. The lighting effects are awesome and can completely change the composition, texture, and atmosphere, keeping you in wonder if that is the same stage or not.

Music: The music is just as amusing and Cirque du Soleily (you know what I mean, lol) as you would expect it to be.

I really don't want to raise your hopes up too high, but am merely expressing my experience the highlight of my trip to Vegas. It was more exciting than big winning hands on the poker table, meeting celebrities, attending other expensive shows or dining in never tried before restaurants (and I'm a foodie\/cook). It made me smile to utter Oohs and Wows out loud throughout the show, and to see my girl do the same. If I can tell things to those in the future who ask me about KA, I would tell them it's not your typical Cirque show, keep an open mind, and just enjoy what you see, and experience the adventure for yourself.",2,0,0

that moving stage is sooo cool!

this is the only cirque du soliel show that has a very easy to understand story line behind it. a lot of the other shows are very abstract or figurative, but this one, you can actually understand what they are portraying thru their body languages and acts.

best seats are prob in the dead center of the room, cuz there are some acts that are done in the side of the room. if you sit way in the front, you wont be able to see it unless you crane your head over your seat.",2,0,1

It seemed reminiscent of a steampunk vibe. The ushers were friendly and entertaining. The music is fantastic and really pulls you in to the story. The costumes and sets are incredible. The moving stages are the most insane thing I've ever seen. On occasion, you can see the mechanics behind the stages, and you are left in awe of how they came up with such an immense project such as this.

I like that there is a storyline that you can really follow with this performance. When I saw Mystere, I couldn't really tell you what the story was, but I felt that Mystere had more of the ""Cirque"" appeal. This performance was more of a dance in martial arts movements. There is a scene where they do shadow puppets and that was really impressive. I didn't realize you could create things that intricate with it. The brother finding the girl he liked wasn't out of place, but the sister falling in love with the Tarzan-y thing seemed off. All I could think was that he looked too old for her. She looked 14 and he looked 20. It was almost creepy that he was falling for a child. I know they say it's a coming of age story, but you never know what age that would actually be in that time period.

I was left with a bit of a lackluster feeling where I just wasn't blown away with it. The final scene is supposed to be an epic battle done while the main stage is vertical. Because of the death last year, they have changed it to a CGI version projected onto the stage. It was blurred because it was trying to move fast, so I couldn't really tell who these characters were supposed to be. They should invest in a better version of it, or have the platform be less elevated so that the performers can safely perform the scene. It leaves you feeling let down. When the scene is over, they bring out the actors so you can link the characters on the projection with their physical counterpart, but that left me even more let down. This performance didn't have some of the aspects of the show that you would come to expect from a ""Cirque"" performance, so I think that's what left me with the most disappointment. 

This is still a good performance, but for about $100 per seat (almost $200 for closer to the front) I felt that it could have been a bit more of an impressive finale.",1,0,0

The acrobatics, effects, and acts will amaze you.  I really don't think there is much else to share, because you should experience it for yourself.

It's probably our favorite Vegas Cirque show, followed by Michael Jackson One.  We also liked Zumanity and Zarkana, but fell asleep at ""O"" and didn't care for Beatles' Love.

KA has a pretty good storyline and some really cool acrobatics, martial arts, and some real creative puppetry.  Costumes were pretty cool - seems somewhat inspired by China or perhaps Korea during imperial times.  The moving stage really offers unique possibilities you typically don't see at other shows.  The soundtrack is also one of my favorites - I bought the CD many years ago and its definitely worth a download from itunes!

Why just 4 stars and not 5?  Somehow the wow factor this time just wasn't there.  Perhaps we're just getting older but somehow some of the fight scenes on the wall seemed slower, less intense, yet dragged on a bit.

Many have said Ka is better than O, but thats just apples and oranges: which one you like is all about preference. O had a bit more of an ethereal vibe to the production minus a tangible storyline. Ka on the other hand, was very simple to understand since it centered on the 2 main characters. Even without dialogue one knew what was going on. 

Notables
- well made set designs, extremely breathtaking. Built in such a way that every inch of the theater was utilized to its maximum potential. LITERALLY!! Sound effects as well as music would blast from the speakers embedded in our seats. The projection of bubbles on the see through screen which gave the illusion that the actors were swimming in water: Amazing! I actually thought it was a pre-recorded video until everyone told me otherwise. The Manmade bird that flew right above the audiences, letting us have a glimpse of the humans actually controlling it was great but the most amazing would be the moving platform on stage. Leaving the theater, I wondered how deep down the stage floor actually went. 
- acrobatics. The fact that my heart jumps into my throat every time is just one of the things I love so much about Cirque du Soleil. When the girl twin danced in the sky with the sparkly half naked dude was my favorite part of the show. Seriously.. he was twice her size yet she flung him around like a feather!!

The only thing that I had a problem with was the final battle scene on the completely vertical platform (Im assuming they believed it to look cooler than it really turned out to be) and the overly sappy storyline. Overall, great show!!!",2,1,1

Why is that? Because this one has a storyline that you can actually follow. it's not abstract like in most Cirque shows, and is not very dream-like.  

For Ka, the moment you step into the theater, you immediately get the feeling that this show is different.  The stage itself is very interesting and sets itself apart from the other theater sets (even O).

One of my favorite parts about Ka is the fact that their stage is a giant moving platform that appears to float. And Ka uses this stage frequently (my favorite is when they change it to look like a cliff)",1,0,0

There were massive structures built on both sides of the audience....very industrial metal bridges perched on  huge columns that you could just imagine people running back and forth across over you head. Unfortunately, this part of the set wasn't used as much. But it was still utilized by swinging to and fro from above.

The actual stage itself was huge and controlled by a hydraulic lift that also tilted and rotated the stage. Everyone in my party was impressed because every scene depicted was so real, whether it was set on a ship, deep below the ocean's surface, or in a jungle.

The acrobats were talented...they were very expressive. The storyline itself was very cliche; this combined with the music made it seem like a disney film--think mulan done by cirque!

There is simply too much  modern dancing, storytelling, and nothing to keep you entertained.  The moving stage is amazing, but that does not make for a good show.

General
-Performed at Ka Theatre in MGM Grand
-Interacive extras before the show by the entrance. They're all dressed up so it's a great photo opp with them and to remember the night!

+KA is super action-packed and has lots of Asian martial arts features compared to the other shows. It was my boyfriend's first cirque du soleil so I knew I had to show him KA to ease him into shows and he loved it. :)
+The story line has sad parts, romance, and happy ending! I thoroughly enjoyed it!
+During the show, performers run down the aisle where the audiences are seated or they fly above the audiences to make it more interactive. Makes you feel like you're part of the show! So awesome.
+The KA theatre itself is total WOW-factor. The stage can rotate 90 degrees! So the huge flat stage that the performers were standing on revolves 90 degrees and becomes one giant floating wall (Well, in actuality it's held by several strong giant shaft or pole). This scene is actually my favorite part from the whole performance!

-When you watch Ka, I actually suggest to get seats in the back. The martial arts stuff looked so badass and cool from far away but this time around, i bought a seat close to the front and I actually saw in detail how soft the actual props were or how soft the performers were hitting each other and stuff. Less dramatic for sure so it was kinda disappointing to sit near the front. :(

I would NOT recommend this. Sitting farther back and higher up would have been preferable.

If you are not into Asian marshal arts fighting, much of the beginning will be not your cup of tea. My wife and I were frankly bored during the first half, for this reason. However, the second half was amazing, both in staging, creativity and acrobatics.

For anyone who saw this show for their first Cirque experience, it only gets better from here.

All the standard elements are there with an over-the-top narrator, early plot twists, and wild costumes, but what it lacked in actual acrobatic performance, it made up for in pageantry.  The moving digital stage was really impressive and the theatre itself made for a fairly intense experience; they even had speakers in the seat headrests.  The imagery was enhanced by performers all over the rafters, but that became fairly distracting...the Cirque choreographers are masters at that, though.  The effects of the 90-degree stage were very cool at first, but the novelty soon wore off.  It's an athletic show, just not something that's on-par with my favorites.

The combination of classic asian dress of one group and the industrial steel-and-tattoo style of the other group made an interesting clash.  I felt like parts of the plot came straight out of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  The score ranged from typical flutes and harmony to electric guitars and spark-showers.

Sitting further back, you can really appreciate the moving stage (which is an understatement), and all the other visual and lighting effects.  Sitting closer, I could check out the costumes and make-up a bit better, I guess.  But I was in awe throughout the show.  The music was fabulous as well.  The effects were just great!  I'm surprised I didn't seat this show earlier! 

This show is a lot easier to follow because of the storyline that's laid out from the very beginning.  You can't help but be mesmerized by all the elements and I heard myself gasping with some of the acrobatic performances by these talented athletes.

Rankings thus far:
1) Cirque du Soleil's O
2) Cirque du Soleil's Ka
3) Cirque du Soleil's Mystere
4) Dragone's Le Reve

I went with a tight group of coworkers after a nice dinner, everything was set for a great show to cap off a good night. Didn't happen. The theater is massive which means that we blew massive amounts for tickets $300+ easily and were still quite far from the stage and not even in the center section (tho our seats were on the aisle bordering the center section). I can't imagine how much people farther up\/center section paid. What a waste. The theater is just too large, too grand.

The acrobatics\/gymnastics\/etc were impressive, but you know, and can at many times, see the wires supporting everyone allowing them to perform the feats. Sure takes a lot away from the performance. My favorite part of the performance was a scene when there were a few men atop\/inside rotating wheels - imagine massive revolving hamster wheels with men jumping from inside to outside the wheel while the wheels rotated in a circle - this was incredible. But the rest of the performance just seemed either gimmicky or simple.

Ka also claims to have a plot. This is a ridiculous claim, I couldn't follow the plot whatsoever. There was some guy who was trying to save some girl I think, but it made no sense and was totally disjointed. Almost as if every now and then the writers thought, oh right, we have that plot thing we have to reference.

Oh, I guess I am unsure if they still cut out the last part.  Some people are still saying that they have changed it.  I guess I am referring to the show prior to the accident.

The choice was between a bigger discount for Ka or a lesser discount at any other Cirque du soleil show. Asking my friends, it was a close race between Ka and O.

Back on point, there are no photos or recording during the show. It's dimly light, very exciting. It's not a scary show at all, but if you have easily frighten children, don't let them sit in the aisle seats.

The show takes you through a journey of love, pain, loyalty, and fear. My favorite part was the shadow play and the jaw dropping feats in the battle scene. It was a beautiful performance all around. I was engaged the entire time and as you may know by now, unlike the other cirque du soleil shows, this one has an actual storyline.

There is a love story interspersed in the plot though it's not very believable and just seemed to detract from the show as a whole. Basically, the love story was a bit of a plot mover rather than something explored. 

The costumes were great and everything was well choreographed. However, at times I felt that it was monotonous. ""Oh hey, another fight scene on the moving wall"". The most disappointing thing was the climax. I understand that the performer died last year, that's a terrible tragedy. However, instead of altering the scene and having them perform on a level surface, they just made up a CGI of the characters fighting on the vertical wall. It was blurry and you couldn't tell what was going on.

Booking was frustrating because I tried to do it online, but their system was down. It wasn't until the next day that I was able to book over the phone, once their system was up and running. The woman I talked to was extremely nice; she gave me the best available seat choices and waived the booking fee for ordering over the phone. 

We arrived 30 mins before showtime, so we ordered a couple of drinks inside at the bar. We spent nearly $50 on 2 large alcoholic beverages! You can save a few bucks and bring in outside drinks as long as it's not in a glass.

Our seats were in section 201, row JJ, aisle seats 26-27. We were able to see everything at a great view, but it was very irritating that they continued to let people in after the show began, which had people walking up the steps and blocking my view for a good 10 minutes. It ruined the beginning intro, which was kind of important in telling the story. 

This was our first Cirque Du Soleil show, so we didn't have high expectations, only to enjoy ourselves. The stage production was phenomenal and visually beautiful. There is more story telling than acrobats, but the performances were amazing. The chairs have speakers, which enhanced the experience more as the music and scenes play out. Because I was distracted by late guests in the beginning, I was lost with the story-line. I can understand most of the scenes, but I kept confusing myself, so I just sat back, relaxed and enjoyed what I could make of the story. Overall, it was an incredible show that I'd recommend anyone to see at least once!

I'd be sorely disappointed to pay $104 a piece for the seats I had tonight to see a recorded and grainy version of the final battle. Cirque needs to rethink their ending.

Thank God I decided to watch it, it was such an amazing show, and I'll definitely see it again with my girlfriend.  I'm even gonna say that it is by far the BEST Cirque show I've seen (the other two were O, and Mystere..which are still shows that deserve five stars).  
   The music, costumes, stage, theater, pyrotechnics, acrobatics, martial arts were all fantastic as expected from a Cirque show.  But what really separated Ka from the other Cirque shows that I've seen was the story of the two imperial twins journeys and battles.  I loved the theater and the moving stage as well, props to Cirque with their creativity in stage presentation.  
    I ended up buying cheap tickets because I was watching it by myself, but as Donna said below...I would definitely recommend Category 2 or 3\/4 tickets, rather than Category 1. Just because so much of the action happens all around you, and in so many angles..it almost helps to sit farther away to get a more complete view of the each scene. Not to mention Category 2 and 3\/4 are cheaper tickets than category 1 as well (which IMO might put you too close to the stage).  
  Anyway Ka is a FANTASTIC show, and would recommend it to ANYONE. Definitely worth the $80-200 you may spend per ticket.

I'm so glad KA was my first cirque experience. It had everything-- martial arts, trapeze, crazy acrobatics. The stage is made up of many ""mini"" stages that revolve, spin, turn over, rotates.

We sat in the middle, closer to the stage but not too close.  The show has platforms which rise vertically to the ceiling and if you sit too close, you will be arching your neck to see and if you sit too far, you can't see the activity on the floor of the stage.

Usually seeing any of the CS productions once is enough, kind of the, ""been there, done that"", but KA is one of those shows that I'd consider seeing again.

Pity, because this was the first Cirque du Soleil show I went to see live, and it was a terrible misfire.  All the other shows I've seen (on TV) were full of ""wow..."" and ""holy cow!"" moments.  They blended stunning visuals, music and artistry with the most amazing physical feats.  But the physicality anchored the show.  The rest were adornments.  KA has stunning visuals, music, impressive technology of moving and morphing stages and backdrops, and.... that's about it.  It's not anchored by cool acrobatics, at least no more than you'd see in any high school gymnastics class.   

 That's too bad, because we went in with so much enthusiasm and anticipation.  The theater itself is highly stylized, thick with ambience, and creates a strong sense of a different time and place [though I wasn't a fan of the speakers in the seat.... too distracting and gimmicky].   Once the show started, I felt increasingly trapped in an endless holding pattern, waiting and wondering when the good stuff was going to start .  It never did.  

One particularly painful interlude was the depiction of a ship in a stormy sea.  Wow, they milked that one to death, long after it had gone dry.  The theatrical representation of a ship roiling went on and on and on and on, interminably, with the only thing happening being people being tossed out of the ship into the water, one by one, anticlimactically.  Nope, it's no fun sitting there watching what is essentially one of those swinging Viking ship rides at the amusement park.  For five minutes.

The story line itself was dull, uncompelling, tortured by cliche, but we don't go to see Cirque du Soleil for their story lines.  But given that I already felt short-changed by the show, the story line added to my annoyance because it was yet another indicia of how boring KA was.   The only time a genuinely delighted smile came on my face was during the damn, non sequitur hand puppet shadow play interlude.  Yeah, I'm embarrassed that was the highlight of the show for me, but it's the only time I thought ""cool, that takes some skill.""  Sad but true.

The star of the show was the stage.  All the breathtaking feats of human physical strength, agility,  grace, synchronization, movement, transformation, endurance you would expect were replaced by a high tech, multitasking stage and plays on light.  The actors were there to frame and demonstrate for you how amazing the stage was.  It should be the other way around, no?  Yawn.

The glowing reviews here are misleading.  Yes, KA could be an entertaining stage show.  No, it's not a Cirque du Soleil show.   Maybe I missed some grand finale, because after about an hour I could take no more and walked out.  At the end of the day, there's a reason why KA tickets were on a 25% off sale.  Buyer beware.",14,10,1

I was just ready to experience! Right away, when entering the show, you are given a sneak preview of what it might be like. The people scanning your tickets are all dressed up in costumes. As you enter into the auditorium you are immediately in awe of the amazing structures\/stage set up thing going on. I felt like I was entering like a Final Fantasy video games! It was beautiful and got me really excited for the show. As you are sitting in your seats waiting for the show to begin, the actor's\/actress\/people part of the show walk out on the outer stage thing doing some acrobatic tricks, spinning upside down and running around trying to scare people. It's pretty fun and really draws\/connects the audience I think. 

Just a couple minutes before the show begins they do a staged reminder that cellphones and photography is not allowed during the show. The show starts off and it is absolutely amazing. The moving stage, the athleticism of everyone in the production, and the music blows you away. The production and performance of the show was just out of this world. However the story slowly kinda got lost towards the middle part and I was really confused on the ending. I had no idea how everything was resolved. I know this was the revised ending since the tragic accident but I wish they had made a better ending of it. My friends and I was so confused that we had to wiki it!! 

My boyfriend loved the show though cause he didn't really care for the story. If you enjoy an amazing performance than you would probably enjoy this. But if you kinda care about the story well, probably should not get your hopes up. Just enjoy it for the performances. I would come back and watch it again IF they fixed the ending.

Ka was exciting and thrilling from beginning to end. There was not one dull moment. It had a good storyline and was performed very well through the acting and acrobats. It had one of the most incredible stage sets ever. I was in awe the entire time. The music fit in perfectly with each act and scene. The performers were precise and nailed every act. I also loved the theme and martial arts. The special effects, esp from the sides of the stage, were very entertaining as well. You had people swinging from all parts of the theater, which kept your eyes focused on many things keeping things interesting throughout the show.

There was maybe 2 cool cirque acts that you would usually see. The rest was basically just random dancing and someone who was swinging with no real moves. They should have at least included some basic acrobatics or juggling, but not even that. And with respect to the person who fell and died, as you would have read they replaced this with a projection of what that scene was about. It has been over a year. That was the final battle scene and it would have been amazing. But sitting there watching a fuzzy projection animation of it for several minutes, is not cool.

The reviews aren't lying, as this is voted as one of the top shows on various tourist Vegas websites.

Unlike other Cirque de Soleil shows, Ka has a driven plot, in which it narrates the coming of age of a young man and woman through their encounters with love, death, and hardships. The show itself is absolutely amazing with the creative use of a moving stage and CGI effects, that will keep the audience at the edge of their seats.

I thoroughly enjoyed Ka's creative uses of certain characters (that turtle, starfish, and crab!) as it will elicit laughter and warm responses from the audience. Not only that, but the music score is amazing and appropriate for each scene, bringing seamless transition between acts and highlighting the climaxes.

This is a great show for families and friends. The audience will fall in love with the cast (don't forget about the long-haired Tarzan adorned in body glitter!), pyro projections, martial arts choreography, and gravity-defying performances.

I've seen this show now five times over the past four or five years.  Of the 5...the past four were mild to great.  They've toned the show down so much and now have less experienced talent than before.  I'm sure there's more than one cast but I've always seen a very talented cast.  Sooo...every time I've seen the show they've changed it more and more.  Pretty much for the worst.  This last time was so unbelievable how bad it was I wanted my money back.  After politely contacting Cirque they do not bother to respond.  So now...the gloves come off!  Wow....Cirque!  You're really something else.  Another big company that doesn't give a rats _ _ _ about our hard earned money!   They take your $168 per seat and give you a show now that's so bad...really take my advise...do not go see it.  You'll be sorry!  I feel bad for the very talented performers mixed with other folks, notice I didn't say other performers, that just stand there and look pretty.  What a disappointment for someone that works so hard and proud to be a part of something so spectacular to just end up having a ""bla"" cast to work with.

Let's talk about the show.  Back...oh...I would say four or five years ago when I saw the first show.  Wow!  I was really on the edge of my seat.  Let's compare the differences from then to now.

First...opening sequence.  Before no narration...now there is.  Not needed really.  I have no judgment either way.

Second...the rotating stage comes out of the ""Void"" where it appeared to be a ship with rowers. This turned into a ritual scene.  This involved multiple people doing acrobats, sword stunts, spear stunts and let's say lots of action and energy.  So much happening you would want to come back and watch again to catch what you missed.  The next three shows pretty much the same.   However, this last show...wow...people just standing on the stage on both sides while one so called performer twirls a stick and occasionally slaps it on the ground.  My head was nodding like you see some folks in church.  I was really really very unhappy with what I saw.  My niece and nephew were like...huh?  What's all the hoopla?  Great music but no action to match.  Something just did not add up here.

Third...the long haired villain, which I've always liked.  He was so much fun even though he was the bad guy.  He was not there this evening but they replaced him with a far less experienced person.  Notice again I did not say performer.  This guy did not even climb on the wall near the battle scene towards the end of the show.  To make matters worse, near the end of the battle scene, the ""emperor"" (guy in yellow shoes) falls in pain due to one of his warriors, one of many dies.  What?  My niece and nephew said the same thing.  What's so important about the regular fighter?  It just didn't have the energy there had it been the villain.  In the past four shows, when the villain is defeated and fallen...the stage rotates with theatrical fog, lights, and music to match.  The emperor comes over to comfort his fallen com-rad as the stage rotates downward into the void.  A scene that stuck with me from the beginning.   This time it just lost it's energy and for my niece and nephew they were confused as to what the point was.

Fourth, the jungle scene...in the past the jungle music always began with the scene.  This time...the jungle scene was about over when the jungle music came on.  Later when we were discussing the show my niece and nephew said...oh was that a jungle?  Duh...

Cirque...music is really key to a production.  You know that!  

The jungle scene was followed by the air ballet for lack of a better way to describe.  These two individuals put on a stellar performance.  She's nicely shaped and petite and he's very strong.  Fake long hair.  Oooopppss...I think I'm going bald!  

The Mexican wheel stuntmen always put on a absolute hair raising performance.  You always hear the audience gasp and a super cheer for them.  Applause to you guys!!!

Fifth...the rotating stage.   During the scene where there are supposed arrows hitting the ground.  They simulate this with spikes or stems that come up from the rotating stage floor.  With semi slip shoes and these spikes they used to rotate the stage really fast with the performers moving all over.  This included folks falling into the void.  That was really crazy to watch.  This last time though...wow...they just chase each other and some falling with the stage moving ever so so slow.  When the stage did speed like in the past, everyone just hung on to the spikes and or edge.  Acting like they're trying to keep from falling off.  Really not exciting at all.

I could keep writing but I think I've given Cirque too much of my time and money.  Bottom line is..they have this spectacular stage, theater, and music but the actors are not always up to providing the best performance possible.  Cirque has lowered it's standards, not prices.",1,0,0

It has acrobatics, a really cool stage, each seat has built in speakers, and the story keeps moving for the most part (the exception is an extended beach scene with the clowns of the show. That part got a bit long and felt even longer). 

Most Cirque shows have ""stories,"" you sit there and have no clue what the plot is but you enjoy the stunts and then leave and people say the story was moving and you are left to wonder what you missed. KA isn't like that at all--the story is clear, there is a plot, there are characters and a clear theme.  This alone helped me to enjoy the show much more than other Cirque shows! 

If you arrive maybe 15 mins before the show, the archers (makes more sense when you see the show, just think of them as the bad guys), repel into certain parts of the audience to scare people and also yell at people to get to their seat. If you have a child with you, avoid sitting in the first row of the upper section because they tend to repel there.  They tend to run around near the side aisles as well (before the show starts it is to scare people as the show gets going it is because it is part of the plot--I won't say more because I do not want to ruin the story).  

Try your best not to sit near the front. The stage lifts and goes on its side. If you can sit further back you will be able to see everything. If you are too close you will end up looking straight up the entire time.  


This is a 5 star Cirque show.  If I only had time to see one Cirque show during my visit, it would be KA.  Acrobatics throughout and several (maybe 3 or 4 acts) that are unbelievable. O isn't a bad show--the dives and acrobatics are fun and amazing, but the plot itself is so boring I almost fell asleep. The water elements of O and production design are very cool though. I would suggest KA over O. But, Cirque shows can be subjective and KA tends to be a show people love or hate.",1,0,0

The multimillion dollar spinning\/flying\/transforming stage is a technological wonder in itself.  Incredible choreography and athleticism displayed by the performers.  I'm baffled as to how they aren't injured or killed on a nightly basis...no live lions in the show helps I guess?

The theater is tucked way inside the MGM, so give yourself ample time to arrive and get a drink. The show bar has excellent prices on alcohol. I got a large glass of Pinot Grigio for $7. The show starts out a bit slow, probably for late arrivals - don't be one of those people. There is very little audience interaction. 

There are some acrobatic moves that will make you gasp for air but not as many as say, Mystere or Zarkana. A couple of funny moments pop up, but again, not as much as you will find in their other shows. What this show did provide were some incredible battle scenes, stage movement, and pyrotechnics.

Instead this show focused more on martial arts and visuals with a touch of acrobatics here and there.  

The theater itself is gorgeous.  There are balconies off to each side of the theater for the performers to utilize.  The stage itself is amazing.  It raises, rotates, and does all kinds of crazy things that really allows for flexibility in the show.

That is a bit of a negative to me because I enjoy shows that challenge me to think.

The theater is no doubt stunning, large, surrounded by high tech equipment, the ushers are dressed up in performance attire, but the real jewel is the stage. The stage is an enormous square  platform where most of the action happens. The performances that take place on the platform certainly highlight the acrobats of the performers. The story seemed to be heavily influenced by marital arts and probably about 14 acts. Without spoiling the story, Ka is about two twins whom are separated after their palace is raided in which the twins go through adventures finding themselves. 

There was one particular scene that amazed me which was when the sister seems to be swimming down the ocean to rescue the nursemaid, but in reality the performer whom play the twin was on a rope against the enormous curtain pretending to swim while the nursemaid is slowly departing into the deep ocean. The swimming was very convincing and my mind was blown, that is all. 

If you plan on buying a frozen drink before the show I would advise you to go with the beer. The Ka Peche was super expensive ($14?) and tasted mostly like cheap super sweet peach drink mix. Where was my rum rum rum?

Gorgeous sets, costumes, choreography...  Excellent, haunting MUSIC.

The ""stage"" is a platform that rotates, and changes from vertical to horizontal.  Amazing.  It starts out as a boat, then becomes the ocean, ice, a battlground, a beach, etc.  

Costumes:  Loved them all.... the crab, millipede and star fish were great.

Two of the acrobatic acts were in former Cirq. shows-- the two guys in the twin spinning round ""ferris wheel"" type things... and the acrobat who hangs on two long cloth cords and swoops and somersaults (what a great body!!!).   Was happy as heck to see them again-- they are both excellent acts.  Very talented.

Loved them.  Loved it all.  Worth every penny....... When it ended after 1 hour and 45 minutes, I was so hoping that it was just an intermission.  The time went by soooo quickly.

The show is currently in a fantastic theater at the MGM Grand, and ticket were roughly $75 a piece...worth every penny.

The show, by its own admission, seeks to combine the usual gymnastics with martial arts, and a story of the ""Imperial Twins"" coming of age.  The coming of age story is fine, and the gymnastics are OK, but the real show stopper is the stage, which rotated on a single axis, and becomes, at several point, a vertical wall that the actors scale with their usual flair.  It's used as a topographic map of battle fields, a mountain side studded with arrows, and a backdrop for a larger than life bamboo forest.  Several gymnasts also fly over the audience from the ramps on the sides of the theater, and the whole concept of space is rearranged constantly throughout the production.  Pay special attention to the shadow puppet section.  It doesn't sound like much - I would never have believed that shadows of hands would bring me to the edge of my seat - but the skill and imagination in those five minutes reminded me why I love Cirque du Soleil.

The music was interesting, but not as moving as ""Dralion"".  The gymnastics weren't as impressive as ""O"".  But the overall impact of the show was exciting, and extremely innovative.  It was thrilling to watch.  I just kept wondering how the Cirque directors keep thinking so very far ""outside the box"" (don't worry, they'll sell you a book on it outside).  

The show was roughly 90 minutes, and I wished they had an intermission to whet our appetites a bit, rather than going straight through.  It also would have meant I had a chance to visit the souvenir shop, which was sadly closed after the show - unusual for Vegas to lose out on a chance to make money, but there you are.

I also liked that the performance had a plot, which is rare among all the shows out there. Costumes were vibrant and eye-catching. I must say that not all the seats were occupied that night though, which goes to show that ever since the accident about 1 year ago, the audience numbers have gone down. 

We were a bit disappointed at the end scene, where it's all done with computer graphics instead of actual real-life fighting, but I guess there's good reason for that change.

My boyfriend and I came to this one after hearing all the rave reviews for it, and we were amazed at how boring it was.

Yeah, that was awesome, the way the stage starting moving around, but once the novelty of it wore off, I got bored with the same stunts and moves. And it was LONG and drawn out.

Even the pre-show, where members of the warrior clan ran around the audience and jumped around above you was entertaining. After that, I was spell-bound by almost the entire show. Could not believe how crazy and complex that set was, just incredible. And, that ship scene! I was sitting in a front-side section, with a good view of the lower stage, and tried to look for the mechanics of the ship and how the wave effect was achieved....when I finally realized it was human driven! The same performers warring with each other on the storm-tossed ship were also expertly maneuvering that large set piece with their bodies. Amazing. And that was just some of the first part of the story. There were just so many good moments in this show, but I'd hate to spoil it too much for new viewers. I will say that the wheel of death had me on the edge of my seat. Those guys must have nerves of steel.
 
I just don't get the reviewers who found the show boring. There were maybe 2 slow sections, but they lasted less than 3 minutes each. I wonder if people are so over-exposed to movie\/internet special effects lately, that they're jaded and you just can't impress them easily, or they have very short attention spans. I think most people would find great value in this show. 

The story isn't super important. Basically, it's of twins forced to part and flee when a warring clan attacks, how they go on separate journeys, find their way back, and battle to resolve the unrest. I'd focus more on the performances than the story-line.

A few other notes: 

-They sold popcorn, which made my kids very happy. My kids, who are both under 10 years old, enjoyed the show. 

-Though pricey, we ended up purchasing some souvenir photos because they actually turned out really nicely. They were sold in sets of 2 photos with a padded, folding frame for $45\/set.

I'm going to Vegas again in a month and I am totally going to see this show again. Tired, drunk, sober, sick, almost dead - you'll sure to enjoy KA!
FYI - they go around taking pictures before the show and you can purchase them after in a sprecial KA keepsake album... for about $55! Yeah I got suckered in... but I sure do look cute in the pics!",2,0,1

This is the second time I have seen the show. My wife and I loved it so much we took our kids to see the show and paid $165 per ticket for the most expensive tickets available - ~$720 for four with fees.

So why the one star? They took out the most exciting and unique scene from the entire show - the final battle scene on the vertical wall - and replaced it with a low resolution video of the final battle scene on the vertical wall. I am not making this up.

That's like:

1) Going to an opera and watching the final climactic scene on 1970's era video with mono audio.
2) Going to a concert and realizing the singers were all lip-syncing and the guitars and other instruments were not even plugged in.
3) Paying $40K a year for college and finding out that the courses are all online.

After the scene was finished, there was *zero* applause from the audience - there was a collective ""WTF did I just witness?!"" silence. Keep in mind: That scene is the finale, the climax, the coup de grace, and they showed a low resolution *video*. Are you f'ing kidding me?! You cannot be serious.

I know the story behind this - there was a fatality on that scene in June 2013. Very sad, but there are an average 58 deaths of commercial fishermen per year in the US, and people are somehow still eating fish. The Ka Theatre seats 950 and the average ticket price is ~$125, so that's ~$120,000 in revenue per show, or a quarter of a million dollars per night. The show plays 5 nights a week, so that's $65 million a year in revenue. Discount that to $50 million a year for some time off, unsold tickets, discounted, tickets, etc. 

If the equipment needs upgrading, upgrade it. If the performers need more training, train them. But replacing the grand finale with a video 9 months after the incident? Absolutely shocking. Guy Laliberte should be ashamed.

Edit: Below is the response from Cirque du Soleil. Translation: ""Watch the low-res video of the climactic scene and shove it up your &*$&""

Bonjour ,

We received your letter and would like to thank you for sharing your thoughts with us.  We appreciate your comments as our shows are constantly evolving and input from our fans is very important to us.

Cirque du Soleil's creators have always wanted to explore new creative platforms.  KÀ was born of our philosophy of always pushing the limits of creativity for all aspects of a show including artistic and technical concepts.  As with all forms of art, it is a very personal experience and everyone reacts differently to every show.

In order to complete the storyline of KÀ, we are using a special projection of The Battle Scene until the full act returns to the show.

The Battle scene will return to the show when we believe that our artists are completely comfortable performing it again. We have not begun rehearsing the act in any capacity at this time.

Nevertheless, we respect your opinions, and will share your comments with our creative department.

Once again, we thank you for your constructive remarks and sincerely hope that the next production will better meet your expectations.

If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.",15,2,2

There was only one good part that lasted about 5 minutes.  Where one of the performers was jump roping on top of a spinning wheel.  Literally.  5 good minutes.  If you enjoy Teletubbie speak, however, you may enjoy this.  Because that's how the actors speak.  

It's like a bad foreign play.  Luckily, my husband had earned enough My Vegas points for us to get free tickets to this so we didn't waste any money on it.  We got 3 row center and it was almost a disadvantage to be that close.  So don't spend extra to get really close, totally not worth it.

Also, the stage rotates every which way, so if you sit close, you'll be looking UP a lot and your neck gets a little tired.

A mythological world and culture has been created and populated by the creators of Cirque for this show.

This show is a blend of circus, broadway show, and opera with all the fantasy of a children's book.  The inhabitants of a couple of strange lands perform their acts to haunting tunes that gain strength throughout the show.  The combination of lyric meloday and the athletic prowess of the acts is hypnotic.  This may be a more subtle Cirque...it reminded me of operatic productions when I first saw it, but it ends with an big bang production-circus number that is astonishing.

(just  looked at its previews now, seems like a bit different production today?) I didn't even check to see if it was still in production beforehand. I assumed it wasn't and bought tickets to Ka thinking I would get the same type experience. I really hyped up the show to my husband so he bought us the tickets and we spent 2 hrs of our time\/money wasted on this show for the two days we were there. The conciere person said to buy tickets ($218.00) in level 2 so we didn't have to lean our heads back to see all the acrobats. Uh, one time a boat floated over level 1. We spent more money to be farther (section 2, row 2 in the middle) away and I could barely make out the characters faces. I would suggest seating, but I don't suggest you waste your time\/money on this one unless you have money to burn and children to see it, we didn't.

The NEGATIVE: Sooooo boring. Many complete down times, nothing happening. Very childlike theatrics (dumb turtles\/crabs\/clowns\/centipeeds), horrible fake kung foo, childish gibberish and the theme\/very immature. We were about to leave the show early around the last portion because of the non existence of acrobatics and the bore factor. Finally some acrobatics in it that we at least wanted to see, but still not that great enough or way to short to make up for the lack in the rest of the show.

The PLUS: Everyone right, the best part is the stage. How it changes etc, but seriously you go to see fantastic stunts by the people. One stage isn't worth the boring immature themed show.

The changes from the flashy lights of Las Vegas into Kà's village are a smooth and subtle transition. It isn't until you hear the gaudy jangling of the slot machines when you exit to the casino when you realize that you had been elsewhere, immersed in an amazing journey.  Kà is a Cirque du Soleil production, and the name carries much prestige.  The reputation it carries is very heavy, but sometimes it can carry negative preconceptions. One normally does not associate a full, linear storyline with Cirque du Soleil, and instead thinks of abstract themes and traditional circus acts packaged in an eye-catching theatrical production.  However, Kà has a concrete and linear storyline, which although simple, is timeless, and appealing to its large, multinational audience. 
 The story revolves around Imperial twins, who are separated when a rival empire conducts a surprise attack on their peaceful kingdom. The twins then embark on a journey fraught with danger, sorrow, and amazement to find each other. The storyline is admittedly simple, but the simplicity allows the show to be understood by everyone. Without any recognizable spoken language (Kà speaks in gibberish, in true Cirque fashion), you are free to absorb in the other ways we communicate: the tone, the music, and the facial expressions. The need to understand the spoken word disappears, and you are left with the raw emotions of the performers, conveyed by the facial expressions, the body language, and accented by the music and the pure vocal sounds.
 As you look deeper into Kà, you are forced to rethink what you are seeing and hearing and redefine it. The stage, for example, at first looks like the traditional stage where all the audience faces. However, as the show goes on, it is clear that we must redefine the stage. The theatre is massive, seating over 1,900 people, but you can see that there are walkways and ladders and platforms surrounding the audience, with half-naked, heavily tattooed warriors jumping down at you as you enter the theatre. Is that the stage? And even before you enter the theatre, while waiting outside, the ""Gatekeepers"" or villagers of Kà come out to tease and play with you, showing you a taste of what is to come. Would that be the stage as well? This is something I wondered while a Gatekeeper came up to me, gingerly poked me, and came away with a glowing, red hot finger.  But what really made me wonder was the stage itself, as it transformed into platforms lifting itself up off the stage into the air to become a cliff side, a sand-covered beach, lush grass, a vertical wall being peppered with arrows, even water! Or when flying machines soar over the audience. What is the stage? I couldn't even ask myself that question without marveling at the technology even required to transform the stage into so many different things.  
 Because there are no words spoken throughout Kà, music, body language, and facial expressions convey the performer's feelings. It is very interesting to note that many of the performers do not come from an acting background, as they were originally chosen because of their acrobatic, martial arts, or perhaps clown skills. Although Cirque du Soleil does require acting for certain roles in certain productions, their main concern when recruiting performers is not acting, but if they can contribute any other skills to a circus troupe. The main characters, the Imperial twins for example, were not chosen because they were good actors but because of their martial art skilss. If their acting was weak, it was very hard to tell, as Kà has a very stylized way of performing that is reminiscent of Kabuki, traditional silent theatre, and Chinese opera. The overall acting was pure and raw, and combined with the powerful music (performed live by musicians in full costume), created an almost overwhelming experience. The sounds feel like they are surrounding and suffocating you with emotions, making you resonate with the characters very being. You didn't feel what the character was feeling. You became the feeling. 
 It is very clear that the designers have drawn inspirations from a wide variety of exotic and fantastic sources. Although Kà looks primarily East Asian, you can see that it has been drawn from more than just Kabuki, Chinese operas, and kung-fu movies. You can see elements of Korea, India, Thailand, and the Pacific Islanders, even elements of European fantasies through the costumes, the makeup, and the set. Somehow, everything combines seamlessly to be something unique, yet something familiar, and it retains the fantastic quality of Cirque du Soleil. You are drawn into a world that is pure fantasy, but the foreignness of Kà's world is not overwhelming and strange.

The shows is good for kids and they allow you to buy pop-corn and drinks and bring them into the theater.

I have seen each one twice, so I feel confident in my ranking. My ranking would be 1) Ka 2) Love 3) O 4) Mystere 5) Zumanity 6) Viva Elvis. Ka is the most technically complete, with a storyline, amazing stunts, creative images, stages rotating on axes, etc.  LOVE is the most fun and a very close second place.  O is the most beautiful. Zumanity is the sexiest, but stunts are just okay. And Viva Elvis could be sooo much better.  You can read my other reviews for more info...

Onto Ka... my absolute fave. I didn't expect it to be, as it looked too warrior-like and manly for me from the previews. But wow... this show has it all. The storyline is good vs evil, and you don't really need to know or understand more than that.  The swordfights on the vertical wall are incredible. So interesting to watch. And the stages rotate around on axes, so it is so visually magnificent!  Theater is amazing, and I've sat in the back and in the middle, and both seats were great.  Great soundtrack too.

This is the worst CDS show on the strip (except perhaps Zumanity- which I haven't seen, so can't comment on yet!). I go into a CDS show looking for acrobatics. So this show had a story line... big deal.. if I wanted a story line I'd go see a play! There were many scenes that honestly just bored me. Chick in costume twirling a baton.. wow, I've seen high schoolers in marching band that can do that. Guys making hand puppets (WTF). Seriously way too much jacking around, not enough breath taking awesome things going on.

Perhaps I'm a hard sell, but I went to see O also this week (I'm way slammed with visitors lately), and O just took my breath away. It was the second time I saw it and both times it impressed me so much. It was beautiful and interesting, and some of the things these stage performers could do were so incredible. I didn't get that in Ka. I left feeling incredibly underwhelmed. 

Temping to give this a 2, but honestly the set was off the hook. This is what made the show for me. I wish they took better advantage of the cool treehouse looking structure thing, but seriously I didn't feel like the show lived up to the set built for it.

I have seen a bunch of Cirque shows and love most of them.  This was by far the least enjoyable. The entire first half was a yawn. A bunch of spear throwing and baton twirling that any high school drum major could do. I was seriously not impressed.

The later half was significantly better with more of the jaw dropping artistry that befits spending $500 for three people.  Some of the acts were truly amazing.  I have been to Cirque shows where there was a standing ovation at the end. Not the case here. Maybe 25% stood up (some heading to the exit) and I think this was very telling.

I think my disappointment is two fold. First, they spent too much time with the story and not enough time on the acrobatics.  Second, there are copious advertisements as one leaves the venue for discounted tickets (e.g., buy one ticket and get another one for $30).  Seats probably not as good as the ones I had (section 202, row CC) but still, it seriously cheapens the experience.

Since there don't appear to be too many bad seats, never pay retail or buy through the Cirque website (the Ticketmaster fee is ridiculous!) always buy from a half price ticket outlet. I bought mine through Vegas dot com where the ticketing fee was ""just"" $10 per ticket and the ticket was only discounted about $17 per seat.  However, since I bought my tickets online in advance, I could not take advantage of the discount offers advertised within the venue.

Overall, I'd prefer O or La Nouba over this any day (preference to La Nouba - in Orlando).



If you have never seen a Cirque production, you might like this, but see O at the Bellagio first if paying more the $50 per person.  Better yet, try to get comp'd if staying or playing on property at the MGM.",3,0,0

Don't be late - you'll miss some cool and fun stuff.  Also, after seeing the show twice, once sitting THISclose to the stage and a second time sitting farther away, I prefer to sit farther from the stage.  I got to see the entire set, in all its glory\/beauty and appreciated the show so much more.  Plus, seating farther from the stage are cheaper.  All this to say, engineers, computer geeks, gamers, construction folks, makeup artists, dancers, pyromaniacs, music enthusiasts, costume lovers, seniors, and youngins will find this show appealing.

The lowdown: storyline is about two royals (prince and princess) who become orphaned and separated.  The show follows each royal through a period of his and her life, including people\/places they meet\/see along the way.  It has a storybook ending.

Other important info: student discounts only available on certain days of the week, don't be late as this show starts promptly at schedule time, 'cheap' seats (sitting farther back) is preferred, interactive pre-show (again, don't be late or you'll miss the pre-show), adequate leg room in all rows, built-in speakers in head rest, pick up tickets well before show starts; other wise, your tickets will be sold to last-minute purchasers.

I got kind of addicted after seeing ""O"" in Las Vegas about 2 years ago, and I hope to see more of them (next on my check list is ""LOVE""). However, I would say of the 3 that I've watched, Ka was probably my least favorite. Maybe I expected too much, but I left the show a bit disappointed. 

Don't get me wrong, the rotating stage and the beautiful theatre were spectacular, but the show wasn't really what I expected after watching the other two. Since I believe this is the only CDS show with a full plot-line, I think it is much more dramatic than the other 2 that I've seen. The pre-show was all about scaring the audience, instead of making them laugh. I was missing the light-heartedness and the comedy that I have enjoyed with other CDS shows. The plot-line was a bit slow and I couldn't help but think that certain aspects of the show were just cliche. Although the performers were good, everything was focused on the plot-line, and it seemed like it jipped the audience on other aspects. I missed all of the jaw-dropping stunts and acrobatics I've seen with their other shows. The martial arts were just mediocre and I really wanted more.

That being said, my friends that went with me really did enjoy the show. For one of them, it was his 2nd CDS show, and the other 2 it was their very first. So, I guess maybe it's just because I've seen the others and now I have more to compare it to. I would just have to say that this show wasn't what I was expecting, and for that reason, I didn't really leave satisfied.

I still think that if you're going to fork over the cash to watch a CDS show in Vegas, go see ""O"" at the Bellagio. Even though the tickets for ""O"" were super expensive (especially compared to ""KA"", since I got the summer special for $55) and never discounted, it was worth every penny, and I would pay to go see it again.

I saw this show again this past weekend with my boyfriend who has never seen the show.  I do not recommend seeing this show until they restore the final battle scene.

Because of the recent accident, the final battle scene was replaced with a video.  The video is blurry and you don't really get what's going on.  I had to explain what was going to my boyfriend.  I love this show, but its really not worth seeing until they can restore the final battle scene.  

Seating:  Get a seat in the center.  I prefer seating in the back for this show.  This way, you can really see everything going on.

Tickets:  Buy the tickets on the cirque du soleil website.  They usually have a deal going on.  I've seen many cirque  du solleil show and I always buy  the tickets on their website.  I have always been able to find a coupon code that makes the tickets way cheaper.  

Show: This is my favorite cirque du soleil show bc it has a storyline.  The other CDS shows are a combination of acts.  This show is about the separation of twins, how they grow up and find each other again.  The storyline is a little cheesy...but the visual effects of this show is beautiful.

Also liked the fact that the ushers joked with the audience before the show began. A few drawbacks prevent this show from getting 5 stars:

1. Somewhat short. The show is about half the length of an opera for about 1.5 times the price. We were expecting a little more for $125 a ticket. I understand that the athletics and sets are out of this world, but still.

2. The revised ending is anti-climactic. I understand that they can't perform the original ending while the investigation is ongoing, but the substitute ending is boring. Perhaps a different climax other than the main characters applying make up in a dressing room?

3. Annoying audience members. There is a good reason why operas typically don't allow late arrivals, and if audience members have to use the bathroom, they will only be let back in during the intermission. People were streaming in after the show began and using the bathroom throughout the show (a frequent occurrence since giant steins of beer are sold right outside the theater). You can't get into a performance when someone's obese butt is blocking your view (or worse, when they've fallen on top of you as a result of bumbling and tripping in the dark).

I understand Ka is performed in Las Vegas, and it's unreasonable to expect a young, drunk audience to behave themselves compared to seasoned opera goers. But is it really too much to request that people not interrupt the show by entering and exiting multiple times during a 1.5 hour performance?

Overall, the show is a one-of-a-kind experience, and was fun enough that I would gladly pay $125 to see it again.

I did feel a little dense because I didn't understand the story. As we were leaving my mom admitted that she didn't get it either so I felt a little better. The actual performance, music, and entertainment was so good that it didn't really bother me that I didn't understand the story. 

The performers jump around the seating area before the show starts sneaking up on the audience. The interaction was cool, but I thought it might be a bit creepy for kids.

Once we get inside the theater we get to our seats.  We're about 7 rows back and front and center.  I did a good job with these seats, I paid for them too.  I think they were $150 a piece.  Once we got seated, another person took a few pics of us.  These ones were great with the stage behind us and pyrotechnics shooting fireballs in the air.  We ended up getting these ones after the show.  I sure as hell paid for these too, $45!  Geez, talk about a wallet raping.  That's just too damn much.  But the pics were nice and MDC wanted them so I had no choice.
Onto the show.... from the very beginning we were intrigued.  The story which I wont talk about was awesome.  It showed laughter, loyalty, pain, love and so much more.  My favorite part was when they told a story with their hands.  With the light behind their hands they made images on the wall.  I laughed and almost cried, it was truly amazing!  Great job to Cirque and KA

Will I again?.....I'd like to see more Cirque shows before I come back but I would love to see KA again.  Toot!",5,1,1

I chose it because of the story line, which I thought my son and I could enjoy, while my wife enjoyed the acrobatics.  My impression was one of ""Prince of Persia"" Cirque de Soleil style.  I wasn't far from the truth, but it still wasn't good enough.  The moving floor was cool, and during some ""fight"" segments the actors would slow down their movements to provide a ""slow-motion"" feel to the choreography.  Still, the story didn't seem to flow.  Two different plot lines, going seemingly different directions, and getting farther apart, are merged during the final moments that make the climax seem rushed and forgettable.  The best part could have been when the floor was vertical, giving an overhead view of a major battle.  Unfortunately the choreography looked more like stoned hippies dancing in the park than any sort of action scene.  Great concept, but poorly executed.",0,0,0

If you see any Cirque show, this one should be it.  Vegas shows suffer from all style, and no substance, flashy colors, and no soul.  Ka is the exception to this rule.

Several of the shows can suffer from their roots of being a circus: sequential acts play out, one by one, strung together with a simple plot, but is interjected with comedic clown acts.  It's a classic structure, but, in this humble critic's opinion, doesn't provide the ethos of a powerful and direct narrative.

Ka has a really nice linear plot that you can be immersed in, the acts don't feel patchwork, and the comedic moments are integrated seamlessly into the plot.  It's very well done, beautiful, and worth your time.  If you like feats of daring, movement, beautiful sets and costumes, or a theatre buff, this show accommodates all of these needs.

Also, periodically, MGM offers local discount tickets, two for one, buy one get one half off, etc.  So, you can see an amazing show at various prices... bargain hunt and you might really luck out.

We have seen nearly all the CDS shows and enjoy them very much, but KA is by far the worst. The decor is groovy and the stadium is very cool to check out before the show starts, but that's about where the interesting part ends. 

As the other reviews have mentioned, it is a story about a family etc and it takes FoReVeR to develop. It is just absolutely without rival if you are looking for a borrrrrrring show. They attack the family over and over and over and over mostly always from the audience shooting fake arrows (of course) and then they get displaced, turn up on a mountain or whereever and wait to be attacked again.

TIP: Loose the awful clowns and the deserted desert island scene as it is.             the worst scene of any play or anything we have ever seen in our life. It was actually embarressing because we took friends to KA and they had to sit through it. 

You should not waste too much time on this, which is a bummer to say as we really like the Cirque shows. Try O, or even the very old Mystere which is always groovy. Better than that, we went to Absinthe and it was great fun. It's not for everyone as it is a little more than rauchy, but it is very entertaining.

We went to the 7pm show, so doors opened at 6:15. The ushers are very interactive and friendly, and you will want to arrive kind of early anyway to see the pre-show.. you might get chased to your seat by one of the performers if you cut it close to starting time. The ushers also walk around and give children cushions to see better which I thought was nice and would appreciate if I had children. 

Like I said, I have nothing to compare it to but the performers are amazing. I have a very short attention span and had thought maybe I would get bored at some point throughout the show but by the end it felt like I hadn't blinked once. It is seriously an hour and forty minutes of non stop entertainment, with incredible music and an easy story line to follow (which doesn't even matter because the entire show is so easy on the eyes).

I would recommend, however, getting a seat closer to the back of the theater.  There are times where the performers literally fly over the audience and by not sitting so close to the front we were able to see everything.

A general tip for most CDS  - get seats a little further away from the stage.  Not only will you save a load of $$$, but you actually get a much better view! IMHO when you sit close to the stage you are missing out on the bigger picture, as there is a lot going on. 

I will certainly rank Ka as one of my favorite CDS shows. I have seen La Nouba, O, Mystere, Zumanity, La Reve (although not part of the Cirque Du Soleil) and a couple of traveling Cirque Du Soleil circuses. 

The storyline of Ka was easy to follow and struck a cord with me. The twin imperial siblings, main protagonists of Ka, follow a journey filled to self-discovery.

You hear this is Cirque's attempt at telling a story.  Umm... yeah.  The story made no sense.  An Asian couple from the Shogun era is separated and one goes on a deep see adventure and the other finds themselves inside the movie Metropolis.  Is this making sense to you?  Me neither.

If, like me, you believed this show was like a Chinese Acrobat show on steroids -- think again.  The entire Asian angle actually serves no purpose except to provide fierce painted masks for advertizing.  Every twenty minutes ninja like fight scenes break out, but they were tame and repetitive.  I saw the later show and the players looked weary. 

Some of the gentler bits were long, lame, forgettable, and should have been cut and replaced YEARS ago.  One such act I remember (it's only been two days at this writing) is an Asian girl twirling a baton.  That's right -- over a hundred dollars a seat to watch baton twirling.  That said, I'd keep the shadow puppet bit -- providing what was on each side side of it was amazing.

The show, however, isn't a total bust.  There are some terribly memorable images.  I don't want to wreck them, but the 'storm' scene was great and what immediately followed (with the bubbles) was literally tear jerking.  The clowns playing with the 'animals' soon afterwards was also quite fun.

But you can't discuss KA without discussing the B I G hydraulic device.  This 'device' is the most unique device you've ever seen in any show.  Without giving much away, any engineer will have his jaw agape the entire time this device is used, which is almost half the show.  If you're not an engineer, you'll still be absolutely amazed.  It had to cost a few zillion dollars by itself.

So here's the thing.  The device was the genius of this show, and makes it almost worth seeing.  The remainder of the show, story wise and conceptually, I'm sorry -- is a pleasant misfire of a disaster.  

If I had my way, I'd have this show close for a few months.  Remove and replace about four sequences.  Fix the story.  Remove the big flames and fireworks, or at least work them in a way that isn't so desperate.

BIGGEST NOTE:  If you're going to make this an Asian battle show, and have that big battle at the end on the device, and have acrobats on wires -- finish the thought.  That is, have a landscape battle with wires, a la CROUCHING DRAGON.  Why not?  You already have people wired up.  And so have a SPECTACULAR battle.  Have men on stage with arrows 'shooting' dudes in the side towers.  I'm not a battle person at all but if you're going to make dinner... SERVE IT.

Cirque can do way better than this half baked concoction.  KA nails the big stuff.  Now it needs to retool the little things.

I wanted to rate lower but I'm reasonable.  I'm embarrassed to say I spent $137 per ticket for three, wife and son came along, spending over $400.  Bullshit!  I even have to apologized to wife and son how SUCK the show was.  The show doesn't live up to a Cirque and Vegas caliber.  The show is so overrated by fellow Yelpers and in Vegas.  If you get free tickets and want to relax from the day of sightseeing of Vegas, then go, because the theater is nice cool with comfortable seats, haha.

The show started off slow and continued to be slow.  I was waiting for the climax and continued to wait, nothing happen.  Oh, before I forget, saw a couple in the front row walk off in the middle of the show.  We were in the third row center.  That how SUCK it was.  

The martial art was poor.  I called it kids stuff, very embarrassing to the martial art world.  Acrobatically, were there any?  If you say, guys and girls running around and jumping around, Acrobat, then go see it.  The show has to be rewritten to last.  I don't think it will last 'til next year.  It did have a storyline buy so what.  Every other show has some kind of storyline.

If you want a Vegas Cirque show, go see ""O"" at Bellagio.  It's a badass Cirque show.  Spend some money and get good seats between row 10 and 5 from the stage.  The next Cirque show if you want another Cirque show, then, go see La Reve at the Wynn.  La Reve was OK, nothing wows you.  ""O"" has that wow effects on you.  Everything about ""O"" has that wow effects from the theater to the show.  Trust me do not go see KA, wasting your time and cash.",1,0,0

The second time was after the unfortunate tragedy where one of the performers died during a performance. They had to change the end of the show to a projection of what the ending should have been and it was lackluster to say the least. The third time, they introduced a new ending.

So having seen it three times, I know some of the beats. That being said, there are STILL parts of the show that got me teary eyed. This is french, abstract, acrobatic art, yet they put enough story in there for the audience to care about the characters. The story isn't like groundbreaking nor will it make the most of sense, but you will know who is the bad guy and who is the good guy. 

What is such an amazing part of the show is that the show just doesn't take place on stage. You will have action happening all around you. It's almost an interactive experience as you whip your head around to catch all the action. This is by far one of my favorite things about the show.

The show does hit a slow spot and I just wish they would take it out. (Slight spoiler: Tarzan and ropes). When this point hits, it just feels like the show drags. People are just doing this forever. Luckily, I believe the next set change is where the most dramatic acrobatic act takes place, so at least the action gets going pretty quickly. 

The ending is an improvement on the projection. It is not as good as the original ending the first time I saw it. I don't blame them, I rather have something controlled than risk losing another life. It still is an impressive sight to see.

I say overall, the night I saw it for the third time, it seemed like all the fight scenes were going 3\/4 speed. It didn't seem as fast as it should have been. Not sure if that's just how it was supposed to look or if it was just how fast they were going on that particular night. It didn't take away too much from the overall production, as there is much more to the production than fight scenes.

This is still one of my favorite shows. The fact that this show provokes so much emotion from me AND still has time to perform awe-inspiring stunts is a testament to how good this show is.",1,0,1

And then there are these angry construction worker types (they appear to maybe have helmets?) and another group of painted guys who seem to be fighting like constantly.  With everyone.  It is completely impossible to follow the story or figure out who is on what side.  I had absolutely no idea what was going on here.  

You may like this show if you were on the flag squad or the drill team in high school...  lots of baton twirling tricks.  OH - and at one point, there is like 10 minutes of shadow puppets...  I AM NOT MAKING THAT UP!  And they were frankly a little pervy.  

I should mention that the staff is super helpful and friendly - although in character and some of them talk in this weird ""Hobbit-ese"" language.  You're never really sure WHY they're talking that way.  But they're nice.  Although they don't really enforce the no cell phone rule and the woman next to me was video taping the entire performance on her phone, which was distracting.  I really wanted one of the Hobbit folks to come and put a stop to that nonsense.

Minus one star because after the 7pm show it's a tight squeeze between when the people line up for the 9pm show so within minutes the staff starts barking and aggressively kicking you out. It kinda ruins that nice feeling you had of walking out of the theater. Perhaps to solve that problem they should have a separate exit. It really was unpleasant to watch people's moods instantly ruined by mean staff.
Minus one star because the one African American in the show did not have a true love in the end and while it may not seem like a big deal it really was.

Cirque has really pushed the boundaries and made some incredible new breakthroughs in theater technology that really merit seeing this show. 

I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because:
-- the story is very hard to follow if you don't know it going into it.
-- it drags at times, so you have to look around and find things to be amazed by during the parts that feel slow.
-- the finale fight scene reminded me of ""West Side Story"" - more dancing than fighting, and some of the minor fight scenes in the middle looked more impressive.

Each one has its own unique vibe, ""look,"" and energy.

Mystere is a tropical circus funk.  O is all about H20.  Zumanity is a play on human sexuality and pushes the limits of performing arts obscenity.  The Beatles LOVE is a celebration of music.

KÀ, is a clusterf*ck of fire, sand, earth...and everything inbetween.

With the exception of the new CRISS ANGEL Believe, I've seen all the Cirque du Soleil production shows on the strip and KÀ is probably my least favorite.

Don't get me wrong though! It's still quite good for a premium-priced show. Typical over-the-top entertainment you'd expect from Cirque, but compared to O, The Beatles LOVE, Mystere, and Zumanity --- it didn't really do much for me.

The interior of the auditorium (decked in dark woods and industrial steel columns) and intricate set pieces are visually stunning and massive, but the show itself lacked any real ""WOW"" factor that sets it apart from the others.

I was among the first few to catch a preview\/soft opening show of KÀ before general admission tickets were sold to the public, so they've probably tweaked some effects and performance segments since then.

If you've seen all the other Cirque shows in Vegas, but haven't seen this one yet, then go for it and buy yourself a seat to KÀ, but if you're looking to choose among all the options Sin City has to offer, I'd suggest passing this one up.",3,0,2

Heads up--It's a 2 hour show with no intermissions so try not to drink up all the delicious margaritas you can purchase inside the Ka Theater and end up missing even a second of the show.  Seriously, you'll hate yourself like I do.  Also, doors open half an hour before show time and the line gets freakishly long but remember that you already have assigned seating so unless you're planning on buying refreshments in the theater, you can just relax and have a few drinks at Rouge which is a bar next to where the line ended all the way from Ka's doors.  Just wait til the line settles down and you can stroll on in without the crowd.

I thought there would also be more pyrotechnics - the balls of fire prior to the start of the show were misleading. But, these low points were overshadowed by the stunts done on the amazing rotating stages. I loved the use of arrows throughout the show. If you can score a good deal, this show is a definite must see. By the way, I can't get the catchy soundtrack out of my head either.",2,1,3

I was with family so I thought eh, why not? I like getting dressed up to go see a big production like this and I know my mom paid a lot of money for us to see it.

We had tickets for a 7pm show and read on the ticket we had to be seated by 6:45pm. This kinda disappointed us since we hadn't eaten prior to picking up the tickets at will-call, it already being 6:30pm. Oh well, our bad. No star taken off for that. 

It was actually pretty cool after walking in. After the guys who were all dressed up playing their roles scanned our tickets, my family and I walk in and excitedly jumped in the line for popcorn and beverages. They have nice big cups for sodas and tasty popcorn. Well maybe the popcorn wasn't tasty, who knows?? We were hungry! I also ordered a black russian and oh so glad that I did.

Going to our seats we marveled at the people jumping up and down into the audience with their bungee cords and all the other actors and actresses running around entertaining people until it began. 

And so it began...What more is there to say? It was OKAY. That's it. I think it was about 2 twins on their journey through life and the adventures they go through. Like I said I'm not a Cirque person, and this does NOT mean I have no imagination but please, have some dialogue so I'm not lost already 10 minutes into a 90 minute show. Personally I liked the shadow puppets part and when the two guys were in the wheel. But as for all of it I wasn't too impressed. What was really amazing though was the set. This is a place you KNOW they spent a pooload of money creating. Too bad the actual show wasn't as impressive as the set.

My suggestion: See Mystere instead. Or save your money and see something a little less fancy shmancy but fun and engaging like Tournament of Kings.",1,0,0

The auditorium was massive, and you wouldn't really think a place so massive could be attached to a casino and hotel. We skipped the snacks and drinks since we just had a wonderful meal a Shibuya (review to come) and went straight to our seats. There were some of the performers hanging out with the audience before for the show and giving a good laugh with their wild antics. F.Y.I: Photography and video are strictly prohibited.

As soon as the show started it was edge of your seat excitement from start to finish. Who knew that something that really did not have any dialog in it would hold my attention and then some?! The movable\/elevated\/morphtastic stage is a must see!!! Some of the stunts the performers were doing were jaw dropping, and this show proves these individuals really have talent. Not only was the show full of acrobatic work, it also had a very sincere story (very touching). The music also accompanied the performance to the tee.

Yes, the engineering on the stage movements and design is mind boggling, and the performers are talented acrobats, but I didnt know what the fuck was going on during the entire performance.  I was afraid the performers would notice the contorted look of confusion and dismay on my face and fall off their ropes.  First they're on a boat that sinks, then some of them wash up on a sandy shore, then somehow they're in an arctic tundra, and then in a lush jungle, and finally in some volcanic underground lair.  Again, WTF?  The synopsis on the Ka website didnt help.  Just dispense with the impossible to follow ""storyline"" and have the players jumping around in colorful outfits doing insane things with their bodies.  I can accept that.  And why are the characters talking in gibberish?  And why must there be the insipid comic relief elements, this time in the form of bad French-like mimes?  And this might be picky, but during group scenes, some of the performers were out of sync with one another.  Sometimes a performer would notice he was out of sync, then stop what he was doing, and join in again later when he could actually keep up the pace.

The story lost me faster than my organic chemistry professor. Staying awake was a stuggle, and I had slept in.

So while I think KA is DEFINITELY worth seeing, it's not a show I'd recommend seeing more than once.

The overall aesthetic of KA was a mixture of Asian and Mad Max (steampunk) which was interesting and made for some visually impressive costumes and set designs. However, a lot of the martial art sword dancing, acrobatics, and aerial acts are things you could see in other CDS performances--the real star of the show is the moving stage\/platform. A lot of the battle scenes, particularly the finale, that made use of the moving platform were fantastic and really made us oohing and ahhing.

But I think what Zarkana really does better than KA is to keep the transitions between sets engaging with the audience and to ensure they don't take longer than 5 minutes. With KA, oftentimes there were 2+ transitions where not a lot was happening. Ticket prices are consistently more expensive too, biasing me to favor Zarkana in the end.",1,1,1

When it comes to the show itself, I was blown away. It's always nice seeing shows like this to remind you how amazing people can be. The acrobats flying around on those ropes and doing flips on the stage blew me away. There was one act where a girl is twirling two different stick things very quickly, throwing them in the air, spinning, etc. without dropping them once. 

The stage pivoted around and went vertical several times where there are amazing fight sequences and effects. I seriously worried a little because I felt like someone could get hurt if they fell accidentally. 

I haven't seen any other Cirque shows yet, but from my understanding, they are all nothing less than amazing.

I do not blame the actors, they did their part. The show just needs a trip back to the drawing board.  However, there were a couple of very memorable scenes but they could not save the show. 

My boyfriend fell asleep and he is a bigger fan of the shows then me. Also, judging by the audinence's reaction I can say that the majority of people were unimpressed as well. Very little clapping and zilch awe's and oh's. 

There are built in speakers in the seats. Probably to keep you alert, which you will definitely need when watching this show. Unfortunately, it was not enough to keep my bf awake. 

Upon entry into the theatre it looks as though some crazy shit is gonna  go down. There are several huge columns on either side from floor to ceiling but don't let that fool you, actors do a bit of swinging between the different levels, that's pretty much it.

To whomever stated that there are no dangerous stunts until the end, they need to realize that dealing with the moving stage with no railings and the dangerous angles throughout the show are feats in themselves. A KA performer died a couple years, so just because the artists make the performance seamless and effortless doesn't mean that there are no elements of danger.

The theatre is incredible and the sets are extremely sophisticated.  We got discounted tickets through Tix4Tonight and I didn't bother to buy the Category 1 tickets.  I can understand the benefit of sitting up close but Ka is a 270 degree sensory experience so it's not really necessary get super-close to the performers.

For Cirque du Soleil virgins, I recommend a more traditional Cirque show.  However, for veterans of Vegas and traveling Cirque du Soleil shows like myself, Ka is different enough from the others so you don't feel like you're watching the same acts over and over again.  

My two favorite parts were not acrobatic at all.  The beach scene with the huge crab, centipede, sea turtle and starfish was cute and captivating.  The shadow puppet act was incredible - never have I ever seen such realistic shadows of animals that express so much emotion. I was constantly wow-ed by the creativity and the quality of the performance.",3,0,2

This show told a story about two siblings who were separated at a young age and went on to live different lives. Eventually they meet again. Of course there's more to the story, but I can't spoil it for you! 

The performers were great. Sooo athletic and every movement was perfection. Some of them even came out before the show started and scared some audience members (myself included). 

I love how the whole arena was their stage. It made it more interesting and kept the audience on the edge of their seat. 

Even the ushers helping people find their seats were in costume and in character. I think Cirque hired all comedians to be the ushers, because they were all hilarious!

KA is one of a host of Cirque de Soleil shows offered by MGM Mirage.  At $165 million it was the most expensive to produce, and is chock full of technical wizardry.  Like the other Cirque shows, its main attraction is the skill of its performers.  Unlike the other Cirque shows, there's a plot - but just barely.  It's probably best to read a synopsis of the plot prior to going, then pretty much ignore the plot while you're watching.

The actual action that you expect from a cirque performance was really awesome! Although I felt like there wasn't enough of it, there were parts that moved way to slow when I wanted to see the action and stunts that cirque is known for.

What an awesome show!  We had pretty good seats, they were somewhere in the middle of the lower section but the theater isn't that large and during the show, the crew does acrobatics all over the theater-not just on the stage so I feel like there really isn't a bad seat in the theater.  

What I really enjoyed was that everyone was in character, even before the show started.  There were people that were part of the cast standing the doorways to greet us and they introduced themselves and they were definitely in character.  Some were very serious and some were funny and quirky, it was awesome.  Someone even introduced himself to us and said if we needed anything, to go ahead and let him know.  They had ushers at the ends of the aisles to help us find our seats.  

The cast was also walking around and they were in character the entire time before the show started, it seemed like they were Turing to ""build"" the story.  It's almost as if the show started as soon as we walked into the theater and now when everyone was seated.  It was so entertaining trying to figure out what was going on when the cast members were walking around, talking to each other in the made up language that they have.  They were climbing railings, doing somersaults, etc.  It was funny.  

A photographer came to take a few pictures of my boyfriend and I before the show started and she said they would be available for purchase right outside of the theater after the show was done.  

The show has a pretty good story to it-it's about journeys, conflict and love.  What's really amazing is the performers do acrobatics on, over and around the stage.  They even have moving platforms and lifts to help with the effects and change in the scenery throughout the show.  It's pretty mind-blowing how to climb, jump and bounce on and off of them.  What a great show!",6,3,5

They had only one solo act "" spinning wheels "" same as in KOOZA but not as well done. Another difference: no live music. 
The show has too much story and no act at all. If you are going to see KA keep your expectations low because all you will see is amazing stage and lots of dancing. Do not expect great acts like  in Allegria, Kooza, Mystere and other shows. KA is different in a bad way.

Everyone talks about the inverted stage - and yeah - that is pretty unreal. It's just simply amazing. 

The lead-up to the beginning is also great to help set up the story for the audience. If you're in your seat 15 minutes before showtime (as you should be - I hate late comers!), you'll have some of the acrobats suspended and zipping around above you. Very fun. 

The story is great and of course very feel-goody at the end....the music and costumes, along with the set, really sell the story-telling part of KA.

This show is also well known for being technically challenging to create because of the moving platforms, also it is an act with a storyline with love, happiness, family, friends and separation. Even though the tickets were above $100 it was definitely worth that cost. This show literally blew my mind as I haven't seen a Cirque Du Soleil show before.

While spending a few days in Vegas, I had a hard time deciding which Cirque show to see. There are so many! After receiving a strong recommendation from a coworker for Ka and attending Ka's free preview talk\/behind the stage 'show,' I was sold. 

The venue is awesome! It's in the MGM Grand near all their major restaurants. They have displays of the costumes in the front foyer area, where you can see a huge winding dragon and gong. The auditorium is awesome, with various climbing\/flying apparati which kind of made me feel like I was inside some really large ship.

The show has a storyline of siblings being separated and finding each other, which others have said is not a common theme in Cirque shows (having a storyline, that is).

They use a huge rotating stage that is just incredible to see. It's also sensitive to touch, and would change depending on the routine happening upon it. Otherwise, it is covered in sand (specific cork pieces) during a really intense battle scene that was amazing.

I've seen about 10 different Cirque shows and this was probably the most disappointing.  I had read that Ka was supposed to be the most extravagant of Cirque productions and based upon the caliber of other Cirque shows I was expecting to be wowed.  I was not.  

The theater is very elaborate but not put to good use at all.  All those ramps that you see on the sides of the stage, what was their purpose?  The only time I saw them used during the performance was when archers fired arrows from it.  That's all.  You had to spend all that money to build those only to have them used for that purpose?  Oh I guess a few acrobats swung from them at a couple of points during the performance.  SWUNG from them.  Not used them for any elaborate act.  Just swinging from them back and forth.  Yawn.

The story line is weak.  The ""romance"" was pretty contrived.  Basically the main characters meet members of the opposite sex and for some inexplicable reason, fall in love.  I had to look up the story on Wikipedia after the show because I didn't understand everything in the story.

The only thing impressive about the show is the rotating stage.  That's the real star.  The acrobatics were weak and almost non-existent.  There was a lot of choreography but little of the acrobatics that made Cirque du Soleil famous.  For example, the wheel of death act has already been done in a different Cirque show (I can't remember which one but I'd seen it before) and it was done much better in the other show.  And the flute twirling was pretty much what you would see from any high school majorette twirling a baton in a parade.  I kept expecting something amazing to happen and it never did.

The projection is a bit blurry and low quality. It brings the excitement level of the show to a screeching halt! Completely leaves a bad taste in your mouth and taints the entire experience. They should come up with something new or remove the scene entirely.

Bottom line, as a buyer you should be aware of this.  Everything leading up to the finale was great, but this really was a huge letdown.

Probably letting the performers catch their breathe.  I'm sure that's typical.  But, I HATE when shows are late.  I can't wait for friends and family of mine to see this show so we can talk about all the awesome effects!!!  AMAZING!",0,0,0

I was skeptical because last time we were in Vegas we saw O, which was underwhelming. It was the one everyone seemed to love and it was the most expensive but although it had its magical moments, it seriously lagged. The clown bits were tedious,frequent, and the music was sleepy.
Ka looked amazing on the websites and the ads (so did O) but this time it did not disappoint! The acrobatics are so cool and the production value is insane. There was one clown bit near the beginning which was short and sweet, and the clowns were acrobats as well so it tied in neatly with the rest of the story. 
One of the better cirque shows to see with a guy because there's fighting and loud music, and fire, and a finale of indoor fireworks. We were sat near the back and wouldn't have wanted to be any closer because a lot happens up in the air.
Well worth the price of admission.",2,1,1

We were not impressed, and there's too many other shows to see.  It was my girlfriends first Cirque show, and she didn't like it. Where's the acrobatics she asked?

We loved the baton twirler!  We loved when the acrobats flew and swung around on the wall.

Honestly; one of the most boring shows produced by Cirque. Every show I've seen, I'm on the edge of my seat and watching in wonderment. This one...I wanted to leave. 

After looking up some details of the show, apparently it was made to be HEAVY on its story (which is not cohesive yet at the same time predictable). But if you're into Cirque because of the acts, stunts, and WOW-factor, this is NOT that show.

Sad that there were a ton of mistakes in the show I saw as well, so much that I couldn't enjoy the show, I just had anxiety through each performance that something was going to go wrong. Luckily not during a dangerous scene; but definitely lots of stick stopping and one of the wheel of death guys tripping on his jump rope while running around on the outside.

These critiques aside; the theater and the stage set up is worth 10*!! It's technical aspects and theater are just amazing.",3,1,0

Starting from the moment you walk in you are transported into another time.  Like I said, the little things I enjoyed here: the in-character ushers, speakers in the headrest, more action in the audience during the show.

As we walked in, the usher we approached reminded me of Captain Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean, a little drunk but clear enough to point me in the general direction.  The other ushers were just as entertaining, accosting people for using their ""lightning boxes"" in the theater (camera flash).  I've been to Le Reve and O, as well as Believe, and none of the ushers were quite as entertaining.  O does have a few clowns that walk around before the show harassing people, but not like KA.

The other added touch I like was the surround sound speakers installed in the headrest.  I do not know if this was the case for all seats (we were in the front section towards the middle).  I was able to sink into my seat to get a great view above and around me; the music\/special effects blasting behind my head were an excellent touch.

Overall the show is excellent.  The stage is amazing, the special effects are amazing and the cast is amazing.  I particularly like the fact that the show has a plot (which is why I liked Believe and Le Reve but didn't like O as much) which is easy to follow without a single spoken word (there is guttural noises and laughing, though).

I will be going again as soon as I can afford it.  It's worth every penny.",3,2,4

My boyfriend and I are avid Cirque fans. Being from Hawaii, we rarely have decent shows, so we try our best to attend as many shows\/events (especially Cirques) when we're overseas. My 6 friends and I did some research, as some have already watched Mystere and O, we figured we'll give KA a try since they have good reviews and have been around for a while. What a big mistake....

This was our 5th Cirque show to attend. When walking in, we were mesmerized by the stage layout and the music. We were so excited!!! And a couple of our friends have NEVER seen a Cirque show so we were anticipating a great show! 

Yelpers...Sorry to say, you guys misled me on this one. I agree with Gina W. These 4-5 star reviews are truly deceptive, especially if you've seen multiple Cirque shows, whether the stationed ones in LV\/NY or the on-tour shows. I've watched Quidam, Totem, Mystere, Amaluna. ALL are better than KA. Yes, KA may have had the story line, but the acrobatic part left me dry. It was weak... CIRQUE is about entertainment! From the storyline, the music, the humor, and AMAZING ACROBATS. Only 2 things came out of this show. Storyline and Music. The rest were non-existent. The pendulum part? The guy almost died doing the jump rope by tripping on his back foot. He eventually attempted only twice and threw the jump rope out. The baton action? Sad to say, but this was probably the coolest part of the show. The hand puppet, the continuous dropping of the javelin\/spear thing, the annoying big lady, the weird bugs and sand, the creepy kylo-ren looking mofo standing in the back while the baton lady did her thing. This show was all too weird, monotonous, and simply annoying. Over-rated and over-priced. 

Something positive? The stage was pretty awesome, clever. The seats with cupholders were comfortable with sounds coming out of the head rest. 

If you're a first time Cirque attendant, you may like this one. But the friends I brought with me, who were first timers, didn't quite enjoy it to the fullest, as they admitted, they were BORED and actually fell asleep at one point! They were being modest and said they couldn't compare it to another show but we all know KA was a clear disappointment. I'm glad we didn't witness any accidents though. 

Go watch a different (Cirque) show instead. Even a non-cirque show like Absynth, I heard, was top-notch. Skip this one unless you've watched everything else, or you REALLY ENJOY sleeping.",5,2,1

Tickets come in at $175 each but in this area there is a cross aisle in front of you and you are elevated to the next upper section so there are no heads to block your view. 

It is true, Sad to say that some of my invited guest have not been as ""over the top"" about ""KA"" as I am, they have all enjoyed it but have liked ""Love"" better. Love is a great show from start to finish.

This is the very first time in cirque history that they dumped the typically cirque performance rule book to create as I like to refer to it.

With a stage that weighs as much as a 757 jet (so I am told) but the stage moves and rotates during the show.

Everything is over the top on this show. It is a story first and foremost and then you mix in acrobats, shadow puppets, men running around a wheel of death about 30 feet in the air and amazing sound and excellent lighting. 

There is a scene in the show that involves a woman drowning with soft music and mood lighting that when it is over you will probably say ""how did they do that""

I would have easily given them a 5 star rating when I saw the original production, but since the accident, they had to change the last fight scene, which is totally understandable. I personally think they should have halted the production for the time being, so the cast and artistic directors can create a better alternative ending, especially if they're charging the original price.  Luckily I ordered my tickets online (Cirque Du Soleil summer special), and got them for a much cheaper price compared to what you had to pay at the ticket office.  ($70 vs $130).

The part that substituted the last fight scene seemed like a last minute, quick fix. It was an out-of-place transition (for those who have seen the original show).  Usually Cirque Du Soleil have wonderful transitions and a cohesive storyline (from start to finish), but the revised ""KA"" was definitely missing the mark.

I want to compare these 4 shows only because they have similar whimsical approach, family-friendly and kids-friendly. 
NOTE: Keep in mind that there are ALWAYS offers at the box office and their website. You can also purchase tickets at the Half Price Show Tickets booths everywhere on the strip.

* Mystere (Treasure Island): starting at $85 for regular price (Category 3) to $119 for regular price (Category 1).

* KA show (MGM): starting at $99 for regular price (Category E) to $150 regular price (Category B).

* Zarkana (Aria): starting at $99 for regular price (Category D) to $155 for regular price (Category B).

* ""O"" (Bellagio): starting at $109 for regular price (Category D) to $155 for regular price (Category B). There are options to purchase VIP Suite Seating but only sell for party of 2 or 4.

____________________________________________

KA is the third show I watched out of the list of shows above. I watched it cos we happened to receive offers for staying at MGM as hotel guests. Interesting enough, MGM is the only place that features both hard-core UFC matches and martial arts acrobatics. Who would have thought?

KA has the second cheapest range of tickets. I personally think it deserves to be more expensive than Zarkana but who I am to say! *hic* Even if you could only get tickets for the back seats, go for it if you really have nothing to do at Vegas (unless you are into gambling)! I remembered that we sat towards the very back because there were not many tickets left. We were able to see everything just fine! The theater is not humongous like the ""O"" Show, but it was big and packed with so many people! I don't remember that you can take photos here... You should double check. Anyways, should focus in the whole story instead of taking photos!!!!

People mention a lot about having a simple story line. True that! I think all the stage movements, flying characters and excellent sound and stage management were complicated enough to make this one simple story shine. I remember asking myself ""How did they do that?? How did gravitational force work here??? Are they okay???"" When you watch this show, you will understand! This is one of the shows that I will gladly come back to watch again and again!",10,3,3

So far, the Cirque shows we have seen are Love, Mystere, and Michael Jackson, but KA was by far the worst. The show is incredibly long and unbelievably boring. The show consisted mostly of fake fighting and baton twirling. You won't really see any of the awesome stunts that Cirque is known for. 

The big finale was cut out since the death of one of the performers and replaced by a big screen showing a movie of what the finale used to look like.

The girl twirling the baton (?) was incredibly skilled and fun to watch and the wheel with the two guys balancing and running was terrifying yet captivating and exciting to watch.

You really can't go wrong with Cirque Du Soleil, but honestly this show has been by far one of my least favorite Cirque shows I've seen so far (I've seen about five) -- my boyfriend even fell asleep during the show, which says a lot about this show!!!

This show has a story behind it, which I couldn't quite follow during the show, my boyfriend even Googled the story line to understand it better after the show. Sure, the costumes were elaborate and there were a couple cool scenes, but mostly it was fighting scenes and none of the ""wow"" factor that usually comes with these types of shows. I was bored to be honest. I also saw quite a few people that were sitting around us leave early as well.

Ka was my first Cirque show and I enjoyed it.  The production values were great and the stage and theater were both very impressive.  The show feels like a real spectacle and with the amazing stage, Ka feels like a show that you could only see in Vegas.

There are other good things about Ka.  I really liked how they made the show cinematic.  With the music and the great lighting, there are moments in the show that feel like you are watching a movie on the big screen (the best example is when they make the stage look like its underwater and with the curtain and lighting, it appears that one of the performers is saving someone from drowning and rising to the surface--very well done).

They try to tell a story with Ka too.  It is not a great story, but the story elements kept my interest in Ka more than Mystere (which was more like a series of disjointed vignettes).  Still, after a while, I felt like I had seen enough and I got a little bored.

There are definitely some strong acrobatics, but you might not see the big and more traditional acrobatics like you would see in Mystere.  Still, there is a piece with huge moving spheres that is very exciting, suspenseful and fun.

Ticket prices for Ka are not too bad.  You can typically find tickets for a lower price than O.

The theater is nice (with a good temperature) and they had some decent concessions.  The theater is also roomy enough and does not feel as packed or hot as Mystere's theater.

I enjoyed Ka.  I am not sure if I am ever going to be a huge fan of Cirque shows, but I thought there were mainly elements of Ka that will stick with me (much more than Mystere).  With the very nice venue, the amazing stage and the great cinematic elements, Ka feels like a special and worthwhile show (definitely worth considering if you are in Vegas and looking for a good show).

Ka is in the MGM Grand, which features free parking (both valet and a parking structure--very easy to find a spot in this parking structure).",31,21,28

The reason why I was not blown away by Ka, is because, I have seen Le Reve (The Dream) at The Wynn and I think that show was definitely way better than Ka.... It is this show in water, there is water in the pool, water flowing from the top etc..... Much better than Ka, but you can read all about that show in the review I shall be writing for Le Reve.

Of the Cirque du Soleil\/Franco Dragone shows, I've seen Mystere, Love, Zumanity, OVO, Ka, O (2x), Le Reve (2x)

My top two favorites are KA and O. I've recommended the two to every single person visiting Las Vegas with limited time\/money.. and if they planned to watch others, those two must be enjoyed last to avoid being prematurely desensitized. All Cirques are beautiful & captivating in their own way, but many of us forget how to appreciate things once we've seen\/tasted\/felt\/heard ""the best"".. Think of the kind of practice and endurance it requires for all Cirque performers to do this twice a day every.single.day. 

Incroyable.

Keep your eyes, ears, and nose ready for a sensational treat.


P.S. Book early, get Orchestra Center seats, around 5-15 rows from the stage. For both O and Ka, you don't want to sit too close or you may strain your neck.

Yes, the rotating stage was kinda cool, but some of the lulls were quite interminable, and the show felt quite drawn out, in favor of storytelling, at the expense of O- or Mystere-like acrobatics.

The price point is also at a premium to older Cirque shows on the strip, where I feel you can get a more value-conscious, old-school Cirque experience that is more acrobatics-heavy and ""cirque""\/street performer-inspired.

Anyone who gave this show less then five stars should give up on live theatre because I don't think anything will ever entertain you.  You have got to be braindead to not enjoy this show!
First off when you walk into the theatre it is like you are in another world.  Even the ushers are acting like people from this empire where Ka takes place.  The theatre alone was breathtaking.  Go early so you can just sit and marvel at how awe-inspiring the theatre is.  Yes it is only 90 minutes but it was the best 90 minutes of theatre that I have ever experienced in my life.  The first ten minutes was a little slow but then the show gets going and it does not stop.  I won't give any of the special effects but I just want to say prepare for your mind to be blown.  
Another reason I love Ka is the price.  I absolutely loved O but at $110 for the cheapest ticket I don't think I will be going back for any return trips.  I have seen Ka twice, the first time I paid $65 and the second time I paid $55.  Look for deals, there are always deals for this show.  It was the best $65 I ever spent.

This is my 3rd Cirque Du Soleil-esque show that I have seen.  I have seen Beatles - Love and Le Reve - The Dream, both of which were amazing shows.  While watching Ka I was amazed throughout the performance and the acrobatics were top notch.  

The only reason I only give this an ""OK"" is because the ""Final Battle Scene"" that had captivated audiences with vertical sword play for years has been removed.  Even to the curtain call my girlfriend and I looked at each other wondering where the climax to the story went.  

We spot to the front desk afterwards and asked where the climax to the story went.  It turns out they did away with it in exchange for a ""Wedding Ritual"" scene.  I then responded by asking -IF- they told anybody about this, they simply responded, ""No because it is still a 90 minute show.""  

Although, it was a tragedy.... again my heart goes out to her and her family.  Respectfully if you take out a Finale you lose heart of the show.  The sword play at the beginning should be alluding to sword play at the end.  Instead, the new ending felt incomplete and abrupt.

Ok... this show had been so hyped up to me that I was disappointed after seeing it this past weekend... wait... let me explain please.

The stage (revolving \/ twisting \/ front \/ side \/ back to back) was cool. THAT was cool. The rest... was ok. 

The theater itself was gorgeous and huge... the crew did an amazing job... the sound system was just right (not to deafening that you can't hear afterwards...) 

BUT... I've seen most of the Cirque du Soleil shows here in the Bay Area and they were all far better than Ka. The acrobatic stuff in the Bay was far more extensive... granted at Ka they were going up side to side... I wasn't blown away like the others I've seen.

At the end of the day... if this is your first Cirque... you'll probably be hooked... at least I got to see it and see what the hype was all about... Now I want to target watching ""O"" and ""Zumanity"" next time around.",6,6,6

It takes place in a beautiful, but very dark theatre , the music was very dreary and somber, the acts were unimpressive, and the story was very difficult to follow.

This innovative stage allows for multiple angles and even allows for actors to vertically climb up the stage as a wall.  Computer generated effects create accompanying waterfalls, tumbling rocks, etc to fall as performers climb said wall.

Dialogue is non-existent in KA as characters rarely speak, but when they do it is a made up language.  But characters do speak through their body with accompanying music to better convey their ""words.""  Parts of the show were funny, which was a surprise because I thought it would be all action given the large influence of martial arts styles.

I would rank ""O"" and ""Le Reve"" (non Cirque) at the very top.

If you are looking to shell out $100 per ticket, get bored, and find a way to fall asleep at a show, KA delivers!!!

It is the only Cirque Du Soleil that tries to tell a story.  The story is easy to understand; however, the acrobatics, musical score, and sword play were poorly designed and delivered.  I found myself wondering when this show would end!!  I can not tell you how many times I looked at my watch.  And, as I surveyed the audience around me, many were either sleeping or doing the same as me.

There were only three cool things from the show:

1.  The stage.  It was pretty impressive to see the mechanics and engineering of the stage.
2.  I enjoyed the scene where the ship sank and you can see the passengers drown into the water.  A stream of bubbles floated down from the ceiling.  Pretty amazing spectacle.
3.  Second scene that I enjoyed that involved ZERO acrobats were the hand signs.  Basically, a couple sat behind a lantern.  They used their hands to make different type of creatures that is ""shadowed"" onto a huge screen in front of the stage. One of those, ""how did they do that moment?""

Finally, if you decide to attend the show, I would recommend the following:
a.  Bring a pillow, you will fall asleep
b.  Unlike other Cirque Du Soleil where any seat is a good seat, I would recommend buying tickets CLOSER to the stage.  If you are seated in the back row, you do not get a true sense of the amazing stage mechanics....  Trust me... this is absolute.. if you sit in the back, you will fall asleep faster!!!
c.  Go to the restroom BEFORE the show.  It goes straight for an hour and 45 minutes or so.

Tips:
--Purchased the tickets at tickets4tonight (at the mall), a pair of ""level 2"" seats for $185

--Go early.  Get your hungover ass up early, buy tickets...and immediately cab over to MGM to reserve your seats.  We went at 2:00 and basically were one of the last to pick up the tickets for a 9:30 show

This is a different format from your typical Cirque Du Soleil show. Many of their shows feature dreamlike and abstract story lines. This show was more like an action movie!

One of the coolest scenes is when there is a fight scene choreographed on a perpendicular stage. It's amazing how visual these shows are. You're always surprised. If you pay attention to the ""sand"" they have, it's actually made of cut up corks!

Mystere was just a series of vignettes that were silly and sometimes cool, but didn't add up to much.

Ka, on the other hand, has a loose plot which, while not much as far as plots go, was great at keeping the flow of the show going. The vaguely-Asian themed show fit music with plot and acts together really well. There were the usual overly-theatrical moments and some stock characters, but I didn't find it to be over-the-top as much as Mystere was. Yes, you need to suspend your disbelief for some of it, but the costumes were amazing--the stunts are amazing and it feels like you are in a different place.

We paid about $70 per ticket and had decent seats about halfway up on the edge of the center section. I think most of the seats were good in the theater.

The story (of a brother and sister who are separated by war and both find true love mbeofre being reunited), costume (asian\/tribal), set design (steampunk\/pirate), and music were all good. The people who seat you are all dressed and in character as if they belong to the village from the show, which was cool. 

One highlight was the how some of the performers in beach or bug creature costumes. There was even a hand shadow sequence that was very well done. The standout acrobats were two guys on giant hamster wheels that were moving like a double Ferris wheel. One guy got out of his wheel and skipped rope on top of the moving circle - without being attached toa wire. There was also wire work, arrows flying, and onstage fireworks.

This was our first Cirque but second Cirque-type show. I might have been more thrilled if I hadn't seen Le Reve first, which set the bar impossibly high.

This show has more of a story line than others, but stays true to the acrobatic background. The stage and set was amazing, it alone is worth the money. The seats were comfy and I liked the speakers in the headrest. We had perfect seats lower section row L, right in the middle of everything. You could feel the heat of the fire. 

My husband did not want to see this, but  I made him go with me. After the show he was glad we went, he loved it and even recommended it to others!!!

Of course tickets can be pricey, but they do give 30% military discounts !!!(only at KA box office inside MGM)

This show was awesome, I hope to see it again!!!!",1,0,0

The most impressive part though is the inanimate star of the show, the incredible stage. It raises, lowers and pivots eleventy billion different directions and is quite the engineering feat.

There were so many we didn't know which one to pick!  I really wanted to see Zumanity and O, but with so many positive reviews about Ka, I decided to go with Ka.

I was disappointed.  I've seen two Cirque shows, both travelling (Totem and Quiddam).  I guess I expected more since I was so impressed by the stunts of the prior two shows, especially Totem.  

The stage is truly spectacular, and a few of my favorite parts included the shadow fingers and the guy jumping rope on the wheels.  I thought it was quite amazing that the stage could rotate the way it did.  

The stunts just aren't as breathtaking as the other shows I've seen I guess.  By that I mean there aren't unicycle girls flipping bowls or a guy doing triple flips on a beam.  

If this is your first Cirque show, I'd recommend it, but I feel like I should have picked O instead.",0,0,0

First and foremost, the hydraulic stage was engineering porn.  it raises, lowers, pivots, rotates, and anything else you want.  Pegs shoot out on cue to provide acrobats with grasping points.

Like many of the other Cirque du Soleil shows, sitting near the rear has its benefits.  you see all of the action on stage, plus the side action that surrounds the audience.  Sitting up front means you'll have to strain your neck from side to side, up and down to catch all of the show.

Another great thing is that there is no real spoken language.  Anyone can sit through it, understand, understand, and enjoy the show.  Speakers built into every seat means the music is always booming in your ears.

KA is definitely worth every penny;  I wouldn't need to think twice to watch it again.",5,7,6

We were able to catch two Cirque shows while in Vegas and this quite possibly was the best.  There is so much going on in this performance and crazy cool acrobatics.  The performers must have nerves of steel.  The theater itself is amazing and appeared to be similar to a giant playground for the performers.  It looked like they were having a lot of fun on all fronts.

The stage.... what a crazy piece of technology.  It moves, sways, flips around, and inverts itself while the performers are doing their thing on it.  The story is excellent and easy to follow.  There was seriously not a dull moment either - no lulls or opportunities to catch your breath.  I was clinching my armrests most of the time while watching the high flying stunts and choreography.  

This was the event we chose via part of the vacation package so were fortunate to see this at no added cost.  Our seats were perfect as well.

As soon as I entered the theatre, I was greeted by staff already in costumes and acting their part. Even before the show started and while everyone is getting seated, we see tribal\/barbaric people swinging around the theatre and running around on the floor  yelling and screaming in an unknown language. I didn't know what to think, but I loved it!

There is a very Asian theme to the show. The costumes were Asian influenced. There was martial arts in the acrobatics. It reminded me of a Peking Opera.

The huge rotating and moving multi-purpose platform was crazy! It's just so interesting how it is used in almost all the scenes. 

The music is great, memorable, and really enhances the story. 

Unlike the other Cirque shows, there is a simple and easy to follow story that just pulls the whole show together.

I can definitely recommend this show. It may not have the most original or best plot, but it just works together as a whole and there was quite a few acrobatics that left me gasping!",1,0,1

I never went to a cirque solei show before and I hate acrobatic shows like on tv and stuff so I didn't have high expectations.. well as far as thinking I would enjoy myself.. well already when I came in it was impressive.. The stage the teatre... you wouldn't expect it to be like that before you go inside.. it also smelt like teatre inside.. A smell I recognize from my childhood when I used to go to musicals and i love that smell... in the beginning when then the acrobats are walking trough the crowd and hanging above you was interesting and I felt for that little show about if you make pictures.. until of course they trew the camera down (people who have seen the show know what I mean) the thing the use during the entire show like this screen or what ever it's called.. wow that's such a great idea !! It was all and all spectacular and it was kind of emotional to!! The music and the movements... it was like a fairytale... When we got out i was really full with it.. it was so wonderful.. I will remember this forever.. ADVISE FOR SEATING!!  I don't think you should have to pay a ridiculous price to sit in front.. we sat in the middle row right in the middle of the room and in the back way up.. These were the cheapest but also the best seats !!! Like this you can see everything happen.. unless you got real bad eyes.. Also when I went only 20% of the teatre was full.. Some people just went down to have better seats for free... I didn't do that since I tot I had the best spot and didn't think this was classy.. but I think it's a waist to spend 100 dollars more for ""better"" seats..

While in Vegas my boyfriend and I watched 4 cirque du soliel shows (including this one) and this was our favourite! I personally thought it was much better then 'O'.

Our seats where in the front section about 7-8 rows from the stage and I thought they gave us a excellent view of the stage. But obviously you have to turn to the side to see the performers on those set pieces that are on either side of the theatre. This may bother some people, not us.

The seats should have been $170, but we booked them with the discount ticket place by coca cola world for about $90.

Prices were good; I called to get discount pricing on Saturday and there were no other options (other than military, student, and AAA discounts, which weren't much). I'm used to paying locals price because I used to have a friend that loved here and we got our tickets at 2 for 1 pricing. Since then, I've refused to pay more than $100 for tickets because I know they come cheaper. Total came out to around $65, inclusive of taxes. 

They say to come an hour early to pick up tickets from will call. Unlike all of the cirque shows I've seen, the line was so short at the booth and there was no line to get in the theater. Overall, the theater was maybe less than half full. Also, it's a small-ish theater. We had category E tickets and were only sitting 4th row up from the middle of the theater. Even the back row didn't look awfully far. 

To be honest, Ka has one of the most impressive theaters that I've seen. They made really good use of the spaces on the walls by adorning them with lights and cool little balconies. A lot of the acrobats also used them in their scenes. The seats are all equipped with their own speaker behind your head, so the sound effects and music were pretty amazing though it was hard to hear the actors (even IF they are speaking a different language). 

Story line was pretty straightforward, but I was about to fall asleep during many parts of this show. People are right when they're saying there isn't much acrobatics involved. I also felt a lot of the stunts were repeated tricks from some other shows (the giant wheel thing that is also in Zarkana was way more ""cling-to-the-edge-of-your-seat"" and the aerial dancers were more engaging and varied in their athletics in TOTEM). A lot of the athletics reminded me of high school marching band color guard teams. Baton twirling and stick twirling were a good amount of the tricks they showed. 

Though the stage WAS cool, I feel like it was overused in a sense that you could tell they wanted to keep using it and rotating it to keep the show interesting. I got bored of it after a while. The end woke me up (don't want to give a spoiler alert) and it was my favorite part in the show just because the the safety of the actors and patrons in the theater... That definitely kept me on the edge of my seat, ready to evacuate in a timely manner... Haha

3 stars because of the costumes and actors, established story line, neat theater, and good sound. Minus two for the lackluster acrobatics, quiet dialogue, and repetitive rotating stage use.",3,0,2

My friend and I talk during EVERY show.  We just don't shut up.  We talk through movies, we talk through plays, we talk through presidential inauguration speeches... but this shut us up.  First of all, the stage was built specifically for Cirque du Soleil, so it absolutely stunning what they can do on stage.  It has a storyline, and yeah you can follow it (it's about war and tragedy, and living in exile, etc).... But you could be totally lost and still be ABSOLUTELY MESMERIZED as my friend and I were.

BUT!!! Like I said, KA is my absolute favorite. The music is the best, there is a plot you can semi-follow, and there is more excitement than just acrobatics (Like mock swordplay and fire). Also, the ending to KA...set to the dramatic overtones in the music as the story ends....is completely mind-blowing. I have seen this show three times and it's been worth my money every time.

We simple dont know what it is, since we have nothing alike.

But as my show experience improved, even though im a Swede, i can tell you that a show is more than that. Its an experience that impress and lasts further than your money spent on it. 

Although it may not have a storyline that is as out plotted as other shows i have seen, but the overall experience is WOW. The theater itself is spectacular and stretches around three sides of the room. The show will begin when entering this place, and there will be performance right in front of your nose, before you even get seated.

And when the show begins, it just keeps on improving until it culminates with a great end scene. Overall this is a world class show with performances beyond highest level.

I was like ""boy that's a lot of cleanup"", but it was beautiful.  Also, the ushers were a lot of fun, the seats were comfy, had speakers built into the headboard, and the stage just looked magnificent.  If you're going to buy top notch seats, I would recommend center, first of all, and then I would say that the first half of section 102, from rows A to K are probably not good seats to be in.  We sat in section 202 row BB and it was PERFECT.  The reason being that the stage is actually a vertical one, so people sitting up front actually have to crank their necks backwards so that they can see what's going on on ""top"".

The story... I couldn't follow at all.  I almost wished they didn't have one.  It was really hard to follow and it seemed as though the kept dwelling on certain scenes, as if they were having a hard time communicating it with the audience.  In one of the scenes, one of the twins kept falling out of the flyer... and then getting caught again... and then... flying out again... I didn't understand why.

The other thing I didn't like about Ka was its darkness.  I prefered the romance a show like ""O"" brought and the abstractness of the other Cirque du Soleil shows.  I appreciated scenes like the shadow puppets, but I really didn't appreciate the fighting and the war scenes so much...

To top it off Sharon Stone bumped into me in the line to go in and apologized to me. I was dumbstruck, which is a pretty rare occurrence for me, as I like to talk. I mean Sharon Stone in Vegas! Casino and stuff, it was just too cool.

However, the reason it's only three stars is the final fight scene.  I understand something tragic happened that required them to change what was done.  But that was also a year ago.  They are still going with the horrible looking video.  I couldn't tell who was fighting or anything.  It ruined the huge buildup and was a big letdown.  Again, I know something horrible happened when this was done originally.  But they could have easily changed it by now.

This is a not to miss performance when you are in the Vegas area.  I'd like to see it again.",1,0,1

The set up definitely feels like a movie theater with concessions as you first walk in. Since shows are back to back, they don't let you in until shortly before the show, which leaves long lines trying to get their popcorn and alcohol while the show is already starting, boo. :( I do enjoy how they have orchestra music playing right above you as you order.

When you walk in, the staff are friendly in helping you find your seat. I have to say that the seats are not roomy to walk past people, which made me too afraid to get up and use the restroom when I needed to. 

We were seated at one of the further section sup and it was a little blurry for me to make out the expressions of the act. It is a cool concept that there was a story behind all of the act, however it was a little dry at first, and you really had to wait until the end to see anything cool. The music was one of the best parts, as well as a man who was walking handstand-style on a life-sized hamster wheel! Overall, it was just ok and I recommend sitting maybe in the middle so you're not too far or too close.",5,1,2

I think I spent more than half the show sitting forward in my seat with my mouth hanging open in amazement.  $200 million spent on the stage I read earlier that day, and OMG it was worth it.  The speakers in the seats were a little loud, but I don't think there was a bad seat in the house.  I actually think the 'upper tier' seats were better as it afforded you a look at everything going on at the sides of the stage.

The costumes were magical, the music was inspiring, the story was great, the total experience was fantastic.

The only thing that threatened to mar the experience was the annoying habit of people in Vegas to stroll into the show 5-20 minutes late and the theater's policy to still allow them to be seated at anytime, not just in transitions.  It was extremely distracting and I missed some of the story during the beginning because of it.

Sitting THAT close isn't necessary. I would've loved sitting a couple more rows back so that it would be easier to take the whole stage in.

-each seat has its own speaker. 
-no intermission
-great costumes
- moving stage that made the story every more exciting. 
- charter interaction previous to show and some story line involved areas very close to audience. 

Cons:
-You get a There is a story line although I did feel it was taken away from some of the less thrilling acts that seemed to muttel it.

The stage.  I mean WOW!  Just come to see the stage itself.  Now, I'm not talking about the decor of the stage... I'm saying it actually moves around on hydraulics!  It's just absolutely incredible!

The music in this one is one of my favorite as well.  And the seats have speakers built into them!  This theater is so well designed!

By the by, don't be tardy because the time listed on your ticket is a hard start! 

I have mixed feelings whenever I see a Cirque show, partially because I am simultaneously awed and terrified at the same time. There's no other way to describe this show other than it is BEAUTIFUL. The stage and sets are incredible. The 360* rotating stage adds SO much dimension to the production and all of the cast members are incredibly, incredibly talented. I love how the storyline takes you through the 4 elements of fire, ice, water, and wind. Absolutely breathtaking. There's a lovely dance in the midpoint of the show between 2 cast members that I dubbed ""Jane and Tarzan""- enchanting. 

Check Ka out, you won't be disappointed. Oh, and in the beginning with the boat- there's no mechanical work involved there- just the amazing feats of the crew members!!

We also got front row seats, which we were very excited about.  We became very disappointed about both as the show went on.

There is so much things flying over the audience's heads, blocked views and bad angles from being so close, the most expensive seats are easily the worst in the house.  =(

The story was ok.  But hard to follow considering they spoke no English when they talked.  When they did talk it was a jumble of Japanese, Italian, Swahili, and gibberish, depending on the origin of the actor.  Pick one and stick to it please, I may not understand you, but I know what each sound like.  I also didn't understand why the floors turned into walls and started rotating at some points.  It just didn't make sense.

Both my husband and I thought the tricks where bland and basic circus acts.  My husband had a hard time following the story because their was no talking and because of his lack of interest after seeing people dressed up as giant insects and animals.  This show is geared to much younger audiences.  My husband mentally checked out after he saw someone in a puppeteered turtle costume do the moon walk.

We sat in the 2nd row and I really loved our spot.  A few rows back might have been better, but we were practically in the show.  

One thing I do NOT like about cirque shows is the fake plant they seem to have in every show.  I think it's obvious enough that the person they pull from the crowd is part of the act, but maybe it's for the kids?  Anyway, the plant in this show was actually a pretty fun one.

On your way in, be sure to get one of the big pina coladas from the concession stand outside. They're not superstrong, but they sure taste good! 

Ka is gorgeous in every way. There is more of a story line than in some other Cirque productions, but I liked that. Instead of crazy acrobatics all the time, there is real depth, emotion, and feeling in this show. There's a part of the show that takes place in a jungle, and it focuses on love. Now, I'm a self-admitted lightweight when it comes to alcohol, so it could have been the pina colada, but I started to get a little teary-eyed during that scene. It was so beautiful.

To the reviewer who wasn't impressed with the baton-twirling girl: Yeah, there are high schoolers who twirl batons. But they don't do two at the same time, and they aren't nearly as beautiful about it. Nor are they cast in an expensive Las Vegas production. YOU try it.

It is an interesting show because so many different things are happening that keep you mesmerized.  Cirque du Soleil tried a bunch of new things with this show and I think they have succeed.

First off, the theater and stage.  Each seat has a surround sound system built in, so the music surrounds you and envelops you and takes you away to this far off land.  The stage itself is just awe inspiring.  It is continually moving the entire show.  It changes, rotates, disappears, and transforms into so many different surfaces, that you never know what is going to happen.  The stage itself is a character in the show.  There is also a lot of interaction between the performers and the audience, which always makes for a more entertaining show in my book.

Secondly, this is the only Cirque show that I have seen that actually has a linear story line.  All of the other Cirque shows I have seen have a main theme with vignettes running throughout the show itself, but not a story.  So if you have seen other Cirques, it is a little different, but fun to go on a ride with the Imperial Twins as their search for each other. 

Lastly, their is a sense of martial arts throughout this show.  I am not into martial arts at all, but watching this show, you really get a great sense of the art and really appreciate the artform itself.  I am still not watching Bruce Lee movies, but I very much appreciate martial arts now.  

Overall, I think KA is a fun adventure that you should try out.    If you do go to see it, buy your tickets ahead of time and directly through the MGM box office whenever you decide you are going to see it.  The theater is huge and if you wait too long, you may be stuck in the back. There are a lot of ticket brokers that will take advantage of you here in town. They will promise one thing, but you get stuck in the back corner in the left over seats and no one wants that, especially for the price you pay for Cirque. I am a local and used to work in the concierge business, so trust me on that one.   

KA seems the least appreciated Cirque show in town, but go see it anyway. It was even in a CSI episode, take that ""O""!",5,3,3

Cirque Du Soleil than some sort of story of mythical allegorical something or other story as an excuse to showcase acrobatic circus acts. 
I was starting to doze off when the girl was tossing the batons in the air. I woke up when those guys on the giant wheel without safety wires starting running around as those things spun. A few acts without wires scared me. One guy with his butt showing was swinging around on those long cloth things. The girl holding him by the hand without safety wires also woke me up. One slip and it would be curtains, finished for him. The stage was amazing. It moved to vertical and kept my attention. It was a little underwhelming with the loads and loads of Wang Chung style Kung Fu movie moves. I think three quarters of the Cirque shows would go out of business without loads of Chinese Acrobats. They must have incubation plants in China or Taiwan or somewhere producing endless Cirque du Soleil acrobats. They all leap the same way and that gets a bit tiring. There must be some Russian in there somewhere, though I can't confirm that. I didn't hear anyone saying Nyet or Dah during the show except for a few audience members from Brighton Beach. I called the concierge at the Mirage four hourse before the show. Only a few seats left at 160 bucks or so. I went on the net myself to the website and bought two tickets, separated by rows, one at a time, for about $118 dollars. Great center seats. Was it worth it? Well, it stopped me from losing money at the casinos for a few hours. And I can say, ""Hey, I saw KA, another Cirque du Soleil show. Ha Ha.""

This show is incredible with the vertical stage and the amazing wire act. The characters are also very likeable with a ""video game"" like storyline. A basic good vs. evil theme. 

Be advised they changed the climatic ending due to the accident to CGI (you end up watching a video for 3 mins at the end) instead of the original VERY AWESOME high flying act. *Hint: If you really want to see the original climatic Ka ending then it is available on YouTube. Go watch it ONLY after seeing the show though. 

Now, is it worth the very $$$ expensive ticket price without the final high flying act? Not really because you will feel short changed. Save your $$$ for a lovely dinner or for a show like La Reve or O. But if you can score tickets at $$ prices then the show is still worth it. I hate to say this because I enjoyed the show regardless but it is what it is.

He liked both but he loved Ka so much that the next time we were in Vegas he'd take me here. True to his word, this was one of his surprises.

Showtimes Tues-Saturday in the MGM Grand. It's a big show floor but coming from the main entrance (where all the cars stop for drop-offs and valet service) it was only a 5 minute walk to the theater entrance. The area in front of the theater has props that resemble the huts to the sides as you go inside. No1DP picked up his tickets at Will Call. 

Ticket prices are level with O and Beatles LOVE, which translates to ""pretty damn expensive"". There's different tiers with different prices for each tier. No1DP and I sat 8 rows from the front as this is actually in the same eye-level as the front of the stage. The very first rows are actually cheaper because the stage is slightly above eye level for those rows. According to the pricing guide where we sat was at least $150\/person.

Due to the horrendous taxi situation we got there around 9 minutes late so we missed the pre-show performance AND the opportunity to take photos with the set pieces. I also got to miss the best part of the show: the exhibition of the different martial arts that are involved with the story. No1DP mentions had we gotten there too late we wouldn't be allowed to be seated but the ushers were kind enough to seat us after the introduction sequence.

What sets Ka from the other Cirque shows is that it tells an original story. The acrobatics and theatrics enhance the story, not the other way around. The story is easy to get even with no spoken dialogue. Ka goes for a fast 90 minutes with no intermission. All parts of the stage are used; No1DP pointed out action happening in the sides I would have missed if I kept my eyes to the center.

The only disappointing part about the performance is the climax. One part of the production used to be live but a death occurred and as a result this scene is now projected into the wall. I was quite confused when I saw this and had to research after the fact to know what this was.

The shop sold all sorts of memorabilia related to Ka and the other Cirque shows. Unlike a lot of memorabilia around Vegas the items inside the store look quite nice, especially the well-designed shirts. No1DP purchased the program guide which clarified a lot about the story.

This brings my number of Cirque shows seen in Vegas to two. I'd definitely recommend this production to other people, especially if they have never seen a Cirque production before.",9,4,5

The first hour is pointless. There are two scenes in the last 30 minutes that were good but sadly not amazing like normal. This is probably why they don't have an intermission because most people would have left.

The MGM is not my favorite hotel\/casino in Vegas but no matter where you are staying, you need to go see this show. Le Reve and O are probably a little more sweepingly romantic and The Beatles one is full of whimsy and very musical. Mystere is geared for kids with lots of comedy so that is the best Cirque show for families. If I could characterize the target audience that KA would appeal to most it would probably be people who like comic book movies or anime. There were a lot of action scenes with the characters fighting mock-battles (no blood or anything like that so its not too violent for kids, though) and just a lot of action in general. The moving platform stage was incredible and I loved the fact that the projections were able to completely change the scenery. The characters went from being on a ship to the jungle to climbing a frozen ice cliff. It was quite a journey. As other reviewers have mentioned, this one has more of a plot than many of the others so you also get a nice warm and fuzzy feeling from the happy ending.

My best advice is to LOOK UP and around as soon as you walk in...  The stuff they've built and have everywhere is just insane.  The whole theatre isn't all that huge so you'd be able to see everything from anywhere BUT... I'd say get tix down near the front and center... We had section 102 (middle) and 7th row (G) and they were perfect seats.  You can feel the heat from the flames but not too hot and the ariel parts happen RIGHT ABOVE YOU... it's so cool.  An isle seat may be cool because of the guys always running around and staging in the isle to run up stage.

Engineering alone is mind boggling...  The different stages that come up from below and move around, tilt, rotate, etc and then these huge towers move around all over... I want to watch a ""how it's made"" on that show... it's friggin nuts and its hard to impress me.

The fighting scenes were sweet, the costumes were really cool and unique, and even the guys not in the show were dressed up and completely in character and interact with you a lot actually.

NO Cameras! lol...  the people that did take some pics totally got harassed by the people of Ka... actually really funny though.

Anyways... crazy overload on the eyes... and if you're up front you get snowed on a little and flower petals all over :)  Oh and the seats have two speakers inside them behind your head... sweeeet...

Trust me, it was THAT bad... It was by far the worst-ever Cirque show I've been to, and I've seen quite a few. Ka's theatrics, stage set, special effects, etc etc... yes they were indeed impressive; I had goosebumps trying to find my seat in anticipation of a mind-blowing show. But man was I mistaken! Here are a few points I made over the performance:

- The show opens with a narrator who tells you the gist of the entire story... That's plain sacrilege for Cirque fans!! Needless to say, the plot wasn't creative either and that's what my rating is mostly based on.

- The outfits were HORRIBLE... you would expect the costumes to be visually stunning in a Cirque show but not here. Ka ads all seemed to tout its ""tasteful ethnic blend"" of both Asian patterning and designing, which included Korean hanboks, Japanese kimonos, Mongolian deels, Vietnamese ao dais, just to name a few... I definitely saw the effort to bring a fresh perspective to costume design, but it was a ""smashed together"" and nothing avant garde. It's unfortunate since their outfits seemed rather gaudy and cheap because of this, not ""eclectic"" as intended (especially after Natalie Portman paved the way with Star Wars).

- Do note that Ka is more thatrical than acrobatic, as many of the reviewers below write. However, you should note that your ticket dollars will be paying for a massive rotating platform and not human performance. If that's your definition for ""theatrical performance"", then by all means, go for it. If not, stay clear of this show. 

- Their ""martial arts"" needs more work and coordination. Many of their fight scenes looked half-hearted for this very reason. I was so bored throughout the entire performance :(

Since everyone seemed to give Ka great reviews, I'd hate to be the black sheep but it surely wasn't my cup of tea, to put it mildly. I'm sure many will disagree, but save your money and invest it in O or Mystere or gambling. You'll get more bang for your buck, no doubt. Fyi, La Nouba in Disneyworld is something to keep in mind.

Hard to describe, so if you see the show, hang out in the lobby to hear and enjoy that delightful touch of whimsy.)  The ushers were friggin HILARIOUS.

Still, I highly recommend seeing this thrilling show.  Sure, the storyline was a little light (it's simple to follow the siblings in their adventures while separated) and the ending didn't seem to give me the closure I was looking for, but then again, it isn't really a play - it's a visual performance of grandeur and danger.

Seating:
There are built in speakers in your chair. Children who aren't tall enough are given these compfy cushioned boosters. The stage is actually sort of rounded, but the actual stage is mechanical, as seen in CSI the TV show. It's a pretty good view from almost pretty much any angle.

I have to admit that we had arrived at Las Vegas and had done quite a bit by the time we saw this show.  I went with my parents of all things.  We got a good deal because we saw two shows of Cirque.  We also so some other shows and it was REALLY HOT this particular summer.  We FELL ASLEEP at one point, EACH OF US.  LMAO. That still doesn't take away another star, it is still 4 stars.

They stage tilts, they fall and they have sand on the stage that tilts and its just a WONDER to watch.  I really want to see this again, the actors told the story without saying ONE WORD.  Its just wonderful.  Give the show a go.",0,0,0

Perhaps if I saw it sooner, I would like it more, but having seen O, Love, and One recently... This one was not my favorite. The stage was cool, some of the acrobatics were awesome, but it was lacking something. 

While there is a linear story here, unlike other Cirque shows, it was hard to follow at times. Other shows I'm waiting with bated breathe, can't believe time has flown by. This one I wondered when it was going to end. It wasn't bad by any means -- but wasn't as good as others I had seen. I likely wouldn't watch a 2nd tome -- and all the other shows I would in a heart beat (esp One -- which would be my 3rd time). Seriously go see that one.

And not sayng it was bad, but I'm so glad I didn't pay full price to see it because I would have been pissed. 

But don't get me wrong, it was cool. There were some fantastic parts of the show..and I totally dig the whole stage and arena set up..very effing cool..

But some parts were so ....freaking...sllloooooowwwww... I kept looking to see what time it was....that never happened at Le Reve or Mystere...not once..

Also the storyline thing was okay, but really, when you go to see a Cirque show, you go to be wowed by acrobatics and such..there was just too much of the ""play"" going on...not enough stunts..


Definite highlight for me was that carnival ride looking thingy with all the circles...(please forgive all the confusing technical jargon)

One thing that annoyed the hell out of me: We find our seats 5 minutes before the show starts, so I excuse myself to hit the facilities real quick before it starts..they have these guys(castmembers) dressed up like warriors\/headhunters\/crackheads from Nellis and Cheyenne walking around messing with people....as I'm beelining it to the can this guy gets behind me and gives me the BOO! out of nowhere...scared the freaking dogsh*t out me ....f*cker!...yea....annoying...stop that..


so, for the price I paid ($0), it was very cool...I would even say go see it if you can get discounted tickets, but do not pay full price people...you'll leave disappointed..

I've seen several of the Cirque shows when they come to the Bay Area and saw O in Vegas.

This isn't your typical Cirque show seen in the Bay Area.  That has more acrobatics.  This show has a definite story line that you can understand and less acrobatics, magic and clowns so it reminds me kind of like a musical.  The theater is huge and has lots of detail to it-amazing.  Kinda like Asian steam punk - sort of.  The stage was THE coolest thing.  It's huge. It elevates up and down and horizontal and vertical.  The show is an Asian theme about two siblings who get separated in a storm and then reunited.  

At the end of the show they have fireworks... yes, indoor fireworks.  I found the show so interesting that I bought the making of Ka dvd.  Can't wait to go home to check it out.

Ka is a martial-arts themed show. In the 15 minutes before the show starts, performers dressed like ninjas swing from balconies and scaffolding, giving what you think is a taste of what's to come.  In many ways it's the highlight of the show.

The show itself has a ridiculous amount of downtime and interludes, dragging out a discombobulated storyline.  The low for me was having to suffer through 5 full minutes of shadow puppet animals.  The close second was clowns on a beach, and last but not least, a lone individual twirling a plain old baton for what felt like ages.   Most of the action consists of aerial acrobatics and capoeira but they were not as technically difficult or ostentatious as what you'll see in LA Reve which in addition to acrobatics has divers, ballroom dancers, contortionists, and other skilled artists on display. The scenery was just ok.  It consisted mainly of a pallet that moved and had lights projected on it. 

To add to the less than captivating show, the venue kept on seating people nonstop for the first half hour of the show.  Anyone at the beginning of the second level of seating would have had their view obstructed every 2 minutes, which was just ridiculous.  Attendees also saw fit to get up and use the bathroom throughout the performance.  It all made it that much harder to focus.

A tip: like most other performances, the best-worth tickets are either the cheapest -- the ones in back, or if you are in the very front.

Ticket: I got a $80 row D101 ticket (basically 4th row from the main stage & outer edge seat) by constantly refreshing the MGM online ticket site. I liked the close-up view, but I missed out several scenes (e.g. the ship scene) due to the awkward seating angle. Not only that, I also had to withstand heat wave generated by random bursts of flame during the pre-show. My recommendation? Avoid first 5 ~ 6 rows.

Even though the show started at 9:30 PM, we weren't allow to go into the theater until 9 PM. There were many memorable scenes - vertical Spiderman-like battle scenes (20%), super random funny scenes (40%), other random battle scenes (20%), and other miscellaneous acts (e.g. amazing flute twirling, the Wheel of Death, etc - 20%). Didn't see too much of aerial stunts comparing with other Cirque Du Soleil shows, but I did notice the performer almost tripped while doing the jump rope on the Wheel of Death.

Personally I don't think KA is better than Cirque du Soleil - O, but KA certainly has a better storyline. I guess whether you like KA will depend on your personal taste.

P.S. - Children under age 5 are not allow to enter the theater & children under age 12 must be accompanied by an adult. In addition, loud noises \/ periods of darkness can potentially frighten some children.",3,0,1

When I was a wee bit younger, I dreamed of becoming a contortionist so I could join their ranks (and look super cool turning into a pretzel in full body makeup and a fantastic cat suit).

Every time I've been to Las Vegas, I've seen a different Cirque show and KA was the latest and greatest yet.  

From the start of the show I was mesmerized by the fantastic costumes and makeup (and in love with the main male character - the blue haired one), the romantic story line (communicated without an intelligible word ever being said), the ever changing stage and the general awesomeness and total uniqueness that every Cirque show somehow manages to exude.

Captivated from start to finish, when the show ended I was once again ready to limber up, struggle into a spandex leotard and become a performer if they'd have me.  

I don't know how Cirque du Soleil does it, but I've never been (nor probably ever will be) disappointed in their shows.  They're worth every penny of the admission price and the ones in Vegas even more so since they get to have theaters built exactly to their specifications.

The famous crab and tortoise scene, seemed like a random and forced comic relief from the tempestuous and anarchic sequence of acrobatic scenes.

The scenes also often dragged on, and the audience is bombarded with dark and sinister music through speakers in the headrests of the seating.  It oftentimes felt as though scenes with the famous rotating floor were forced into the story purely for the WOW factor, without heeding the flow of the overall story.

My heart was still pounding an hour after leaving the theater. 

How is that possible?

Well, between the exciting fight scenes, the detailed costumes, the $220 million colossal set with several stages and platforms that move and change with each scene, Ka embodies what a cirque show should be, with a more straightforward storyline.  

This is a story of love and conflict where twins got separated when they were young.  They are eventually reunited in the end, but not until facing life's challenges and self-discoveries.  Kinda like teenagers going through a roller-coaster of emotions minus prom night. Classic acrobatic elements you'd expect from a cirque show is supremely executed.  Martial arts and Capoeira influences are also present.  The beach scene with the crab puppets was so funny, the music is on point with every scene and the whole experience is enhanced with built-in speakers on your seat's headrest. It's like having your own surround sound!   There's also a band that performs off-stage and I only noticed it when they came out and took a bow in the end.

This is not your typical acrobatic circus type show--it's a true spectacle. The artistry shows in the scenery as much as in the performers' amazing feats.

Never been to a Cirque de Soleil show before. Always thought it was just acrobats with tights performing death defying stunts but KA is far from just that. 

Upon entry, you'll feel as if it was the biggest theater you've ever been to. The random timing of fire balls on stage while people are getting seated is just a hint of something great to come. 

As you're seated, there are pre-acts being performed. Tribal people swinging from side to side above the audience as they scream. As it begins, you'll see a quick performance meant to tell you not to use cameras or cell phones. Clever and fun. 

As the first scene opens, you'll marvel at the huge rotating platform. The narrator tells you the story behind the two twin siblings and the origin of the story. 

The sheer size of this production was insane. Probably the most technically crafted show ever - $195M invested. 

Reviews criticized the storyline but I think it's the storyline that shines. Reminds me of an epic tale of family, love, and war. The score is just as amazing. Like 300, Beowulf, gladiator, all at once.

One of their absolute classics. I do need to ad that I have seen KÀ in February 2013 (before the accident), so the ending I have seen was the original one and, therefore, from what I am reading, the one that made more sense and was more climactic. 

Bonus:
If you want to follow what's going on better, read-up about the story before you come see the show. 
In my opinion, center-and-a-little-back seating is the best to view more of the show from, but the beautiful thing about KÀ (the production and theater) is that the show is going on all around you from the moment you step into the theater. There is not a dull moment or person there.

It was so incredibly BORING.  I have never, ever experience boredom at a Cirque show, but this one had my eyelids slowly closing several times.  I kept waiting for the excitement to bump up, but damn, I got almost nothing.

2 stars only because of the innovative moving\/tilting stage, the beautiful costumes, and the Wheel of Death act (freakin' incredible!).  That's it.

First, some of the acrobatics were great, of course, but nothing I haven't seen at significantly cheaper carnivals and other shows. Sure, they had lots of energy, and I know it's a lot of work, but there wasn't a whole lot of actual talent, which is what I expected to see; this is Vegas, this is supposed to be top-shelf talent, and you can't even get some peopel who can actually shoot a bow and arrow?

It's a very 'busy' show, so I think for many that's all it needs to be in order to be entertained, but if you focused on the individuals, most weren't really doing much. Wow, you can play catch (and drop it a few times), not very impressive. 

The story was kinda hacky, and the performers themselves aren't mic'd so its like watching a TV show in the Sims 3: cheezy, pointless, and lots of gibberish. The fat lady was completely unnecessary; we get it, fat people are helpless and should be laughed at, but come on, it's an ongoing joke throughout the entire show.

As for the show's storyline, it basically involved the fat lady matriach of a clan, two men-women (women dressed as men) fall in love to quell the spat between two lands, and pirate dudes crash the party and capture one of the man-woman. King of the pirates wants his daughter to marry, then the Fu-manchu dude presents his emo son to said daughter. Emo dude's special talents include whipping his hair back and amateur pyrotechnics, emo dude then gives the daughter a baton they pretend is a flute for some reason. Some bullshit goes on with some of the original tribes being lost, pointlessly annoying giant bugs and crabs pop up on the beach and take up 20 minutes of time for some stupid reason. Pirate king's daughter falls in love with the man-woman, and gives him the flute-baton for some reason. He plays it for a minute. She then does a baton routine with said flute (which was pretty decent actually). Eventually, the two men-women are reunited, fu manchu dude had a plan to take over all the tribes, some 'war' footage is displayed in terrible quality, then they do a happy dance. Oh, then they'll do real fireworks, which sounds cool, but super bright white light in a pitch-black theatre does what? Oh yeah, it freaking blinds you, so you can't even see it. So f*cking stupid.

As for the actual good parts in the show, the platform was pretty awesome and took some creative engineering. There were hints of actual talent with the baton routine, the hamster cages (you'll see), and the sparkling dude on the corde lisse, and the sets were designed pretty well. But it was also kinda amateurish, I've seen much more impressive acrobatics done by far cheaper acts, and the focus on a lot of stupid bs like the crab and giant centipede, that took up like over 10 minutes of pointlessness, totally made for any 5 year olds in the audience I suppose.

Perks:  They serve 32 oz alcoholic beverages.  I got some peach smoothie something or another which was delicious.  The vertical stage was pretty neat, but you can only watch people fall off it so many times before that gets old too.

Disappointments: Everything else.  The show was SOOOO boring.  I was ready to be amazed and in awe and not wanting it to end.  Instead Jon and I found ourselves looking at each other wondering when the cool effects and acrobatics happened.  We ended up leaving after an hour and ten minutes.  We just couldn't take it any more.  The straw that broke the camels back was when there were crabs and starfish running around the stage.  This isn't Disney World for kids, this is Vegas people.

My brothers and I came to that conclusion while discussing what we would pay for it after having seen it. Yes, it's entertaining, but so are movies that cost much, much less. 

First, the negatives: I'm not sure what the pre-show audience interaction was supposed to be; there were lots of extras running around at the start, but I didn't see them doing more than making random noises. The ""joking"" scenes are overlong and worthy of a $10 comedy show, not a $180 one. And I'm still confused over what the word ""Ka"" has to do with the show. 

Most annoyingly, what passes for a ""plot"" is a confusing combination of cliches and contortions; I had to go onto the show's website afterwards to figure out who was supposed to be on what side and what the point of several sequences were.  I would've preferred they dropped the whole plot thing rather than try to make any kind of coherent story. 

That said, a few of the scenes are outstanding. The ""love song"" (apparently- couldn't tell at the time!) dance is beautiful, the vertical battle is appropriately epic, and the shadowplay scene is delightful. The costumes are incredible (and the music is pretty awesome, if a bit maudlin. But is maybe 20-30 minutes of magic worth the sticker price? I'd say no, but if you can get 'em for cheap, then go for it.",3,0,0

This is a great show and am glad we went. My only issue was with the final battle scene.

In case you don't know the history, a performer died after falling during this scene, and the show was modified afterward. I have no problem with them doing this, but the way they did it was just disappointing. They projected imagery of the final battle scene, with digital actors doing acrobatics. The projection was blurry and just not engaging. I felt like we were watching a movie in a cheap movie theater. They could have done better.

The crunching and knawling at her giant bucket made me want to vomit.  Yes the lady also licked her fingers.   

I understands that shows are expensive but I consider it a travesty that concessions sell barrels of popcorn to be crunched while I try to enjoy the show.  For me the experience was compromised.  

As stated the show was very nice, but it will be my last Cirque du Soleil,  I just wouldn't feel comfortable paying for another show and running into the same experience.  

When is charging enough....enough?  Does popcorn really go with such a show?  What next in this shameless fleecing of the public. How about big buckets of Nachos with liquid cheese to go with the show.  And don't forget your beer hat that holds 40 ounces of your favorite Cirque du Soleil beer.

Tickets don't have to be printed out if you can pull it up on your phone with the barcode to scan and they don't search through bags or anything before entering the theater, which made the process easy.

The theater was grand and went with the theme of the story. When you arrive early, there are performers who come swinging above the audience and we even saw them scare a few of them, popping out of nowhere. There are also speakers in the seats! And if you get cold, you can ask any of the employees for a blanket and they will give you one to use.

Try coming in at least twenty minutes early if you're trying to purchase any snacks and refreshments from the concessions. We got to the theater 15 minutes before the show was supposed to start, but missed the first 5 minutes of the show because there was still a line at the concessions. Though in our defense, the bartender was moving a little slow and trying to start conversation with like everyone in line knowing the show had already started. Although when you're waiting in the line, there is a TV that shows the live performance.

I've never seen a Cirque Du Soleil show prior to KA and wasn't sure if any of them had a story line. KA had a story line which in my honest opinion, was predictable. There was not a lot of dialogue, and even then the actors would be speaking in some gibberish language so it may be hard for some to follow through with the story if they missed the beginning.

- pick up tickets early in the day. you don't want to be stuck in the will call line as the show begins. i went at noon and there was still a gang of people either buying or picking up tickets.

- i had front row seats. great right? well, maybe. we were really close to the action. so close, in fact, i had to pull my legs in a couple times for fear of tripping the performers as they ran by. and it was fantastic to see the facial expressions and the detail in the costumes. but for this show, i think seats a few rows back would have been better.

we spent much of the show with our necks craned back as we watched some of the acrobatics that were performed on the vertical stage.",1,0,0

Now what I really expected was an integration of cool tricks and acrobats into the story. But they kept me waiting for something cool to happen and it never did. The only really thing I liked about this show was the cool vertical wall they were fighting on.... but honestly other then that the rest of the show was pretty boring. 

I enjoyed Mystere, Iris and several other Cirque du Soleil productions but this one kind of disappointed me and was not really worth the price I paid for the four tickets. Some parts of the show just really dragged and at one point it got annoying with the girl screaming.  

Overall if you are watching a production by cirque du soleil for the first time then this would be an okay show to watch since your expectations wouldn't be so high yet. I mean it's not necessary a bad show just wasn't what I expected.",0,1,0

- The music is phenomenal.  Like most Cirque shows, the music just blows you away....and it works so well with the performance.

- Great acrobatics & physical feats.  Again, Cirque doesn't disappoint.

- Awesome sets.  I don't want to give away too much, but there's a scene where the stage lifts up and goes vertical from a horizontal position....absolutely crazy....and the performers on the stage?  All I can say is WOW!

Some tips....

- Make sure you look all around you....to the left, right, and above you....there's a lot going on and you don't want to miss it.

- Use the bathroom before the show starts.  Again, you don't want to miss a minute of the action.

- Bring a coat or sweater.  It can get a little cold in the theater.

I could see the story they were going for, however, it failed to all come together for me. I felt there was a lot of things happening that wasn't really part of what was going on. 

When the show starts out, there's no real explanation as to why this is happening. As the story progresses, you understand the point but, it doesn't make sense. 

As far as the costumes, they were good and fitting for the show. I also was hoping for more tricks or acrobatics. I was a fan of Mystere, and expected some of those type talents. 

I will say, the stage is amazing. Watching it transform into many things for the show was so intriguing. And there was also a part with the girl in the forest type setting with a guy and that dancing was pretty cool.

I barely remember the storyline of Zarkana, but KA has a cool story. It's simply, easy to follow, and left you lots of space for imagination. It's also wordless, basically you only need to know who's the good and who's the bad. Stunt, I liked the ""two guys jump on the big wheels"" idea in Zarkana, and I'm shocked to see it again here. But it's not as long, I was hoping to see more.

I also liked the lighting, the music, and the setting. Everything was so perfectly done, all details and keeps you all around, because the theatre is all set and so awesome.

Im an intelligent man, but as far as the story goes, I have no clue what happened. Probably because I spent more time creeping the stage intricacies than I did watching the show. The rest of our group shared the same sentiments, and what not our favorite Cirque performances. 

The modified ending is just terrible. As another reviewer mentioned, you can find the original scene that was replaced due to the tragic accident that occurred. The new scene is just awful, like it was done with a camcorder from the 80s.

To me, KA had more of a storyline compared to Dralion but it was a darker story than Ovo and the acrobatics were great but not as amazing as the other shows I have seen. Perhaps this is because there is so much happening in a big venue or I was concentrating on the story more.

1 STAR - For the friendly staff. Everyone we spoke with tried to strike up a conversation and kept thanking us for choosing KA to watch.
1 STAR - Strong Crown & diet which came in a huge souvenir cup for only $18. 
1 STAR- Beautiful theater, stage & costumes\/makeup. Even the ushers and employees in the lobby had some crazy cool looking makeup on and stayed in character. The theater is HUGE.

Buy the $125 tickets and try to get in the middle section, not too close to the front (the front of the rear, middle section would be ideal). Most of the action takes place way up in the air or in the middle of the air, not flat on the stage. The stage moves and goes away throughout the show, so if you're too close, you'll probably have to crane your neck up which would get tiring. I assure you, the show is worth every penny.

I have seen a couple different Cirque du Soleil shows, but this one took the cake. The stage, technical direction, sound, performers, everything were amazing. You literally watch some of the moments and can't believe what you're seeing - it makes you feel like a little kid again.  Some civilain reviews complained that this show was not like other Cirque shows, and it's not. It's much more theatrical, less circusy - so if you like the acrobatics, stick to the other shows, like Mystere and O.

They really pay attention to every detail.  The tickets are expensive (IMHO) but at least you can see where they put the money.  You can enter into the theater very quickly and find your seat no matter how close you call it, but of course... if anyone knows me, I am always painfully early (for everything)...  No worries, because before the show they have cast members up and down the isles and literally swinging from the rafters.  This means there is plenty to watch while you are drinking your $20 slushy alcohol drink from the concessions.  The stage is on hydraulics and can move in ANY direction they wish giving the talented actors many different ways to perform, and yes there are even speakers in the seats.  Plus the theater is very grand.  Another great thing about Vegas shows of this size is that the entire theme of your surroundings can be crafted for this experience.  

This is a story about a twin brother and sister who get separated young in life and through various struggle with rivaling tribes and situations find happiness and each other in the end.  Therefore, get ready for all sorts of performance: dancing, acrobatics, sword fighting and some humor as well.  There is one act during the show that is a wonderful combination of beauty and danger (let's just say... without a net).

The short definitions:
Pros:
Amazing moving stage
Immersive story about love and growth for two imperial twins as they search for each other and to restore their kingdom
Great costume design

Cons:
Way too much martial arts
Lack of variety of shows
Removal of the final act which was replaced with low quality CGI

Here is a more in-depth review of the various acts:

Pageant- I loved the intro. It just hooks you in with the archers popping up on the side of the stages. Great start!

Storm- Very acrobatic fight scene on a moving boat. Quite breath taking.

Deep- Semi-boring but it does make you feel like you're in the water.

Archers Den- I love the villains. However, not a stand up scene.

Wash up shore- Freaking hilarious. I really enjoyed the turtle the most. I really liked the sand that they put on stage.

Shadow play- My favorite scene by far. I really liked the shadow puppets, so life like and quite moving. One of the most beautiful scenes I've seen in a cirque show.

Climb- Introduction to the epic fight scenes as the characters move around a moving stage packed with sand.

Blizzard- Pretty cool. I liked the bubbles which they used to imitate snow.

Flight- One of the coolest scenes from the show as they make a flying apparatus. You literally see the actors fly above the audience.

Captivity- An interesting scene. I don't really get the love story but whatever. XD.

Forest people- Awe inspiring and colorful. Very vibrant. I love Tarzan!

Slave cage- Epic wheel of death! Very cool!

Final battle- It sucks that this scene was so underwhelming. I'm sure if I saw this scene as it was originally created I would be amazed. However, the holograms were terrible.

In the beginning, I found the show to be a bit slow and boring.  (Probably because I was up until 6 am playing poker and only had 3 hours sleep!)

The show is definitely different from your typical cirque du soleil shows. This one is more focused on Asian themed\/ sword fighting\/acrobatics. Most cirque du soleil show is like watching a dream with really no plot just different acts of crazy ""sitting on the edge of chair"" acrobatics. But KA actually has a storyline and nothing was really scary cause they used wires.

The language they use and some characters (ie the Tarzan-ish guy) is just hard to take in. Even watching it the second time, it's not my kind of cirque du soleil, so I'm glad for both times I was able to get the tickets for a cheap price.

The only thing I really like about the show is the big platform that can go vertical and move around. The last scene with the fighting on the vertical wall was my favorite, but the other parts didn't catch my attention like the other shows do.",0,0,0

So we watched the show last night. After all the praises and rave reviews, I feel like I witnessed a different show than most people. I mean don't get me wrong, there were some cool parts, the technical aspects and the costumes were elaborate. The rotating stage and moving platform blew me away but I guess maybe I was expecting too much and sadly I was disappointed. It just appeared so all over the place and the story line didn't seem cohesive at all.

The theater though was amazing and I liked how interactive their ushers were. I also liked the built in speakers on the chairs. My favorite parts are the one involving the boat when they were trying to escape, it seemed so realistic and life like. Another is the dance between the boy and the twin sister in the forest. I love the aerial acrobat acts, I wish there was more of that incorporated. Flying fight scenes would've been awesome. Also breathtaking was the Wheel of death, though I have seen this kind of act performed many a times, it never fails to amaze me.

It was an okay show in my books, now would I see it again? Probably if it was free. At least I can cross that off my list and move on to the next adventure...",7,4,7

The performances by the artists were definitely top notch. The super high tech stage really captivated me. There were lots of gravity defying stunts that  were really outstanding.

Tip for thought: Best seats are in the Front! 

Tickets in hand and the feeling of excitement just go through your head before entering the doors.  

First thing you see is the Dragon statue and their photographers greeting you to take your picture.  Alas, I see the bar and decided to pick up some drinks to get turnt up and ready to enjoy!

 The Show:

Great introduction and storyline that keeps wanting to know what happens every second

The Choreography is simply Extraordinary and its all the reviews say it is with combinations of dances, acrobatics, martial-arts with breathe taking stunts all on a stage that does it all which puts you on the edge of your seat.  You will notice the hours and hours of hard work each character puts in to the show.

I was extremely excited when it first started, the fire, the costumes, etc. But as the storyline went on, too much shit was going on and I didn't understand any of it. 

It's Las Vegas - I haven't been sleeping, it's dark and cool in here, if I'm not entertained, i will fall asleep. Which point blank, did happen - kind of. I didn't entirely knock out, it took every ounce of energy for me to not fall asleep. It was pretty boring and I was unimpressed. Sure, the moves were amazing (i don't doubt that, there's no way that I could do half the things they do on the stage). But the show just didn't hold my attention whatsoever. For the last 30 minutes, I was hoping that it would end ASAP so I could leave.

The concession stand was cheaper than other shows though, $6 for beer\/pop and you get huge cup! And popcorn was pretty cheap (comparable to theatre prices).

The performances seldom disappoint--the artistry and music and feats always combine for an amazing spectacle. 

KA, however, introduces something only hinted at in some of the other shows--brilliant set design.  In KA, the stage itself is one of the amazing characters, performing its own contortions, wardrobe changes, and hydraulic acrobatics.  Pyrotechnics warm our wide-eyed faces as we watch.  Apart from the stage, the set surrounds the audience, with performers swinging over our heads, shouting from behind our ears.  KA is probably Cirque's most narratively-coherent show, as well--there is a clear plotline to the story.

Unfortunately, the set malfunctioned during our show--when it came time for what I would later realize was a climactic performance on the Wheel of Death, the set froze, and the musicians played on.  We sat listening to the music, mildly disappointed that we were missing some key scene in the story.

Needless to say, Stars on Ice and the Nutcracker Ballet are rare events for us.  We were supposed to see ""O"" with some out-of-town friends, but I chose Ka after reading reviews about the various CDS shows because it supposedly had a storyline and seemed to have a more masculine theme with the impact of fire and war and all.

As we walked into the massive auditorium\/stage set, we were were stunned by the complexity and enormity of everything.  Our seats were perfect...in the middle section 102, row M, seats 21 and 22.  As the show unfolded, I had goosebumps during some of the thrilling performances.  Despite being a simple storyline, there was often so much going on that it was hard to see everything.  For example, when the female twin falls into the forest, she falls in love with the firefly boy.  Yet, while this was happening right in front of us in the middle of the ""stage,"" my guy was completely focused on the gigantic bugs on either side of the scene, which were going up and down poles and spinning upside down and around.  He had no idea what that scene was about.  Of course, everyone has their own viewpoint...

I really liked the fighting scenes, including the one on the stage that went 100% vertical, and the drowning scene was so graceful it almost brought tears to my eyes.  You really need to see this show to appreciate how huge an endeavor it is.  I'm looking forward to another CDS show one of these days...perhaps ""O,"" which our friends also highly recommended after seeing it that same night.

We have seen other Cirque shows with much more acrobatics without nets, amazing music played on stage. Costume design for KA seems more captiving, but maybe due to the less tumbling and circus acrobatics in comparison to the others  

If you see KA don't sit in the first 20 rows or you will be looking up the entire time.",0,0,0

*With little words spoken an epic journey of two twins split apart and sent on separate adventures is depicted through martial arts, dance, music and special effects. They brief you in the beginning with a little narration and the rest is history!

*The overall production value - the stage itself is set on hydraulics.. prior to the show starting it's submerged below eye level and during the show.. it's all over the place and coincides with each scene. The props, costumes, lighting, soundtrack, crowd interaction, the arena.. vibrant colors, mist, explosions, characters in the rafters and so on.. it was all structured to make the entire experience visually, mentally, emotionally and even physically enticing. All senses are tickled but taste! If only that lady next to me shared her popcorn!

*Being sat in a handicap seat that moves and joyfully scaring every single person that walked by (including a character in costume who was attempting to startle me). Fun! We were upgraded 5 rows forward even though our seats were pretty good as is.. most likely due to the extreme amounts of fun I was having in the seat I was in..

*The digital effects were phenomenal. The illusion of arrows being shot, characters hanging cliff-side, birds soaring by and so on.

*The performers. The physical capabilities of a human being is pushed to defying limits during the act. The fight scenes were action packed with intense music to back 'em up. Once again, my palms were sweating during some of the performances.. I'm not afraid of heights at all, but I was a little nervous for those folks contorting, flipping and dancing at such great heights!  I understand they're professionals, but when you don't see people doing things as such on a common basis at levels well above the everyday eye level.. it puts everything into an ant-like perspective. 

*Spotted the guitarist in the VERY back with the double-headed neck completely rocking out all by himself.. it was at that very moment I thought to myself, ""I really think I'm in the wrong profession."" I have since focused less on web development and focused solely on becoming a musician. Not trying to be in KA or anything, just wouldn't mind reading sheet music and rocking out for a living from now on.

*I fell in love with the Imperial Sister that night

I gasped, laughed, sighed, cheered and a tear came to my eye. I don't recall a single moment that had my attention diverted elsewhere. I was reeled in and captivated throughout the entire show from beginning to end. I left out quite a bit, as it's something you should check out on your own.

Several things made Kà inconsistent with the usual standards of Cirque Du Soleil. For one, the storyline was a total cliché. I think I have seen ABC Family do better. Seriously, similar storylines can be found in any daytime cartoon. Furthermore, the ending was unusually underwhelming. When the entire cast came out for the curtain call, the audience's collective reaction was something like ""that was it?"" Kà's short program time didn't help either. 

Then there was the entire fight scene that consisted only of a pre-recorded video of their actors comically ""fighting"". The video was overcompensated with a plethora of needlessly loud sword-clashing soundtrack. Actually, the video really felt like watching a cut scene from an old video game, like from Nintendo Street Fighters or something. The video was not only blurry, it was also yawn-inducing. It dragged on for a painful amount of time. If you have a small bladder, this is the perfect time to go for a bathroom trip since there is no intermission. The decision to play the video perplexed me thoroughly until I learned later that the original\/live fight scene was removed from the show due to a death of an actor last year. 

Oh yeah, there was also an entire act that was just shadow puppets. Maybe I should have brought children to this show...? 

Overall, I still enjoyed the show despite its obvious shortcomings. (Having been drunk the whole time might have contributed to this.) Both the stage and the theater itself is impressive, and I loved it that I could feel the warmth of their pyrotechnics from my seat. Although, admittedly I sat only 4 rows from the front.

I am so grateful for the opportunity to see this show..it exceeded any expectations I had. Action packed. Exhilarating. Captivating. Amazing. Mind boggling. Well-rounded. 

Without giving away too much, here's some reasons to go see this show:
-Acrobats leave you with the ""wow"" factor
-Costumes are well done
-Stage, set and special effects REALLY add to the show
-Theater seats are comfortable with speakers in the headrest

This show is great for adults, but in my opinion, complexity of the characters might be inappropriate for kids under 7. (Costumes might be a little scary.)

The snack bar has standard theater type snacks, but it has some of the best priced drinks in Las Vegas.  If you buy a large beer, refills are then half price.  My wife got wine and she thought it was nice tasting and they filled her glass which made her happy.

The show is nonstop.  From the time you sit down in your seat until the very end there is someone going on.  Even before the actual show starts, there are performers moving around and doing small tricks to keep the early bird entertained.

As many of the reviewers already mentioned, the amount of acrobatics is less but the trade-off is that you get more of a plot and storyline that follows the happenings of a brother and sister who are separated and go on their own adventures. The effects are much more prominent in this show, which of course serves to distract from the lack of acrobatics but a good show is a good show and this is absolutely a GREAT show to come watch. It is animated for the eyes and the effects keep your attention. The seats are also a lot better because they have the sound speakers coming right out of your chair. 

I love all Cirque shows for the different element they bring. This almost Asian-themed performance was beautiful, more heartfelt than the others and kept attention very well. Comparatively, Mystere was an oddball that was just weird and unique but in a good way - Love was an homage to the Beatles and since I love the Beatles, the music put to the backdrop of acrobatic performances was a thrill to my senses.

Now that I am reading other reviews, it was really unfortunate about the fatal incident that they needed to change the last scene with projections. It was a very long part and it was the climax. Given that, they could've at least lessen the price.

first of all it's the largest of all the theaters by a long measure, so even though you're paying a lot for the ticket, it doesn't mean that you actually sit close at all.  for the same money you could buy a ticket for O or Mystere or Love, sit in a theater half the size, and you could even sit in the balcony and still be closer then a premium seat at Ka.

second of all.. the stunts are just terrible.. i see better stunts in a jet li movie, and at least there's no visible wires in the movie.  its really just terrible... the whole show is just a terrible chinatown parade mishmashed with asian martial arts demo.. seriously no artistry or amazing human feats at all..  might as well go see the circus circus midway shows for similar performances..

Without giving too much away, the stage seems to defy physics more than the performers do. It seemed to have a heavy Asian influence and the story, music and special effects really were amazing. I particularly liked the animal costumes - reminds me of the Lion King on Broadway.

The stage is crazy awesome in that it uses a giant claw type machine that holds the bottom of the stage allowing it to rotate in every which way which allows for a ton of cool scenes 

for example:(semi spoiler alert) battles on a vertical stage that continues to rotate.

The stage is really what allows for all of these awesome scenes. And there is more to the stage than just the rotating stage, a lot more, but I won't ruin it for you here. I suffered through a slight food coma during the show due to the insane amount of food I ate right before this show so I missed part of the story, but I got the main idea. The show is a standard 1.5 hrs roughly with amazing choreography and spot on enthusiastic performances, you can tell this is done very very professionally as they never miss a beat. Highly recommended, I would only take away one star for this because I am comparing this to all of the other shows I watched, including the price I paid for this which is a bit on the higher end ($110) when I have seen things that I was equally if not more impressed with such as Absinthe (70$), and I would say Absinthe has been my favorite show.",1,0,1

As life always plays out in dramatic and unexpected fashion, it became the fourth CdS (Cirque du Soleil) show watched.  This one is located at the MGM Grand.  Outside of O, general consensus says this is one of the best.  

Right at the front doors you'll be greeted by slew of ushers talking in a tone reminiscent of a Renaissance Fair except in the world of Ka.  We then took our ""professional"" pictures; one of which was with the ushers.  Bun asked why we took a picture with the usher.  Considering my silly logic, I really thought she was in the actual show for an odd reason.  She was just that convincing.        

Walking into the auditorium, you'll be blown away with the breathtaking size and grandeur of the theatre.  I almost ran into the railing looking straight up and around the theatre setting pieces.  The story of Ka is more a straight forward story than other CdS shows such as Mystere, which is overly abstract at points.  Filled with action packed martial art scenes, acrobatics, and some comedic relief to boot, the story of two siblings is played out with almost no narration.  Everything is shown through movements and facial expressions (if you're sitting close enough).  

The most glaring positive note I have for Ka is their translatability to the audience.  You can tell everyone just gets it when the characters on stage are conveying a language through movement.  The syncing dance with the backdrops and props will leave you firstly, awestricken from symbolic motion, and secondly, wearing a ""Whoa! How did they do that?"" face on.  

Good versus evil, love story, epic journey, and coming of age can all be categories describing the performance.  Ka has the whole package.  This is my favorite and best CdS so far.  Wild rides of suspense and emotion inducing moments will have you thinking where the last hour and half went.",9,7,8

They should advise you before you purchase your tickets that the final fight scene, which is the climax of the show, will be presented in low quality from a projector onto the stage.

Words simply won't do, in this case. Being there would! 

Just a couple of days before, I've seen ""O"" by Cirque du Soleil and though one Cirque show per trip would be enough. Well, I'm more than glad it wasn't! 

I decided to buy fall-offer tickets for ""Kà"" after going in the morning (Tuesdays @11AM, Kà Theatre at the MGM Grand) to the Theatre Tour. That's fully free! No charge to step into the ""Kà"" world. The presentation was engaging, entertaining and reveals incredible facts! It's a behind the scenes that enriches the actual show. 

After that presentation there was no turning back - Kà was something I had to see! No comparison is  possible to ""O"" (which, by the way, is fabulous! Mind-blowing!). 

I went there ahead of time, to make sure I would hear the acrobats playing the largest string instrument in the world, spread all across the hallway ceiling. Just get there at least 20 minutes early - plenty of things to do, from checking out the Kà shop, to being amazed by the amount of work and detail put into the costumes on display, playing behind the scenes videos and hearing the music played on the string instrument. Also, you can get drinks and popcorn before the show. And, meet the fantastic Lucky, the Dragon. 

First impression on entering the theatre is that you enter the Kà World: the theatre and the stage have no defined boundaries - stage is prolonged into the theatre, almost fully surrounding it, making you part of the story. Yes, that's right: there is a story, a true and fully developed plot-line. It is pretty easy to follow, but open to interpretation. It's a veritable bildungsroman. 

The makeup, costumes, props and technological effects are beyond any imagination. Flawless! The choreography is inspiring and intelligible (for the random individual).

It was sort of like watching a foreign show without the subtitles. The acrobats were to the very minimum. The performers did a bunch of swinging around without any actual acrobat moves.

I've seen three Cirque shows so far: Kurios, La Nouba and now Ka, and Ka is definitely my new favorite! What an epic show, I feel like there was no down time whatsoever and the theme was phenomenal.

The stage moves throughout the show, it rotates, flips, rocks, it's really hard to explain but the stage itself was a work of mechanical genius, I've really never seen anything like that.

From the opening scene your heart and mind are definitely racing, where else can you go to a show and have arrows being shot right over your head! It was like we the audience were right in the middle of the battle! 

There were so many times that I felt like something awful was going to happen to one of the performers, I was on edge the whole show, but then of course at the last second they would catch themselves or someone would save them. I know it's all part of the show but that's how good this thing was! The acrobats, the music, the martial arts, the stage, top notch. But, what else can you expect from Cirque du Soleil?!",2,1,1

I spent hours upon hours researching shows in Vegas for my 21st birthday and I finally decided on KA based on availability and ratings. How would I describe it in one word? Exciting! 

Like other people have said, it can sometimes be a little difficult to follow since they obviously can't talk, but everything else definitely makes up for it and you just forget about the story and get so involved with what they're doing!

A few things I would recommend if you're considering this show is to definitely buy early and straight from the MGM website! I bought 2 really good tickets in the front-ish rows for under $200 with taxes and everything included. 

Definitely go check it out! Definitely worth the money. I can't wait to go see all of the other ones :)",0,0,0

The change wouldn't have been so bad if they hadn't also changed his fate at the end of the show which just off sets the tone at the end. They made other changes as well to the show which i enjoyed and a few that were not really better or worse then before,  but ultimately that change to that one important character made me once again unable to set this one back up as my number one Vegas show and my recommendation for all my friends when they ask which show they should watch.",0,0,0

KÀ is a story about Imperial Twins who are separated by war. The technology behind this show blows my mind away. Stages appear and then disappear. The main stage rotates constantly. It lies horizontally for one scene and the next, it is transformed into a vertical cliff. 

The highly trained and skilled artists perform perpendicular acrobatics. They also demonstrate their amazing capoeira and wushu skills. Each seat is equipped with speakers built into the headrest. You are taken into another world by the magical sounds of the live musicians.

I like how the performers came out before the show actually started.  They did a small gestures\/skits while people were still looking for their seats.  They story line was simple, but made it easier to follow since there wasn't any dialog (just some singing). The performance and the graphics were amazing, but I was hoping the last flight would of been more intense and had more action.  Great start, weak finish.

It took me 2 1\/2 years to make it to KA for one reason or another. On 6\/30 that wait was over, and I can say without hesitation or reservation that it is one of the most mind blowing things I've ever seen. 

Expectations: Totally exceeded in every way. 

**************************************************

Reality check! This is Yelp! and I like to try and write useful reviews, not gushing, emotional pieces. So let's get to it. 
Parking: Valet is nice but can be a zoo. Self park is easy to get in and out of from Koval Lane, the local's not so secret access. 
Once you're parked you enter the MGM Grand. The MGM Grand will get it's own review. It has issues. It ain't all that. It's just an annoyance (and I do mean annoyance) to walk through to get to the KA Theater. 
But once you get your tickets or you scan the ones you have (They REALLY need to update those ancient hand scanners that are circa 2002), you are in for an experience that you will never forget. 

Once inside the theater the seating is quite comfortable even if you're a little wider or a little taller than most. Also there are hidden speakers in the top of the seats so for those with less than perfect hearing the audio will be a very pleasant surprise. Golden Circle Seating offers a more ""immersive"" experience but this is an intimate venue and Cirque brings parts of the show out into or over the audience so yes you can save money and still have an awesome experience (But being seated only 5 rows back we had several OMG that's awesome moments!). Beyond that, read the other reviews for details and know they're still not able to tell you just how good this is. And yes, if you are into the technical details of stagecraft the stage is EVERYTHING you've heard about, and still amazing to behold in action. When the lighting which is a cut above anything I've seen anywhere lets you see into the depths of the stage, the technical minded will catch glimpses of the massive machinery it takes to pull KA off and you will smile and oooh and ahh over the secondary spectacle that Cirque teases you with.  

Summary: It is worth every cent spent. 5 Stars? Placement on my Best of Las Vegas List? Placement on my The Mythical 6th Star List? Without any reservation or hesitation, OH HELL YES! All of that and more. 

Dear Cirque du Soleil: Now I understand. I get it. And I've still got an ear to ear smile the morning after, and an afterglow that's going to last for awhile.

Edit: One more thing. If you want concessions, be prepared to pay $$ Vegas Prices $$ for everything. $5 water? Check. $8 and up drinks? Check. This ain't a rant about it, I expected it, I'm mentioning it so people are not shocked when they see the pricing as many walking by the concessions sure grumbled about it.",3,0,3
4818379,ushHfc4SzJtsP9VAnPLUkA,t5y9jjoa8aednFPyRiPtog,DXlDzOcpdUE_F21tok0fgw,5,2013-05-24,"Overall rating is more like 4.5 stars out of 5.

The show was an amazing experience. I mean immediately when you walk in you can tell based on the ambiance and atmosphere of the theater that an excellent show is going to be put on.

One thing that I do believe needs to be addressed is the age limit of the attendees. Typically my wife and I have to deal with our seat location but this time was different. We booked a week in advance and we decided to shell out the extra mula for better seats (I'll give a little more insight on the seats after my age limit rant).

So here it goes.

Ok, so seating wasn't an issue for my wife and I for this occasion because we had good seats and could see the stage perfectly. However, this time around there were four seats behind us that held two older gentleman and two younger boys (One probably 4 or 5 and the other maybe 8 or 9 and before you call me evil hear me out). Now I don't have any issues bringing the younger folks to the show but when you have explain to them every five to ten minutes what's going on then I'm pretty sure this isn't a show for them. Also the younger one wouldn't stop talking, kicking our chairs, and smacking on popcorn like he has never had anything to eat. All of those distractions caused us to miss parts or the show (We paid a lot of money for the tickets I would like to get my moneys worth). Thus part of the reason I gave an overall rating of 4.5.

Ok now that the rant is over back to the actual performance. The theatrics were awesome and the stunts executed perfectly. You could tell that the people performing practiced hard because their timing with the performances were spot on. However, sometimes the scenes can seem a bit chaotic and over the place but not to the point where you don't understand the story they are portraying.

Now as for details on the seating that I mentioned earlier. Be careful not to get the closest seats in the theater because can cause for a very awkward viewing because you are right up on the stage.

In the end this show is a must see if you are ever in Vegas.",2,0,1

The Firefly boy dancing with the Princess among the trees was completely cut. This could have easily been converted from a swinging aerial act to a real dance. It would have conveyed the love story between those 2 characters and not have you question why the Princess chooses to marry him after you assume he saves her.
Then the final battle.... Yes, I know a performer died accidentally a little over a year ago, but the battle projected on the wall was unacceptable. It did not look right and it was difficult to tell what was happening. Again, this could have been reworked to make the action take place on a horizontal surface than the vertical one.

So much goes into the set mechanics that it's simply impressive to see this masterpiece play out. I've heard poor reviews of the show, and I can understand why. If you are coming for a circus-oriented show, then this is not it. What this is, however, is a very Cirque du Soleil interpretation of a theatrical production. Although there aren't many acrobatic acts in the sense of gymnastics, they are still very much geared towards athleticism. The opening pageant alone goes to show the skill that is required to perform in such a production.

What I really loved about the show was the overall aesthetic of the theatre, costumes, and lighting. I'm fully impressed with the grand entrance when people walk in, it really seems as if you're entering into a foreign world. The eye first is drawn towards the columns and then as you find your seat you notice the fire that seems to erupt from the void where one would expect to see a stage, only it's just a void that is filled with rolling fog effects and intense bursts of flame every so often. 

The attention to detail is really what makes Kà so wonderful. The costumes are magnificently crafted, and I'm partial to the archers and spearmen (super hot!). The stage transitions and lighting effects are both subtle, yet dramatic and truly take the user into a new world. Although I must say this isn't my favorite Cirque production, it is towards the top of the list. If you prefer more acrobatics, then see O and Mystère while in Vegas. If you prefer more theatrics, then Kà is definitely the show for you.",6,0,1

I have a HUGE respect for what these people do. It's daring, it's risky, and it takes years and years of dedicated training. If I'm ever asked about Cirque by someone who's never been? I zealously tell them to go. I've been to three, and plan on going to many, many, more.

That said... the notorious ""climax"" for this show just isn't there. The digital replacement is not only, well, a digital replacement, but a shoddy one at that. It's blurry, and it's extremely difficult to even see what's going on. This is a prime example in the importance of a solid ending. 

The rest of the show had brilliant moments, but even then, the story dwindled sporadically, and relied on the acrobatics to keep your attention.

It's all about a ratio of enjoyment to cost, and though the enjoyment WAS there, it just wasn't worth the $100 ticket cost. I know it seems tempting since it's slightly cheaper than ""O"" or any of the other more acclaimed Vegas shows, but my advice? Just spring the extra $30 and go for one of those!

My family and I stayed at Luxor and decided we would go to a Cirque show. Then we saw Kà and it looked like a really good show. So we bought tickets and waited for the 9:30 show.

WOW! When I went into the Kà theatre, I can feel the excitement in the atmosphere. I felt right into the scene because the lights were dimmed, these cultural themed posts and bridges connecting all of them. And every time I go to a Cirque du Soleil show, I can't but help to anticipate. 
Here's the cool thing. On your seat, there's a speaker built into it so you feel like into the scene. Plus, they have a giant stage that can rotate almost 360 degrees. The actors take precaution and have ropes that pull them up and down during the performances. The do this fluidly and you won't even know it's a part of the show. 

The death wheel scene was amazing. The actor jump-roped on it without any rope attacked to him so if he falls, it's the dirt nap for him. I just love everything in this show, from how the actors express emotions very realistically, to how the actors can see and perform with all that makeup on.

You have to follow the story closely through the action because the ""script"" , after the introduction of the story plot at the begnning, is not really language. But the acrobatics, the set, the action sequences are extraodinary. My wife couldn't even watch a few times as the acrobatics were just too perilous to believe. The performers really risk it all, every show, twice a day five days a week. You have never seen anyting like this.  After the tragic death of one of the performers last summer[ due to an equipment failure), one sequence at the end is projected onto a screen. I think this was the weakest part of the show. The sequence could be recreated, or maybe some explaination of why this is done could be given, either in introducing the show, or maybe have a program printed for the audience. But aside from that few minutes that don't reach the level of the rest of the performance, it is just jaw-dropping amazing. I don't know if there are occassional hiccups and misses in other performances of Ka, but the show we saw was flawless for the entire hour and half production. It was my first Cirque show, so I don't have others to compare too. But now I am a true fan and want to see other shows someday. My only real regret was that the audienced didn't give the performers a standing ovation at the end. But they probably couldn't stand up that quickly after drinking all day as most visiting Las Vegas seem to do. Leave your iphones in your pocket, you can't take pics before or during the show.

Currently, Cirque du Soleil is having a discount on tickets for their 20th anniversary celebration. I was a bit skeptical about choosing this over Mystere 'cause of the reviews on here, but I'm glad we chose KA! Originally we were going to get seats close up, but again I did my research and a lot of ppl said to get seats further back. We got seats in section 202 Row GG seats 15-18 (smack dab in the middle!) We had a great view of the entire stage. It's true, it's better to sit further back (Row AA is the best) 'cause the stage continuously moves\/flips and is really big.

I enjoyed KA 'cause it actually had a story line and it follows through in the show. I liked the theme\/decoration of the theater as well in comparison to Zarkana. I'm not sure what other reviewers were saying, but there was plenty of acrobats in KA. We saw the 9:30 show and it kept me awake and entertained whereas Zarkana I fell asleep halfway through lol.

The theater itself is decorated very differently than the other theaters as they incorporate a lot of the pillars into the show.  I think what I liked most about this show is that you invest in the characters, that there's actually a storyline that you can follow along with this show, as opposed to the others. 

RIP to the girl who passed away in this, and kudos to all the performers in this enchanting and mesmerizing show, TRULY amazing what they do in this show.  Let's just say there are several battle scenes where the people are actually performing on a platform that is at a 90 degree angle, essentially where the audience is getting a bird's eye view.  Spectacular. 

To all the previous posts where they said that the final battle was in CGI, not sure if they meant the characters as well, but if so, they've brought it back where it's actually people fighting again, and it was EPIC, I can't wait to come back and see it again!!!

WOW at the music and how it just transcends you into this magical world where sea creatures are larger than life and these people who speak gibberish make total sense.

They have a few alcoholic drinks you can purchase, including water coke, diet coke, and sprite. Also, popcorn and a few types of candy. I will warn you though.. it's very expensive. 

They close the bathrooms they have in the KA area after the show (at least they did when we went), so head to the bathrooms in the casino immediately. Because they got packed FAST.

What I got was air stunts, confusion, boredom, and mediocre fights. 

Really. Why even say you have a story? The narrator was in the initial start of the play then never returned. It was like watching a foreign film without subtitles, which was also part interpretive dance and silent movie? It didn't make sense.

The twins were separated, boy got away, girl lost at sea, deserted island, sparkle tarzan, bandit girl that looked exactly like the princess(so confused), marriage and fireworks? It was just so confusing. Was there a plot? Was there a reason? The posters say romance and drama! But, I didn't see that, at all. I saw a lot of random things happening. 

I would understand if it was just a stunt show, then I wouldn't grade it so harshly, but it was described as a fighting play? Which is why I'm not enthused about it at all. I would not recommend this to anyone. Maybe the other ones are better? But my experience was terrible.

:: Experience::
I didn't find it boring and my daughter loved it!  The show has a story which I think I understood.  The acrobatic was entertaining and a bit suspenseful.  There were some funny moments too.  I can see why some people thought it was ""slow"" but I still liked it!!  The seats I bought was about $88.  At first I thought we wouldn't see much but it was not bad.

This show had a discernible plot, characters, & the circus segments were fewer and further between. The vertical battle sequence was probably my favorite part (and the obscene starfish).

No question the Ka theater and costumes at this show are amazing, however, both the 'acting' and quality of the performance were way below what I was anticipating given the other reviews and the reputation of the Cirque enterprise. Throw in chaotic, deafening head-banger music and you start to get an idea of why I am so critical of this show.

I thought I scored a good deal on the tickets - $323 w\/tax for 3 in really good seats near the front. Unfortunately, as the show wore on, I found myself dreaming about how many other ways I could have enjoyed spending that money elsewhere. To be fair, there were a few good sequences that were entertaining and well done... but those amounted to probably 10 minutes of the 1.5 hour performance. Many of the routines just left you wondering 'Huh? Why was that included??' For instance, at one point a performer does a solo twirling a baton... the first few seconds were ok, albeit a bit amateurish. However, after 3 or 4 minutes of watching her twirl the friggin baton you wished she would just topple off the stage or otherwise disappear.

Likewise, there were a few martial art sequences that can only be described as lame. Keep in mind there are two performances of this show each night - this was the early show. Still, at times the performers looked completely exhausted throwing weak kicks and punches that truly looked like a bunch of pre-schoolers trying to play-fight as they re-enacted something they saw on TV! When routines like that fell so flat on the stage, I could only shake my head and roll my eyes with my companions doing the same thing next to me.

There was a family with three 6-8 year old kids sitting on booster seats next to us and those kids seemed to be enjoying the show. I guess if you are looking to entertain your kids for a few hours this show works. However, if you are expecting quality entertainment at an adult level and you are ok spending more than $100\/ticket, do yourself a favor and check out another show.",0,0,0

There was so much going on that I would have probably not have gotten a chance to experience it the way I did if I was in the front.  Don't let the ticket guys lie to you.  There really are no bad seats. The stage was ridiculous, it was definitely the star of the show.

The story was great and very easy to follow. The transitions between acts were great. Some of the acts gave me that tingling sensation. The princess with the flute twirling was one of my favorites. How do you do that every night without messing up. The princess with the jungle guy swing act was very beautifully done as well. The first battle scene with the bad guys running up the wall was pretty sweet. The last guy to fall off, man was my heart pounding for him. The stage was so amazing. I wonder what happens to all that sand, and what do the people fall on. 

The only part I didn't like was the final battle scene. I mean I get it, one of the performers passed away during this scene, but it doesn't mean you bring the show down hill. As a big production show, I expected Cirque du Soleil to find an alternative way to display this act.

I am enamored of Cirque du Soleil. My first Cirque experience was La Nouba (the resident show at Disneyworld in Orlando, Florida); it enthralled me and I ultimately saw it 13 times while I resided in Orlando. 

I have attended no fewer than 20 or so unique Cirque shows. Most of them were touring productions (Alegría, Varekai, Saltimbanco, Dralión and Luzia, among others). I've also seen five here in Las Vegas (Love, Zumanity, O, Mystére, KÀ).  

Of all the Cirque spectacles I've seen, I would declare KÀ my most favorite (tied with Love, as I am also a devoted Beatles fan). 

KÀ is unique in that it depicts a story, and a sweet one at that. At its center is a giant, moveable platform called the Sand Cliff Deck. By itself, it is a technical wonder. ""[It] measures 25×50×6 feet (7.6×15.2×1.8 m) and weighs 50 tons. A vertical gantry crane supports and controls the Sand Cliff Deck, lifting the platform up and down 72 feet (22 m), rotating it 360 degrees and tilting it from flat to 100 degrees"" (Wikipedia). From its depiction of a boat in the show's opening, to a cantilevered chase scene with arrows being ""fired"" into it, to being a backdrop to a vertically-staged fight, the Sand Cliff Deck is a performer in its own right!

The performers, of course, make a Cirque show. I loved the beach scene (I love animals, and the crab and turtle were executed ingeniously); the shadow puppetry was adorable; the strap duet performers were duly impressive for their physical strength and for the fact that they were performing without the benefit of a safety line; the Wheel of Death was thrilling, and I was amazed at the performers' stamina. 

I immensely enjoyed my time at KÀ, and am very much looking forward to seeing it again (if my husband will allow it, I just might ask if we can see it again during our 3-night stay here).",0,0,0

I actually liked the fact that there was a story line that was easy to follow (maybe because I've seen it twice?!?!).  The martial arts is great and the moving stage just makes it that much more incredible.

I've read another reviewer say that they have seen several Cirque shows and that this one was the worst.  My opinion is quite the opposite.  Cirque shows can get quite boring....how many 3% body fat - freakin' hot- acrobats can you realistically see flinging themselves hither and thither before it all becomes a bit boring?   O comes to mind, I enjoyed it, don't get me wrong and the diving is incredible, but I think KA delivers more....and yes there are hand puppets which I thought were very cool....and it flows with the story line.  I think that is better than that stupid clown\/emcee that prances all around the stage speaking in gibberish...or was that French?  SouthPark does a wonderful parody of the Cirque phenomenon.

Also, there aren't as many acrobatic scenes as there are in other cirque shows. The wheel of death is also the most terrifying thing to watch. I wish they would cut that out of all cirque shows after what happened at Zarkana. It's the most unsafest thing I've seen. 
Nevertheless, there are some good parts to this show. Utilization of the wall\/stage they use is very impressive. The closing of the show ended with a Big Bang. Certain acts were amazing and beautiful. Overall, it's okay, but not the best of the cirque shows. I suggest:

The stage is indeed impressive and more than a few times I asked myself how anyone could dream up such a feat. Although the stage seems a heavy slab of engineering genius, the stage metamorphosizes throughout the show to blend in with each scene providing at times the backdrop and at others the centerpiece of the show.

Although we were impressed by the acrobatics, a consensus favorite among our group of six were the shadow puppets; animated and full of personality.

Fire, battle scenes, a rotating stage & a darkness I have yet to experience in other Cirque shows-- KA gets five stars. The story of a brother & sister torn apart by war was an easy (& heart wrenching) story to follow. My favorite scene of all is the simulated sea scene--it really looked like the characters were floating through water.

This is the fourth Cirque show I've seen (Zumanity, Believe, Ovo.)  Highly recommended because it is much less campy & more serious than the other three shows. I loved the industrial looking set & the gloomy & moody feeling that encompasses the show.

All I can say, after watching the show, is that KA is the best Cirque du Soleil show I've seen so far!

From the moment you walk into the theater you know you are in for something great. A wide view of golden rails and torches surrounding the amphitheater, and pits of fire from the stage make a pretty cool welcome.

Then the show is simply magnificent: The stage is mind-blowing, the main platform turns and moves in literally every direction. The sets and costumes are gorgeous, the music is beautiful, and the acts are varied and pretty impressive.

One thing I really liked was that (unlike many of the other Cirque shows that feel like just different performances) Ka tells a story. You get the acts, jumps, impressive maneuvers and more, but it's a great twist to have all that merged into a story.

One tip: if you've had your drinks make sure to visit the restrooms before the show because it's an hour and a half long, there are no intermissions, and you are not gonna want to miss any part of this show!",2,0,0

Ka is the most narrative and story-driven of all the shows.  It is not the spectacle of ""O"" nor the whimsy of Mystere nor the steaminess of Zumanity.  It certainly is not like the musical tribute to the Beatles that ""Love"" is.

Ka is the story of two Imperial twins separated by treachery, who come of age in their journey to reunite and to restore their legacy.  It's the easiest and most focused of the Cirque plots to follow.  There is a martial theme to the story and the stunts and dance are influenced by Wu Shu.  As a companion put it, ""This is Cirque du Soleil for boys"".  I couldn't agree more.

As with all the LV shows, there really isn't a bad seat in the theatre and sitting back a bit actually helps with some of the scale of the stunts and effects.

KA is an extraordinary feast for the eyes and ears. The Cirque performers are the greatest at their craft. High-soaring acrobats, a lovely storyline (the journey of a brother and sister) and daredevil acts. Cirque is known worldwide for their amazing shows. You won't go wrong with a Cirque show in Vegas - but if you're a fan of good action and adventure, you'll want to see KA at the MGM. 
It can get a little confusing at times without narration. Where is the brother? What happened to the sister? Why is that giant turtle dancing? But the visual imagery makes up for the lack of narration. Bring on the stunts! Oh, and I liked the dude rocking out on the guitar. Watch out for him. He's rad.

For KA, my wife was the fan and I was just going along. For Penn & Teller, the other way around.

My wife really wanted to see Ka, and from the trailers we found on the site and reviews in a few places we decided our first Cirque experience would be Ka. The idea of the sand and fire themes seemed interesting.

Right away, the theater impressed. It was huge, but clearly built so that there was no such thing as a bad seat. In addition, there are multiple tiered levels built almost to the back of the theater, so you immediately have the sense that the show will take place on more than just the front stage (which bellows fireballs as you sit waiting). The ushers were all in character, and I overheard many speaking multiple languages to people who did not speak English, allowing them to help everyone find their seats or just chat.

Once the show started, it was an instantly immersing experience. The acrobatic performers run through the aisles, soar overhead on cables, and jump from the central rotating platform onto the stage wall only feet from the front row. At every moment, there is a simply staggering display of athleticism and choreography at work. Even for for someone like myself with zero interest in gymnastics or musical theater, I was taken aback by the performance. If there's one thing that was mediocre, it was the story, which was very familiar. Luckily, it's also not very important to the overall show.

I guess I am missing some part of my brain (emotion? imagination?) because, unlike the majority of reviewers here, I really did not like this show.

Yes, the rotating flying stage is amazing. The stunts are pretty good too. But I need a bit more to keep my attention during a 90 minute show. There is no dialogue and the story is super hard to follow. There are stuffed animals (large ones, but still), there's martial arts, there's fire. It's kinda a man's show in that there's a lot of stunts and stuff.  Again, though, for 90 minutes I need something more to keep me going. After a while all the special effects get kind of old and you're left with nothing. It's like a delicious looking cake but once you bite into it you realize it's just flour and sugar. Total let down.

I have to say this is only my 2nd Cirue du Soleil show (the first being Ulalena in Maui), and while Ulalena was better in terms of plot and story, it still wasn't great. So I guess the take-away point is, Circque shows are for people who (1) want to spend a lot of money, (2) be entertained with pyrotechnics, stunts, and moving objects.  That's just not me, sorry.

Talk about intense!! The performers are very good at what they do and there is no other cirque show like this one!! Don't sit too close to the stage as the vertical platform they perform on is HUGE and if you sit too close, your neck will probably ache by the end of the show from having to look up most of the time.

Since I went solo, I think I paid $64, which was still pretty good and with a pretty good seat too.

I really didn't know what to expect walking in the theater; but it seemed  that you are expecting all of the theater would be part of the show with the giant towers, and dangling ropes so I was thinking to myself...this is gonna be cool.

So I was told that KA has a lot of acrobatic performances and a really great story line. I can totally see the acrobatic performances but I didn't get the story line. Maybe it was just me, but there seemed to be some good guys, then some bad guys taking over, then the good guys take over at the end. There were Asians, blacks and some Eskimos? so I couldn't figure it out...oh well.

But the performances by the artists were definitely top notch. With the super high tech stage that kept the audience guessing on what is going to happen made it more special. Lots of gravity defying stunts did make me go ""wow"" but it wasn't enough to compensate for the unknown story line.

I'm not going to give away the story since it will spoil the fun.  I simply love it.  The technology that seamlessly transformed the theme from land to water to mountain was breathtakingly amazing.  The acrobats and aerialists pleased the crowds as expected.  Ancient Chinese martial arts and weapon play were also successfully inserted into the show.  The only part of the show I didn't like too much was when projected movie technology was used to depict a section of the story.  I want to see everything in real act, not screen projection.

The retail store next to the show is also worthy visiting.  I was excited to see the exclusive collection by Desigual (a colorful, bohemian Spanish apparel line) for KA.

In pursuit of a tired, predictable story line, the producers of Ka seem to have abandoned much of the breathtaking acrobatics and feats of human physical prowess that Cirque is so well known for.

The show draws imagery from disparate Asian themes, which at first seemed like a nice touch. Also thrown in, however, were what looked like Native Americans, Tarzan, and Marilyn Manson-esque rock characters. An eclectic variety of influences is fine, but this was downright confusing.

The martial arts were slow, painfully fake, and underwhelming. You'd be better off watching a WWE match - at least pro wrestlers know how to throw and take fake hits. The acrobatics were not even close to Cirque du Soleil's standard. As another reviewer noted, they relied too much on wires. It was easy to see that the actors were just as talented as any other Cirque performer. But their abilities were watered down by the emphasis on the story.

To be fair, the show had its moments, but they were few and far between. The stage was truly innovative, as it could spin, move up and down, and rotate to just about any angle. It would seamlessly change from a boat, to a sandy beach, to a vertical rock wall. The theater environment was very well done as well. Each seat had speakers positioned in the headrest, providing a surround sound-like experience and adding to the immersion. But these were desperately underutilized.

Before entering, there was a helpful usher that split people into the proper lines and guided them towards the right entrance.  Our tickets were scanned, and more ushers guided us towards our seats.  Definitely no issues with service, that's for sure.  

Now, the detail of the theater was simply unique!  Long walkways all along the walls that really made you wonder.  Near showtime, you start to see performers walk across them in costume.  From there they joined the crowd, stalking and lurking on people trying to make their way to their seats.  Especially preying on late arrivals; So don't be late for the show or you'll be spotlighted.  Talk about an intentional embarrassment.  It was pretty funny, and I pretty much  knew we were in for a great show.

Here's a few of the highlights I enjoyed:
~ The martial arts experts:  These included the good guys, warriors and archers.  Their moves and stunts were simply astonishing and impressive.  
~ The outfits:  Talk about Flash Gordon-like!  From the mountain tribesmen, forrest people and moving animals on the beach, they all had a crazy array of color.  Way cool!   
~ The rotating moveable stages:  With the circling sinking boat which was freakin' awesome to see, to the mountain wall that stood some 90+ feet up.  Man I was speechless in awww!  Even the backdrop of certain scenes were simply extraordinary.  
~ The acrobatic moves on or along the stage or in the air:  They flew around the audience like humans with no fear; I couldn't believe my eyes!  And the guy doing jump-rope on the human hamster-wheel.  Holy crap, I was praying for this guy's safety.
~ But probably my most favorite highlight, or shall I say highlights were:  1) The shadow puppets.  Not sure I've ever seen a mastered hand puppet show.  Definitely remarkable.  2) The scene following the boat sinking:  I enjoyed the lone maiden in water with the floating bubbles in, ""breathtaking""!  

As for the ending... They must've altered it, because there was no video ending at the time we went.  Just fireworks and the unity of the tribes becoming peaceful.

However, neither the musicians nor the dancers were synchronised with each other. The Wheel Of Death was cancelled. 

Most obviously, there was no energy in the entire performance! Everyone looked like they wished to be somewhere else. That made all the performances lack any passion or intensity, and I was never truly 'swept along for the mystical journey'. I almost dozed off which I've never felt before at any live event, let alone a CdS show. 

I truly wish this had blown me away as I raised my family's expectations and we spent $900 on tickets. I am bewildered by the high rating on Yelp. Maybe I went on a bad night. Either way, will approach my next CdS show with caution.

Plan your Vegas trip around the time when Expedia gives out 2 free Cirque tickets if you book three nights hotel with airfare. I've done it twice and it is SO worth it! Yes, I know I live within driving distance to Vegas but I dread that hangover ridden slow crawl back to the OC so much that I am wiling to pay a couple extra bucks to fly. 

On to the review...

Hands down the best Cirque show in Vegas and I've been to all of the ones worth going to... Hubby and I got free tickets and were a little worried about what our seats would be like... They were AWESOME! About 10 rows up from the front, aisle for me (yay!) and the lady at the will call told us that had we paid for them they would have been worth $175 each. Score!

The show was incredible. The stage was seriously the coolest thing ever. It is huge and angles up so that it is almost straight up and down. The stunts and acrobatics were amazing. I wasn't bored for a second! Unlike other Cirque shows I could follow the story line. Bonus! 

The drinks they serve up are ridiculous. Huge and so full of alcohol that if you aren't careful you'll quickly be on your ass. Don't worry. I was fine. I still have that huge cup though (I use it for water now). 

Go see this show. Even if you have to pay full price for it. You will NOT be disappointed!",2,1,2

My wife had seen many previously but it was my first time. It was very cool. The reason for four stars is that when you have so many shows on the strip, it doesn't quite have the 'you absolutely have to see it' feeling. It was good and you should see it, but if you choose something else, you may be just as happy. 

So this is the fire show with a rotating stage. Don't sit in the first 6 rows or so as the stage lifts up and you can't see everything. The stage and the ambiance was great. From the dragon out front to the harp players above your head, they set the mood right from the beginning. 

The story was very good and easy enough to follow (especially for a cirque show). The fire and rotating stage were very cool, as was the choreography and costume design. 

Overall, I would recommend seeing the show. There are no real negatives to mention, but I wouldn't give it an absolute recommendation as O or any of the other shows may be just as good or more you're style.",0,0,0

This performance seemed more like a story\/theater type rather than just a bunch of acrobatics. Our favorite scene was the jumping around on those spinning wheels.

I took 1 star away because the ending scene was all video. There was a whole dramatic scene that lead to the final scene.. then all of a sudden it's video!! 

Other than that, the show is great and my boyfriend enjoyed it as well. Lots of fight scenes for guys to enjoy :)

btw. Look for deals cuz they're out there!! I found a winter deal through Google which lead me to the mgm site and got tickets for only 55 each!

As my date described it after it was over, ""this show was epic!"" -- Firstly, I really liked the MGM Grand. We didn't get a chance to go there the first time we were in the Vegas, but this time, we spent quite a bit of time there. The theatre was big and the seating was comfortable. We had seats in the lower half of the auditorium on the right side when facing the stage. It was a good vantage point to see everything that was happening.

The story itself was very easy to follow which I think made it even more entertaining. There were a lot of great tricks & martial arts moves, along with some comic relief. The thing I like best was the moving stage; it created some really dynamic scenes and gave the actors a lot of room to perform.

We're recommend this show to others when visiting Las Vegas. Try to get a seat in the lower half of the auditorium since there are intricate details which I imagine can't be seen from higher up.

After a great experience @ Cirque's 'Beatles Love' Show in 2014 - we were both looking forward to another amazing Cirque performance.  'Ka' did not deliver ...

Upon first glance - the 'Ka' theater was impressive.  The theme based lobby was elegant, seats were comfortable & the staff was friendly.  However - due to the high seating capacity & size of the stage, the venue lacked intimacy.  Seated in the upper level - the performers appeared small & we felt too 'far' from the action

'Ka's' theme was more plot based - combining a tragic, historical story with the amazing acrobatics & visuals that are the hallmark of a Cirque production.  However - the story was clumsy & confusing and failed to capture this Yelper's imagination.  I found myself dis-connected from any of the characters, uninspired by the plot, and struggling to stay awake during this 90 minute show.  Despite the impressive 'Wheel of Death' scene - ""Ka' just failed to deliver on the expectations of a ""Cirque"" production.  Perhaps the franchise should focus on its core strength - 'wowing' the audience instead of thought provoking yet complicated storylines.  

Quite frankly - I'd rather have spent my money on ""Carrot Top"" and an hour of black jack.",0,1,0

     I have seen Mystére, Zumanity, and Zarkana. While all of these Cirque Du Soleil shows are prominent and unique, Ká is the one show that truly touched my heart. 

     The storyline is beautifully designed. Every performer has their own important role in the ENTIRE show. Ká makes sure that you easily understand the plot, and most importantly,  watch the variety of perspectives of the main performers.  It's an indefinite attribute that the viewers  and I noticed.

     Along with the storyline, the amazing acrobatics, the beautifully designed costumes, the vibrancy of the colors,  Ká takes you on a journey full of wonders and excitement-delicately steering your emotions throughout the entire show.

   Although the visuals and the performances  were a marvel to see, what caught  my attention the most was the music being played. Ká played a large variety of music in each segment and Cirque Du Soleil beautifully synthesized the genres to their respective scenes. The music was so vast that the amazing vocals, the guitars, harps, drums, flutes, and other percussions were merged to a splendor of creativity in such a form that I sat in awe with my mouth opened lol. 

 If you want to be taken to a dimension of fantastic visuals, music, and beautifully  choreographed performances, Ká is a show by Cirque Du Soleil that I highly recommend.",3,1,2

I chose Ka after talking to everyone who has seen it tell me the show was amazing.

Halfway through the show, I was extremely impressed with the layout, costumes, performances and the stage set up. I can't imagine the amount of planning and design that went into designing the theater.  I was ready to give the show 4-5 stars until...the CGI\/projected fight scene. It was blurry as hell and I couldn't figure out what was going on.  It was such a disappointment seeing that and unfortunately I let that ruin the entire show for me.  I wish they would have just left that out because it really didn't flow.  They should either remove that entirely (or if they are going to show it for the stories sake, make it shorter) or just choreograph something else with the actual performers.

We decided to give Ka a chance tonight. The stage was amazing, it floated, rotated, you name it... The performers were also great. Why the 2 stars? It was boring. The storyline was slow and too much of people flying around on ropes. The music was in language I didn't understand and it was all just too dramatic for my personal choice. I'm officially giving up on cirque.",0,0,0

I thing Love is my favorite and I would avoid the Michael Jackson Cirque if  I truely wanted a cirque show. On to KA. I loved the theater and the seating. Not sure if there is a bad seat in the house. As well the stage. WoW that stage. It truely is the star of the show. Yes the actors\/acrobates are amazing but the stage makes the show. I would recommend this to anyone who want to see a good cirque show. Not my favorite but not something I would aviod. With that said I think once was prob enough for me on this one. I am glad I saw it at least once though.,1,0,0

The beginning and the middle were captivating but too much dead time sprinkled in throughout and by dead time I mean the comical bits that are used as a tool to distract you\/set the stage for the next scene (i.e. the sand pit part). The gripe I have about Ka is they failed to provide a climax and therefore lost me by the end of the show. The part of the show where it's supposed to be an epic battle scene on the vertical stage was not done live and instead was a previously recorded scene that was displayed across one of the stages. I was so confused watching this and the entire time they showed it I kept thinking, ""What the hell are they doing? Why isn't this live? Why am I watching this video? WHY AREN'T THEY DOING THIS BIT LIVE?!"" I'm assuming that's the part of the show when a late performer's cable snapped and fell to her death, and if so, they should have re-choreographed that part of the show or done away with it completely. Watching a recording of it just left me, well, unsatisfied. It was incomplete for me.",1,1,3

Although this is only the second Cirque show I have seen, I have attended several sports, music, and fine arts events, and this is easily the most memorable event. Although tickets are rather expensive, there are discounts available online if you look hard enough. I recommend searching slickdeals before purchasing. My family bought tickets off of a slickdeals.net post, and they were $270 for three tickets about six rows away from the stage. Although that is not cheap by any means, the face value of the tickets are significantly higher. It was an amazing spectacle and worth every penny. Every person in the show gave a brilliant performance. (Note: for a preview, I would recommend going on Youtube to see what the hype is about). If you have any appreciation for the performing arts, I highly recommend you see this show. I would definitely see this show again in the future.",0,0,0

The storyline was well conveyed which was impressive since it was void of words. The permanent stage provided some unique acrobatic opportunities unseen in traveling cirque du soliel performances. My only wish is that rather than using CGI for the final fight scene (apparently a performer fatality made live performances stop) they just created a new scene.,0,0,0

I was not amazed as everyone else was with this show. The props and stunts were cool but nothing to die for. There was more story telling and fake kung fu that took up most of the show. There were about 2 or 3 really cool scenes but besides that it wasn't to my liking. 

SPOILER ALERT: the big spinning wheel was the coolest along with the vertical wall. The fighting on the wall and the sand was something u would see on power rangers. Just over exaggerated fighting. It didn't help that the actors spoke baby language. It wasn't English, Chinese, or anything. It was goo gaa gag ooo. I myself wouldn't go back to see. Maybe when I'm a lot older and haven't seen better things. I would go to a Michael Jackson Cirque du Soleildad if they came out with one.",1,0,0

What a show! Easy entrance. The employees are SO nice! They're very helpful and funny when finding your seat. They talk and joke around with everyone in the audience. 

The show is spectacular. I love the story line and the costumes. These performers are so talented and strong. They really put on a great show. I don't want to give too much away, but I really can't imagine anyone not enjoying the show. Just go, and you will enjoy it. There's a lot of effort put into the story, the performance, and the stage set up and you can tell!

The only thing, is that one of the last scenes includes some sort of projection screen of people climbing up and down the wall. This is the scene that was previously the actual performers doing the acts going up and down, but has been changed to projection since Sarah Guillot-Guyard passed away. It's a very traumatizing thing to have a performer pass during the act. I almost feel that they should just remove the scene altogether. But it is not my decision. 

The other thing... If you play MyVegas you should use your points on this! I used mine on two tickets for the show and we got row D seats 1 and 2. It was a fantastic location and the tickets retailed at $140 each! Can't go wrong with a great cirque show for free in Vegas.",3,0,1

From vertical wall battles to the acrobatic moves. Pretty cool there is a storyline too. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a show in Vegas. I enjoyed it a lot more than Jersey Boys or Blue Man. Guess more Cirque Du Soleil shows for me when I come back to Vegas.

They have a concession outside the auditorium where you can buy popcorn and beverages. Not much alcohol in the drinks tho.",1,0,1
