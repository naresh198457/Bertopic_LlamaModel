We were all super excited because it was our first time.When we first saw the room it was spacious and elegant the decor was beautiful and plenty of space for the four of us to get ready.

The first day we were having some issues with the drains not going down in our bathroom and kitchen sink. After notifying the front desk, management did not step in to address the pluming issue nor did maintenance. We called housekeeping the second day for restocks on towels toothpaste and other necessities. I asked them if they knew the problem to our drains not going down and turns out that our drains were locked from the previous guest that was staying in our hotel room. 

Now that's the least of my worries....

On our second day we decided to order room service for lunch.I believe we ordered a BLT with a side of salad and fresh fruit. I picked at the fruit to pick out a blackberry and you won't believe what I found!!! 
A LIVE WORM!!! I was disgusted!!! 
Called front desk immediately and notified them about the worm squirming around In our food .Somebody eventually came up and took a look at the food and told hotel management. 

We went down and showed her pictures and videos of the worm and she apologized BUT also said that ""mistakes do happen all the time"" 
(Yes we did get our money back for our meal because obviously we didn't eat it...) 

I had such high expectations for Cosmo and wish that I had a better stay. To be honest I don't think I would ever stay here again.

I didn't have a chance to hit up the main pool last time I was here, and really enjoyed lounging at the Boulevard pool this go-round. It was chill, but still lively and had decent music (surprised us, as we are both snobs and my bf is a dj haha). The people were great too. Good vibes. Great hot tub also!

The suite has its own washer and dryer, two full bathrooms, a full kitchen, wine fridge, and just about every other amenity you could ever want.  The view of the strip from the balcony was impressive.

The building footprint is small, but they fit a lot into it.  We did not get the chance to try any of the food options or shop, but we will next time.  I also will be coming back in the summer to take advantage of at least one of the pools.

Well what can I say, 

I'll start with PARKING. 

5 stars.

The garage is laid out very well and you are only a short walk to the elevator.
This can be quite convenient when going back and fourth from room to car.
Also, all of the spots have a really great LED system that is set up above the parking spot that lights up green when empty, and stays red when occupied. Thus making finding a spot MUCH MUCH EASIER!!!

SERVICE: 5 stars

From the check in desk, to the prompt security this place has their service ON POINT!!! I had an inncedent on my first night with a loud neighbor at 5:00 am.
I called the desk, noise was gone under 5 minutes. End result, a happy customer.

Hotel\/casino. Do I even have to say??  Of course it's 5 stars...

....It's a 4+ BILLION DOLLAR HOTEL!!!

Apparantly the whole ""city center project"" including vdara, mandarin oriental, veer towers, aria, as well as the cosmo and the defunct harmon, was IN TOTAl, 9 billion! before ressecion and inflation. 

Thus making the cosmopolitan absorb almost HALF the cost of the whole freakin place.

Uhh, ya... It's pretty effing nice. Probably the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in and seen.

This was my first visit to this hotel but I had seen it featured on various TV shows over the past couple years.  As the cab pulled under the garage space, I knew I was in the right place, it was just like on TV with the lines of limos pulled in front of the entrance doors.  

As I walked inside, I noticed quickly how updated and clean the lobby area was.  I was quickly greeted in the check-in line and by a staff member who was directing people to the open check-in desks.  I had a few min. wait before it was my turn but it's to be expected in LV.  At check-in I was promptly given my keys and was pointed to the West tower elevators. This is the nicest of all Marriott properties I have ever stayed at.  

First let me tell you about my pillow top mattress, this is possibly the most comfortable hotel mattress I have ever slept on.  It might even be better than the Bellagio beds which I am a big fan of.  The bathroom was huge and the glass shower on one side and a tub on the other.  The room was fully upgraded and I enjoyed my view of the Bellagio Fountains from my room.

There are many bars at this property and tons of machines for gambling.  The entire place is well kept and very clean.

The Cosmo is centrally located on the Strip so no matter where you want to go, it's quick to walk to most places.  It was nice to be able to walk to New York New York and Caesars without tiring myself out too much.   

My only complaint is the lack of casual dining restaurants.  I was looking for some type of casual sports bar to sit down and have a quick lunch at, but everything seemed a bit too fancy for me.  I ended up eating at a different hotel but it was a quick walk away.

I would have to say, this is the nicest of hotels I have stayed in yet on the strip.  Most rooms include a Terrace, and the room I got is spacious and includes comfy bed and nice couch as well.  Included is a mini-fridge. (Of course standard arm and leg pricing.). The reason I would give the room 5 stars is because it is super clean and from my perspective; flawless.  As I was comped the room, I cannot rate the value...but very nice. 

The casino floor is very nice too.  A lot of bling and upper class type of people. (Not necessarily my crowd, but dang....the rooms here just make it so worth it.)  Anyways, don't come looking for low limit tables--it is rare to find a Blackjack or roulette under $25\/min. Busier nights $50 min

Food: 5\/5.   Holsteins for lunch.  Best burger ever. Seriously. Mando place each trip.     And late when your drunk, there is a secret pizza place on the 3rd floor.  Yum. Also did Wicked Spoon which is their buffet.  Another best.  Selection is decent enough as the quality of food is of what you'd expect for the quality hotel. 2 of us for brunch and added the unlimited bloody Mary's, mimosas, and champagne $100. 

Valet. 5\/5.  Complimentary and classy service.  Not that I find it necessary, but each attendant is quick and even though I look 20 years old, they still call me Sir and. Mr Shefferd.   And the pick up...even better.  Scan your ticket and wait in enclosed area for quick service.

I had an incident occur on a Sunday evening where my shoe heel got stuck in the escalator causing me to have to launch out of my shoe and resulting in my $800 Louboutin heels to be completely trashed. The hotel offered me a food and beverage credit for what happened. The next morning I received a call where they said they could either offer me the credit, a 15% discount on my next stay or a complimentary upgrade during my next visit. To say I am insulted is an understatement. I think this establishment lacks any true value of their customers and guests. We come to Vegas often and it's safe to say that I will never step foot in the Cosmo ever again and neither will the rest of the party I was with during this visit. 

One of the employees, Moe, a resort manager, is a real piece of work. He essentially looked me dead in my eyes and said its an escalator, shoes get stuck - there's nothing I can do. I've seen hotels go above and beyond for their guests when NOTHING bad happens as part of their experience, however Cosmopolitan is NOT one of those hotels. The embellishment of lies that are conjured up at this place are ridiculous ...maybe that's to be expected in Las Vegas, who knows. This establishment only sees dollar signs and gives ZERO shits about anything else (shocking, I know). They're cheap, rude and insulting to anyone who can't throw money at them. What a disgrace to the establishments who care about their visitors and really go the extra mile to show that they care. Take your money and good time elsewhere - you will be glad you did.  There are so many other hotels that will treat you well, not lie and offer up a truly amazing experience. I am a true believer that any get away should be nothing but a pleasant experience. Yes, things happen, many times out of the control of a person or a business, but the way these negative experiences are handled makes ALL the difference.

Just a few tidbits....
1) The pool is small and super crowded.

You can clearly see the blue light (or green?  I forget) amongst the sea of red lights indicating that a space is open. Plus parking is FREE people ( it is pretty much everywhere on the strip but some people don't know.)  Anyway, card games are much more chill here. On the main floor, you just play against the house. No playing against each other. Just keeps it simple which I like. I wish the servers were a bit quicker with the drinks but they were free so I'm not really upset about it.

Whomever at the hotel was in charge of the conference, didn't do a very good job of doing the double checking that we asked them to do.

Room was beautiful, but very dusty. Great amenities, though could not get either of the flat screens to work. Even the guy who came up couldn't  figure out what was wrong and said he would send up an engineer. I was out for the rest of the day, and the tv never did get fixed. One of my fellow conferencees discovered an old sock that wasn't his when he moved something and others never had their glassware changed out.  Check out was easy, though.

Good restaurants, though very pricey.

I got a totally awesome deal at the hotel because I had a two free night hotel package but then the whole trip ended up being comped... WHAT WHAT?! To this day, I still have no idea how we ended up getting that last night for free but I'm not going to question a great thing.

The hotel decor and interior design were sooooo chic and modern. I won't lie, it's a pretty damn girly hotel but I'm not complaining but the guys might. But whatever, they can stay at the Bellagio next door if they don't like it. But I definitely loved the chandeliers all around the ceilings as well as the purple color scheme... amazing! LOVED IT ALL.

The room itself was so cute too, everything from the layout, to the wallpaper and the L-shaped couch. So perfect. The bathroom was a little too exposed to the rest of the hotel room though. But the blinds covered that problem. Also, I wish the toilet had a separate room or something so that when someone was showering, we could still go in without seeing them. But it's all good. We were all girls anyway!

Oh and the view... we had such a precious view of the Bellagio fountain. GAHHHHH I LOVED IT ALL I SWEAR. There's really not much to complain about except for maybe the TVs not working as well as I had hoped. They lagged but whatever, who needs TV when you're in Vegas?",2,2,2

I stayed here during a very busy weekend--in fact, I believe the Saturday  during my stay was 100% sold out.  Originally, we booked the studio suite for the kitchenette, which is one step up from the regular room.  Coming prepared, my friends and I packed more than 10 tv dinners for us to eat in our room for post-club munchies, snacks, etc.  However, when we checked in, there were no more studio suites available!!  The gentleman checking us in, offered to give us the city room (downgrade) plus $50 resort credit.  But, my friend and I kept insisting that we needed a microwave for all our food.  We tried requesting just a microwave, but they don't have microwaves at request.  The gentleman made a phone call and seconds later, the manager comes out and tells us there's something he can do.  He ended up working his magic and upgraded us to another room and said, ""You will definitely have your microwave.""  

He walked us up to the 14th floor and showed us our ""room""--a freaking two story penthouse!!  The room is absolutely gorgeous!  On the main floor, there is a kitchen with dining area, a full bathroom, 2 flat screen tvs and a living room area.  Just outside the room, there is a private terrace with a jacuzzi and direct access to one of the pools.  Upstairs, there is a king size bed, full bath, and a projection screen tv that can be hidden in the ceiling.  Oh and we can't forget...we had our microwave!  :)

I do have a complaint though--I guess housekeeping didn't clean our room well enough because there was broken glass in our bathroom!  Unfortunately, I ended up stepping in it and cutting my foot and also my finger.  :(  I ended up filing a report...hopefully, that message will be relayed to housekeeping so they know to not rush during cleaning.

We had to wait longer than the couple the showed up next to us. Its sort of like a grocery store check out line (luck of the draw). The Bar staff where great at Vesper and the drink menu is fabulous. When we got to our room we found out they had run out of Terrace rooms and give us a city room instead. When I talked to the front desk I was given the run around. My room was never changed and in place of any fair comp they offered a $25 food credit which was not anywhere near the value I should have received. When I complained again they offered a spa day pass when i called to ask about it the spa didn't even have my info and did not allow me to use it. We were also charged for items we shouldn't have been charged for minibar items and Internet. I also found hairs on the floor in our bathroom that were not mine. The shower wasn't cleaned very well. The minibar snacks where all unorganized. Room service didn't provide new glasses and the towels were wrinkly. The remote was sticky and the TV picture quality sucked. Also the one pen on the desk didn't work and the walls looked dirty. the wallpaper behind the tv was coming off the wall and the bathroom walls had marks. My biggest issue was that we did not receive a room with a balcony, bathtub, frig we could use or a microwave. We were told we would have a room with those amenities so we bought food from the store to eat in place of paying high prices for every meal. Well that was a waste. I was really looking forward to taking a bath as I don't have a bath at home and bought bath products for our stay-also a waste. So more than half my time here was horrible.

OK let me be specific. Outside of The Chandelier, I like the 3rd floor game area. I never would have expected that in an upscale strip hotel. They have a pool table and some board games that you can play. What? That's actually pretty awesome. You know what? If they threw in Settlers of Catan or any other European board game, I'd be crazy impressed and bump up that star rating to a 5. I'm easy like that. Then again, that vintage Monopoly box is pretty cool. It's like Sambalatte without the local charm.

I also love the elevated walkway that you can take between Crystals and here. Now I wish all the hotels offered an elevated walkway between each other. Separate the cars from the people, keep the traffic flowing for both, and keep the pedestrians safe.

We attended your New Years Eve Skating rink only to be totally disappointed and when I contacted your events department via email I received no reply... please see my email below hopefully I can get some kind of reply now...

Your event at the ice rink was EXTREMELY disappointing. For $160.00 a ticket I would have expected that your event be fully thought out ahead of time and set up flawlessly. We were expecting to see and hear the Bruno Mars concert. One it finally came on at 11pm (no one could give us a definite start time) it was only on the screen for not even 10 minutes before the audio feed went out and they were not able to get it back.

Honestly, I think I will be staying here every time I go to Vegas from here on out. That's how much I enjoyed the Cosmo. The rooms are amazing and spacious, they almost all have amazing views and its a really big grandiose hotel.

I'm glad that they've toned down the glittery aspects of the hotel from what it used to be when  it opened, which was gaudy and painful to the eyes. Now its just classy and full of amazing bars, restaurants and people. I really enjoy walking through this hotel and just getting drinks with friends at the Chandelier (a gigantic 3 storey bar under a chandelier).

The parking situation could be better, but I do appreciate the parking sensors that tell you which spots are occupied and which spots are open. I also don't like that you have to take an elevator from the parking garage to the main lobby level and then take the elevators from the lobby level to the rooms.

It looks like the only hotel with balconies. The location is good, in the middle of everything so it's only 30 min walk to the Venetian and maybe 20 to NY-NY. Across the strip though a pedestrian overpass there are a couple of fast food restaurants, a pharmacy but most importantly a slushie place open 24\/7 ;)

The rooms are very nicely and tastefully decorated like a magazine and have all the amenities you're looking for, mattress and bedding are premium, TVs accept bluetooth audio for jammin'. It was my birthday so the nice check-in lady had chocolates delivered to me with a card :) The housekeeping staff were even putting back our toiletries in order on a towel after using them. so nice! 

I'd say the only cons is a lineup at the check-in counter which seems to be the norm in vegas and the glass railings on the deck get dusty because it's the desert.

I'm not a Vegas person. I'm not someone who goes to Vegas every chance I get...every long weekend, holiday break, or celebration is not automatically cause for going to Vegas in my mind. I've had friends who do...and I've participated but its not my thing...This hotel makes me want to re-evaluate that. 

This place is fantastic. And I was not even a hotel guest!!! I didn't stay here but I did just spend 4 days allover this b**** attending a conference.  One long-a** conference.  Spending 12+ hours here for work.  Anyways, my review is of the hotel in general, their event spaces & service, catering, staff and bars\/lounges. 

Just to get this out of the way, the drinks everywhere we went were totally fantastic. Fun, inventive, unique, tasty and strong!!!  This opinion may be partially biased because my drinks were 1.) also largely free (during conference evening ""networking"" receptions and\/or paid for by my work) and 2.) I imagine there is probably some concerted effort to generally keep the business travelers\/conference-goers ""happy"" and liquored up and more likely to hit the hotel's bars, dining spots, and casinos after the daily conference events are over, where they'll probably spend more money since they can ""expense"" some of their costs. Anyways, mucho kudos for the stiff drinks and the fun mixes. (Check out the ""adult vitamins"" at Holstein's!) 

As everyone has noted, the ambiance and decor are amazing. Its a good-looking hotel. Lots of beautiful glass and shiny metal work. Very pretty and modern. But also not too cold. Just the right amount of plushness and dark leather to feel some warmth.  Very with the times, electronic displays for hotel directories and info. Lots of chandeliers. Check out ""The Chandelier"", which apparently is the world's largest chandelier....something like 3.5 stories tall!   The pretty light fixtures in the conference rooms make a nice distraction when you're bored during an afternoon workshop.

Service was decent in the hotel in general. The staff in the lobby, casino floor, valet, taxi stand, general ""public"" areas of the hotel were always friendly, attentive and seemed to make their best effort towards helping you out. 

The catering\/event staff still met the friendliness\/sincerity mark but unfortunately they seem to have a lot of kinks in their processes that need to be worked out. That has nothing to do with their politeness & what-not but the wait staff\/catering crews seemed a bit uncoordinated and less than methodical in their set-up & workflow coordination.  Whoever is coordinating or attempting to manage the crew and oversee the set-up\/layout for some of the receptions and luncheons needs to rethink some of their strategies and layouts.

The food from the catering crew was definitely way better than their service\/strategy.  I had no complaints about the event food and neither did any other fellow conference go-ers. Everyone seemed to love the food!  Lunch had a great variety of vegetarian and carnivore options. Fresh salads. Attempts at innovative combinations. Their versions of snack breaks were really cute!  They included some different items for workshops breaks that I haven't seen at a conference\/hotel venue before. Different, interesting & more fun than normal. I love getting cookies and coffee at conferences but the Cosmo did it even better...caramel popcorn, candy bar assortments, handmade potato chips, clif bars, red bull & sodas!  It was a welcome surprise! 

Pros: Decor, catering food, strong\/creative alcoholic beverages, friendly service, people-watching, location, style, for now I hear they are loose and fast with free room upgrades on weekdays. 

Cons: Catering staff\/crew has some kinks to work out in their system, crowded in the evenings, can get a bit crowded in the evenings.

As with all banks being run by incompetent idiots who are materialistic so are the operations of The Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino of Las Vegas.

The bars\/lounges are SUPER cheesy, Chandelier is obnoxious along with Bond and Vesper bars being a typical hotel lobby bar. I think their main target clientele are gold diggers and the wannabe princesses.

The customer service SUCKS ass. I've been told to wait in an imaginary line by myself while a worker at the counter just stands against the wall when I try to sign up for a rewards playing card aka. Identity card. The bonus $10 free play feature only works on 20% of the slot machines because they are cheapskates.

One of the ticket machine ate my remaining change when I tried to redeem it. I flagged down a girl that worked the casino floor and told her what happened. It seemed that she couldn't be bothered with dealing with other people's money. The girl gave shitty attitude and constantly rolled her eyes along with hiding her smirks. With Vegas being a shitty city due to a bad economy, I'm surprised the German Deutsches would hire such a skanky bimbo who feels as if she's all high and mighty. So this brunette bimbo with the attitude could NOT resolve anything had to get her supervisor. The supervisor was cool he didn't even sweat the bimbo's pettiness. Also he was very knowledgeable and just mouthed off instructions to her on how to resolve the issue.

The ONLY saving grace at Deutsche Cosmo Hotel was the buffet Wicked Spoon none else.

+1 star: Wicked Spoon
+1 star: Good for eye candy with TONS of skanky faux prostitutes walking the floor at night.

This place is modern, upscale, gorgeous, and very chic. Usually when I go on vacation, the last place I want to stay in is the room\/hotel but this place is the exact opposite. 

The lounge itself has beautiful chandeliers even the front desk is setup similar to a lounge. Everyone is dressed to impress. The service is top notch. 

I would say for the most part, people keep it classy here but it is Vegas. On my arrival, I saw a man being wheeled in on a wheelchair because he was that drunk. In the elevator, I do remember a couple trying to hid...well not so much hid, but they lost their hotel key and didn't have anywhere else to go and a random stranger thanked me for getting on the elevator because as he said...""it was getting a bit awkward.""

Marquee: The Cosmo's club\/lounge is called the Marquee and it was a blast. The entrance was a bit weird. You have to come down on an elevator and the host greets you like you are in an amusement park...telling you how big it is, how exclusive, and to ""prepare for the experience.""

I forget the name of the buffet but it was excellent as well. Vegas is known for their buffets and I would definitely eat here again.

If you want to enjoy the day party, I would definitely make reservations at least a day in advance.

There is so much to say about Vegas...I could write a novel, but I won't. I would say if you can afford it, the Cosmo is a great place to stay. Especially with the location! It is right between the Bellagio and Aria\/City Center and across the street from Planet Hollywood and Paris.",1,2,2

1) Between my friend and myself, we have 17 charges on our credit cards from the Cosmo for a 3 day stay. I put down my credit card to check in - had an incidental hold (room price + $150 a day) AND have an $800 CHARGE for them for god knows what that I am STILL dealing with (then contend it is a hold despite the fact that it is literally ON MY CREDIT CARD BILL).  Then, according to our bill we called room service maybe 6x and somehow have 10 charges for that.  Then the exact same $800 charge I have on my friend's credit card.  My favorite part to all of this is that they keep telling us different information - this is a hold, this is a charge, I don't even know.  I'm pretty sure we're going to end up paying $3k for our $870 weekend hotel room.  I think at this point we've more then proven our ability to pay for this hotel room, so slow it down with the charges?  I've stayed at other hotels in Vegas before and had 1 incidental hold and 1 charge at the end - room service + resort fee + bill.  Not complex, Cosmo. Do better.

2) Our room, quite honestly, wasn't all that mind-blowing.  The beds were comfortable, the bathroom nice, and the view gorgeous but we did not have much space and I wouldn't say it was any better then a $200 cheaper room at Monte Carlo.  The floors in our room and the hallway were stained and dirty.  

3) Some of the staff were amazing, but some were outright RUDE to us.  We had a room service representative on the phone tell us to shut up and talk slower - I get that it's a challenge managing drunk people but this was at 8am and we were sober.

4) We didn't get housekeeping one day, so we cleaned our room ourselves (it wasn't like we trashed the room - we're extremely neat and clean people).  We had room service delivered that night, and he obviously alerted housekeeping to this because they showed up to clean...at 9pm.  Great.  Thanks for nothing.

5) All the Cosmo had to offer us for our negative experiences was a complimentary one tier upgrade (which, I know how this goes, they NEVER have an upgrade available with 2 queens - only a king) and an $80 room service credit.

That said, there was nothing ""WOW' about this hotel enough to deal with the pain and struggle afterwards - everything happening with our credit cards right now is SHADY, not to mention customer service is not this hotel's forte.  If you're looking for an actual luxury experience on the strip, pick the Wynn.",2,1,0

The next morning I woke up, opened  the blinds to go outside onto the balcony, and at the base of the sliding door I see a bloody and used condom!

Only a couple complaints. Our first two nights were the hardest, AC would not cool down the entire room. Very large very nice room but the bed room area was hot every night and was sweating.  Finally after three visits by two different AC techs nothing changed but them bringing us a fan to blow directly on us. LOL no offer of changing rooms etc.  we do have a balcony room and we keep blinds always pulled. That really shouldn't be an excuse but idk they mentioned it. 

Now on fifth night no one has ever called to check if all our issues have been addressed etc or doing good.  $$$ 300 a night place with no AC working properly and a fan. Unreal

Next. Room has a pre stocked frig with everything u can think of inside.  We wanted our own stuff in there and requested to remove those items due to not wanted. $25 fee to empty frig for your items.  Or $25 will get u a second ice box for your stuff. Either way. $25 

Next. Went to grocery store for few late night snacks lunch type snacks.  Two cases of water.  Unload taxi and Bellman asks to help and I accepted and then told $25 charge to help get that to the room since not luggage. 

Also could use more exhaust for smoking. Wish Vegas had smoke free hotel n casinos. 

I really loved this hotel upon walking into the door but over time several small things are killing this experience. Might try it again in future.

Anyways... WOW! 

We drove up to valet (of course) because ... it's Vegas and I don't see why I should have to park my own car. LOL! 

The valet area is 5 stars (at least). GORGEOUS! The light fixtures, colors and special concrete that looked like you were driving on granite were FABULOUS. And this is just the valet area. It's a fairly small area with a couple tight turns so don't go zooming into here or you might collide with a column light fixture or a cabbie. Take your time... enjoy the ambiance. (Yes, I know it's just valet but still... take it in..EXPERIENCE it.) 

The lobby area is gorgeous and the lobby bar is nothing like any of the other lobby bars I've seen at other hotels. This looks like something out of a movie.... it looks like a ultra lounge... but it's the lobby bar. 

Ok... so moving through the casino floor and the upper levels... everything is GLITZY and GLAM. Totally over the top. I know... it sounds ostentatious and ridiculous... and it should be... but it's NOT. It totally works. I love that everything sparkles, glitters and feels alive. Of course, I wonder in a year from now, how this will look as I'm sure maintaining the shiny surfaces is going to be a bear. 

Love the HEELS in the banquet area and the DOGS and the JEDI council chairs and ... the POOL TABLES and the FOOZE ball table in the restaurant area... I mean... it's fun in a really upscale manner. 

The pool area (while it was only 50 degrees we checked it out anyways)... looks like it is going to be the place to hang when the temps start to rise. What a set up! It's not just one big pool area... they split what limited space they have up into sections and it flows very nicely. Overall it is very small so I'm not sure how they are going to manage the crowds. The pools are edgeless and have loungers in the water. Plus there's a covered area with 9 big screen TVs and a separate bar to just hang out. The cool part is that it's on the 4th level and you can see LVB below.

Ate at STK last night and it was just awesome. The wague sliders with foi are off the hook. Same for the mashed potatoes, and the potstickers. We tried a bunch of items, but these were worth writing home about.

I wish they had a convenience store in the lobby. Somewhere to buy cheep snacks, and a 6 pack of beer. I miss that. Also, not great shopping.

The chandelier bar is very awesome. Try the verbena. It come with a flower that you eat, and it makes your mouth numb. Fun party trick!",3,4,3

ENTERTAINMENT: You need to experience ""Rose. Rabbit. Lie."" and all their different rooms. It's hard to explain the uniqueness but it's basically a ""modern supper club serving reinvented American classics alongside live music and entertaining performances."" But if you're in a clubbing mood, you're in luck because they have Marquee night\/day club, which is one of my favorite clubs on the strip since they feature the best artists.  

FOOD: Cosmo features an array of unique cuisines to satisfy all your tastes. Some of their restaurants include: Blue Ribbon (American), China Poblano (Chinese & Mexican), D.O.C.G. (Italian), E by Jose Andres (Spanish), Eggslut (all-day American breakfast), Momofuku, STK (steakhouse), and many more. I've only tried Eggslut (highly recommend the Gaucho Sandwich and the Slut) and Momofuku (highly recommend the shiitake & pork belly buns, oysters, scallop poke, king crab cold noodle, and pork ramen). 

DECOR: This is the only hotel on the strip that is super artsy and different. From the graffiti art in the parking garage to the pool on the top floor, you will find hundreds of unique artwork and architecture.

OVERALL: Book your next hotel stay at the Cosmopolitan, you won't regret it.",7,1,6

It also had a kitchenette with a microwave and a mini fridge\/freezer.  The freezer came in handy for the fifth of vodka we bought.  It was money worth spent!  Since we stayed during the week it was a bit cheaper and I was able to take advantage of the stay 2 nights, get 15% off deal.

Our terrace overlooked the Bellagio water show, which was pretty cool being that I've been to Vegas several times, but never saw the show until we stayed in our room.  Loved having a terrace, especially since the weather was perfect.  The room wasn't spotless, but it wasn't terribly dirty either.  The ottoman on the patio had some burn marks on it from when people smoke their cigs out there, and the ashtray had not been emptied - so that was kinda gross.  The bathroom was huge with 2 sinks, a separate bathtub, and a huge shower.  The couch in the living room - well, let's just say I didn't really want to sit on it as it looked like it had been previously used for other people's enjoyment.  But it's all good, we didn't really spend a lot of time in the living area anyway and was only in the room getting ready to go out and sleep. 

The decor of the hotel is definitely glitz and glamour with several restaurants, shopping, and small convenience stores.  Close to lots of casinos, Planet Hollywood, CVS, and Walgreens.  I especially liked not having to walk a million miles to get to the lobby or taxi stand from our room.

I love that this hotel does not have a theme.  Just super chic with great art.  I wish we could have gone to the Chandelier bar but we were ""busy"" napping and laying by the pool.

Our room was gorgeous, had a view of the fountains, Paris balloon and Eiffel tower.  And they were able to accommodate us by giving us 2 adjoining rooms.  Only downsides were value for money (but probably good bc it may be deterring the trashiest) and the fact that we were in a wheelchair accessible room with no lip on the shower which made for some flooding.  Nothing that couldn't be fixed with a few towels.

We got one add'l day @ $350.  This was for my husband's 30th and I wanted everything to be perfect.

I had many email conversations with Kendall in the VIP dept, who was super helpful.  At one point, the Cosmo double-charged my card, and she was able to get everything straightened out, although it took about 2 weeks.  I asked her about cabana reservations too late, and we couldn't get one at the Blvd pool for $750, so I settled for one at the Bamboo pool for $1K.  The day before we got there, I got a call from Shelly confirming my reservation, who was also very helpful.  She informed me we would have a direct VIP contact when we checked in that could help with whatever we needed during our stay, but that her & Kendall would also be available if anything went wrong.  I told her my friend would be checking in early and setting up our room.  Shelly said everything would be ready by 10 so my friend could arrive any time after that and everything would be fine.  She suggested that the Steamer Trunk be delivered before we checked in for the ""wow"" factor.  I went with it.

Then we arrive in Las Vegas...

I call my friend to see how the room is.  She arrived at 12 &still had not been let into the room by 2:30.  The VIP concierge kept saying the room wasn't ready, and then ended up giving us a room that was not our room.  It was several floors higher &barely had a view of the concert.  The Steamer Trunk was not delivered before we arrived.  Not only were we pissed about having to wait for the room, we also did not have any booze to drink.

I called my so-called go-to people, Kendall and Shelly, and neither answered, nor did I ever get a call back.  I ended up speaking with David, who understood why'd I would be so pissed off, and promised me the trunk would be send ""right up.""  Haha, ""right up,""  you don't know how many times I heard those words this weekend?  He informed me that the concert tickets, which I had expected to be in the room, would be available at will call the night of the concert and told me he could be my direct contact during my stay.  About AN HOUR AND A HALF, the Steamer Trunk was delivered, minus a bottle of champagne.  I guess they thought we weren't celebrating?!?

Later that evening, I get a call confirming my reservation at the Bvd pool and the woman informed me that the pool would be drained because of the concert.  #1) my reservation was at the Bamboo pool.  #2) why are they selling cabanas at a pool with no water?

Sat. morning, I call the front desk because we have a cabana reservation @ 9 but the pool opens @ 8.  They inform me that the 9 time was incorrect, and that the pools now open @ 8.  I get down there right at 8 to make sure we get the cabana and a few chairs near the pool.  The guy, who must have been LOADED, just kind of stood there when I told him we had a cabana reservation, like he couldn't understand what I was saying.  Then another guy at the stand tells me I can come back in 15 minutes & he'll let me know which cabana is ours.  I come back in 15 minutes, then in 25, 35, 45, 55...  Finally @ 9:15 they let me have my cabana and tell me a waitress would be ""right out.""  @ 10:30 the waitress comes by.  We had about 6 different waiters\/waitresses the 6 or so hours we were at the pool.  Nobody knew how to turn the fan on, the TV didn't work, and it took on average 45 minutes for your drinks to arrive & an hour 15 minutes for food to come.

We leave the Cosmo for dinner\/drinks and I call and request housekeeping to come up and clean the room.  We were gone for about 4 hours and when we came back, lo & behold the room was exactly as we left it.

We were running a little bit late so we started watching some of the concert from our room, even though it was too high up to see anything.  During a song we weren't huge fans of, we head down to the concert on fl. 4.  Only you can't get off on fl. 4!  Did I mention I spent $4,000 to have this room because of the concert?  We never found will call because we couldn't even get to the floor to get to will call.  We went back up to the room and finished watching the show completely angry by this point because of the waste of money.

Sunday morning most of our party left and my hubby and I wanted some alone time.  We left the room @ 10 and put the ""Please Clean"" sign on the door.  We got back to the room @ 2 and the room hadn't been clean.  By this point it was almost comical.  We left the sign up and started taking showers.  Housekeeping ended up coming @ 5:30, while I was in the shower, so they wouldn't even clean.

Needless to say, I will NEVER stay at the Cosmo ever again.  Worst service EVER!  Even if you get a VIP package, do not expect any type of service.  I've stayed at 2 star resorts with better service!",3,1,0

This new, hip, hotel had so much buzz around it, that i was really excited to go see what all the excitement was about. While visually, there is a lot to see, i was really kind of disappointed overall. The hotel felt almost claustrophobic with all the different designs and decorations going on...maybe it was due to the lower ceilings (I'm more used to the open high ceilings of Aria etc..), or the fact that it was crowded in general, but something about it made me feel uncomfortable.

My friend and i decided to gamble for a bit before we left so despite the initial awkward impression, we decided to stay for a bit. Now, this isn't really the hotel's fault but i have to say, i have never encountered so many douche bags in my life, than at the casino here. The crowd in general were just downright rude and obnoxious. I literally had some greasy sleazy man physically shove me hard out of the way just so he can get a spot at an overly crowded roulette table. This was of course after asking me if i was waiting to play, and i had said yes. True, he didn't beat me down or anything crazy violent like that, but have some class. 

Also, to the ladies there, i feel your pain wearing 5"" heels all night, but if you're just going to end up walking around barefoot all night in the casino with your mascara and glitter eyeshadow running down your face, have a better game plan and invest in some dr. scholls ballet slippers. When the crowded hip new casino is filled with about 75% of the ladies doing this, it kinda makes the whole hotel look gross.",5,4,1

There was a lot of fanfare but I thought the grandeur of it fell rather flat. Condos were still available for sale and a lot of the shopping center space was vacant. The cosmopolitan hotel definitely is upscale and modern but I can see that the modern theme can get boring in the long run.

I've seen some aggressive marketing for the hotel in recent years as they sell their image of being ecletic, avant garde, or just plain weird. The hotel is definitely a hot spot especially since they have marquee. Marquee is both a dayclub and nightclub and it is always packed. They are very strict on the swimwear policy; don't try to pass of your board shorts and swim trunks. 

The rooms of the cosmopolitan are rather smaller than the other hotel on the strip. My guess is that's why they installed a japanese soaking tub to make up for it. I'd like to say it's like an exotic version of a hot tub but to me it's simply a small tub with raised walls. There are no jet streams or anything like that. It is literally a soaking tub. 

Another highlight of the hotel is their buffet-- wicked spoon. It is actually not too bad; I prefer the one the bacchanal at caesar's.

Also, go check out the second floor as there are many picture taking opportunity for the girls. 

If you never used the hotelapp before, you can get $25 off your stay here if rooms are available. Code = mrhee3.

All in all, a nice place to stay but a bit pricier than the other hotels on the strip.",1,2,2

If I have to be in this god forsaken city, then I need to be in a cool spot or else I am going to lose my mind. The Cosmo repeatedly came up in discussions with friends, coworkers, family, and from what you hear from those who loooove Vegas. Ok, so we booked our rooms - 2 rooms for 4 people. When we arrived at the Cosmo, I have to say I was impressed. (Note that this is huge that I was impressed considering that very little impresses me and I was in Vegas.) The lobby is very nice, trendy, and chic. Whoever did the interior design for this whole hotel did a fab job. The guy who checked us into the hotel was so nice...so nice that he upgraded me and my friends room to a Terrace room facing the strip.

Been to the Cosmopolitan for a night at Marquee a couple of times but this was my first time staying in the hotel. I really like the look & decor of the Cosmo. I don't know how to describe it except that it can fit right in South Beach with its styling and feel... Is 'modern-grand' a term?? It's a damn pretty hotel. From the artwork scattered around the hotel, the shops, the casino itself, the random sitting areas, the pool table anyone can use upstairs, the pools, the vending machines that dispense little 'tile or block' works of art... down to the people that choose to gamble and party here. It's definitely a good look.

And let's face it... Marquee is the spot to party at in Vegas these days. Wow... Great times there. I have no complaints at all. But i can't go into too much detail either... HA!

The room was nice. We had a clear view of the Bellagio water fountain from our windows. The beds were comf, the pillows were plump, the amenities very well thought out and some just seemed random. For ex: colored pencils on the desk. I did like the many electrical outlets on the desk itself. Vegas hotels seem to hide electrical outlets or seem to furnish their rooms with the bare minimum. The bathroom was nice. Dark woods, black marble & chrome. Two sinks, nice robes & towels provided, separate toilet area for privacy to handle bidness, awesome water pressure from the overhead rain shower... See through stand-up shower must be made for some Vegas deviousness. You gotta see it... Had to take a pic of it. I wasn't mad at that.

Lobby area near check-in was very dramatic with the ever changing display panels that line the columns. I really liked that... A modern but artistic touch.

Cant forget to to talk about the valet... Despite being a busy hotel, the amount of time waiting for our car to be retrieved was not bad at all. Cushy seating while you wait... Take the escalator down at the back entrance so it's away from the chaos that is the taxi drop off & pick up area.

Despite my boyfriend and I visiting Vegas almost monthly (it's actually quite embarrassing), I'm loyal to Cosmo and brought my friends and family here as well. This beautiful luxurious hotel offers everything people dream about in Vegas. From the chic elegant décor, incredible artwork all over the grounds, to the mouth watering food. There's tons of chandeliers and technology inspired decorations giving this hotel a very young trendy vibe.

Location: This is in the heart of the strip on the South end. Prime location to walk around and check out all that Vegas has to offer.

Room: I often stay in the Studio Terrace Suite which is spacious to say the least! The beds are top notch, showers\/baths are huge, and the style keeps up with the rest of the hotel staying modern and classy in every way possible. The bed and pillows were not only amazing, but way more comfortable than my bed at home which says a lot! For an extra charge you can have a room facing the Bellagio fountains but the few times I've upgraded I felt the music was nearly impossible to hear and I often missed the shows so I don't think the upgrade is really worth it. Besides, it's much better to get out of your room and watch the show up close. My main tip? Make sure to ask for a balcony... you won't be disappointed. 

Food: I think many locals can agree that Vegas has some of the best food the world has to offer. Cosmo has some great options too! It's pretty crucial to try at least one buffet while in Vegas, and the Wicked Spoon offers practically everything your heart could desire. My other favorite buffet would be the Bacchanal Buffet in Caesars palace. If you're looking for a quick casual bite make sure to ask about the top secret pizza stop located behind a hallway with no signs. It tastes delicious! Jaleo and Scarpetta are on the pricier side but the food is excellent quality worth every penny. For a good lunch I'd highly recommend the burgers and shakes at Holsteins that come with free popcorn.

Activities: For all you gamblers, the casino is small and intimate, but still large enough to have all the best slot machines and card games. There is no poker room. For all you clubbers, I'm sure you already know that Marquee Nightclub and Dayclub is one of the hottest clubs in Vegas. The pool parties are insane offering some of the best DJ's and bands, and the nightclub offers multiple stages allowing you to dance to edm while your friends dance to hip-hop at the same time! The venue is alluring and the lights are amazing. This is easily a club that you'll want to come back to again and again. For everyone looking for some peace and quiet, don't worry, there are multiple pools and jacuzzi's at this hotel so there is something for everyone.

Employees: Every staff member has always been so accommodating and truly does everything to go out of their way to make you happy. From making reservations to helping find activities, I've always been greeted with a smile and had staff members go above and beyond to help provide me with an excellent stay.

Cons: Rooms are extremely expensive, by hey, that's what happens when you're staying at one of the best hotels on the strip. I'd recommend checking online for discounts or joining the hotels loyalty program that offers lots of perks. The only other problem I faced at this hotel was when I saw Jason Mraz recently at the Chelsea venue. The venue itself is large with a great quality sound system, but I was seated on the balcony and the bar was extremely noisy throughout the entire show. Everyone around me was so distracted from the noise that it took away from Mraz's mesmerizing voice. I've been to other concerts at this venue and can only say positive things, but because Jason Mraz is known for playing a lot of soft songs, I was surprised that the noise was not taken care of.

Overall, can't wait to visit again soon! If I could give the Cosmopolitan 6 stars I would do it in a heartbeat.",2,2,2

my friend's vegas host was able to get us deals not only for tables but here as well

booked a terrace wrap around suite and the connecting terrace suite (the peekaboo bathroom into the bedroom is sexy!).. 
in addition to 3 roll aways it comfortably slept my group of 10

when we got there, our host told us to go through the vip doors to check in.. my friend said ""we need to go through here and get away from these common peasants"" haha
the vip check in experience was amazing, they offered us alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks, treats such as macarons, chocolate covered strawberries, chocolates, etc. the sweet tooth in me devoured as many as i could before we left.

I was in the line for 45 minutes, yet someone who just arrived got in front real quick on the side. Then on top of that I had to wait about 5 hours for my room. So I was a bit annoyed.  They held our bags as we roamed around sin city exhausted as heck! 

I stayed in their Wrap around terrace suite with fountain views. First thing, the wrap around terrace was not wrap around, it had a wall in the middle due to an elevator issue. So that was a bit misleading. Second, the kitchen has nothing. I mean NOTHING. No plates, no silverware, no napkins, not even a towel, nothing....  They had an ice bucket and 4 cups. Not even a garbage bin. So its almost impossible to use the kitchen. Which makes having a kitchen pretty much somewhat USELESS. Who is going to travel with plates and utensils and napkins and anything remotely for a kitchen? It should be a little stocked, This is pretty dumb! This was a full fledged kitchen and it had nothing!!! I needed a napkin so bad, I had to use tissue paper. Really ridiculous. 

We had guest visit us for a few hours who were also in Vegas for the i heart concert, they went to the wrong room by mistake and when they knocked the door the guy answered completely naked with his PECKER in the wind.... my friends made like a bread truck and hauled buns. OY! I mean I know its VEGAS but who needs to see a nasty old sausage in the wind. Gross - this is an upscale hotel that's kind of disgusting and scary. 

OK lets get back to the room- WOW it's really pretty, I won't lie its outrageously nice. It's like a condo and the view of the fountains, wow... That view is worth every penny. 

Bathroom, hands down best shower ever- the toiletries were not the best, could be better, But all in all this room was fantastic, just come on Cosmo stock up the kitchen a bit, at least a roll of BOUNTY!  Heck a kitchen towel - PLEASE a kitchen towel!!!  

Would I stay again? Yes, but I will take bounty with me for sure.",0,2,0

The experience was magical.  I had a one bedroom suite overlooking the Bellagio Water Fountains, but truthfully, the fountain was fun for the first day, so I would also be okay with staying at the other side of the building next time.  

I don't know what Vegas offers today, but when I visited, I noticed many things that set the Cosmopolitan apart!  Number one is ease of finding a parking space (TOP NOTCH).  There is truly no need for valet parking here.  The resort is equipped with a user friendly parking garage that shows us where the free spots are by using green light for available and red for unavailable and also letting us know how many spots in an area are empty!

Number 2 has got to be the bathroom... can I curse??? It was an effing experience!!!  I felt the bathroom in a one bedroom suite was the highlight and it would be number 1 but since I have never seen this kind of parking, I had to give it to the parking. 

Anyway, I am not going to write too much.  I know Vegas has plenty of reasonably priced properties, but it would not be an EXPERIENCE without the Cosmopolitan. 

I crave it like my favorite food!!!

It (in my opinion) is certainly the best - anywhere!!!",1,1,1

Pros:
-Room is pretty nice. Bathrooms are nice. You must get a room with terrace view. I believe this is the only hotel that offers them. However not all rooms have a terrace view, so make sure because we saw a room without the terrace and that room definitely is not nearly as nice. 
-Mostly a younger good looking crowd. 
-Staff seemed pretty friendly and quick to help. I will say, it must be because the hotel is new that a lot of the staff didn't really know the answers to our questions. It didn't really bother me though because they weren't uptight and strict about everything. 
-The bamboo pool was pretty chill and the staff again were chill. 
-Everything seems to be pretty new which is a plus. 
-Wicked Spoon buffet was pretty good. I liked the mac and cheese. We even asked them if they had some without ham and they whipped up a batch for us. 

Cons:
-Sketchy internet!!! I am deducting one star because of this. Sometimes the wifi wasn't working and it wasn't just my laptop. It was other people's too. Also the speed wasn't that fast. Cosmopolitan, seriously you need to step up your wifi game. Encore's is blistering fast. And because I need to go online to do so many things this actually is the only thing preventing me from coming back to stay here. If you fixed your internet I would be back in a heartbeat. But unfortunately now I will probably check out other hotels or just go back to Encore.
-Marquee pool, nice, but unless you plop down for a reservation for a seat you pretty much have to stand around. They do have 2 other pools that you should be able to get a chair for though if you go early enough in the day. Also at the Marquee hour, I don't really need to hear peak hour tracks during the middle of the day. I personally would rather hear something chill. But that's just my own personal taste.",4,0,2

My friend tipped the receptionist to get a terrace room on the 50th floor, and even though it was South-facing, we had an amazing time having crazy Vegas fun and just enjoying the scenic view.

The casino just has everything you'd need to enjoy Las Vegas to the max. It also attracts the finest crowd that comes to Las Vegas. The ventilation system is very effective and you don't smell the cigarette smoke in the lobby as much as you would in other casinos.",4,1,1

The decor, the food, the atmosphere, the people, the clubs and nightlife, just everything was amazing.

I really really REALLY wished i stayed here during my trip, but unfortunately it was pretty pricey for some odd reason for off season.

The wicked spoon buffet is pretty much anyone's heaven of unlimited amazingly delicious variety of just about anything you could possibly eat.

I also got a room where some of the light switches were broken and the scale in the bathroom didn't work...

Unfortunately, I am really not sure why.  The place, while upscale is definitely geared towards girls.  Despite being fairly new, there are stains all over the rugs.  The rooms are pretty basic.  No bath\/jet tub. Shower only, which was terrible because the shower would never become the right temperature.  It was either scalding or too cold the entire time.  You are better off staying at the Vdara and walking over here for the clubs.  The bouncers are total d-bags at Marquee by the way, but the Dayclub is fun at least.  For nightclub, I think I'll be sticking to Omnia if given the choice.  Crowd at Cosmo is very New York\/New Jersey-ish.  Just my two cents, but I prefer the other hotels in town.  However, the location is very central.  Just stick to the Cosmopolitan side of the strip if going south on the Strip if you want to avoid the ghetto crowd.",0,1,0

We're a married couple in our 30s and have pretty limited interest in being in a huge party hotel. In reality, we needn't have worried. While there were plenty of young beautiful around and the entrance to the Marquee club attracts most of them, the rest of the hotel and casino had a pretty typical Vegas crowd. 

Check in was super quick (3pm on a Wednesday). We were given the wrong key and didn't discover it until we made it all the way to our room, but when we got back to the front desk they were apologetic and fixed it quickly. Eh, mistakes happen. 

We were in a studio terrace with a fountain view. I always request the highest floor possible, but the highest available was in the 21st floor in the east side tower. When a hotel has 75 floors you feel like 21 is pretty low, but honestly the view was still spectacular. Treasure Island to the fountains and everything in between. 

The room was great. Spacious living area, king size (super comfy) bed, two flat screen TVs and a beautiful huge bathroom. The bathroom had a wide jetted tub and there was a separate shower that was almost preposterously large. Very clean with nice fixtures. 

A few weird things:
Everyone talks about the wet bar, and they should, because it's weird. There's a dishwasher but no dishes. There are cupboards for the dishes you don't have, but there's no dresser for the clothes you do have. At the end of the day, you just marvel and the silliness of it and put your clothes on the few shelves in the closet. 

The other thing that made me nuts was the lighting system. It's all or nothing. Say you get up before your partner and want to take a shower and get dressed. Sorry buddy, no nightstand light that I can turn on individually. Instead, every light in the place has to be turned on (and there are a lot of lights) and then you have to walk around and manually turn them all off except the one you want. 

One of the best features of this hotel is the balcony. We loved coming back after an evening out and relaxing out there watching the craziness of the strip below. Add to it the view of the fountains and you've got a real winner. 

The casino was nice, great decor, didn't feel too crowded, even on Saturday. We played blackjack for a few hours and the dealers were really funny, playful and knowledgable.

It was a great room on the 62nd floor but the stench of smoke was a bit of a bother.  I had a great view of Trump tower and decided to walk over and check it out. The two hotels couldn't be more different. 

Don't get me wrong, both hotels are luxurious and stunningly adorned - there's not much to gripe about at all. The service  is amazing: they do everything that they can to make you feel important and welcomed. 

So it really comes down to the experience that you are after. Here is the deal:  

if you want to come to Vegas, get wild, gamble until you drop and then party in the room, stay at the Cosmo. The party rolls 24\/7 downstairs.

It does not really cater to degenerate gamblers like myself.  It serves mostly people who come here for other reasons and then may spend some time on the machines.  Lack of attendants and infrequent cocktail waitress visits, make for a frustrating time on the floor.  There is also a lack of variety in the table games.  But it is fairly clean.",2,1,1

Wow wow wow....I have stayed in almost every hotel on the strip (except NY NY and Wynn and Tropicana)...you cannot put a price on that terrace...and to be there on the 4th and watch the fireworks off the terrace.

Room was awesome...check in was quick (went over at 7am and they pre-checked us in and we were in our rooms with bags from bellman by 10:30 am).  

Love the casino and the lounges and the slots and the drinks...best floor drinks on the strip.

Every employee we ran into was top-notch from front desk to bellman to floor waitstaff to the dealers to the slot attendants to housekeeping who upon request brought more hangers within 15 minutes of the request.

Plenty of storage (as there is a mini kitchen that makes for good storage for clothes).  No bad charges from the mini-bar...never went near it.  

Holstiens food was yum yum yummy...had it twice.

Did I hear the club...yeah a little but only around 4am when the rest of the strip was quiet and I would get up to use the restroom and I would fall back asleep within 15 minutes.  My husband NEVER heard it and he rarely sleeps well in a hotel and slept like a baby all three nights.  

The bedding and towels are awesome.  Honestly I don't have anything bad to say.

IF I rated the four hotels we stayed at Cosmo is number one, Aria a close second, Caesar's third but the bathroom was amazing, and PH (well its PH...it was free).  We also stayed at Caesar's free and paid 79 a night for Aria and all total for Cosmo just under $500 with taxes and fees for Friday, Saturday, Sunday over the July 4th weekend....not bad.

One negative is that it is a happening hip place and loaded with the young crowd (we are early 40's) so that can be a little overwhelming, but hey more power to them.  Also there was a murder in front of the casino and CSI was there all day blocking most of the entrances on Sunday (I think it was Sunday...too many martinis...big blur of fun).",2,0,1

It was my first time in Vegas when I stayed at this hotel. We had two queen beds for four girls. It was nice! Our view was amazing, I was speechless! The bed was really comfortable. The bathroom was nice, no tub though. I do wish this hotel has a tub just so I can soak my feet in after a night of dancing in my high heels. But it's okay, no big deal.

I love how Marquee night and day club is in Cosmo. I went to Marquee for two nights (Friday and Saturday) and Marquee day club on Sunday. It was good to not have to walk out of the hotel to get somewhere. 

My guy friends stayed at Vdara and we were all going to see Kaskade on Saturday night so they came to Marquee to get stamped at 9pm and came up to our hotel room so we can pregame until 10:30PM! It was very convenient especially for guys! I highly recommend guys going early on a busy night to get stamped so they can get in easier later. 

Also, on Friday night, I got lost from my group so I decided to leave the club by myself. It was no big deal because all I had to do was take the elevator back to my room! This hotel is super convenient if you plan to go to Marquee! Highly recommended.

To make a long story short, I just had a phone call with Chance the Front Desk Manager who told me that maintenance and all hotel employees are allowed to enter my room unless I have a do not disturb sign on the front door. I stayed at the Cosmopolitan from 4\/15-4\/17 for a conference. Chance assured me upon arriving that my experience would be better than last time when someone at the front desk accused me of charging thousands of dollars to my room when I did not and led to the company not booking me again due to the way the Cosmopolitan handled the situation. I was apprehensive about visiting again, however was initially put at ease by Chance. Half an hour into my stay Chance asked when maintenance could come by, I told him tomorrow morning, and 2 maintenance guys walked into my room without so much as knocking. I could have been naked and moving forward didn't feel safe. When I called Chance he told me to put the do not disturb sign on my door.

Great location, easy access to both the Strip and cabs, and best of all, an art-driven ""cosmopolitan"" decor that goes beyond ultra-chic to a new generation of hip and fancy that will certainly be a mainstay. 

I've been coming here since 2009 and it has been the only hotel I stay at. They seem to always be adding new cool things to the hotel and rooms, the most recent of which seems to be choreographed cirque-de-soleil style dancers on swings and platform displays near the front bar and gambling area. Art is everywhere. Good music is everywhere. And the incredibly beautiful Chandelier Room bar anchors everything in a timeless way.

Decided to gamble a bit at Cosmo and we got comped at Cosmo! It was def a dream come true. We got the nice East Tower suite, with the Bellagio water fountain view. GORGEOUS hotel, the best we stayed in. Everything was clean and well decorated. There was a balcony with soft couch seats, so at night sitting there overlooking the strip and watching the bellagio water fountain was just breathtaking. When we first walked in the TVs turned on to football and omg... words really can't explain how surprised we were to see the comped room we got. Plenty of room for the 3 of us, so we took advantage of everything they offered to us. 

We went to the pool and ordered some beers on our hotel, we found out when we checked out the next day that our fees were waived! THANKS COSMO! Great swimming pool, it was a bit crowded but seemed like everybody was having a great time. Felt like I was in college again. Later that night we went to Marquee for KASKADE, we didn't expect to get in b\/c it was me and 2 guys, but thanks to our hotel key we got in right away! Best clubbing experience of my life. Kaskade for first time is pure amazing. 

 We were only in Vegas for Saturday but we had the BEST VEGAS TRIP of our lives. We came back  for Halloween to Vegas but it didn't compare to the experience we had at Cosmo. THANK YOU COSMO. Next time not sure if we can get comp again, but we will def pay that extra few hundreds just to stay here. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! The center of vegas has shifted.",2,2,2

It has a modern feel as soon as you walk in to either the casino or lobby, and the area with giant chandelier in the middle of the casino has lots of good bars and restaurants.

The room was perfectly fine and I had no issues with it. But if I'm being honest I expected a bit more given what it costs to stay here. There was nothing wrong with it-- comfortable bed and all the usual amenities, but there just wasn't anything all that special about our room (which was just a standard room with 2 beds). The one exception to that was the shower which was cool looking and very spacious.

Generally all the staff were very helpful and friendly, but we did have one bad experience. On Sunday morning before we had to leave for the airport we tried to go to the hotel's breakfast buffet. We got there and there were about 10 people in line ahead of us but they said it would be a half hour wait. Looking into the dining area there were TONS of empty tables. The explanation was that they did not have enough staff to open all the tables which would make more sense if this wasn't a self-service buffet! Not to mention it was a Sunday morning so not like the breakfast crowd should come as some big surprise. So we gave up on that (and by that time it was too late to try Eggslut) and went to a crepe place near the casino. It took a frustratingly long time to get our food there, but the crepe I ordered was fantastic.

Overall still had a positive experience at Cosmo and would certainly consider staying here again. Location-wise, you can't do much better being in the heart of the strip.",2,1,1

I've been visiting Las Vegas since the 90's (the days when LV catered to children with wet 'n' wild water park, almost every casino had arcades and amusement parks) and I have lived here long enough to not wander the Strip unless friends or family are in town. The Cosmopolitan just may change that. 

DECOR: From the outside, she makes you wonder ""What's in there?"" and once you make your way to the parking\/ Valet area, you're kind of distracted with all the details that the other casinos lack in the parking garage. Lights, crystals,... Not such a good idea for dumb drivers as we experienced... WATCH THE ROAD DUMMY. 

After speaking to one of the employees, the rumors are true, the valet parking area is like that of the one that you'd find if you google the word's ""Volkswagen parking garage"", robotic platforms and compact spaces. With a 4"" clearance on the top, bottom and sides, oooweee, you better bet that those Valet employees are trained! The person I spoke to said that their Valet can accommodate up to 1,400+ cars, so to not turn any guest away. Holler. 

The self parking garage, as you can see from some of the photos, each floor painted with a different theme. We took our time looking for a parking spot because 1. we wanted to checkout the wall art, and 2. It was so damn busy since they just had their Grand Opening the day prior and people just did not know how to drive, le sigh. 

There's a huge chandelier that covers 3 or 4 floors of the center bar. Random areas of unique chairs, sofas and a pool table in the center of the third (?) floor. Restaurants and mall areas have many unique pieces of art, decor and things that you just have not ever been able to see at any other casino. 

GAMBLER'S POINT OF VIEW: I did not see a sports book. Weird... or just enjoyed a few too many cocktails and didn't notice, LOL. 

I am not much of a gambler, $20 and I am done, but I had to give this place a try. Towards the front of the casino, they have themed gambling areas. Dealers are dressed different from pit to pit (some burlesque type outfits, some, collared shirts) even the bars are decorated different from one another. 

Although you'll never see me wait hours on end to enter a nightclub, I'd like to check it out... Promoters, where you at?? 

I'd love to check out the rooms and pool, perhaps a summer staycation :)",3,1,3

  My hotel balcony facing the MGM Grand and Luxor was uplifting! They even have lounge furniture on the balcony that was nice to have a smoke and a glass a wine on.

The Marquee Day and Nightclub are killer. The girls that work there are the hottest in Vegas and really nice. The staff is very nice to hotel guests and will let you cut in line for the Marquee Day and Nightclub.

The buffet at the Cosmopolitan was the best I ever had. Every type of food you would want to gorge on, they have. The buffet is a bit pricy though. Its like $25 but your def going to pig out and fall asleep after and go rest in your super comfy bed in your room after.

The only down size is that not everyone can afford this hotel. Its super super expensive. Room service charges a $5 order fee on top of an 18% tip for the room service guy. Room service for a 12 pack of beer is $95. The pool charged us $300 on saturday for two day beds, ouch!!! Our bill came out to $561.00 with an 18% tip included, but the girl was super nice and super hot, the service wasn't bad either, they treat you with respect and get your order fast because they know your paying too much. The dj's at the pool were killer....

All in all, if you can afford to pay a few thousand for the weekend def stay at this hotel. If you can't be a player i suggest you stay at Harrah's with the rest of the people from the 909 and 818......only the fittest people can live this lifestyle'",1,0,0

We arrived at 4 in the afternoon, there was no room available, and we were told we had to wait. When they finally called, we were offered a room in the west tower on the 16th floor. We explained we had a certain room booked and we paid that much money because we wanted that particular room. Reaction from the reception young woman: sigh, rolling her eyes and an arrogant reply ""it's new year's eve, everything is booked"". 

We politely complain, she turns her back and another girl comes in. Nicer and more willing to accommodate. Magically a room on the 67th floor on the east tower becomes available. We get all excited and feel they have done us a favor. (our marriot platinum premier didn't count for anything)

We get to the room, keys do not work. I guard 4 suitcases in front of the door while my husbands goes to solve the problem. 20 minutes later he calls me and tells me a man from maintenance has to come and check on the batteries but there is nobody available right now. Another 20 minutes, problem solved.

We enter the room, quite nice at a first glance, didn't get the full view of the strip but the side with the aria hotel. Not what we paid for but good enough as we do not want more aggravation and definitely do not want to loose this room as ""it is new years eve and everything is booked"" So, we make peace with the half a measure for what we paid a full amount and try to enjoy the elevated floor at least. 

But the surprises continue. I went to the bathroom, the toilet seat was sprayed with what looked like feces from the guest before us. Called the office, they sent a maid and she cleaned it. Apologies from the hotel. 

Next morning after shower, my husband grabs a towel and it was dirty and grey, looked like it was put back on the rack after was picked up from the floor. All the towels we got in the room  over the 4 days were a dirty white and worn out. Seriously? For $2000 a night you cannot afford buying new towels or bleach them. You really need to use them until they look like cars were washed with them?

Bathtub was dirty and with hair in it, round marks of glasses on surfaces, carpet was covered in dark spots, pillow on the balcony table covered in stains.

Room was half cleaned every day. Dirty glasses left in the sink, toilet not cleaned at all, bathroom sink left with hair and makeup stains, dirt on the floor, same bed sheets and pillow cases, the blanket had a brown mark that looked like poop and we put it next to the door on the floor hoping to be replaced, we found it on the bed turned with the spot inside. 

Just awful
. 
And the best part was the booming, loud noise from the Marquee club at the bottom of the building until 5 in the morning. The club is literally in a tent, no sound proof, the only thing that separates you from the noise is a plastic roof and your balcony door. It was impossible to get any sleep until they stopped in the morning
. 
I understand it is Vegas and it is about partying, and we like that, and we were there ready to not mind a little noise and staying up late, but even in Vegas you need to sleep eventually, that is why you get a hotel room, and when you pay that much money for it, it is quite unacceptable to have to listen to club level noise all night long. 

The casino was filled with cigarette smoke, more than in other hotels. 

This is just a pretentious, expensive hotel but once you paid the money and get behind the glamorous facade, there is no effort made to make you feel welcome and respected for the money you paid.

Last but not least, the room next to ours was occupied by probably 12 young people who got back to the room every night drunk, one of them banged at our door at 4 in the morning (we were not sleeping anyway), another one vomited on the carpet outside, they screamed for hours and made a lot of noise like they were throwing furniture to the walls. This is the calibre of this hotel and the refinement of their usual guests. One morning, at about 8, there was this guy walking down the corridor half naked and drunk\/high, looking like a zombie. 

We paid for a high end hotel and felt like in a cheap dorm.
Pictures attached!
Will never stay here again!

For what we paid for a room, we definitely expected the place to at least be clean. Service is pretty crappy as well. Finally, this is not a place to go and feel relaxed. It's a club and party scene, not for couples looking to get away or families. We just didn't expect that since it's not cheap. 

We arrived early and had to wait in a long line to check in. After waiting, we finally got to the front of the line. The check in process was quite easy and seamless. Since we were there early in the day (about 12:30 pm), our room wasn't ready, which is what we expected. We were told that we would receive a phone call when it was available - between 3 and 5 pm. The call came promptly at 3:02 pm which was great.

Meanwhile, we figured we would get lunch at one of the many restaurants onsite. Our friends chose Milos. The food was mediocre, but the bill was pretty steep for lunch. The menu was pre fixe three course meal. There were no complaints, but everything was pretty standard. The lobster in the pasta was pretty chewy and subpar. Service was also a little off and pushy. Not so laid back and relaxed. Definitely had a certain way of running things - drinks took forever as well as dessert. 

We wanted to hang out at one of the many pools afterwards, but found ALL of them to be a party, club-like pool scene. We were told that the Bamboo pool was more laid-back and great for relaxing. We headed there and it was definitely not the case. It was so packed and obnoxious. 

The room and entire hotel was pretty dirty as well. There were many places that the dust was piled up and obvious. The windows hadn't been cleaned in a long time and even the shower glass still had fingerprints on it. Not up to standards of a hotel that charges $300 a night in an area that you can get a room down the street at the Luxor or MGM for half of that and have a clean space. Drinks were also over-priced.

So for 3 years of never paying for a room you now want to charge me.  The worst they did was let Kendall Brasch go from their VIP services dept.

It makes me think of a club I used to hang out at when I lived in Atlanta and of course one of my go-to drinks (before dirty martinis became more appealing to my taste buds).  I remember hearing about this Cosmopolitan before it's grand opening just about a year ago, and of course I read the rave reviews that came before mine, so I was super excited when my husband told me we were heading to Vegas for a friend's shotgun wedding and we were staying at the Cosmopolitan.  Stayed there, we did... and we also dined at almost all of the restaurants inside this hotel, used the fitness facility and the spa.

The hotel is as glitzy and glamorous as you'd imagine.  It is modern and sleek, yet comfortable.  The rooms are spacious and include a sitting area, desk, kitchen, large bathroom, patio (at least our room did), closet, and fluffy(comfortable) bed.  The view from our room overlooked the fountains at the Bellagio.  We also had a refrigerator and honor bar.  The bathroom amenities were quality, but despite being one of the nicest hotel rooms I've stayed at, there were two minor drawbacks: 1- our room was missing a hairdryer (probably an oversight and I am sure if I called to mention it, they would've replaced it), and 2 - the toilet paper was cheap.  Again, these are very minor but worth mentioning!

As I said above, we dined at many of the restaurants located inside the hotel.  My favorites were: Blue Ribbon Sushi, China Poblano (I never would've combined Chinese and Mexican, but it works!), and Jaleo (don't miss their incredible acetunas aka olives).  Oh, and if you're into buffets, don't miss Wicked Spoon.

But even more fabulous than the food, was the Sahra Spa... I had an incredible massage here.  I didn't get to spend as much time as I would've liked, but that just means I'll have to return again.  Spa day, anyone?

One other fun fact for those that are interested in shopping rather than gambling: The Cosmopolitan is located just a short walk over a bridge from not one, but two major shopping destinations.

Bottom line: while this wasn't a crazy Vegas trip (it's different when you go to Vegas with your husband than when you go for a bachelorette party with a bunch of single girls), it was a fun get-away, and I'd definitely stay at the Cosmopolitan again!  I have to go back to check out the pool when it warms up again anyways, so I'll report back then!",11,4,12

We had horrible experiences with THE Cosmopolitan.   No matter how beautiful your decors are in the hotel, I don't sleep at the lobby or the bar area at night.  I rather you provide us with decent services instead. 

First strike, the toilet was full of shit stains when we arrived the room.  You don't have any excuses of given an uncleaned or unready room to your guess especially when you charge so much. 


Second strike, we were wakening by a loud ""BANG"" sound at 6:58 a.m..  I thought was earthquake, actually it was the cable box from the TV dropped and broke the table lamp.  We had to called the customer services right away to get the mess fix, and it took the technician about 40 minutes to arrive.  And another 10 extra minutes for the housekeeping department to clean up all the broken glasses.  

For all the yelpers, don't you guys feel bad for me at this point, it is literally Vacation Nightmare.""  

Third strike, The same night of the Fallen Cable Box disaster, the Housekeeper never came by to fix our bed, change the towels, and make the room.  BTW, We tipped the Housekeeper whom cleaned the broken glasses from that morning.  
It is HORRIBLE.  Called in to request them to get our bed fix, and we made a request to have them please come by after 5 p.m. because we were tired from the morning disaster and all the sightseeing, and the coordinator was agreed to send someone over around 5.  

So, half an hour passed from the time I called, someone knocked on our door.  It was the housekeeper and we have to send them back.  I almost had a heart attack.  I have to talk to someone that understands about services and accommodations.  The manager got on the phone with me and explained that ""the housekeepers get off at 5 pm and no one can provides us services after that time.""  HOW come no one told me that when I make my first request.  And the manager explains"" We didn't anticipate the back up.""  WHF are you talking about, and Is it your first day as a manager for such a high end hotel??????

The hotel itself has a very nice vibe, good atmosphere and good location, in my opinion. There are pros and cons: 

Pros: 
1.) The suite is very well put together. I really liked the layout of the rooms and the balcony, etc. 
2.) We stayed there the night before the flogging Molly concert and had we booked it just one night ahead we would have been able to comfortably watch the concert, which was held at the pool, from our balcony. 

Cons: 
1.). They did not really clean the place very well, as there was dried up vomit on the corner of the balcony and cigarette butts on the ground. 
2.) The second bedroom had an odd layout where the shower and bathtub were part of the room - separated by a half wall in the center of the room (the bed was against the half wall on one side and the tub was against it on the other). This was fine for my situation but if you were the type to want privacy while showering or bathing then this is not for you.

I had a pleasant experience, but with any hotel I don't think I can ever give a perfect 5 without getting the best possible experience. Sorry, my standards are high, especially when people pay an arm and a leg to stay at this place. Having said that, let me continue:

Valet parking went smooth. Check-in took a little long. After that, we grabbed our room keys put them in the elevator card thing and were taken up to our floor. We ran down that hallway in anticipation...put the key in the door lock...and were in AWE.

Okay, I'll spare you the details of the room. ;) Just know we had an amazing view, three sliding doors to the terrace, a kitchen, an amazingly comfortable bed, shower, etc. 

Anyways, there were some technical difficulties with the room right upon our arrival and they apologized. One of the phones wasn't working, our TV went berserk, and some lights were acting cray. 
But seriously we had no light in our bathroom for about an hour. That's unacceptable. And they didn't go off once, but TWICE. WTF? I need to take a crap or shower and it's pitch black! They apologized, but that was it. Okay, thanks Cosmopolitan staff! 

Other than that and everything being obscenely expensive in our room and the places at the hotel I enjoyed my stay. 

It's a beautiful hotel, filled with very beautiful people. I'm not kidding when I say I saw the best looking people at our hotel. Not to mention at Club Marquee, which I will review as well. 

In retrospect, would I stay there again? Sure. But I'd probably want to try a different hotel and just head on over to Club Marquee. I decided this after being told on Saturday night that club entrance was still charged. That's a fuggin joke, especially with the amount that was paid for our room. Oh well. OH! And before I forget.

We checked in on 11\/5\/12 into a ""Wrap a-round terrrace suite on the 65th floor. Initially we were happily surprised with the suite itself, as it is tastefully decorated and has great amenities such as a full kitchen and even a washer and dryer.
Unfortunately the other reviews we read on ""Trip Advisor"" were right on point when they talked about lack of service and how beat up the rooms\/furniture look for being such a new hotel.
Examples:
1. had to call 3x and wait an hour for a crib to be delivered- even though I called 3x the week prior to our stay to ensure the crib was ready upon check in
2. called 2x for dishwasher detergent, was told it was out of stock...then delivered 10min later- apparently the staff who decided to tell us it was out of stock didn't communicate it to the person who kindly delivered it to our room
3. We had a FULL kitchen but not a dish in sight...it is a $50 fee\/day to use dishes, plus someone has to drop them off and inventory them, then pick them up and inventory them (about 2hr process)- What's the point of a kitchen??
4. Carpets were DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!! I had to ask for them to be vacuumed on the 2nd day, apparently this isn't part of regular housekeeping?!? (I attached pictures)
5. The wrap around terrace that was the selling point of the room was not cleaned prior to our arrival, there were trash (pizza boxes, cigarettes, beer bottles) left over from the previous occupants

Our room wasn't ready right away so we went and had lunch, but no sooner had we sat down then they called to say the room was ready.  Fast!  The room was a standard room (so they say).  When we walked in, the bathroom puts my office to shame.  Not only was there a separate shower, toilet and bathtub, but I didn't have to share a sink (ah, the little things can make me so happy).  This had a separate ""living room"" with its own TV and the ""bedroom"" had a TV as well.  When you walk out onto the balcony, the view is of the Bellagio fountain.  So a good view during the day AND at night.  The pool was nice, though we only stayed long enough to get hot and have a few cocktails.  I ordered the Suntory Smash.  It was really good - loved the piece of watermelon that came as a garnish.

The casino itself is pretty standard - has all the right tables and slots (and numerous bars scattered all around in case you might want a drink).    One day we did go specifically to a bar called ""Bond"" - nice layout, great place to people watch and the drinks were good.

As I mentioned in my earlier emails, I was looking for recommendations for a club with table\/bottle service for 40-50 year olds as it was my friends 50th birthday.  You sent me to Justen.  I did not know he only worked for Marquee.   He said the club was perfect for us and he would set us up with a ""great table"".  I even tipped him $100 on the way in...  

It was all 20 something patrons.  Not what we were told or even sold!!! They set us up with a table in the back corner by the bathroom.  It was horrible.  Couldn't have been further from the dance floor.  Not even in the ring. Then they triggered a fraud alert on my visa and they would not let anyone have any of the drinks even though they know we were staying in the hotel. What is that all about???   It took the waitress (Mary) over 30 minutes to re-process it. We were all standing there with our thumbs up our ass. 

Now the icing on the cake....Mary told me she was leaving for the night.  I signed the bill and included a 20% gratuity.  Then she comes back and asks for a tip for the bar back who kept up with the mixers etc...  She said the gratuity didn't include him.  I was so angry at that point that I just charged another $50 on my card.  Then I go to the bathroom and come back and our whole area was cleaned out and know one knew what was up.  I felt worked over and angry over the whole experience.  Disgusted!!!! 

The next day on check out neither of you were around.  They had some manager from Marquee call me and he said he would give me $50 towards my next visit to Marquee.  Seriously?????

The Cosmopolitan hotel is my absolute favorite hotel in Vegas. I no longer have the desire to stay anywhere else and I have only stayed in one other hotel before (Luxor). Centrally located in the middle of the strip and right next to a walkway bridge (since Vegas doesn't believe in crosswalks at intersections), everything you need is in or around the hotel eliminating that dreadful, crowded walk from one end of the strip to the other. This hotel DRIPS sexy...and encourages sex if you ask me. Adult kits in every room, open bathrooms with a huge jacuzzi tub for two, HUGE shower for four or more (if you are into that kind of thing *wink*). There were people making out everywhere and I wasn't mad at it! I didn't get the chance to text Rose to find out her deep secrets...(I'm sure it was just a promotional line). The art work here is amazing! From giant stilettos, full screen walls and the beautiful pink chandelier bar in the center..there is always something to look at everywhere you turn.

Although I did not have any luck on the slots at this casino, they have a nice selection of slots and tables. The nightlife here is amazing! Multiple bars, restaurants, shops, Marquee nightclub, two pools (one is more relaxed, the other is where day parties are held). As I overheard an older couple say...this is where the young people that can afford it stay. This hotel is one of the more expensive ones, however it is more than worth it. I paid $200 in resort fees for things I didn't even use (pool,  gym etc) 

I would HIGHLY recommend staying in a terrace room with a fountain view. The view is unmatched. The captivating lights and the Bellagio fountains dancing...it's breathtaking. The Cosmopolitan is the only hotel I've seen on the strip with balconies (please correct me if I'm wrong) which was amazing in itself. To wake up in the morning to the fountains and go on the balcony for fresh air without having to leave the building is perfect! The rooms are very big and and terrace rooms have a living room with a separate TV. There is also a kitchenette with sink, microwave and minibar. The minibar has a freezer but no room to refrigerate drinks. However, they offer complimentary refrigerators for you to store items in if you call guest services. Room service is available 24\/7. It is pricey but very good food! They offer laundry services, dry cleaning, a variety of amenities...this hotel really knows how to treat and take care of their guests. 

Lastly, The Cosmopolitan has one of the best reward programs. The Identity membership allows you to get points with any dollar spent anywhere in the hotel including slots. It is very quick to rack up points to use as comps. Also, they give you exclusive offers. We received a free nights stay just for signing up! The Cosmopolitan is officially my second home.",2,1,1

And those stories, much like hotels that inspire them, are Exactly Like Nothing Else.

The Cosmopolitan's Casino Hosts, Doorman and Valet are second-to-none.  In Los Angeles, I was a bellman for The Ritz-Carlton - which is owned by the Marriott.

The view, both morning and night, was jaw dropping. My bag was dropped off without me even calling 5 minutes later. David offered unpacking service and even to make an ice run for me. The room also came with some not typically offered Vegas amenities like a mini fridge separate from the standard minivan and an IPad for the room and temperature controls. Location was perfect, as we were right across the street from Walgreens and other amenity\/sundry shops.

It is one of the most beautiful hotel that I have been to in Vegas, and I have stayed at most of the hotels in Vegas.  Entering this place and going to the valet can be a little confusing, because it is on the side street on Harmon, not on Las Vegas Blvd.  Once you go in, valet will be on the left, I honestly do not know where self parking is at in this place, because it is like a maze, you can get lost!!  Checking in and going to your room is a breeze, you will be totally amazed by the beauty of it's lobby, as well as the cool screens on all of the walls.  Also theres a nice Vesper Lounge right next to check in if you can't wait and need a shot or a drink to calm you down from being shocked by the sheer magnificence of the place.  If that doesn't impress you, get to the room!  Love the wrap around balcony rooms, its like a big ass studio apartment, with every possible thing you need, from a nice kitchen, to guest bathrooms!!  Just love the view, especially when you get the Bellagio fountain view and the Eiffel Tower view, it is the best view in town!  Cosmo is so beautiful inside, with soo many chandeliers downstairs, and even in your room!!

Love the design of the place, love the casino, very inviting and very modern.  On to the FOOD, we all love that right?!?! The buffet was bad, I mean Michael Jackson BAD!! Love the nice modern decor of the buffet, the food looks wonderful, but it sucks, totally avoid!  STK was however very good, love the food there, I had the lobster plate, man was it good, highly recommended.  Comme Ca was also very good, a very nice flare to French cuisine, also highly recommended!

Next is the shopping, one word, sucks.  Although they have All Saints, but that is about it, so take your shopping to Bellagio, Crystals at City Center or Caesars where all the designer brands are at.

Marquee night club is wonderful! Hard as hell to get in, but once you are in, the decor is wonderful, the music is great, and the crowd is young and lively!

The pool kicks ass, the pool sits on top of the casino, so you are probably around 10 floors up, overlooking the Las Vegas Strip, can't beat that!

The amenities in the room were missing, such as flip flops and robes, bottle opener and glasses. Also the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign that invited the housekeeping staff to wake us up every morning. The living room phone was not charging in two of our rooms.

The Bamboo Pool staff had a very slow moving day. The waiters although many around, none to be found. Waited over one hour to find one and after placing the order the drinks returned 20 minutes later. Second order, the waitress left our drinks next to someone's chair even though we ordered from inside the pool. After asking for our drinks she brought them to us with melted ice from the 110 degree sun after 45 minutes wait. The assistant supervisor of the pool, very disoriented and uneducated was unprofessional and without interest to solve the issue. She felt like all she had to do was comp our drinks instead evaluating the real issue and solving the employees.

For a late check out of two hours it was requested to pay a half day rate.

A few months back, I was in Vegas for a wedding and had the opportunity to check out the rooms at the Cosmopolitan during a Bachelorette party. They were beautiful. So I told my BF we just had to stay there because it was one of the newer and popular hotels. My boyfriend called in and worked ""his magic"" and was quoted the price of $650 for a one bedroom suite over looking the Bellagio fountains. I emphasize the ""magic"" part. I'm not sure what was promised or asked but the price seemed like a great deal. I looked online and found the a 3 night stay was over $1,000 for a one bedroom suite! Good job BF! 

We arrived on a Thursday afternoon and the place was DEAD. Check in was a breeze. They gave us an option of which floor we preferred (unheard of!) and were whisked away to the 49th floor. The room was UH-MA-ZING. My god, my pants dropped when we opened the door. Living room, kitchen, closet\/changing area, in-room hot tub\/shower combo and balcony overlooking the Bellagio towers. Holy Moly. BF and I took full advantage of the room. Everything was clean, new and super chic. LOVED it. 

The hotel itself boasts quite a number of bars and restaurants. The Chandelier bar is the prettiest bar I have ever seen. After a late night on the town, we hit the pizza joint and on a different night tried the restaurant Comme Ca for dinner. Wicked Spoon buffet and The Henry are both excellent places to grab brunch\/lunch\/dinner. Everything was superb. I did like the fact that the second hand smoke floating through the air was not as bad as some of the older hotels. My only gripe was that the pool was not open until March. But they allowed sunbathers to hang out. Bar wasn't open either. 

I highly recommend a stay at the Cosmopolitan. Central to everything and on the strip. The rooms are different and are all awesome. Beautiful hotel, awesome bars and restaurants.",3,1,3

I work on the strip in one of the finest hotels in Las Vegas and I will, from here on out, suggest and refer my family and friends to stay at the Cosmo. The room was gorgeous! Amazing view from our west tower.  It was probably one of the best views of the strip I've seen.  Having a balcony is a nice asset, we left the slider door open and just relaxed on the bed, listening to the sounds of the busy nightlife is actually quite peaceful, I've never heard it like that before. 

Check in was quick and efficient.  The lobby was unique and if you like art, you'll be intrigued at almost every turn.
 
Every single associate we encountered was stupendously friendly!  All around excellent experience.  

The spa was ok.  When I go to a spa I prefer a more tranquil and relaxing quiet experience, there were a lot of chatty Cathys that day.  The decor doesn't scream peace.  It's much more modern.  Although the staff was friendly, I didn't care for it.  I won't go back again.

Great selection of restaurants, however, they are ALL overpriced! Which got really annoying.  Price gounging at it's finest!!

Room service was excellent!

The Chandelier Bar is gorgeous, definitely a hot spot!  
I will name Marquee one of the best and newest clubs in LV.  It's huge and keeps going, mulitple rooms!

I was impressed from the moment we pulled up in the marble-look entry of the parking garage--just so clean and classy looking. Next to impress was the lobby with enormous columns made of HDTV screens with various entertaining images displayed. Throughout, the design elements and art are beautiful and hip. The casino floor is a bit small, but I kind of like it that way. The crowd is young-most looked in their 30's-and glamorous (mostly!) and we did see at least one celebrity as we were out for a stroll.

One reviewer said the place did not have a good flow, but I completely disagree! The ground floor is mostly gaming, the second floor is shopping, the third floor is the restaurant level, the pools are on the roof, and the chandelier bar runs through the middle of all three floors, tying everything together and providing an excellent place to people watch on any level.

MOST of the restaurants are gourmet and fairly expensive (but really good). However, the crowning moment for my stay here was when i went on a food run at 12 in the morning. Armed with sweats and a Pac-man T, I snaked around the hoards of ready to party 20-year-olds crowded around the night club. I finally reached a security man and asked for a pizza place, half expecting to scoff and ask me my age. He didn't, he actually pointed me to one. As far as i could tell the place didn't even have a name. The entrance was just a short, skinny hallway with a counter, a register and a PINBALL MACHINE!

the best part is that we had the most perfect view of the bellagio fountains and the eiffel tour that you could ask for.    Since, we were getting married in our room - the view was amazing.   

I could have lived on the terrace - so relaxing to sit there and see the fountains go off time and time again.  At night with the lights was even more spectacular.

If you're married or have a gf, bf, partner, someone special - you're going to have sex. And hopefully lots of it. That's all you need to know, in a nutshell.

Why? This luxury hotel is a smooth combination of luxe, sleek, classy, and sexy. If I could have it as a dessert it would be decadent (but not too much), creamy, and go down just right. Everywhere you go there are places to lounge, dine, and there is something for almost everyone here - food, restaurants, nightclub, pool, multiple sexy bars serving signature cocktails, hip music pumping from all manner of places including the elevator, etc. All the accoutrements that bring you to the proper mood to - you guessed it - have SEX. And isn't that what Vegas is all about? 

Decadent, but not too much. Just the way I like it. 

We were there for a four-day stay and luxurious holiday party celebration recently in December. It is one of the most beautiful, modern hotels I have ever stayed at. So hip and upscale in a sleek way, but not overtly so. 

We were on the upper twenty-something floor and stayed in a TERRACE SUITE WITH BALCONY. Such a fabulous room. This room had: 

+ Hello\/goodbye ""memory lighting"" that remembers your lighting preferences at the touch of a  button. I loved this! 
+  Beautiful lounger for two on the balcony 
+  French door closet with robe and slippers
+  Soaking bubble jet tub 
+  Shower with beautiful, shimmery tile and lovely C.O. Bigelow bath products
+  A nice, spacious living room
+  Comfortable bed and pillows
+  Kitchenette with microwave, sink, and fridge
+  Music video channel and tv, playing music while projecting artsy images 
+  The video music pillars that greet you at the front lobby are beautiful, and get naughtier as the night progresses (but still stay tasteful)

Again, all fabulous to have on hand for you-know-what - SEX. This room was in the upper echelon of $600\/night, so not exactly super affordable. But if you can swing it, it's worth every penny. There are more affordable rooms, too, of course in the $300s\/night range and there are also more expensive rooms than this one. 

The check-in and check-out process was easy. Our suite was comfortable, quiet, private, luxurious and I could have stayed here for a few weeks. There's a fridge stocked with expensive alcohol and water. If you want to save money, there's a Walgreens across the street at the corner of Planet Hollywood, where you can buy snacks. Every employee we encountered gave exemplary, friendly service. A shout out to MARIA in housekeeping - she's great. We went to the Chandelier Bar and The Marquee Club and had a fantastic time. We went to Rose, Rabbit, Lie for dinner for the holiday party and had a blast. 

YELP TIP NOTE: No cover for the Marquee Club if you're a guest at the hotel. 

All in all, a most fantastic, enjoyable time and a real getaway. We have kids, so yes, this was a dream come true to be away from ""real life"" for a little while. So stay here at The Cosmo, have lots and lots of SEX, and come back renewed. I highly recommend this hotel for couples seeking an escape. Or if you're not a couple, have yourself an adventure!

I must say that it is rare I wish I was STILL in a hotel room. The Cosmopolitan did just that. The hotel itself is a marvel. It is pristine, new, and jaw-droppingly gorgeous. But, like anything brand new, not without its faults.

The room itself was spectacular. Cutting edge design, gorgeous furniture, great bath products by Bigelow, and a bed that will make you wish you could sleep all day and night. The room was entirely automated by one of the two large Samsung LCD televisions (more on that later). The books displayed everywhere was an amazing touch, and I loved the wallpaper, steamer trunk, and artwork. After hundreds of hotel rooms, this may be one of my favorite ones....

There were, however, some faults. There were some stains on the couch. I won't tell you what the stains reminded me of....There were leftover spaghetti noodles on the carpet from a previous guest (hello, vacuums), and the housekeeper seemed a little out of it and unsure as to what he was doing. I am not sure why a Miele dishwasher was actually in the room. It didn't seem to serve a purpose other than to say ""Wow, there is a Miele dishwasher in my room"". The tub was rather fabulous and the shower would melt away any cares from the most staunch water conservationist. Heaven. Really. The Kallista sinks were beautiful and the separate water closet was a nice touch The televisions, though,didn't work all the time and seemed 'frozen' for lack of a better word. Also, noise was an issue for us coming from the night club.55 floors up, we could still hear the night club on a Saturday night. It was LOUD. Be warned. You will hear it until 4:00am when they close. (and that's coming from the ""Beck and Call"" person we called).

Overall, I highly recommend the hotel, the casino, and the restaurants, which were all great. I attended a large conference there and I must say that the entire staff, from start to finish, were all stellar. I can RARELY say that.The Cosmopolitan hasthe potential to be truly amazing. They just need to work out a few kinks. But, still, to me, one of the top 2-3 hotels in Vegas.",0,0,0

We were bambozilled.  They offered a upgrade which we perceived as just 400 bucks, but it was like 400 in addition to the 100 we already had for our reservation.  

I recommend whatever prices they give you make sure to get a copy before you go to your room, because if we didnt ask we would have been stiffed with a $1300 night stay.  

The pools there are for show haha I am a little fat and the pools I saw I don't think I could even lay down in the pool to cover my fat. I would have to lay face down to try to hide it. LOL.  Lots of sexy women during the summer walking all around the hotel in the bikinis.  It makes it hard to concentrate sometimes  gambling, but I don't mind.  

The gym is awesome they have some high end equipment and with TV's and stuff the shows you how to use the high end equipment.  There is even a boxing ring and a Tennis court.  I only wish you could use the Steam room or sauna, but they hotel says that's a different company from them.  I would think use of the steam room or sauna would be covered in the resort fee,

I would stay again at this place maybe if they offered me a better deal.  I have stayed at other hotels all around vegas 5 star hotels, but never had the upgrade scam done to me like that.",2,1,1

1) If you stay in the West Tower, you don't have to walk through the casino.  You check-in and then the elevator is right behind you.  This is a HUGE bonus for me since I'm in town for work and walking through the casino is a drag.
2) The rooms are modern and comfortable.  I feel like one person did the design for Caesar's, Palazzo, and Ventian... so it's nice staying somewhere that is arranged differently.
3) Beds are SUPER comfortable.  Although I hate feather pillows... 
4) The gym on the West Tower (14th floor) is open from 5am until (I think) 8pm.  I'm a morning gym-goer and have had no issue getting a machine.  The gym is also really clean and the staff is friendly.  One downside is that the women's bathroom smelled like someone had died and they'd tried to cover it up with air freshener.  (Seriously seemed like a plumbing issue.)
5) The Cosmo has several fun bars sprinkled through the lobby -- one right by registration and then the Chandelier bar, etc.  Again, everyone is friendly and it doesn't reek of cigarette smoke.
6) The Cosmo has some of my favorite restaurants on the Strip, including HOLSTEIN'S.  I love that place.",2,1,2

I chose to stay at the Cosmopolitan because of all the wonderful reviews I read prior to booking. To start, the location was perfect. The Cosmopolitan is located right in the middle of all the action on the strip. It is right across the street from Planet Hollywood and next to the Bellagio hotel. When we first checked into our room we immediately when up to check it out (we got a Terrace Studio) and were sent to the 36th floor. While standing outside of our hotel room door we could hear music playing in the room. Excited that they were thoughtful enough to get our room ready we slid the room card in and unlocked the door. To our surprise, there was a suitcase in the middle of the floor with clothes spread out everywhere. Realizing someone else was checked in our room, we immediately closed the door and called the floor operator and was connected to customer service. I explained the situation to the rep and he apologized and asked us to come down stairs to the front desk to straighten everything out. We did so, having to retell the story a few more times they came to the conclusion that our reservations were mixed with another group. They ended up upgrading our room AND we were on the 42nd floor. The reps from the Cosmo called me a few times throughout my weekend there to check in with us and make sure we were enjoying our stay as well as apologizing for the mix-up. Our first night back from exploring the strip, we walking into our room to find an apology card from Cosmo and a cute box of gourmet chocolates.They also gave us a $75 food credit that could be used anywhere in the Cosmo. It was refreshing to get that kind of customer service that is so rare these days. GREAT JOB, COSMO. We'll be back for sure. :)",2,0,0

Every time you open the refrigerator (which is motion-activated) they charge you for using it. We checked out with $70 of charges on our bill. Yes, they took it off. But I asked the woman at the desk how many people they are charging who DON'T notice it. She had no answer, just said they were happy to remove charges.
But that is just the tip of the disorganization iceberg at the Cosmopolitan, which attempts to blind you with glitz so that you don't notice that staying there is really more like high-rise camping. 
Everything in the room operates off the TV remote: the lights, the air conditioning\/heat, hotel details, spa appointments. Our TV remote, however, was dead, as were four lights in the room (one in the water closet, which means toilet room for those who don't get out much. and we couldn't see a damn thing in there.) It took two days to get those things restored. TWO DAYS. Unacceptable. Of course if you can't turn the lights out without burrowing into TV screens (4 clicks deep) you're just going to let all the lights burn. 
This is faux high-tech bull. What it really is is aggravating.  Hotels are supposed to be relaxaing. Not taxing.
Also, the maids don't seem to know what they're doing. Not enough towels, no replacement of soaps. Missing do-not-disturb sign. Can't get those things when you ask for them.
The place was taken over by its lender, Deutche Bank, and opened anyway. It shows.
One good thing: every room has a deck.

And I do agree with some people that the hotel resembles a movie, and that you're in the damn movie.  It's just beautiful.

We were in a suite for a couple of nights, and I thoroughly enjoyed the room for the TVs, the balcony, and most especially the huge shower with a tub inside.  Yeah, the shower room has a tub.  It's the biggest shower I've seen in my time in Vegas without having to shell out more than $500 a night for a room.  Definitely impressive.

I had a blast feeling like a gaudy rich girl with the ginormous chandelier.  I actually wanted to hate it because of their TV commercials, but at the same time, I liked those damn commercials.  It was new and shiny when I went a couple months back, so I hope they are able to keep this up.

I like that the place is not super big, but still large enough to feel like you are in a vegas casino.  Ok, well it's big, but compared to other places in Vegas, it wasn't overwhelming.  The casino floor was manageable and they had some fun slot machines...of course.

I also checked out the Wicked Spoon Buffet (to be reviewed separately) and for a buffet, I thought it was pretty good.  I don't generally like to eat at buffets, but I was with mom, and she is into buffets. :)

I can easily say that this was the best room I have ever had... or will have in a long, long time! I booked through Lasvegas.com for a 3 night stay at a Studio Terrace room. When we were checking in, the AWESOME guy who was helping us, asked if we would like an upgrade on the studio terrace with a view of the Bellagio Fountains for $25\/per night. THE BEST $75 I HAVE EVER SPENT...!!! Seriously... we didn't want to leave our room. You also get a free, small bottle of water which is nice of them, but then again, this hotel can def afford it. 

Anyway, our studio was amazing in every way possible. There is a huge bathroom, with a shower, soaking tub, and a separate toilet room. There is also a living room with a couch\/desk, and the bedroom that is connected to the balcony. Everything is connected to a remote, so from turning on and off the lights to the XM radio on both flat screen TVs. Just one pointer i have to make, and we were def warned about this, but i am not sure how seriously we took him. The minibar\/food in the room is all wired, so even if you move the food just a bit, the hotel may charge you right away. We were just messing around, looking through what we got and trying to find room for the food I brought from home, and i was immediately changed $75. Not exactly sure what the $75 was for, but all the food\/drinks are hella expensive in the room. Anyway, we called the front desk right away and they removed the charges almost immediately, so the customer service we had at the hotel was great. 

Like I said, our first night we were really tired and the view was so amazing, that we didn't want to leave. We ended up ordering room service which was brought to us hot and fresh within 30 minutes. The guy bringing the food even gave us a couple extra items for free, so nice touch :) We were starving, but the food was excellent and I was incredibly happy with our entire experience to that point. 

The hotel itself is jaw dropping gorgeous... it's hard to put in words exactly everything it has to offer, but it's def a site to see. I can't comment on the casino since I don't really gamble, but I would probably recommend to go elsewhere to play. I don't think this hotel's main focus is on gambling, especially since I overheard that it's the only hotel that has a straight path from one side to the other, so people don't get mixed up at the slot machines\/tables. We didn't get a chance to check out any of the pools because it was too cold, but I cannot wait to be back and party at the Marquee Day club. Speaking of Marquee, it was def a HUGE plus that all we had to do is take the elevator down to the club, but I really did not like the club at all - i have a separate review for Marquee. 

As for food, when I was in Vegas two years ago, my family and I dined at Comme Ca and it was delicious from what I can remember.  Besides room service, i briefly checked out Holstein's and ordered food to go before a night out in Marquee. I ended up ordering the wrong thing though, and though it was good, I was disappointed. But I will def be back to this burger bar next time because the menu is insane! At 5 am, we decided to go check out Secret Pizza, but also to our disappointment, they were already closing. So, I def have a list of things to eat next time I am there. 

Cosmo's location is absolutely perfect - right smack in the middle of the strip. It's very easy to get to other hotels from there and there a couple Walgreens\/CVS very close as well. 

I am still in awe of this hotel, and I truly cannot wait to come back and experience it all over again. Thank you Cosmopolitan for giving us one hell of a weekend!",1,0,0

The room is a bigger than your average hotel room.  The bathroom is nice and spacious and has all the modern amenities.  The thing that annoyed me about this place was you had to use your room key to get to a floor and didn't always work on the first try.  The hotel has the hottest club Marquee, nice restaurants, and a locals' gem, a pizza joint right next to Blue Ribbon on the third floor.  Service staff was good, thought it could be better, but the good thing is, didn't have to use them much.  Keep in mind, this place is a Marriott chain, so they will price match and take another 25% off of the bill.  Long as they're not losing money, I'm sure Marriott will keep that in effect.

Upon driving up to the lobby you can already tell that this property is much newer and cleaner than the rest on the strip. The main thing that won me over is the lack of cornball theme - every detail is chic. 

We stayed in a Terrace Studio with an incredible view overlooking the Bellagio's fountain, so we were treated to gorgeous shows day and night. The bed and pillows were super comfy and I loved the layout of the bathroom, including a deep tub with window overlooking the Vegas lights. We had a nice wet bar and dishwasher, and I was thrilled with the closet space and seating - more than enough for our guests to stop by for drinks, including several comfy seats, a large couch and bench. The bedroom can be closed off for privacy with a pocket door, and there are flat screens in both the bedroom and living room.

The bars and lounges at The Cosmo are average for Las Vegas, but The Chandelier is really something to see, even if you can't get in when its packed. The Wicked Spoon, however, has one of the best breakfast buffets I've been to in the city. 

Generally, I thought the service was quite good - the staff is friendly, any concerns were immediately resolved and the concierge did a great job of recommending and booking tickets for a show.

My only complaint is the pool situation. We were there in mid-April and the weather was hot and sunny. Unfortunately, the large Blvd pool was not filled because the hotel was hosting concerts Thur-Sat of that week and they use that same pool space for concerts. The website made no mention of this so I would advise you to call ahead and verify that the pool will be filled and open during your stay. There is another, smaller pool (The Bamboo Pool) that was filled, but by 10 a.m. there were not any chairs open because it was so packed. Even with the large pool being filled I would anticipate that there will be a lack of seating and advise you to arrive before 10 a.m. if you want a chair.

PROs
- Blue Ribbon Restaurant was delish!  The Gindara Saikyoyaki(miso black cod) was my favorite!  It was cooked to the perfection which melts right in the mouth.
- Marquee, one of the best day and night club in Vegas!!  
- it was very convenient to book our stay there, so we could arrange everything within Cosmo without worrying about taxis and drunken girls :)
- loved the antique and modern decor in the room.

CONS
- housekeeping not up to standard for the price of this hotel.  I've stayed at other hotels where they restock all the toiletries when it is halfway full.  They would fold the clothes from the floor and put it neatly on a chair or bed.  Neaten up the mess on tables, floors, and change the mugs in the room daily.  Unfortunately our housekeeper did not do any besides making our bed.  It is very aggravating running out of shampoo, conditioner, body wash in the shower.  I also left a gel eye mask in the refridgerator, which was gone the very next day.  I assumed it was thrown out.. but why would you throw that out?  There were plenty of trash in the room that should've been thrown out but yet my gel eye mask was thrown out?  
- long check in line
- i called rom service for hot water and I was told it will take an hour and 15 minutes!  WHAT??  All i wanted was a hot water... unfortunately, i couldnt wait and never got my hot water.

My room was a standard room but was very large with two queen beds, a HUGE bathroom, nice balcony and a nice little living room area.  My coworker got upgraded to a suite which would make for a great room to get if you were throwing a bachelorette party or any type of party in your room.  It had a connector door too if you wanted one normal room with a party\/suite room attached!  I also loved that the room elevators were right next to the lobby, its not like other hotels that make you walk through a maze with mile long hallways to get to your room.  Although they did have a 2nd tower that I guess you would have to take a short walk through the casino to get to those rooms. 

You can get Marriott Points when staying here, which is an added bonus!  

Conference Facility:  We used one of their conference rooms at the hotel for our small group training, which was free to use when your group stays in the hotel, but you have to spend a minimum of $6000 on food, which was pretty easy to do with breakfast, snacks and lunches for 3 days.  The food was AMAZING for conference room food, I was really impressed and so were my coworkers.  I wish I had a larger stomach and could have eaten more of it.  We were definitely full the whole time, and the staff was super friendly and nice that served our group.  The bathrooms by the conference rooms were always clean and the conference rooms were always a comfortable temperature! 

Gym: I used the gym for 3 days while I was there and its a very nice hotel gym, with its own boxing ring!  I didn't see anyone in there boxing but it was pretty awesome that they had that and boxing bags in one room. They also had free weights, tons of cardio equipment and weight machines.  They even had a small room that offered classes or you could go in there and do your own workout when classes weren't going on.  Its $20\/day or $50 for 3 consecutive day pass.

Restaurants in Hotel:  There's a lot of great dining choices in the hotel itself.  The first night our group ate at China Poblano which was very good for small to medium size groups (we had 8). It had a mix of Mexican food and also Dim sum.  It was fun and the food was very tasty and unique.  

We had drinks at the Chandelier Bar before dinner which is located right outside of the restaurant.  A few of us stayed out and ended up hitting up the Secret Pizza place which is right between the Sushi Restaurant and the glass elevator, its a long hallway that has no sign!  At the end of the hallway is amazing pizza by the slice and they're big slices!  

The 2nd night we ate at Comme Ca which had really great French food and wines.  I recommend the cheese platter and the oyster risotto.  

The last day there my coworker and I decided to try Wicked Spoon for lunch and we were SO HAPPY that we did.  Not only was the food amazing but there was such a fun selection.  The dessert bar alone is worth going for.  The price for brunch was very reasonable.  They had a very hip selection of food compared to other buffets.   It was such a broad selection of food that its hard to decide what to eat but would make any group happy, we almost wished we would have had one of our group dinners there even though the others were equally tasty but for the price you really do get a lot of bang for your buck!!

Location: The hotel is located right next to the City Center and is connected by a short walkway to the new Crystals shopping center which also attaches to Aria.  The shops there are very pricey but there are also tons of restaurants.  It is also connected to another walkway that has the biggest Walgreen's I've ever seen.  So you can walk over and buy snacks\/beer\/wine\/anything you think of that you might need for your room.

My only complaint is that the bathroom smelled like wet dog in my room, I think the hotel is dog friendly (which I love dogs) but I just happened to have a room where a large dog must have been shut in the bathroom a lot.  My co-workers room didn't have any issues.

They also have stupid rules about large parties over 8 in their restaurants.  You have to have a special prix fixe menu and they charge kind of ridiculous prices per person.  We ended up splitting our group of 16 at Comme Ca into two groups of 8 which worked out fine because the tables were right next to each other.   We wanted to give our group choices of their own dinner seeing as the conference food was picked for them so it was annoying that the large group dining was such a pain.  The reservation line that you use to make the dinner reservations also was not much help during the process!",5,1,1

When I go I like to visit all the casinos and bars and play a lot.  I stopped through the Cosmopolitan and put $100 in video poker at the bar.  Ordered a drink and played a little.  The bartender asked if I would like a drink and I asked for a water and a drink.  I played for 10 minutes and no drinks.  I asked again and they seemed annoyed I was there playing.

While waiting I switched games to video black jack and after winning a few hands I pressed the MAX BET button which in most casinos is 10X your minimum bet.  Well not here....  it is 100X minimum bet.  Damn you max bet...... 

When the bartender finally brought my $100 drink over I asked about the absurdly high max bet and he laughed, yeah, that's the take all your money button.

I had been in Florida for two months taking care of my elderly mother. I was ready for a break. I was ready for my wife. And maybe a little kissy-kissy romance.
I flew home and whisked us to the Cosmo, where I had made a week-long reservation. We both have highly stressful jobs, and so this stay-cation could not have come at a better time.
From the moment we sent our car off with the valet to the second we walked up to the check-in desk to the second we left, the entire staff at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas was first-rate.
We booked a Terrace Suite (I HIGHLY recommend it if you have the means), and the view from five hundred feet above the Strip is worth every last penny.
From the spa (you HAVE to get the fifty-minute massage) to the pools to the first-rate restaurants (for various budgets; Eggslut is a must if you're on a budget) to the gaming floor, the Cosmo blows all other resorts away. The decor is fresh, the staff is young, the atmosphere is youthful and energized.
Best resort on the Strip for those in your twenties, thirties, and forties.
And, as an added bonus, it turns out that the Cosmo has one of the most generous membership rewards programs on the Strip. You get five points for each dollar you spend on the property--either at the shops, restaurants, spa, bars, etc. 
We already have a free night's stay coming our way after just a few days at the Cosmo, and we'll definitely use that free suite night later this fall when we need a little romance again.
The entire resort is designed to look and feel youthful . . . and for a couple in our early forties, the excitement and energy of the Cosmo makes these two old farts think we can still hang with the cool kids. Seriously, though, the entire resort staff is youthful, helpful, happy, and endlessly helpful.

It was my first time in Vegas.  I had no idea what I was to expect.  Anticipation and nervousness filled my soul as I clicked confirm on that ticket just 2 days after he asked me.  After only a few days of knowing him.

He was there already when I arrived Sunday.  But when I arrived, it was... out of a fairytale.

My handsome gent greeted me in the most elegant, decadent, sophisticated hotel I'd ever seen.  Chandeliers cover the hotel interior.  It's plush.  It's swank.  It's the trendiest place these days on the strip.

I can't speak to the pricing as I booked it on points, but they offered us excellent service as Marriott Platinum Elite members, and both of our rooms were top-notch.

The hotel itself has endless amenities, and I will not list them here as they have a website for that, but suffice it to say that you'll never run out of things to do even if you never leave the hotel. The lobby is actually really cool, with giant TV-tiled columns featuring animated designs. The Terrace One Bedroom, as you can see from the photo, is huge and very well-appointed. Not seen in the photo is the massive bathroom with shower, hot tub, and great views of the Strip.

It's very accessible from the Strip via the casino and it's super easy to get around for drinks, food, or gaming. Just don't accidentally leave from the side entrance, or you'll get stuck off of the main walkway with no way back on other than hopping a fence.

I rated this 5 stars with an assumption that you can't compare it to a high roller suite at a Vegas hotel, or to something a resort hotel in Dubai. If you're looking to stay in Vegas and you're not ultra rich, then my review will be the most help to you.

This is my second stay at the Cosmopolitan. I checked in on a Sunday at 2:30 PM and there was no line and a ""preliminary"" type of check in person greeted me and then escorted me to the actual check in person. It was a great touch - she also offered me cold bottled water from a tray. It really felt different than the usual cattle call line you see at other hotels. There isn't even a velvet rope type queue line here, just some large columns separating guests into logical lines that meet at a desk instead of a giant counter. Even though I purchased a standard room, I felt like I was getting high end concierge service.

The check in person (Lauren) was incredibly friendly and helpful. She upgraded me to a balcony room with a Strip view without any tip or hassle. If anything, she was apologetic that I was in the Eastern Tower which was a short walk from the check in desk instead of the closer and more convenient West Tower. She genuinely seemed interested in getting me the best room available. She was friendly, chatty, and treated me like I was the most important person she talked to today. I was really impressed.

My room was a 600 square foot mini-suite on the 22nd floor with a Japanese soaking tub, living room, desk with tons of plugs including HDMI, two large flatscreen TVs, dual sinks, separate toilet, bar area with a sink, and a balcony, which is where I'm writing this review from right now. I overlook Planet Hollywood and Paris. The street noise and stereo from the pool deck below me is a bit louder than I'd hoped, even with the door closed, but not ridiculously so. Although there is a partition separating the balconies there is still a visible gap between them so keep that in mind before you hang out in your underwear. There is no smoking in the rooms, but the balcony has ashtrays.

The room reminds me of a high end hotel that isn't in Vegas, such as a Four Seasons in a large city. Everything in the room was very clean and well tended. I've stayed in plenty of Vegas room and they all had suffered from a churn-and-burn mentality, where the rooms are alright but nothing you'd write home about. This was not the case at the Cosmo.

Inside of the room there were venetian blinds that you could open to view the tub and the shower. I guess that's cool if you want to lay in bed and watch your significant other shower or take a bath. The tub also had blinds that you could open to look out onto the strip.

Speaking of the tub, I didn't know what to expect for a Japanese Soaking Tub, but I thought it was a bit of a death trap. It's like a mini jacuzzi, where it's square shaped and has two little seats in it. You fill the thing up and sit in the seats instead of lounging prone like you'd do in a regular tub. The reason I say it's a death trap is that it's attached to the main open-air type shower area, and it's surrounded by very nice and very slippery marble. I tried the tub twice and for the life of me I couldn't figure out a safe way to get in and out of the tub. I had to basically crawl on my hands and knees to pivot myself into the tub and then back out because of the slippery marble. There are just enough too-high and oddly placed marble platforms\/steps leading towards the tub that you have to be extremely careful not to slip on the wet marble. Even cold sober, It would be incredibly easy to slip and fall and smash your hip or face into the various towel stands (which aren't strong enough to be hand holds) or bang your knees against the steps. 

The casino was a decent size but not very forgiving. Tables are all $20 and up on the weekdays, and the slot machines aren't what I would consider loose. Your $20 won't go very far here - pull out a $100 bill for your 15 minutes of fun instead. Drink service was very good, they seemed to have it down where unless you're in a dark corner you can get a drink every 10 minutes or so. Oddly I was served several times by male cocktail waiters, something I can't ever recall seeing.

The Cosmo, along with the Aria and the Wynn\/Encore are really a step above the rest of the service you may have come to expect in Vegas. The lobbies are trendy, high tech and immaculate, and elevators and hallways smell fresh and look new. The casino staff are dressed smartly, act professional, and push in chairs, constantly sweep and empty ashtrays, and seem very focused on maintaining a good image for the hotel.

All in all I am very impressed with the Cosmopolitan and would definitely consider staying here again, especially if you can book a mid-week off season rate.",4,0,2

The staff is friendly, the rooms are clean, and the hotel\/casino is amazing! Plus, as a guest, you get access to Marquee without having to wait in the general admission line.

Food wise, there's several great restaurants, at least 2 of which are open all night. Room wise, spend the extra $75 and get a suite; nothing beats chilling on your own private patio! Request one above the pool area, that way you can party on your balcony while the music from the live acts\/DJs filters up from the pool!

The verdict? If you're going to be spending any time at all in your room, book the Cosmo. I promise you won't regret it. However, if you're one of those people that likes to gamble and club nonstop, don't drop the money if you're never going to be in your room.",0,0,0

Our room was spotless and loaded with nice furniture, but the real highlight was the balcony. We had a glam view of the Bellagio fountains and the Paris eiffel tower which was amazing for the insta pics...I had a vision and it was everything I wanted it to be lol! 

We ordered more towels, blankets, toothbrushes, and slippers and they were brought to us in no time. 

The complimentary lotion is so divine. It left my skin feeling soo smooth and silky--a must have in the dry Vegas winter weather! It all just felt so bougie..I loved it. 

One issue I had was the water wasn't very warm when I showered the first night. It was fine the rest of our stay but during that period the water was only lukewarm at most. Also wished the lighting would be a little brighter in the bathrooms and hallways where the mirrors are. I found it hard to do my makeup because it was all so dimly lit and poor selfie lighting.

Other than that, our stay here was delightful. We got a great deal with the Anniversary Suite sale, so we got our 2nd night's stay for $5--huge steal! So far I had a better experience here than Vdara (except for the lighting situation) and I definitely look forward to staying here again.",3,3,2

The Casino is beautifully decorated and makes you feel glamorous just by being there! The service is always courteous and competent. They don't kiss your butt - most exude an air of confidence because they know they will take appropriately good care of you. This visit, they bumped our room which was a bummer because we were with another couple. Though it was a slightly nicer room, this meant they were stuck with a sofa bed...so the Cosmo ended up taking $50 off our bill. With my casino rate, we were able to upgrade to Fountain Views for little to nothing extra plus received $150 in resort credits which we gladly spent on a late night Room Service meal. If you want Room Service, get it and you will be pleased, I promise. It will take 30-60 mins but everything we have had over multiple visits has been as good as most restaurants.

The rooms are all decorated with the same touch of glamour. We have stayed in a few different rooms and have always opted for the Fountain View. Totally worth it. The view of the strip at night is gorgeous. One other thing I love about Cosmo is that everything above their basic rooms offers a balcony. If you haven't noticed, that's rare in Vegas. For me, it's pretty important. 

The gaming here is on par with any other nice casino. They have a plethora of bars and restaurants to check out. I've been to most of them and they are all nice and every place we have eaten at in the Cosmo is fabulous even their version of a 24-hour diner...they have some incredible Truffle Tater Tots.

Marquee is the day and nightclub. I've been a few times at night...Saturday night ran us $70 per couple which was higher than Drais but at least you aren't totally blocked off from the pool area. What I dislike about Marquee is that it's run by Tao so it's not really part of Cosmo. So, the only perk you have of being a hotel guest is a slightly shorter line. But, that's Vegas.

We saw the Bamboo pool from above and it looked nice and relaxing. It would be the appropriate pool for kids or those that don't want the pool party scene. We opted for the Boulevard pool and are happy we did. It was a mellow pool party compared to what I imagine Marquee would be like (or compared to the always popular Hard Rock Rehab party), but it was still a pool party. It was for hotel guests only so things stayed small. Kevin Hart was here for the weekend so he had bikini clad chicks walking around and supposedly was giving out free mani, pedis and massages. The downfall was that the pool closed at 5PM so they started pushing us out at 4:45.

Bag check is always quick and I admire how efficient the Taxi guys are...they keep the Taxi line moving so you rarely have much of a wait. 

Until next time, Cosmo.",0,0,0

We had access to a penthouse suire... the wraparound deck and a butler's touch was amazing. Of course living room was spacious enough to entertain the guests.

We had access to a Bungalow at the Marquee pool. This really made the trip. All day\/night access to Marquee. Top floor had a jacuzzi overlooking Marquee. Middle floor, a bathrrom and bed w same view. Bottom floor, a kitchen and living room spacious enough to host the entertainment. 

But what really, really earns my 5 star: in all that mess I left my tablet after I checked out. A day or so ago, lost and found contacts me and sends it back, 2 day priority, for only $10.

If you are on the right kind of drugs this would occupy a ton of your time. 

When you check in once again the high tech casino is on display. LCD screens with hotel info and doubles as your check in signature. I was able to get a balcony room (yes a balcony, not many of these on the strip). The room is controlled from the lcd phone. You can control climate, lights, music etc. 

The casino was very cool. Nice size, not too large and had plenty of table and machine games. The restaurants were a little spread out, but the selection was wide.

The suite of course had a awesome view on the 67th floor and we enjoyed it on a huge wrap around balcony despite the wind telling us to eff off. 

The inside itself was quite nice. It felt like a nice house (and originally supposed to be condos) since we had a little kitchen area and a small dining table along with a living room area separate from the bedroom. I think the bedroom overlooking in the bathroom is cute, but fair warning to not share a room with someone you will freak to see you nekkid in the shower. If you're in for a long stay- you have a washer and dryer. If you actually plan to use the kitchen you should ask for pots and utensils, etc when you check in. They don't keep any in the drawers, which I think they should since why have a kitchen that can't actually be used? 

We had to ask for certain things to be brought up including stupid shit like a deck of cards and the service came up pretty prompt. 

On a important note, plan well who has keys. You cannot get up to your floor without swiping your key and then it can only access the floor of that room and not all the floors.  So if you're planning also on meeting some of your friends that are getting ready in their room- you cannot show up and knock on their door. Someone has to go get you. 

I think this would be a good place to stay if you want to do CityCenter.  I like this much better than the Aria and the Vdara in terms of room ambiance and space.",2,2,4

And, for some reason my memory has no sheets on the mattress, Yes, Cosmopolitan was worse than that. Less than 24 hours there and a disaster of a stay.

After some time at the Trump International we decided to check out Cosmopolitan. Trump was becoming too relaxing and we were feeling like we needed more of a night life and a few more restaurant choices. Judging by the commercials it was beautiful and everyone was glamorous and happy.

We pulled into the valet and dropped off our bags with the attendant since there wasn't a bellman available - hmmmmm. Lately, check in times have been at 3pm - 1. This is because they have no house keeping, 2. because they want you to roam the casino and spend money gambling, eating, and drinking, extremely irritating! We got there at 1pm, knowing that they could add us to the queue for a room and we would just grab a drink and something to eat while waiting.

The front desk took down our cell number, verified the number and promised to call us back at 3pm. Well; it was 315 and no phone call. Annoyed, we walked back across the casino and waited in line for someone at front desk. By the way, as we were walking still no phone call.

The guy at front desk was very friendly, but it took more time to put us in a room. After he typed away for some time he issued us $150 room and beverage credit. That was nice of them.

Prior to departing the front desk we asked for them to send up our bags. We got to our room about 4:00, waited 15 min for our bags, called and complained. We finally got them 45 minutes later. Ahhh, glad that's over. Now time to start our vacation!

What's a little speed bump, just about to relax at 5pm and embark on our obsession with in-room movies when disaster strikes! You guessed it, unable to order in-room movies! Thank God the phone works so that we can call and complain about everything! Turns out they never checked us into the room completely. Since no one could solve the problem the manager got on the phone. With a flip of a switch, problem solved, turns out we have seen all the movies anyway. Ugh! Finally time for a quick nap before dinner. 

I was super excited that this beautiful room was not only equipped with a full kitchen, but also a washer and dryer. I desperately needed to get the wrinkles out of my top, so I decided to ghetto iron my shirt by throwing a damp cloth in the dryer with my top. Who needs the steamy, right? Immediately after doing so I realized that I threw them into the washer instead of the dryer, no problem I thought. Wrong! This washer absolutely refused to open. I'm pretty even tempered, but by this time I wanted to find a blunt object and bash in the washer! Frustrated, and having less than an hour to get ready, I got on the phone again. The front desk representative told me that the washer door would not open unless I run a cycle. Ugh, that wasn't gonna happen! So, she told me engineering will be up ASAP to open it. 15 min later and no engineering and let me tell you, I wasn't surprised! I called again, another 15 min passes still no engineering. Again, 15 min later still no engineering! I was going to have to take this into my own hands, meaning we Googled it and found the user manual. I guess this means I am an engineer. 

Flustered, I threw on my top and we headed out to meet our friends at Milos, the Greek restaurant located on the property. None of us knew how to get there and the nonexistent hotel staff and security wasn't making it any easier. There is a God, the service and the food was excellent. We will definitely be going back to Milos. After over stuffing ourselves we headed to the closest bar and had a couple drinks. We would have loved to stay a bit longer, but our food coma was slowly killing us. We couldn't wait to crawl into bed and crash. Massively Bloated ;) and sleepy we made it down the 300 degree hallway, only to find that our damn key cards didn't work! SERIOUSLY! By now I have reached my breaking point. Oh, should I say ""boiling point"" since the hallway is easily over 80 degrees. With that said, I stared down the endless hallway, took a deep breath of the humid hallway air, and embarked on the Bataan death march to the front desk. Shockingly one person was working the front desk and there was a line, we are talking DMV dejavu

This may come as a bit of a shock, but the next morning decided to check out, just had enough. I mean, what's next! Is the roof going to cave in on us! Even checking out the next morning was a 30 minute disaster on the phone trying to figure out how to apply the two credits we were given....

The casino is very stylish and clean, but offers nothing to gamblers. This is the wrong hotel for business conferences. 

Notes:

At checkin the hotel did not have the room configuration we requested. 

I don't want a floor to ceiling window into my shower

I like to have a dresser to store my clothes

A small refrigerator was expected 

The room was not cleaned on 1 day; on the same day clean towels were requested; 4 phone calls and 5 hours later they were delivered.

The TV configuration prevented a Roku streaming device from being used. Tech support was requested multiple times, due to a wait time of multiple hours for service they were not able to service our request.

Twice I had to side step vomit in the lobby.

Twice I had to decline the generous offers of prostitutes working in the lobby.

The casino did not have a poker room.

The casino preferred to close tables rather than lower the minimum bet.

The casino floor was small.

There were very few blackjack tables that paid 3 to 2 on blackjack; most paid 6 to 5.

All of the restaurants were very good; no complaints. The grilled octopus at DOCG was worth a second visit. 

The pool on the 14th floor was not large enough for the number of hotel guest trying to use it.

The pool on the 4th floor was used primarily by non guest of the hotel that came for the club scene.

At 5 am the party moved from the night club into the room next door.",8,5,2

The bathroom has a separate powder room from the wash basins and a fairly good size shower.

My only complaint was that the shower didn't drain well.  They certainly need to update the plumbing or snake the drainage area.  

This hotel is hip and extremely popular with young adults who love clubbing.  The club is constantly packed and the area around has numerous eateries and restaurants that are, of course, full of people.  Make a note to try Secret Pizza if you can get it.  There is always a very long line.",9,8,8

We had decided on valet parking due to the fact that it still is FREE (gotta take advantage, before they start charging) Gentlemen in valet area was super nice, asked where we were heading to and gave directions without me even having to ask for it. Thats great sevice! 

As we walked in the front area it was very attractive and eye-catching. We headed up the escalator to the boulevard pool area where the ice rink is located. 

Pretty busy evening but took notice right away of bar area for food and drinks, fire pits (available for renting), billiards and foosball area for kids or adults and in far corner skate rentals.

We got in line, and took us about 10 minutes to get to the kiosks to sign waivers for skating. It asks you for adults and kids names that'll be skating. Finally got to the area to pay $10 for locals with ID and $15 for visitors. As we headed to skate pickup, they have an assortment of sizes but i guess they were bombarded with returns and had to close down for about another 10 minutes to put skates away. Why they didnt have more workers assisting? I have no idea. 

Tip: If you have small children or toddlers that will have a hard time skating on their own I would suggest grabbing the blue seal which is used to sit them on top and an experienced skater can push them around. These go fast so get them ASAP when you see it available.

After getting skates and stood in line to enter rink it was pretty crowded. The rink had alot of people skating, experienced and un-experienced. Highly suggest being very careful they do not have any workers assisting in there and alot of skaters are pretty dangerous.

We took a little break and headed to bar area, grabbed me a draft beer (Stella $8), churros with chocolate dipping sauce $10, and french fries $7. Total about $25 w\/ $5 tip for bartender. Good thing is they have a water station so no need to buy. 

Tip: If you want a fire pit area it has to be rented ahead of time online.

Last, my debit card had fraud and I had only used it twice in Cosmopolitan, so I feel there was some unsafe charge which compromised my card.

Check in took 30 minutes, reception very pleasant & upon learning we were locals gave us a great view from the 45 th floor. Elevators open and upon walking down the hallway, it smelled of vomit. Okay, maybe just happened. Smell never went away. Room gorgeous view of Bellagio fountains. Everything controlled by TV, very high tech, except when both remotes need batteries. Shouldn't that be part of the daily check list? Just sayin. Okay, to find a bamboo, pool very crowded, so we head for the pool on the 17 th floor, before we get there run into a young couple who says that's more crowded and the music is so loud it's unbearable.This from a couple in their 20's. So, we head for the Boulevard Pool, long walk through the conference room area, strange. A nice emloyee tells us a short cut, we get close and are told it's closed to prepare for a concert. Okay, we talk to some folks who say the Bamboo pool is emptying so we decide to go there. We find two lounges for the 3 of us and 2 of us head for the pool. To say it was filthy was an understatement. We could see the bottom of the pool at the Bellagio from the 45 th floor but could not see our feet in this pool! When did it become OK to smoke in a pool and flick your ashes in it? Exit stage left and to take a shower. Gross does not cover it. We went to Mandalay Bay for a show and luckily took a cab. Both cab drivers said getting in & out of this property is a nightmare, in fact on the way back, he let us out a block away or it would have taken 30 minutes just to turn in. Monday talked to a friend who went to the concert and took him 2 hours to exit the parking garage. Positive side STK restaurant was great even though they took away my drink before I was finished.

Not the 'phony smile because we want a tip' service, but genuinely happy employees that make you feel like the money you spend there is worth it. They have solid rewards program- I think it's 5% of purchases. We got an upgrade and a room with a north view, which means a view of the Bellagio fountain and the mountains. The rooms are contemporary with ultra sleek interior design features. The bathroom is nothing less than perfect- huge jet tub and bench in the rain shower.

As other reviews have mentioned, this hotel IS swanky. The furnishings are nothing but chic, the chandeliers are massive, the bedding is lovely, the bathrooms are brand new and furnished with nice shampoos, conditioners, lotions, etc. As for the hotel itself, I was definitely impressed. 

As for the customer service...well, that's another story. You'd expect a premium 5 star hotel on the Vegas strip to offer nothing but the best in customer service and satisfaction. Unfortunately, the service was not up to my expectations when it comes to a 5 star hotel. 

When I checked in with my boyfriend for a 3 night stay, we were informed that the hotel has a DEPOSIT of $150\/night. Seriously? I understand that a deposit is necessary, and many hotels have a deposit requirement, but $150 per night is a bit excessive. We told the front desk clerk that we had a late flight out. She told us to just call downstairs and request a late check out, and that it shouldn't be a problem.

The morning of our departure, we called downstairs to request a late check out. We were informed that any check out after 12:00 noon would be charged for a half-day's rate. What? This was not communicated to us on check in. What seemed like it wouldn't be a big deal was clearly an issue for the hotel. After attempting to negotiate, we were able to get a 1:00 check out. A whole 2 hours? Gee, thanks. The icing on the cake was when a hotel employee knocked on our door at around 11:30 and told us that we were late checking out. After calling the customer service number and complaining about her treating us like children, we did not receive any sort of solution other than an apology.

CASINO
Bring your ID! They card everyone and even if you just want to watch they will card you. 

ROOMS
Only been to some suites for pregames but these looked amazing and the view was just lovely. They are pricy though from what I believe. 

MARQUEE 
Marquee is fun but always super busy and not very big. The poolparties there are also good, not epic. 

BAMBOO POOL
Chill pool, amazing for hangovers. Lol. 

FOOD
I got some secret pizza 2 nights in a row. Best food for after club hours! Do expect to wait for a little bit.",1,1,1

Room: It was very nice, clean, well-decorated. The bathroom had a shower door that can be seen from the bedroom also. You are able to control the room from the TV remote as well as the high-tech telephone.

There was a balcony, but we could not find the door to access it.
The hotel itself is very classy. 

Would I stay here again? Yes, when I can afford it [When I have a decent income or if I can get 9-14 other people to split a suite with me] I mean dam, $175+ for a room on a Monday night? You can get a nice suite at many other hotels for $100",5,0,0

We loved Milo's, Jaleo, China Poblano and STK however last time we were there my boyfriend and I were having a drink in the Vesper bar and a raunchy waitress thought it was appropriate to spread her legs to my boyfriend (I suppose she was hard up for tips; there's always a young crowd there). We left the Vespar bar and went back to our room; I called the front desk and left a message for the Vespar bar manager to call me. Shortly there after we were sitting on our balcony drinking wine and 4 security guards came into our room without knocking.  Apparently whomever I spoke with at the front desk said I had threatened the raunchy waitress...security was rude, forceful, tried to keep my ID and kicked me out (literally escorted me out like I was a criminal) but said my boyfriend could stay! We of course both left and went to the Belliggo which was 100 times better but it's a shame that their staff is allowed to treat people that way!  We actually paid the bill with all the points we had built up because we had spent so much money there!

I decided to book the larger suite type room with a Japanese soaking tub.  The room itself was large with multiple flat screen televisions that were very nice.  The room had a large couch with a giant walk in closet.  It also had a nice desk with another television above that.  The mini fridge was obviously packed with the finest overpriced items you might ever need.  There was a standing shower with a great shower head and ample space for two throughout the room.

The soaking tub was a real pain in the ass to use.  I think it took me at least one solid 40oz to fill up and by then i was tired of standing by the window waiting.  The view from the 67th floor was great even though I was in the back tower facing the Aria and not the strip.  I could still hear the party going wild at night.  The DJ was definitely laying it down that night.  I couldn't believe they wouldn't let me in with my teva sandals.  

The hotel itself is ultra chic with that kick ass chandelier and plenty of bars for every type.  I still remember heading down to the sports bar in my Mavs jersey talking trash to some jack wagon who was a warrior fan.  I'm like really Dirk just dropped 40 points and your still trying to tell me he's soft.  You sir are total idiot and should take yourself immediately away from here.

Unlike any other hotel resort on the Strip, the Cosmopolitan radiates with absolute class.  Even going to the parking garage you are in awe with the beauty in the simplicity of the mirrored ""COSMOPOLITAN"" name scrolled against the wall.  Can we say ""wow""?  Then when you get below to the parking garage you see all the beautiful art on the walls and then notice red and green lights down the rows to let you know what space is available for parking.  Can we say ""technology""?

Then! When you stroll through the lobby you are mesmerized by the artistic columns that has a very modern feel to it.  Can we say ""sophisticated""?  And then bam, there's the bar, right in the lobby. Too chic, too chic.

By far my favorite hotel on the Strip and a place that I recommend for everyone to visit. Anyone who's anyone goes to the Cosmopolitan-- know this now so you don't feel left out.  Just don't go there in sweats and Uggs, you're not doing yourself justice in this hotel if you do.  Put on your Vegas best people! Hip, hot and happening---that's what this is, that's what you are...so get on up! Inside the Cosmopolitan!

The Wicked Spoon had fair reviews but their brunch was more than satisfying. I never bother with buffets but this was the best one yet. On another note I never bother with snow crab legs, it's just too much work for too little meat...but the wicked spoon cuts them down the middle so it makes it worth it.

My friend and I were groped by some pathetic guy while walking through the lobby on NYE two years ago. I was asked by the bouncers whether I wanted to press charges and I said yes, of course. They brought my husband and I to a back room and, after interrogating me a bit (nice, right?), they told us it would take ""four hours"" for the police to get there to file a report and we could wait, or just let it go. We saw them treat a girl who was by herself even worse while we were back there - I wonder what terrible thing she had been through.

From that time I vowed to never set foot in that hotel again. If that's how they treat a woman who's groped, imagine if something worse happened?

The hotel itself is absolutely stunning! And our City Suite? To die for! Making the reservation was super easy and the communication was great. I requested early check-in and they gave it to us. 

 When my Matron of Honor called to get some help for their concierge; they were very helpful and gave us many suggestions. 
 We went to one of their 4 pools. This is where the service went a bit sour. The gentlemen that greet you, weren't helpful at all. We were barley greeted and didn't know where to go. Apparently you had to pay to sit somewhere; which we were not told. Finally, after walking around and looking dumb, we went back to the guys and they finally explained what we had to do. Great...thank you for letting us know NOW! And not when we first walked in...

 The pool is STUNNING! The bartenders...suck. I've been a bartender and server for a long time and it was THE WORST customer service I've ever had. My group contained 7 (very attractive) girls and it was impossible to get a drink...wasn't even busy. The bartender was complaining to us that he didn't want to be there and kept talking about how he wanted to leave to bet on the game and go to the gym. Not what we, your customers, want to hear buddy. You sound like a tool. He also made fun (and not even in a witty, playful manner) of our Chicago sports teams (where we are from). 

 We bought SO many drinks from them, rounds of shots...and didn't get a free drink at all!! Come on! I'm the bride! I take care of you, you take care of me. Nope. He could care less. He just wanted to get out of there. The pool could have gotten SO much for business from us, had they friendlier bartenders. 

  We went to STK for dinner which was fabulous. Complete opposite experience from the pool. The hostesses were sweet and professional. Our server was fantastic and so on top of it. We were in a rush to go catch a show, and he completely took care of us. The food was SO good!

The casino is nice...but the management and some of their employees are really rude. One of their employees actually said something inappropriate and rude about me. Myself and the girls I were with were absolutely shocked and went to go talk to the manager. He also, just as rude. He was not taking us seriously. Very disappointed in the casino.

All in all, I do like this hotel. It's gorgeous and the front desk staff is great. I would NOT use their pool or their casino. I'd go somewhere else =)

     I just returned from a weekend at the Cosmo.I was there for a conference, so there is a lot to do with the hotel that I can't even comment on at all. I thought the suite was great, although not my style, who cares? It was a weekend, and I expect that in Vegas. The suite was enormous. The bed comfy. The mini bar, already depleted when I got in the room (and then the charge was on my bill...but removed when pointed out). The shower\/tub\/window view, etc was pretty cool. No serious problems with temp. There were definitely dirty areas of the room, which is disgusting. When I'm forking out $660 for two nights, I don't want to find hairs, thick dust and filth all over the sliding doors hampering my view of Vegas. Definitely creepy feeling. Only cleaned out one sink the second day. Cleaning staff is definitely the most lacking. 
      The view of the Bellagio fountains was great...and just how spacious the balcony was. I ordered room service one night, and it was relatively quick, decent tasting, and the server who delivered was quite friendly. The staff in general didn't seek you out to check on you, but if you approached them with questions, etc, they were all very friendly and helpful. Tip: much fresher and more economical drinks in Vitals - the 24 hour store near checkin. Maybe even more variety of food and snacks would be great.
     Oh yeah, also, the second TV in my suite didn't work. It made obnoxiously loud sounds and just wouldn't ever correct itself. No remote for that tv either. Restaurant selection was lacking, they really need to offer something more basic and\/or casual. let's see. i had three or four screwdrivers throughout the weekend and they were all slightly different than each other. Only one was truly orange, which is frightening really. I chose a screwdriver because I thought it would be so basic and simple. Ha the screwdriver cost nearly $11, and of course was tiny. The hotel felt like a meat market, at least at night. but, maybe all of vegas is that way at night? Other positives: quick elevators to all floors and the chandelier bar was beautiful.",0,0,0

Upon checking in the kind gentleman at the front desk placed us in a beautiful Terrace Studio. He provided me with conference information, cracked a few jokes. He was absolutely excellent. Upon entering the room, I was immediately greeted with the sound of music coming from one of the two plasma screen televisions. The sound quality was phenomenal! It immediately set romantic yet sexy vibe.The studio contained a beautiful terrace that ran along the entire width of the room with a comfortable chair covered with cushions and pillow, a cushioned foot rest and a side table. We enjoyed both wine and breakfast on the terrace. The seat easily fit the two of us. The king bed was adorned with an oversized comforter and multiple pillows. At the foot of the bed was an ottoman.  In front of the bed was the plasma screen television from which the music was playing. The living area contained a curved sofa. Another plasma screen television was placed in front of it. A kitchen stocked with a mini fridge, microwave and coffee maker was also present in the room. The bathroom was large. It had both a stand up shower and a small Jacuzzi. Finally there were the most comfortable robe and slippers available for each of us. The staff even let us take them home!

As for the rest of the hotel. 

The entrance was eye catching, there were digital screens displaying moving images of a couple which were erotic but appropriate. It was eye catching, trendy and truly captured the overall feel of  Las Vegas. 

There was a restaurant called The Wicked Spoon. We ordered two meals from this restaurant, breakfast which we ate on the patio and the dinner buffet. The dinner buffet wasn't your run of the mill buffet. Each item was on a a mini plate or bowl rather than in large trays which were  turned over often. Being overly aware of the microbiology that can present itself at buffets, I enjoyed this quality. The food was excellent all around. The flavors were great, the options were numerous and everything was beautiful presented. 

The gym was also great. Although I had to wait for machines likely because of the time that I went, I still cannot complain. The equipment was clean, the staff courteous and towels and water were available. 

The chandelier, a beautiful bar downstairs and the casino downstairs were quite. I cannot comment on the quality of the bar as I did not attend it. But it looked like people were enjoying it. The casino was smaller than those present at most of the larger hotels, however, I did have some fun with the roulette machine. Tables were minimum 20 and people looked like they were  enjoying themselves. The Marquee is the club at this hotel. The bouncers really over charged males and since I had come with one, I did not make it to this club. However, I've heard good things. 

The conference was well organized. The hotel has a multitude of rooms and ballrooms for the purposes of group events. The refreshments provided were wonderful.

As for price I booked a vacation package so I got a great deal. About 1000 for 3 nights + flight from Virginia to Las Vegas for the two of us. Considering that getting a flight alone was about 450, its like we got three nights at this beautiful hotel for 100 dollars total. I thought it was quite the steal. 

In summary, this hotel is beyond phenomenal. I thoroughly enjoyed it in its entirety. From its artistic displays, delicious dining options, bars, casino, luxurious rooms to its excellent customer service, this hotel is the place to stay on the Las Vegas Strip. I strongly recommend it to all.",1,0,1

It's always been over my comfortable price range considering we like to stay in Vegas for 4-5 days usually.  At $300\/night that's a big expense for most.  However during this summer we got a 3 nights for 2 at already reduced prices so I went for it.

Overall I'm glad I stayed here and would stay again.  It is very expensive.  This is a top-tier hotel on the Strip no doubt.  With Marquee dayclub & nightclub, fantastic restaurants, beautiful people and architecture, and a breathtaking view off any balcony suite - it ranks next to Encore as my favorite place to stay.

People say why spend money on a room when you're only going to be in it for a few hours to sleep.  I disagree.  We want it to be a home away from home.  We want luxurious furnishings, amenities and fixtures with a large double-sinked bathroom and shower big enough for a party.  I'm sad I didn't get to try the jacuzzi tub - I will next time.  For me the balcony is the top draw.  Why other hotels don't have balconies in Vegas is beyond me.  Palms Place locked their balconies which will be the downfall of that hotel.

Make sure you visit the Chandelier bar at least once.  Drinks are pricey so choose wisely.

We also decided to go out to the Boulevard Pool.  Originally we were only staying for an hour or so.  We loved it so much we got a daybed and spent near $300 on margarita pitchers and food.  If you get a bed, remember they automatically add a 21% gratuity to the bill.  Not that bad, but read your receipt before you add another 20% by mistake.

Apparently Marquee attracts the hottest girls of the world.  A group of friends and I just chilled at a bar on the second level and enjoyed the view.  Tho the girls are the hottest thing in the world, doesn't seem like they're willing to give you the time of day, which made me try harder :)

The decor in the hotel, casino, and room was ridiculous (in a good way). The atmosphere and vibe was lively, fun, and exciting. I unfortunately did not get a chance to gamble at the hotel but I did eat at The Wicked Spoon and I can definitely say it is classy and delicious. Staff was friendly. Only downside was requesting anything to the room took quite a long time. We requested extra towels and I think we probably waited a good 1-2 hours before they had arrived. One other small thing that occurred (which was probably my fault), we did not put the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on our door so in the morning my gf and I must have been really knocked out cause we heard no knocking. The next thing I knew, I had heard our door open and it was housekeeping, sort of scary but then again I could have double locked it and put the sign outside. Marquee pool party was insane, everyone should check that out, and Marquee night club was awesome as well. If you want to feel classy then stay at The Cosmopolitan.

i don't recall the last time being in a hotel with so much crystals and chandeliers dangling. Amazing. Makes me want to go gaga-Tarzan and swing through each string of crystal.

Every little detail of this hotel is very modernized from the parking lot (yes, I said the parking lot with the red\/green lights if space is occupied or not) to the furniture. Plus, it's the only hotel in Vegas where I can find a pool table. Even the buildings look like some upscale buildings in downtown NY!

Henry's was awesome too as the bartender took amazing care of us at the bar in front of Henry's!  At Henry's our server was able to just keep adding tables as our party grew bigger and bigger. The tab came out al together which did cause a little confusion I say on our part cause people didn't feel the need to pay for a proper tip. However I server got it al together and stayed calm and at the end, it worked out!
Bell guys where awesome too, each time we needed a lift they where quick to move for us and get us a car!
Room service was sooooooooooo fast and and also awesome.  Every time I left the room and came back in th afternoon, the room was cleaned to perfection'
Check in and Check out was smooth. Even though it was busy the lines moved quickly. And for checkout a guy just came and grabbed room numbers and emailed receipts!
The club was nice too! Got a chance to see Busta perform so that was cool!
Room service was good and prompt, the food could been better. The pizza was very dry one night and the chicken was over cooked and fried so hard the next night.  But it was hot at least!!!

We were told we would get notified via text when the room was available - never happened.  We went to the front desk for a second time to a more helpful person and they gave us a one-bedroom suite - which we were told was an ""upgrade"".  We needed two beds and we were told that we could get a two queen terrace suite the next day.

We asked for the sofa bed to be made that evening around midnight when we would be gone and they confirmed it would be assembled upon our return back to the room.  This was never done, so 2 people had to sleep on an uncomfortable sofa bed.  The next morning I did call to express my disappointment, and they came to make the sofa bed at 12:00 (noon time).  We asked for the two queen terrace suite (we called early around 9 am) and we were met with resistance from the front desk.

The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are nice but a list of problems ended up turning our experience into a most unpleasant one and we will not be staying at this hotel again.

We started by noticing that we had a dirty towel and washcloth in the bathroom.  I don't know if they were dirty or just really stained but either way it was nasty.  Saturday night we put out our food order for breakfast Sunday morning at 8am.  A little after 8am we realized no one was bringing us food and I looked outside our room and notice the order was still hanging on the door and we placed it out early the night before.  We called room service, and after being on hold for several minutes, ordered breakfast which by the time it got to the room was 10am and were very rushed because we had reservations to do other things which is why we wanted breakfast at 8am.  I called to complain but the wait times on the phone were to long.  It didn't matter if we called the front desk or room service we were on hold every time.  If we really needed something and had a lot of time we would call and put the phone on speaker so we could do other things while being on hold.

I sent the letter below to guest relations for both the Cosmopolitan and Marquee over a month ago and received no response. This club is dangerous, unethical, and unsafe. Furthermore, they seem to only care for patrons who are straight. It's 2015, this behavior is unacceptable. 

Dear Management,

I am writing to you today in regards to an incident that occurred at the Marquee nightclub, located in your hotel. On the night of 10\/17\/2015, I entered Marquee with my male cousin and a female friend. 

A group of female friends of mine were celebrating a bachelorette party and had purchased a table for the night. I was invited by the group to come by the table and celebrate with them.

Upon entering the table area, located to the left of the DJ booth, a security guard immediately grabbed my cousin and I and pulled us out of the area forcefully. Due to his actions, I almost fell over and bumped into one of my female friends. 

The security guard then told us that this was a table reserved only for women and we had to leave. After informing him that the table was paid for by my friends and they had personally invited me, he continued to push us violently away from the table. 

This action was shocking and upsetting to me and the women at the table. The security guards actions were aggressive and inappropriate and he had no right to violently touch me and my cousin. The entire party found this action unprofessional, sexist, and incredibly dangerous to our safety as patrons of your establishment. 

I know certain nightclubs in the Las Vegas area grant free admission to women in hopes of enticing male patrons. Some staff may have seen two men near a female group and thought that they were a ""threat"" to business. However, as a gay man I also find this behavior sexist and homophobic. 

I would like to speak to whomever is in charge of safety and\/or guest services so we may resolve this matter. What should have been a memorable night for all those involved turned into an upsetting event. My friends and I are apprehensive about frequenting your hotel as we are concerned for our safety due to this event. 

We are planning to be in Las Vegas from 11\/20-11\/22 to celebrate another bachelorette party. I hope your establishment can convince us that you welcome all patrons regardless of gender or sexual orientation. If you would like to speak to another witness of this event, I'd be happy to provide you with their contact information.",4,2,0

After leaving the Marquee nightclub and heading to another venue, I stopped to tie my shoe, but during this time, two guys walked passed me and grabbed my cellphone out of my back pocket and ran off with it. I caught up with these individuals and after retrieving my stolen property, the guy began to become violent and very threatening. So I located the nearest security guard\/guards and informed them about the situation, what had transpired and that I wanted to press charges. Apparently, the security guard who was taking my statement was not trained on the proper protocol when a crime takes place at any type of resort and instead of detaining the thieves until the cops arrived, he allowed the criminals to leave the property with no type of repercussions. Enabling these individuals to threaten and rob other patrons of the resort and surrounding ones as well. After I realized they had let them leave on their own, I insisted to speak to the manner about this, which his response was (because his colleague made the statement to him ""that he royally messed up by letting the guys leave) that I was trespassing and had me and my friends escorted off the property. Mind you I was staying at a studio suite for 3 night which cost me over 1200.00 but Im the one that was escorted off the property by numerous of security guards because my safety was at risk. SO YOU MAY WANT TO THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU THINK ABOUT RESERVING A ROOM OR EVEN VISITING THIS VENUE ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE VALUABLES OR SMALL CHILDREN. GIVEN MY RECENT EXPERIENCE THE ENTIRE SECURITY TEAM IS NOT TRAINED TO PROTECT THEIR HOTEL GUEST AND ARE STUBBORN TO CONTEST TO THE FACT THEY ARE WRONG WHEN A MISTAKE HAS BEEN MADE. I frequent Vegas at least once a month, and for the most part we always stay at the Cosmopolitan because of its location and nightlife. But ask yourself this, is one's safety really worth a good club? No!!! There are too many new, inviting and safe hotels around and on the Vegas strip.",0,1,0

Though I have not stayed at the hotel, I have been on the casino floor many times, have seen a concert there, and have eaten at Wicked Spoon, so this review is about the hotel as a casino and not about the rooms. 

The vibe in the hotel is definitely younger and hipper than a lot of other hotels on the Strip. This also means that there is a much higher number drunks to deal with. Nowhere else is this more evident than in the public men's rooms where one constantly watch his step avoid stepping in vomit, urine, or feces that has been kindly placed on the floor and not in the toilet. The bathrooms at the Cosmo are consistently some of the filthiest I encounter in Vegas. I understand that customers can be pigs, but there should be janitors to clean them up. In other hotels, there is almost always someone cleaning the bathrooms, but I cannot recall ever seeing them cleaned at the Cosmo. 

Chelsea was a decent concert venue, though security had no idea where to send  people. One person would send us in one direction, and then other security would yell at us for being there. There was a lack of training and\/or communication. 

The Wicked Spoon was very disappointing, but you can see my separate review for the details.

Staff was relatively friendly, though the person checking us in may have downgraded our room a bit when we weren't willing to pay a cool $60 extra a night for a room facing the strip. We got a lovely view of Aria's parking lot for our stay, haha. 

In regards to our room...perhaps my mind in the wrong place, but why is there a clear floor to ceiling window in the shower looking into the bedroom? Why is there wall to wall mirroring throughout the room? And are you sure that wallpaper is of dancers? The questions in my mind were a bit hilarious, if not immature. The beds were definitely comfortable though. 

All in all, the Cosmopolitan is definite a chic place to stay in Vegas. It definitely seems to be catered to a younger crowd though.

* The hotel and rooms have been maintained very well and has aged well. You can always tell how well a hotel is kept by the number of scuffs on the furniture and walls or stained grouts in the. 

* The choices of restaurants are not much and they are pricey but we usually eat out anyway. The buffet is much better during lunch and dinner but not so during breakfast.

* Hotel staff are fantastic! From the valet to room service to their casino hosts, they're all very friendly no matter what time of the day. One small detail that I really like is that you're greeted by the front desk in person where you stand in line instead of waved over to their desk like most hotels.

* The casino is smaller than most, but the dealers and cocktail waitresses are friendly and responsive. It will not overwhelm you with acres of  slots and tables.

* This hotel is pre-friendly! We've been bringing our dogs here on vacations so it's convenient not to have to get a separate pet hotel.

***TIP*** If you play at their casino, make sure to ask for the casino host and introduce yourself. They may be able to help comp some of your room expenses and help with future accommodations.

I gave this hotel 5 stars because it is a nicely packaged Las Vegas hotel. However, it is not a family oriented place. There is much room where kids can roam around, but then again we only stay here for their hotel room accommodations and friendly staff, which I am rating 5 stars.

Sure it's got a big mall at the beginning filled with a chandelier looking bar, and maybe the restaurants around it sound nice, like Holstein's Shakes and Buns.

+
I rented a Terrace Studio with a friend - two queen beds, tub and shower, kitchenette (microwave, sink)  and living room area. Outside Terrace with great view. Good wifi. On paper the best ever. But not enough drawer space, and while elegant, completely lacking in charm. After Day 1 my friend moved to the Paris where he got a deal on a Premier Red Room (upgraded with a view) which while not as luxurious, and no terrace or microwave, had more charm (and the Paris is not nearly as nice or cool hotel as Cosmo). The Cosmo is the most happening hotel in Vegas - always packed with beautiful young things, and the bars are elegant. Secret Pizza is good (like an average NY pizzeria), China Poblano is awesome, and the buffet is good but not great. For big shots there are good odds Video Poker machines in the high limit room, and if you avoid the 6:5 blackjack there are reasonable BJ games.  

As an older happily married man I prefer the Encore or Vdara. The Mandarin is even nicer but too expensive. But I will probably go back to the Cosmo if they make me a good offer - there is nothing major to complain about...",0,0,0

Valet is complimentary and quick - you scan your ticket and the car arrives in minutes. Upon check in, we mentioned that we had requested a room with a view of the Bellagio fountains. We were told there's an additional fee (a big one) because those are the most requested rooms. Would've been nice to know that before we arrived. 

We prepaid our first night of the room in full, and only had one more night that would be charged upon check out. I checked in with my sister, and our friend (who booked the room) wasn't there yet, though she put our names on the reservation. They asked my sister to put down a credit card for incidentals, and said once our friend arrived they would switch it to her card.  Knowing we wouldn't have any charges, my sister put down her debit card. When our friend arrived, she switched the room to her card. The next day my sister had a $600 ""hold"" on her card (for a debit, that essentially means the money is taken from the account). We went back to the hotel to resolve it. Not only had they put a hold on her card for the second night (and we weren't even checking out until the next day), but they added $300 hold for incidentals. Apparently, it's policy for them to hold $150\/day, but when we checked in they NEVER told us. 

We spoke with a woman up front who took care of it, though she said the charges might take days to be reimbursed. We asked for the manager so that we could provide feedback. We had no problem with the holds for incidentals (I mean, this is Vegas, I can only imagine what people do to those rooms). But you HAVE to tell people, you can't just charge their cards. The manager was apologetic and said they would be sure to work with their employees on training. She then offered to buy us a round of drinks and put a $100 credit on our room. We thought that was very generous and thanked her. Also, even though we prepaid for one night ""in full"", it didn't include their $30\/day resort fees. I really wish there was an option to decline resort amenities. The pool was CLOSED, we didn't want to use the spa... I mean, they could easily deny access through our room keys if we opted out of using them. But alas, another extra charge after the fact.

The lobby is quite a sight when you walk in. There are enormous columns with built-in screens that are constantly changing. Unfortunately, the scene can be chaotic. And they absolutely need a designated check OUT line. That process is so much quicker than check in. Just beyond the lobby is the more casual bar. They had a decent amount of seating and the drink prices weren't totally obscene. It was a great place to drink before going out. 

There are two wings with guest rooms, and just off the lobby is the West Tower, where we were staying on the 33rd floor. There are two separate elevator banks depending on your floor number which was great and makes it much quicker. Our view from the room was lame, facing a hotel on the south side with zero views of the Strip. For $250 a night, I was very disappointed. The room itself was nice with two queen beds. The bathroom is designed for couples, not groups. The shower has a window looking in to the bedroom (and the window shade it on the OUTSIDE). The toilet is essentially a stall with a door that doesn't lock and doesn't go floor-to-ceiling. There is a sliding door to shut the entire bathroom, but I don't understand why they couldn't make the toilet stall more private.

The beds were very comfy to me. My sister and friend found them a little too soft but I like it that way. At the front door, there are Hello\/Goodbye buttons that will turn all the lights on\/off which is easier than turning everything off individually. We wanted to store leftover food in the mini fridge but it was completely stocked so it was pretty much useless to us. The complimentary toiletries were crap. Usually nice resorts have high end toiletries so I was very surprised to find they were complete junk. 

Back downstairs, past the first bar you get to the casino, the chandelier bar, and the East Tower. It's a long walk in heels. The second floor has the buffet (which I didn't try because it was $40 for breakfast). It also leads to the shopping area and another restaurant, Holstein's. We had a delicious lunch there (free salt & vinegar popcorn, buffalo chicken dip, hamburgers and fries, and my sister tried the Smore shake). 

We didn't visit the casino other than walking through it. The entire hotel allows smoking EXCEPT the guest rooms. So if you want a smoking room, you have to pay more for a balcony. 

Overall, it was a fun experience with a couple hitches that they resolved. Staff was generally nice and helpful, access to the Strip is fantastic. Lots of food and drinks so you never have to leave! I had fun, but I might try another hotel next time to switch it up.",2,0,0

I've stayed at numerous hotels in the city, including NYNY, MGM, The Hotel, Caesar's, Venetian, Flamingo's, off the strip and Mandalay Bay. This is the first time that I can't wait to say ""I'll be back"". The customer service and interaction was far and above the most exceptional ever experienced. In fact, we became so spoiled by the exceptional service that it was noticeable when individuals fell short.

I want to start with a few of my favorite individuals, and why we'll be back:
1. Mervin - you have got to promote this incredible former Marine. He was our first impression, and made it a win right from the start. Mervin was polite, caring and unbelievably professional while also setting us up with the most amazing experience. He helped upgrade us into a gorgeous Terrace suite to help celebrate my partners birthday weekend. To say Mervin basically made our weekend is an understatement. Hope we see him on our next trip!

2. Our server the first night at The Henry (10\/27 late night) - I'm sorry I missed your name, but you rocked! You were always there if we needed anything, and helpful with recommendations.

3. Travis - big thanks go out the concierge who helped us understand the best places in the city for nightclubs, even wen that wasn't in the hotel. I really appreciated the honesty, and he helped out with understanding access to the Marquee if we did not want to leave the hotel. For note - it's 2 hotel guests free per room, but you have to get there early enough as they limit access if the club is full.

4. Matthew from Rose.Rabbit.Lie - thank you for making a crazy scenario at the end of the night entertaining! And so sorry you had to go through that, it's too bad the management and fellow bartenders did not realize the impact one customer (no matter how much she spends) is having on others. I appreciate that you didn't roll over for her insanity and actually took our request seriously. 

The few concerns I had were fortunately isolated instances within good service. Justin - the point of contact for booking tables at the Marquee who completely lost our future business from his total lack of customer service and unprofessional attitude. The bartender and manager at Rose.Rabbit.Lie who allowed a drunken customer to become racially aggressive because she came in often and spent a lot of money.

Vegas is all about the flash, the crazy design, casinos, food and drinking until you fall over. Many places can claim bits of these elements, but not all offer the customer experience that makes you want to go back for more. Thank you Cosmopolitan for rising above the rest. We'll see you next year.",2,2,1

First of all the rooms are amazing. I got a killer deal on this hotel room for 3 nights. I booked with LasVegas.com & ended up paying about 540$ total for the city view room with 2 full beds. The room had modern decor but not over the top. The beds were extremely comfortable. Not a fan of the feather pillows, mostly used a long somewhat skinny decor pillow since it was the most comfortable one in the room. Our room over looked the Bamboo Pool & We could see the beautiful Aria hotel and some of the city lights. Loved that. The bathroom was very nice, huge mirror, marble counters, floors, marble shower. Oh THE shower. 

The shower is open to the sink area of the bathroom, it's a clear glass door facing the ""toilet room"" which is separated from the bathroom by a foggy glass door. The shower also has a clear glass window from top to bottom into the actual room facing both beds and the window to the city. It has an interesting design of blinds on the OUTSIDE of the window that faces both beds. Only the people on the outside can control it while you're in the shower minding your own business. My husband sure got a kick out of that while our male room mate was showering. And of course, when I was showering. It was definitely the hit of the room.

The touchscreen phone next to the bed controls everything in the room from the tv to the lights. Thought that was pretty cool.

All of the girls in this hotel look like expensive models. That wasn't a bad thing. :) 

Extremely helpful and friendly staff. We ordered room service one night when we got home super late from the club. A hamburger and 2 bottles of water. When we checked out, we found out that cost us $50. I wouldn't recommend it. The food wasn't anything worth $50, but hey it was delivered to us..

We went to check out the boulevard pool but it was shaded in the afternoon so we went back to the bamboo pool, which seemed to be shaded by a big hotel for a couple of hours maybe between 1-3? We spent a lot of time at the Bamboo pool. It was very relaxing, could have done without the few kids running around playing but oh well. We ordered a raspberry drink a few times from the bar, not sure of the name but the bartender(good looking dude at the bar with the tatt's and the faux hawk) said he made it up and we'd like it. We did. Delicious. We also ordered food, steak quesadillas & hamburger sliders. The quesadillas were delicious, the sliders were good, but lacked any sort of sauce. Used some of the guac from the quesadillas on the burgers. Much better. :) 

I also loved the CO Bigelow products they supply you with in the bathroom!",0,0,0

Since C first opened its doors, it immediately became our favorite place to stay. But, it seems as though every time we go back which is quite often,  the level of service and cleanliness shrinks. 

Hotel décor-one of the most beautiful hotels in Vegas. A girl can dream that her house one day will look like the chandelier bar lounge that Cosmo has. 

Rooms-any room you get, it's guaranteed that it will be nice and the view will be spectacular. However, my review will solely be based on housekeeping and cleanliness of the rooms based on the LAST couple of times we have been there and most recent Labor Day 2013.
* Sheet and pillow had blood stain on it and smelled horrific
* Used condom on the floor 
* Glass had lipstick stains
* Comforter had a black shoe print on it as if someone walked on the bed with their shoes. How housekeeping missed this is besides me!
* Towels had ""yellow"" stain on them


After reading other reviews, I agree with some people as far as this hotel catering to more of the younger crowd and maybe wanting to show an image that people ""party"" at Cosmo but dude c'mon the above is nothing more than ridiculous and plain NASTYYYYYYYY. 

For a place that is overpriced on EVERYTHING such as food, rooms, spa, water, and chances of you winning gambling at this small casino is RARE, you would think everything would be up to par especially housekeeping. NOPE!!!! Done!",8,2,0

Great spot on the strip, with Miracle Mile shops across the street (Good for stocking up on snacks\/food @ ABC Store).  The rooms are very modern and trendy and, while the entertainment area is fairly small, the nightlife is upscale and busy!

Many of the rooms can also give you a direct view overlooking the strip and the fountain show at the Bellagio!  Fantastic view!

I had left a new laptop in the room as well, and the hotel did a fantastic job at getting it back to me.  Service staff had turned it into security within 30 minutes of me checking out and they had a great system in place to approve & mail the equipment back to me via USPS.

And even with that point of reference, time ceased to exist; as did regular sleep and nourishment. You find yourself in a neon haze surround by 4-inch heels and a plethora of douche. This level of exposure is really only recommended for the professional... or the insane... or perhaps Justin Beiber. My time in Vegas was something akin to Jesus's 40 days and nights. Was I tested? Yes. Was I enlightened? Only my pocketbook. Would I have rather endured this trial anywhere else? No. Cosmo is the place to be on the Strip. Until next week, when something shinier comes along. 

The rooms are alright, 3\/5. I had a mere City Room. Though I faced exposure to a Terrace Room and a Two Bedroom Suite. None of which knocked my socks off. But you don't really come to Vegas for the rooms do you? Not unless you are my mom. And then it's all about the rooms and nickel slots. 

Comso is aout the scene, 5\/5. And from a technical standpoint, the layout is quite refreshing. It is linear and provokes a casual and meander to and fro two definitive points of access--not this circular, ""Wait where am I?"" thing every other casino in Vegas has. 

And then there's food: I ate at 8\/14 restaurants during my stay. Yes, I lived here. All have the Vegas prim$um attached. So beware, but that is to be expected. The standouts for me were: Holstiens and Jaleo. 

So indulge dear friends! Get meta and have a cosmo in Cosmo. I dare you. Your head may explode... But only temporally?

We parked in their garage and red\/green lights tell you which spots are open. Crazy awesome.  The lobby is gorgeous with giant pillars that are screens.  They must be 15 feet high at least.  The Chandelier Bar which covers three floors is beautiful with it's draped beading.  It does not have a large casino like you see at the MGM or Bellagio.  The casino isn't the reason you go to the Cosmopolitan.  The atmosphere is the reason you go.  The restaurants, the clubs, the shops...everyone is dressed to impress and ready to party.

We stayed at the Cosmopolitan for 1 night at the end of a 4 night stay because I wanted to see what it was like and used Marriott points.  Check-in was sloooooow.  We waited for 22 (yes 22 exactly) minutes in a line with 2 people and 2 individuals working the desk.  No idea how that happens but the gentleman in line with me said it was his second time waiting that long in two days.  Yikes.

The room was nice.  It's what I'd call a junior suite.  The king sized bed was separated from the sitting area by a half wall.  The room had a kitchenette and a gorgeous bathroom.  There were neat touches like coffee table books and ecletic artwork.  The overall feel is trendy and slightly artsy.  However... the kitchenette does not include a single dish.  There are 4 glasses like you'd get in any hotel but no coffeemaker, not a pot, pan, or utensil to be found.  So why a kitchenette?  You can get utensils, for a price.  The room wasn't so clean.  It was clean at first glance but your feet would turn black from walking on the carpet and tile.  The walls and curtains had stains.  Not what you'd expect from one of the most expensive hotels on the strip.  

The noise...holy cow.  I expected noise because it was a sold out hotel in Vegas.  I didn't expect 3 am walls vibrating noise.  Marquee, the main club at the hotel, is located in between the towers and the noise travels up the glass facade and into your room.  I'm glad Tylenol PM knocks me out because while I enjoy a late night in Vegas, the fact that I was on the 32nd floor and could still hear the club quite clearly...ridiculous!!

Nope & she asked me who I booked it through & to see my reservation information.

The Cosmopolitan is so over the top is exudes gaudiness. Walking around I could see they went all out with the wow-factor decor. Huge shiny chandeliers, chic and modern, plenty of restaurants, glitzy and glittering crystals everywhere, beautiful art, amazing staircases, hot bars and clubs, shimmering cocktail lounge, stylish upscale retail shops, you name it! The 'bling"" factor is in full effect! It's sexy for sure but seems as it's trying a bit too hard. The younger crowd will eat it up, while the older more established Vegas gambler might be put off if not into this scene.

I did sign up for their players club card but as of now have still not received one mailing or email offer. On top of that the machines were tight.

Onto the room! We stayed at East tower room 5293 and 5292. The room(s) is amazing!! Very modern and has ample amnenities for whatever you need. The best part of the room is of course the balcony! On one side we had the perfect view of the Bellagio fountain and when you turn the corner there is Marquee right below us! Free dayclub shows? Count me in! It was perfect to lounge on the balcony to enjoy the sun and the music below after a hectic night of partying.

Being able to hear Marquee from your room is a good and bad thing. When we arrived on Friday we were very tired and tried to get a quick nap in before EDC. But it was hard to sleep to the sound of Armin chants and their fireworks going off. Im not going to deduct a star for that because we had no trouble sleeping at night.

My room was in the West Tower - 18th floor. While in the shower yesterday morning I looked down to find a HUGE roach crawling in the shower at my feet. Needless to say I screamed and was completely traumatized and jumped out immediately. This was no ordinary roach. It was probably 2-inches long and 1-inch wide with wings. The kind I've only seen in Asia. It did not crawl up from the drain because the drain holes were way too small to fit this monster through. 
I called the hotel staff and they changed my room immediately and offered a food and beverage comp. Even though they addressed the issue I don't think that they really believe what was in my shower with me because no one came by to see it for themselves. But I do have this photo in case anyone from the hotel would like to validate my story.

UPDATE: They sent us a bed bug report ... not sure why considering our issue was with giant roaches ... not bed bugs",1,7,0

My experience began when we were given the wrong room, we asked for a room with 2 beds and were given a room with only 1 bed.  We called right away and were told it would be a $10 charge to change rooms.  We then called for laundry service and additional hangers and it took over an hour and 2 phone calls before someone came. We were there for my best friends wedding, so all her family and friends were arriving throughout the week.
Her cousins arrived a day prior and they got there at 8am and were not given a room until 9pm.  Another cousin of hers had a new born with her and upon her check in her husband found 4 pairs of dirty underwear on the couch of their room along with an open bottle of soda in their frig and NOTHING was done for them!
She called for a late cleaning for her room and housekeeping never came...my room took 45 minutes to check in to and when they ""cleaned"" the room there was garbage still left on the floor.
The overall service was terrible, the staff was SO RUDE everywhere we went...it was like we were an inconvenience to them.  We went to the Bon Bon Bar and all of the bartenders looked like they were mad to be there and their drinks were NOT worth what we paid for them.  Everything we asked for in regards to service was responded to by saying there would be an extra charge.
For the amount of money they charge they should have a higher sense of urgency, staff that don't have an attitude problem, housekeeping that actually clean and management that care when their hotel guests are having a bad experience as we complained and nothing was done or offered.
I have stayed at The Venetian, Bellagio, Wynn, Ceasar Palace and the MGM and have had nothing but great service at all of them.  
I will NEVER go back to The Cosmopolitan and I suggest that you don't go either!",2,2,1

We have stayed at ever hotel and this is by far our favorite. We love the balcony to overlook the Bellagio fountain. They usually offer us an upgrade for a nominal fee and we usually take it. The restaurants and great and so is the vibe. The pool is on the small side but we love the quaintness of it unlike some of these really busy pools at other places.,1,0,1

Being the newest and one of the nicest hotels on the strip, my friend decided he wanted to stay here to celebrate his dirty 30.  We decided to stay from Friday, October 14 to Sunday, October 16.

RESERVATION:
We had a decent size group so I decided to call into reservations and see if we could get a group rate.  My information was passed on to the celebrations department and I worked with Angela Cooper to set things up.  She was able to set a website up for our group so Cosmo would know our group was together and place us in rooms near each other.  In addition, because a site was set up, we were guaranteed set rates up until a certain date.  What wasn't clearly told to me was that a ""block"" of rooms would be reserved for me, but it doesn't mean rooms next to each other are reserved no matter how early you book, it means it's based on availability.

CHECK-IN: What a horrible experience!!!
*We checked in at the front desk at 1:20pm and were told that our room wasn't ready.  When I booked my room, it asked what time I would arrive.  I entered 1pm...why ask what time we'll check in when you're clearly not going to honor it?
*The girl checking us in said she would check us in so when our room was ready, they would call us and give us our room number.  She also said she would notify housekeeping to get our room ready as soon as possible so it shouldn't be too long.
*I mentioned to the girl checking us in that we had a block of rooms and wanted to make sure we were together.  She looks up a couple of names and said we're all on the same floor.  Turns out, we weren't (more on this later...)
*We decided to walk around and get something to eat.  An hour later, we still didn't receive a call.  My friend calls and they said it would be another 10-15 minutes until our room was ready.
*Being the tweeter that I am, I tweeted how annoyed I was.  Cosmopolitan tweeted me back mentioning that check-in technically wasn't until 3pm. Fine, I'll wait...
*It's 3:15pm and I still haven't received a call that our room was ready.  My friend calls again where the operator had to contact the front desk.  They said our room was just about ready and we were able to go up.
*We head up to our room.  WTF our keys aren't working.  My friend calls again where the operator says that's the correct room and they'll send security up with new keys for us.  
*While my friend is on the phone with the operator, I'm on the concierge phone.  I'm told the bellboys could only bring keys to me if I'm in my room.  If I was in my room, why would I need keys?!  I said they could show them my ID to verify that it was me in the hallway.  I was then told only security could do that.  Fine, send me security!!  ""It'll be 30-45 minutes until security can come up there"" I was told.  Ughh!  Back down to the check-in desk I went.  
*One of the birthday boys calls me and let's me know he just checked in and is in his room.  He tells me what floor he's on...NOT THE FLOOR THE CHICK CHECKING ME IN TOLD ME THEY WERE ON.
*I expressed to a manager, I believe his name may have been Terry, how upset I was.  Although nice, we were simply credited $50 for food and beverage.
*I was still tweeting with Cosmopolitan who had asked for my last name to contact the front desk to try to help me out.  They then tweeted me back to enjoy my upgraded room.  Ummm...I didn't receive an upgraded room, this was the room I paid for. FAIL!!!
*We get to our room, we don't even have hand or face towels. 

ROOM:
We decided to book a terrace studio room which at the time of booking was $280\/night +tax.  The room had two queen beds, large bathroom complete with both a shower and tub, a small living room area, and a kitchen area which consisted of a sink, microwave, and fridge.  However, don't think you could store things in the fridge, it's all minibar items!  The room has two tv's, however no tv in the bathroom.  The terrace room looked towards the MGM and Aria direction.  I think if you want a view of the Bellagio, I believe you have to pay the premium view price.  

Apparently I had a faulty room because it was EXTREMELY difficult for me to open the terrace door.  After going to one of our other friend's room, we also found out that we were missing the seat\/ottoman combo on our terrace.  

Because of my experience combined with the amount we spent to stay at a ""5 star"" hotel, I doubt I would ever stay at the Cosmopolitan again unless my trip was comped.  No doubt, Cosmopolitan will be receiving a complaint letter from me...an actual snail mail complaint letter!",7,0,2

Walking around the casino, it felt classy, the decor was beautiful. When I saw the glamorous chandelier, my mouth was open. The people at the Marquee club are funny, and the girls are pretty. Their music selection was quite nice. I must say I was having a mighty fine time because the bartender gave me an especially strong drink, well for me anyway.

Soon as we checked into our room, we realized our ""non-smoking"" room smelt like smoke. We called to complain and asked to get another room and we're refused another room BUT we're told someone would come up and try to get rid of the smoke smell.

We came back to the room and it still smelt like smoked. When we checked out, we tried to complain to a manager but there was no manager there. We were told that a manager would call us about the issue with the room. They never did. 

The worst part? My friends and I got a day bed at the Cosmo and spent nearly $500 AND were still treated terribly.

I've stayed at this hotel now 6 times. I really like it. The rooms are large and the bathrooms are awesome. However, there's *always* something that's just a bit off or missing that surprises me. Last time, there was no water in the minibar when I checked-in. OK, so they forgot it. But, upon check out, they charged me for it, as the items in the mini-bar are automatically billed upon no weight being sensed at the sight each item sits. I had to explain that there never was any water. Another time, neither tv worked in my room. Also, this time, the ashtray in the balcony was filled w\/ cigarette butts. None of these are the end of the world, but, like I said.....details.

As for the Casino itself, Not so good.  

This is a very small, boutique-type casino. I've played a lot of craps throughout Vegas and world. I watched a craps dealer just rip a poor woman player because she had placed her bet in the wrong ""section"" of the dont come box. He then proceeded to give her winnings to another player, and when she questioned him on it he accused her of lying. Unbelievable! Having witnessed the whole thing while playing at the same table, I came to her aid and told the pit boss, who came over, and I told him to re-wind the tape upstairs. They then reluctantly gave her her winnings. This place has consistently arrogant \/ cocky workers. Right now, they're a hot, new, 'in' place, but that will soon die down, and I expect this place to be pretty spartan and empty. They need a management make-over, and fast. I recommend you Gamble and bring your business and hard earned $$ else where.",4,2,1

Even though there was a moldy half eaten fruit and cheese plate left in our room, I couldn't remove a star because the rest of the experience was so great!

My boyfriend and I stayed at the cosmopolitan 3 months ago for our 2 year anniversary. At check in we received a $50 drink voucher at the Bar near the checkin. We thought that was pretty cool:-) Because of our anniversary we were able to upgrade (for an extra few hundred dollars) to the Wrap Around Suite...OMG! First lets start with the fact that its basically an apartment (1400 sq ft), full kitchen, living room, bedroom, and two bathrooms. Next, the view was AMAZING!!! It doesn't get the name wrap around for nothing; the balcony was huge and literally wraps around the entire suite! From living room to the bedroom...It has two big couches on each end and a smaller couch on the corner of the balcony. Our view was from the Bellagio water show, the paris hotel (eiffel tower facing our living room was beautiful at night), and wrapped around to planet hollywood. It was Bananas! The bed was super comfortable, and I loved the jacuzzi style tub in the bedroom. Also, there was a washer and dryer...Yes, Inside of the room! What hotel does that? Amazing!

Now lets talk about that nasty fruit n cheese plate. When we first arrived we thought it was some special thing for our anniversary until we saw the mold...Disgusting! We called housekeeping to have it removed, left the room for a couple of hours, came back and the nasty plate was still there! At that point we called to complain and the hotel was very accommodating; gave us a $150 food\/drink voucher for any restaurant in the hotel and shortly after the cheese plate was removed. Housekeeping could definitely use some improving, but everything else about this hotel from the front lobby, the pools, spa, to the customer service (especially the room service-they were truly amazing\/nice) was grade A and we will be returning for another stay in two weeks. Oh btw, I won like $400 playing wheel of fortune slots! :-D 

I forgot to add that there's this hidden pizza parlor (stays open until 3am) on the same floor as the Scarpetta restaurant; It is very much hidden (looks like a hallway to nothing), we kept seeing people walking around with pizza boxes and we're like wtf!? Where are they getting this pizza?!?! lol. We even asked some of the hotel staff and they didn't even know what we were talking about (Weird right?) It took us 3 out of our 4 night stay to find it.

Meanwhile we spent 3 hours at the pool and come to enter the room but the sofa bed was never set up. Thirdly, the WiFi in the room would not connect  to all three of our phones.

How about the pool tables & foosball, & TV's  to keep you company?

Overall Decor- very modern

Service- Poor to Bad
Tried to check in early in the am was told that our room wasn't ready and that they would call when available.  We just leave the hotel and 1\/2 hour later i get a msg that the room is now ready.  So i just ignored the msg and then went back when i was done with all my errands.

The room- again very modern decor way too much snacks and drinks to offer with a pricey price on each.  The glass shower that you can watch and see everything from the bed.  What's the reason for that idk.

Self Parking lot- I thought was really neat they have an automated number system of how many stalls are available on each level.  and they even got a green light over the stall if its open or a red light if its taken.  so all you have to do is drive around and look for green lights!

Uniform- All employees DO NOT WEAR NAME TAGS!!!!!!!!! So if you have to complaint you better hope they told you their name in their initial conversation with you otherwise you will never get it.

Clubs\/lounges- very crowded with clubbers on the weekends.

Location- Liked that very central to all i guess that's why its part if the city ""center"".

Full kitchen, bar, laundry, two bathrooms (one with his and hers), living room, two 50"" TVs, and of course, the giant wrap-around balcony overlooking the strip (get a north or east facing room for a great view).

The Bamboo Pool was very chill - two bars flanking the pool area and waitresses walking around everywhere.  The buffet, the Wicked Spoon, was the best buffet I've had in Vegas ($75 for two).

The only downside was that the Marquee ""DayClub"" was outside our room.  Even though we were 25 floors up, we could hear this all day from about 11AM - 6PM from our room.  I will say it was entertaining to watch, the place is pretty much a live version of Jersey Shore filmed.  Not so great when we're trying to sleep off our hangovers in the middle of the day.

I am upset to give The Cosmo a two star review, but based on my experience with the check-in process and having a suite here I cannot give anymore. I have been a fan of Cosmo since it opened. I've spent a lot of money here. I'm a local and I sing its praises to out of towners all the time. But I will NOT be recommending for any of my friends (local or otherwise) to actually stay here.

We arrived early (just about an hour) prior to check-in time and we were greeted by a very nice, chipper young lady who set about getting our information. First off, we had just made the reservation the day before, so we were absolutely sure it was there. The girl typed in our name repeatedly to no avail. My husband whipped out his phone and showed her our email confirmation so she could look it up by the confirmation number instead. TA-DA. There it was with our last name misspelled. Hurray. At least we were smart enough to bring our confirmation with us or else they probably never would have found our reservation to begin with. 

They have our reservation for the Terrace Suite for one night. She asks us if we're there for business or pleasure and I say it's my birthday and we're locals and we just wanted to get a room for the night and play by the pool. She seems okay with that and continues tapping away, then she excuses herself and brings forth some other guy in a suit. O HAI guy in a suit, what do you want? He introduces himself and shakes mine and my husband's hand. He then proceeds to chastise us and shame-shame us for being locals and getting a hotel room for a night.

""It's our policy to inform locals that our rooms are not meant for loud, raging parties. We expect you to be courteous to the other guests. After all, there are plenty of other places to have a good time here in the resort.""

OH. OKAY GUY IN SUIT. I'll try not to have a raging balls-to-the-wall party in my room since you've wagged your finger in my face before I even check in.

What gets me is that he specifically said it's policy for them to inform LOCALS. Because, well, guess what locals? Cosmo doesn't want your business if you're just there for a night for your birthday with your husband trying to enjoy a suite and have dinner with your friends. Seriously. I was so incensed by this guy I didn't know what to do besides awkwardly laugh at his remarks.

He then goes on to ask if we're ""in the industry"". 

No. I reply. I work for the federal government and my husband is Air Force. 

""OOOOH"" says guy in suit, ""Thank you for your service.""

YAH. Fuck you. You were just giving us a lesson in how we should conduct ourselves in our room that we're paying good money for, GUY IN SUIT. How about you fuck off with your ""thank you for your service"".

I've never been treated that way when I've checked into any hotel before on the strip. I've never been shamed because I'm a local. I've never been given a talking to by some random guy just because I happen to be local and I happen to just be getting a suite for the night. I think it was ridiculous. I think it was rude. And I think The Cosmo does a whole lot of assuming about their guests.

Well I guess my young appearance my tattoos must have just sent alarm bells ringing up the asses of these people.

So our check-in process basically sucked and I am sad to report how far it dropped The Cosmo in my eyes.

Our room - Terrace Suite, 28th floor, facing the Bellagio Fountains. Amazing room, full kitchen, living area, wrap around suite, plush bed, interesting artwork. Lighting that goes completely on and off when you leave the suite. A tub that could have been much bigger in my opinion and a decent enough bathroom. We didn't call for room service, so can't comment. 

We DID have my 4 friends come up to the suite AFTER we had dinner. We all fuckin jumped all over the beds and turned over tables and lit a fire in the trash can and brought in a fuckin tiger from Sig & Roy's Magical Garden and we fucked that place up. OH JUST KIDDING. We watched the fountain show, hung out, had champagne, talked, and had my birthday cake while I opened presents. Afterward my LOCAL CRAZY MUTHER EFFING FRIENDS left and my husband and I watched TV and went to bed. OH MAH GAWD.

Anyway, that's my experience at The Cosmo. Not so good, eh? Dearest locals - go elsewhere, lest you be chastised before you even get a chance to enjoy.",26,29,12

Lets start with the sales and catering\/wedding staff: Tina, Patti and hosts and servers. AMAZING! Tina and Patti helped plan the entire event for almost 1 year. My wife and I were happy that we were able to find people who understood what we wanted (as picky as we were) and were totally flexible in changing things. Their suggestions for photography and the officiant couldn't have been better. From rose pedals lining the isle to the unbelievable view of the Las Vegas strip and Bellagio water show, everything seemed like a dream! The ceremony itself went so smooth. Our guests still haven't stopped talking about how ""PERFECT"" everything was all the way down to the timing of the music, the view, decorations, and our attire. The guests had such a good time that they are asking when we are renewing our vows so we can have another event there!

The bell hop was equally nice as he filled our ice container etc. After a 5 day stay, we decided this was our favorite place in Vegas and definitely plan to stay here every trip.

The good:
- Best views in vegas - we had a view of the bellagio fountains and the strip
- Big room - 1200 sqft of room.. thats massive
- Convenient location, central to everything
- Most of the staff was courteous and polite

The bad:
- no drinking water ( most hotels at least have a bottle - specially needed after a long flight and super-hot vegas weather )
- no coffee machine
- no toiletries beyond the basics - we asked for a shaving kit which took 1 hour to arrive. There was no bath scrub, etc. which most hotels in this price range offer. 
- gym access was 20 bucks per day - I actually had made sure that the hotel had gym, I guess they forget to mention that you have to pay to use it
- renting a chair at the pool was a few hundred bucks
- chocolate cake took 1 hour to arrive and wasn't that good
- we ate at the Chinese+mexican restaurant which was basically overpriced and lousy food.
- the bathroom light wasn't working, so i called the concierge. nothing happened for 2 hours, and I had to call again. they said the previous person didn't put the request in.

That being said, this hotel is absolutely beautiful.  When you first walk in, you can't help but notice the three story tall chandellier.  It's stunning. But what's different about this one is the lounge that the chandellier is built around.  What an excellent concept.
As we made our way around the hotel, we were looking at the various pieces of art.  Tastefully chosen and placed around the hotel.
We were trying to figure out how to get to the Will Call for our tickets.  We found the first person that seemed available and asked.  He directed us to the escalator.
When we approached the escalator, we were told that it was unfortunately closed. This was because it was direct access up to the pool and the concert entrance was in a different place.  So we had to trek across the hotel, down some hallways, up an an elevator and then to one of MANY ballroom areas, where we found their ""box office"".
Normally I would have been frustrated that we had to trek all over the hotel.  However, having never been there and the place being brand new, it was nice to see the different parts.
Once we were finally granted entrance in to the pool area, I was impressed.  It wasn't anything overly extravagant like some of the pools, but it was definitely an inviting atmosphere.  For shows, they drain the ankle deep pool, and in the 3 ft section they place a riser to make the elevations of the GA floor a little more even.   The stage was a little high, but what's great about that is that, no matter where you were standing, you had an excellent view of the performer(s).
The reason they call it The Boulevard pool is becuase it's on the top corner of the 4th floor on that part of the hotel and it overlooks Las Vegas Blvd.  You have an excellent view of the entire strip.
There were several bars to choose from.  After getting a drink at one of their permanent bars, we tried to scope out where the best place to refill our drinks would be, as they have satellite bars like most hotels.  We decided on the one near where we were standing and inquired with the bartender what she had available.  When she asked what were drinking we told her Jameson & Ginger.  She said she didn't have Jameson.  Then she said, ""Are you going to be in this area most of the night?"" We advised her that we likely would be and she said, ""I'll get you a bottle of Jameson and some ginger beer"".  To which we replied, ""Then we're yours all night"".  Later I discovered our bartender, Heather Tool, had ties to my hometown as well as San Diego where we currently live. I was sold. She was definitely our bartender for the night.  We never had to wait for a drink and she was always attentive to our needs.  At one point we asked if they had cigarettes at the bar and she said no.  Her barback or bar assistant overheard the conversation and even went so far as to make a call so the cigarette girl could come upstairs to us so that we could purchase some.  In my opinion, that was definitely far above and beyond the call of duty.  It may not have been a big deal to them, but it certainly stood out in my opinion.
I really was hoping to have been able to stay here, but unfortunately we weren't able to when making our hotel reservations.  One day I'd love to go back and stay here.  As long as Heather is our bartender and everyone else gives us the stellar service they did that night.  Cheers to you Cosmopolitan, you just gained another fan.",1,0,1

When we returned to our table, my friend's cell phone was missing -- stolen. We suspect the bus boy as he was the only one seen going by our table. The restaurant staff was not helpful in speaking to him to try to retrieve it or doing much else. They just called security and refused to help in any other way. Of course the thief texts nasty crude emails to my contacts before it was finally turned off. Security then says they have no cameras in the eating area restaurant.

The place is absolutely beautiful. The decor itself has personality, and the chandelier in the middle of casino is so fascinating, it'll have you in awe of this place. I came here with a large group of about 20 to celebrate my friend Mark's birthday. I've been here a handful of times before, but this was the first time I've actually stayed here. I was staying in the ""City Room,"" and Mark and a few others were staying in the baller status room AKA the ""Wrap-Around Terrace."" We all were able to get rooms on the same floor, so it was decided that Mark's room was deemed ""The Party Room,"" and every other room was for sleeping.

The City Room was your standard hotel room with that eclectic Cosmo touch. Our room had 2 double beds and a see-through window to the shower\/bathroom from the living room. Strange, right? Now, here come the problems... When we first walked in, it was like somebody was already staying in our room except without any baggage. There was a room service tray that wasn't cleaned up - Strike 1. There was an opened soap along with its' wrapper in the shower - Strike 2. & here comes the biggie... PANTIES behind a treasure chest! Strike 3! Although the panties were hidden behind something, it's definitely not a good thing when the next guest finds them. Of course we had to say something. We demanded for the room to be re-cleaned and for some sort of compensation. I was hoping the get the room for free, but they gave us $150 hotel credit instead. That works, I guess.

The Wrap Around Suite was AMAZING. It was essentially an apartment with an astonishing view from the 40th floor. We had the view of the entire strip with the Eiffel Tower to our right and the Bellagio fountains right below us. It was spacious with 1 bedroom, 2 bathrooms, a living room, kitchen with bar, and a balcony that wraps around a corner of the hotel. By far, this is the best view I've ever seen of the strip. Like I said, this was dubbed ""The Party Room."" So of course music was blasting 24\/7, people were going in and out, and we were getting crazy up in here. Security came up on Saturday before we headed out to Marquee and told us we had to leave the room. They said they heard our music all the way from the elevators. Damn, we were all the way at the end of the hall too. Whoops. They thought we were throwing a huge rager in the room, but we were just pre-partying.  No biggie though, they were cool, and they didn't kick us out of the hotel. 

Despite the incident that happened in my room, I still love the Cosmo. I can't get over how sick this place is. It's super girly, and maybe that's why I love it.

They seemed to have most of the newer machines, plus some previous favorites of mine.  The casino isn't that old so most of the machines are from the last decade, but other casino's have already retired some which I still like so I was glad to find them at the Cosmopolitan.  

The casino is kind of long - stretches all the way to the back.  They relocated their Players Club more to the front which is nice, at least it was nice once we found it.  The signage was a little confusing.   Even the directions given by an employee we challenging.  (I wouldn't say it's near the escalators, but more opposite them, but that's just me).  

The casino is still clean and very modern looking.  It's definitely on our radar now to visit if we are walking by, but hasn't quit met the ""We've got to go there every trip"" level yet.",1,0,0

I also love the assortment of restaurants here (my ultimate favorite is Estiatorio Milos, which serves excellent Greek food!) Situated right dab in the middle of the strip you are walking distance from the Bellagio Fountains, Caesar's Palace, the Aria Shopping Mall, Wicked Spoon Buffet, etc.

But one of the main reasons why I love the Cosmo are the suites. It's one of the only hotels with terrace\/balcony rooms. I always book the terrace studio with the fountain view...BEST DEAL IN LAS VEGAS. Not only do you get a beautiful view of the strip but you also get a million dollar view of the Bellagio Fountain Show. Sometimes you can just lounge in your room and it will be a vacation in itself due to its beauty. Also the bathrooms are huge with a bathtub & walk-in stall that you can sit in. 

Photos don't do the Cosmo any justice. You have to experience it yourself. I'll meet you there in a heartbeat...just not in the summertime when it's 117 degrees in Las Vegas lol.",1,1,1

Nice place overall - good central location, nice & big rooms, and lots going on in the building.

Our room was good minus the fact that they forgot to give us shampoo and conditioner the first night and one of the faucets wasn't working. However, they made up for it when we asked and even gave us some chocolates for the inconvenience.

The restaurants were pricey but that's probably expected. The nice gym in the West building closes early at 8 PM unfortunately. Had some issues with Wifi, even though we had to pay extra (the daily resort fee) for it.

Enjoyed our stay overall and thought the service was great.",0,0,0

I was charged with planning a family trip to Las Vegas, so I booked three rooms for our stay (Wednesday-Saturday) at the Cosmopolitan. Now, I am a big-time Vegas girl (I usually come about once a month), and the Cosmo is widely regarded as one of the fun hot-spots. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Chandelier bar, and was excited to stay in this place. Looking back, I should have researched it more. This was a go-to-expensive-shows-and-dinners type of a trip, not my usual stay-out-til-6-am-and-hope-you-make-it-back-with-all-of-your-belongings-type trip. With that in mind, overall I was a little disappointed.

PROS:
- Location: Right in the middle of the strip, easy to go outside and walk about. Bellagio fountains are next door.
- Cool stuff in the hotel: Marquee dayclub\/nightclub for one, Eggslut for another
- Staff is super friendly. If you catch someone in person, or call down to complain about something (which we unfortunately ended up doing more than once), they are very customer service-oriented and sweet to try and help you. 
- Suites are spacious and I liked the decorations.
- BATHROOMS: technically part of the rooms, but I want to make a point about them because I LOVED that you can see the strip while you shower. The open shower-connected-to-bath area was also nice, and the bathtub was fantastic for a soak.

CONS:
- Need coffee in the morning? GOOD LUCK. No coffee in the room, and you can wait in line at Starbucks, which is apparently the only place in the hotel to pick up a simple cup of coffee if you're not doing brunch\/breakfast at a sit-down place. Can't believe they make it so difficult for such a simple essential. Probably not a big deal to most people, but fellow caffeine junkies beware.
- If you have a strip view room, it will be LOUD ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHTS. Marquee is bumping until 4 am - a fact my parents and aunts\/uncles did not appreciate. They loved the casino and Chandelier bar, but they both said that the fact that we were on the 32nd floor and could legitimately FEEL the bass was a problem.
- Service was ridiculously slow. While friendly, it seems like to get things actually done (e.g. extra towels, hair dryer replacement since ours didn't work, etc) you have to call multiple times. Case in point: my parents arrived on a Wednesday at 1 pm, and asked that sheets be brought up before 10 to make up the pull-out couch. Either my mom or dad was in the room the entire day; sure enough I came in at 1030 PM and they hadn't brought anything up. Everything was a variation of that - well-intentioned, but you end up having to harass them to get things done.

Overall, I'm pretty torn. Would NOT recommend for a family trip or if you're going with people who don't plan on being out all hours of the night. My parents (especially my mom) were pissed about all the little problems, and there are too many AMAZING luxury hotels on the strip to stay here and worry about if everyone's gonna be happy.

I'm staying here again in a few weeks for a friend's birthday, and it'll be younger\/more ratchet group, so I'll update then depending on our experience. I'm hoping for that crowd it'll live up to the hype more. Will update then.",0,1,0

I expected much better quality for the price.  We stayed on the 49th floor of the west tower and as soon as we got out of the elevator, it stank like feet and wet dog.  The decor was ugly and looked as though it was thrown together in a rush.  Our bathroom wallpaper didn't have clean edges and looked about ready to start peeling off.  Tsk tsk.

We hung out at the Bamboo pool which got pretty crowded by 1pm on a Monday.  We ordered a couple of Bloody Mary's and charged it on a credit card.  I was flabbergasted when the waitress came back  and the bar said that my credit card was declined.  I called the credit card company and they said that I had enough credit on the card and that the Cosmo poolbar charged the card 4 times!  I spent 30 sweaty minutes on the phone with the credit card company and the waitress trying to get the charges reversed.  The waitress was cooperative, sweet, and real apologetic and said that their system must have gone down.  Not a good way to start my pool day but the drinks were really good  and I ended up ordering a couple more times anyway, paying with cash to be safe.

I got a player's card and came up a little bit on the penny slots.  Be sure to bring a sweater on the casino floor cause it was freezing.  So much so that we decided to go back to our room to defrost.  Brr!

Some pros is that it's in a central location.  It's conveniently easy walking to Paris, Bellagio, and Aria.  The best part of my visit was CRSVR and Holsteins.  

I wouldn't pay to stay here again.",3,0,0

I stayed here for a conference just 3 months after it opened and I loved that part of the experience. The best was really like a cloud. The bathroom was gigantic. It is definitely an upscale establishment.

Then why did I just rate it 3 stars? My first night there, at around 2 in the morning, the fire alarm went off. I raced out into the hall and there were employees there that were checking for the source of the smoke. They promptly told me to go back into my room and that if anything was found, I would be notified.

First off at 2 in the morning when I have a conference to attend in a few hours, I do not like to be dealt with in the abrupt manner that the employees dealt with me. I am out of it as I had been awoken from my sleep and to not be told what was going on was not fun. 

The next morning I decided to find out what was going on, so I sent  tweet to the Hotel's Twitter feed. I did this as they seem to be very active on Twitter and respond quite frequently. It took two tweets to get a response and they said they would look into it. This was Thursday morning.

Saturday comes and I am in the airport, waiting to board my plane and i still hadn't heard anything. I sent one last, and very frustrated, tweet. I quickly got a response, pawning the blame off on hotel management not getting back to them. Within half an hour I had my response that it was a smoldering pillow. I think they had forgotten all about my request when this came back so quickly but i could very well be wrong there.

If it wasn't for how nice the hotel is, I would have given this review a 2 star rating. As such, it will be hard to get me to go back. I hear the Aria is nice.",2,0,1

This type of place will make money hand over fist until their real value comes out which is perfectly NILL. Customer Service and satisfaction are what makes money for a property in the long run after the newness has worn off. With many places to choose from you better have all your ducks in a row when you attempt to get passed the everyday guest and after my recent 4 hour experience at the Cosmopolitan, I assure you if this is the level of service provided to a potential large gambler, then they will be bankrupt and under a corporate umbrella sooner than later.

Long time MGM Property guy Mandalay Bay \/ Bellagio being my two places I spend the majority of my gaming. 3-5 trips to Vegas per year with the bankroll of 5 to 10K for the tables. With that type of consistent play certain things are expected.  A confirmed room type made 3 months in advance with a Casino Host for VIP service should be handled well as VIP Service should be.  After explaining my situation to my new host I confirmed with copy via email for a Wrap Around Suite with an adjoining Connector room as I was bringing my two nephews with me and wanted to keep an eye on the 20 something crowd as it was their first visit to Vegas. Casino Rates for room established and a follow up with my host Riley O'Neil was completed 10 days prior to arrival with all things confirmed.

Note about a month ago I also contacted the Host for Marquee Day Club regarding a VIP Cabana for the weekend see later in review for results.

Arrived to VIP check in Memorial Day weekend Friday, and was told by Rico the VIP check in personal that not only did I not have a Wrap around suite confirmed but they had NO Connected room confirmed and only a standard King bed Terrace Suite for me. What was I supposed to do pile cots into the room? after 5 phone calls to Riley, by both myself and Rico who by the way DOES NOT HAVE the Casino Hosts Number? No answer from Riley. Rico stated please let us give you a room and in a few hours we can get this changed an authorized. Fair enough mistakes happen.  Off for lunch were we enjoy a horrible dining experience at the overlook restaurant.  Time is ticking now 2 hours have gone by and Riley finally calls me back. Explains don't know what happen but I'll get it corrected.  Another 90 minutes go by and we head back to VIP service where Rico has no authority to do anything, no supervisors are on premise, and Riley has not at this point even called VIP Services.   4 hours now and finally get the call from Riley and get this NOT ONLY do they not have my suite, but no additional room is available 110% sold out is the term used.  He doesn't know what to do, and here I am Holiday weekend, with no rooms. Truly the cluster phuck of all time.  He states let me work on it.

I pick up the phone, call my host at the Mandalay Bay ""Marciano"", and within 5 minutes I'm being whisked to a Jr. suite for myself with a connector and my nephews. That's how it's done folks.  By the way not one more phone call from Riley O'Neil even after everything that happened. UNBELIEVABLE is the only way to describe the level of service or lack thereof.   I lost quite a bit this trip at the tables, and the only thing that makes me smile is that none of it went towards this sham of a hotel.  Bankrupt is where they will eventually head with this level of service for their gamblers as when it's all said and done, eventually  karma is a bitch. 

PS: On Saturday a day after all this I get a text message from the Marquee Day Club host asking if I still wanted a cabana? LOL Imagine they can't fill their cabanas so they call me the day of? Not a call back email nothing back for the 30 days since my request Priceless and useless come to mind!

Don't stay here unless you're ready for poor service and even worse a staff that simply is useless.

A gift card from The Cosmopolitan should be the ""same as cash"" in terms of dollar value especially when the card is used in a restaurant inside The Cosmopolitan itself.

So we arrive and after waiting for an hour to check in we are told that we are going to be charged an additional $450 for incidentals for our stay, then we were told that it was just a hold, then we were told that since we prepaid over the amount for the rooms at booking there were to be no charges.  He did need my credit card for verification, which he immediately charged the $450 to which I didn't know until checking my account.
Then upon arrival to our room we noticed housekeeping pulled a splash and dash, and nothing was really clean.  Our terrace had the remnants of a broken glass and some kind of juice stain all over it.  We called 4 times to have housekeeping come out, and they never did.  Even on the daily housekeeping routines they never checked the terrace and never ran a vacuum.  Throughout our stay we also noticed things like chip crumbles in the hallway for 2 days, a water bottle on the floor in the ice room for our whole stay and numerous other things that fell back on housekeeping.  For a hotel this nice I would hope for some cleanliness!
I never heard one story or saw anyone win anything on the casino floor.  The bars where cool, the breakfast at the buffet was good (way better than buffet food!), the restaurants and shops all were great.

Now I am back home and checking my accounts and I see they charged me an extra $200.  Just a one time charge of $200 3 days after my stay.  I would have checked my itemized receipt that I was promised in email at check out but I haven't received it.  I can only assume it is for the broken glass and stain on the terrace that was there when we arrived but who knows...  I have tried to contact them 4 times today and whoever the operator tries to put me through to the phone just rings until it goes to a busy signal and hangs up.

Oh and the stupid tv control thing, yeah its a pretty neat idea to have all of your room controls on your tv, but the thing had to be reset constantly just to function as a tv.  Then when we tried to order a movie one late night and it didn't work the tech noticed that I was never properly logged into the system.  He called the front desk and had them log me off and then back in.  But they all forgot to tell me that after that my keycards wouldn't work anymore.

I have to admit that I felt like a pimp having to insert my key in the elevator to get the 60 button to light up. The room came with tons of WOW!
- THE VIEW. sick. completely sick. I couldn't stop going out to the balcony just to sit down and take it all in.
- THE BUTLER SERVICE. Just pick up the phone and the butlers get you what you need. They were amazing and made our stay there completely memorable. The only setback was that during the evening hours, there was high demand for the butlers so the response time was often delayed, but it wasn't like anyone was dying. LOL.
- COOL. The Cosmo is just all-around COOL. The place's got swag. I enjoyed walking around the casino and the shops and just being in the environment.
- PARTY. What a crazy pimp pad to have a birthday party. It was an intimate setting in a penthouse with an incredible view. Nuff Said.

There were a few drawbacks. Although they were minor, they are worth mentioning. 
- We catered some food that was blocked by the bell desk and they had to throw the food away. This was crazy. When you pay that much for the penthouse, who cares if you bring food to your room. We ended up getting pizza from the Cosmo shops and bringing up to the room, which was tasty, but totally inconvenient.
- The bathrooms are 100% black, so it was a challenge to shave with so little light. I can't imagine what it would be like for women to find enough light to apply their makeup. 
- The kitchen isn't really a kitchen. It only has a tiny sink and a tiny refrigerator. BOOO!
- The technology in the room is crazy cool ... when it works. Sometimes the curtains opened, sometimes they didn't. The tablets which controlled almost everything where hard to get used to and were slow to respond. The front TV surround speaker didn't work, so we couldn't hear voices when we tried to watch DVDs. 

In addition, we secured a cabana for one afternoon which was fun. It is worth noting that we brought our 3 & 5 year old boys with us for one day. They loved the room and the pool.

Our experience at Cosmo was an incredibly great experience and the drawbacks were minor. The most important part is that all of our guests had a wonderful time. Highly recommended.",1,0,1

I recently had the pleasure of staying here with my hubby for 1-night and I fell in love! Everything about this hotel is gorgeous. From the moment you walk in the front door it's a fun, sophisticated\/sexy energy. The hotel also doesn't have that overpowering cigarette smell that most casino's have. I cheked-in during peak Check-In \/ Checkout time so it was a little bit of a cluster. However the staff did their absolute best to be pleasant and accommodating. A hostess even served us little Cosmopolitan bottles of water while we waited in line:) 

All of my (little) frustration with the check-in process was immediately put to rest when I arrived to my room. We stayed in a King Terrace Studio located on the 24th Fl. WOWZERS! The room was massive and immaculately clean. I was actually shocked my how large the room was. We had a full sized sectional with a plasma TV in the living area. I'd describe the decor as sleek, modern and glamorous - unlike any other hotel I've ever stayed at in Vegas. The Balcony was also huge with a view of the pool. Unfortunately, I wasn't on the Bellagio fountain side - the pool view was still cool! The bed was beyond comfortable and the linens were amazing! 

Since we were only here for 1-night, I didn't have an opportunity to explore the hotel in it's entirety:( We did swing by Chandelier for a late night cocky-tail:) This is one of the most stunning bars I've ever seen! The humongous chandelier is breathtaking! I wasn't crazy impressed by my drink, but I was kinda more consumed with the bar itself.

From their sleek modern design, all the way to their vast selection of hotel rooms to choose from makes Cosmopolitan stand out from the rest. As you observe their hotel layout while walking around you can't help but to stumble upon their gambling floor. Though their gambling options may not compare in size to other hotels, none the less they surely make up by offering other options to their guests. 

The next big attention getter hands down has to be Marquee Day & Night Club. While looking to show off your hard worked bodies and dancing to the most modern selection of music, Marquee is your go to place to party it up during the day. If you rather relax and save your energy during the day and want to party it up at night, please believe Marquee is still your go too. This club has to be the biggest I've been able to walk through to this day, offering various spots to choose from. Their main stage area usually play EDM music, and you can find the same selection of music at their outdoor area as well. If that is not what you are looking to party it up with, no sweat they offer another downstairs room called ""BOOMBOX"" where they play you very selection of Hip\/Hop. Personal the BOOMBOX is my favorite. A lot of other clubs don't offer a good selection to choose from when it comes to purchasing drinks at a bar, but with Marquee they literally have 6 (Entry way, side of main stage, front of main stage, outdoor near main stage, outdoor behind projector screen, and the last one located in the Boombox) different bars to choose from.

If you are not looking to partying it up during the day isn't your forte, and you just want to lounge around a pool area, the beauty about Cosmopolitan is that they offer two different pool areas to choose from. One is located on the third floor, and other which is located on one of the middle floors of the hotel. (I was faded when I went so I am not 100% sure which floor, but it is somewhere between 14-16).

If you are looking to shop Cosmopolitan has numerous stores to choose from located on their second floor right above their gambling area, and the same floor for Marquee's main entrance. They have stores that cater not only to the ladies, but they also offer stores that cater to the gentlemen as well.

Finally the eateries, they offer a few options to select from on the second floor where the shopping area is located as well, but their main attraction is the world famous ""Wicked Spoon"" which has been featured on Food Paradise Buffet episode. Their prices are more reasonable then compared to their competition (I.e WYNN), and their selection definitely will get the tummy growling and mouth drooling so make sure to come hungry. On the low, this buffet will definitely help cope with your hangover as well.",7,4,6

Make sure your room is in the East Tower.  While I am sure the West Tower is nice, the long walk back by the convention meeting room areas seems so desolate.

The hotel itself has a nice location and has a good mix of semi-casual restaurants on the 4th floor.  If you want to try something unique, book a reservation at Rose Rabbit Lie.  The dinner theatre will be a first for most people.  The hotel Is currently the choice of the upscale non-clubbing scene between the late 20s-50 year old set crowd of pretty people.  If you decide to go casual with a t-shirt and shorts, you will look terribly foolish and probably feel uncomfortable.

Gambling area has distracting female dancers in an array of black catsuits to take your mind off of any card counting you're doing.  The Chandelier Bar is a great 2 story social bar set in the middle of the hotel.  Do keep an eye out for the ""local talent"" as my friend thought he was getting lucky until he found it might cost him something extra.  Anyhow, I find this bar to be the one I end up at even when staying at other hotels.

The rooms are fairly priced. A recent 6 day stay cost $2200 for a room that was high grade during a busy convention time.   The wraparound balcony faced the Bellagio and we were treated to a nightly water show.  The bedroom opened out to the balcony so you could sit outside as you deemed suitable.  The bathroom has both a jacuzzi tub for two and a large glass shower with dual sinks and a separate water closet.  

The room also comes with a full kitchenette and lounge and entertainment center.  Although you probably won't do any cooking, the suite allows you all the room to entertain a small party or to keep separate if one person wants to retire early or sleep in.

All in all the room feels like a luxurious New York bachelor pad, hence ""the Cosmopolitan"".  Definitely the current ""it"" hotel for those looking for that jet-setter feel.",3,2,6

The check in, check out process were both convenient and an easy process. The hotel also offers a hertz service on the first floor. We rented a car our last day there and that process was also smooth.

Everywhere had young people mid twenties early thirties who were looking to party, and have fun. Live music by the bars, as well as a DJ in another bar.. COSMO is THE  ""young"" ""party"" hotel right now in vegas. The hotel is loaded with great restaurants, clubs, amazing pools and amenities. One pool for partying one pool for relaxing.

Cosmo is the posh hotel in vegas right now, or ""hot"" hotel, so the prices are going to be more expensive than other hotels out there. 

The decor of the hotel, and pools are not as EPIC, Grandiose or Amazing, as the other hotels such as Caesars, Bellagio, or ARIA, and the rooms while more expensive are smaller and are not as nice. 

I know this is redundant, but with COSMO your paying to weed out the riff-raff that the cheapers hotels do not. You are surrounded by younger people looking to party rather than honey mooners and old people. 

So in conclusion if you are a big group of single women, or single men looking to party this place is perfect. If your married, on your honey moon, on a business trip or so, I would recommend MANDALAY BAY or other hotels with activities besides ""partying"".",0,0,1

We had an awesome two bedroom suite with a gorgeous view of the strip.  One room had a king and the other one had two queens.  There was a huge bathroom in each bedroom with a half bath in the hallway.  Loved, loved, LOVED our suite!

There are also a variety of dining options in the hotel, so you can satisfy all your cravings.  There's pizza, Chinese\/Mexican, steak, Spanish tapas, a buffet, and plenty more.  We ended up at Henry's a few times for late night\/early morning eats.  Holsteins Shakes and Buns was also another good spot for burgers.

I was able to see the pool from my room, but unfortunately, the temperature dropped when we flew in and it was a tad too chilly to work on my tan.  Instead, I spent my time in the casino......losing, losing, winning, then losing my money.  Fun times nonetheless.

Everything about this hotel is so appealing.. with its bright and sexy decor, modernly designed bars, fancy suites with balconies and panoramic views, and the atmosphere you see in James Bond films.

I've been fortunate to have stayed in the Wraparound Suite twice. Huge room, perfect for groups.. and with the entire corner balcony open to the view of the center of the strip, it's pretty amazing!
There was one king bed but so much living room\/sitting area to crash in, that it was not problem to fit a group of 7. The one Summer weekend we were there, some of us slept on the couches in the balcony.
You can't beat the view from here, day or night. The Cosmo is located in the heart of the strip so you'll have some sort of nice view wherever your room is.

I love the bars here, especially Vesper. They make some fine cocktails and use top-shelf, fancy-named liquor.

Marquee is one of the more popular day\/night clubs in Vegas right now.. always a fun but crowded time.

I think the Cosmo could have better restaurants. Wicked Spoon Buffet was good until Bacchanal opened and killed every other buffet. I like Secret Pizza though.. it's quick and pretty good(amazing when you're drunk).

Don't come here to find lower limit table games.. especially on the weekends. One time there were only $25 craps tables going on.

I had heard great things about The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas and was dying to check it out for myself.  Upon walking into the casino floor from the Strip entrance, I was really digging the decor, the HUGE crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling.... and that's pretty much where my awe ended.  I understand this place is the ""it"" place of the moment for the 20s to early 30s crowd but my sister and I were totally floored by what we witnessed in the 45 minutes or so that we were there.  There's giant hot pink high heel in the middle of the floor when you walk in and there were a good amount of girls dressed in their clubbing-best taking pictures while standing in the high heel, so that was ok.  The casino walkways were way crowded with those who had gotten out of the club (Marquee) or one of the bars there.  Many douchy-looking guys using profanity and slurring their speech so you know they were almost done for the night.  Another review called the casino floor ""claustrophobic"" which I very much agree with.  The ceilings are low, the decor just looks like a mess with so many drunk people wandering around trying to find their friends.  

And I know there are many girls out there leave their hotel room dressed to the 9s with 5 inch heels on only to give up a few hours later and walk the floor barefoot.  I saw more barefoot girls in here that night than walking around anywhere else at any other casino.  There's a Walgreens very close by where they sell some of those Dr. Scholls ballet slippers you can carry in your purse.  There was so much of this going on.  Nothing classy and hip about that AT ALL.

On another side note, as we were leaving, a friend we were with had a broken bottle thrown in his direction right outside the casino doors (WTH?).  And my husband said the men's restroom was filthy, which I was surprised by, since I have never seen a Vegas hotel with a dirty restroom, but perhaps because of the clientele roaming around???  And one more thing, hardly anyone uses the slot machines at this hour so the drink girl will never pass by you if you're playing on one.  

If you're into being claustrophobic, around a large amount of obnoxious 20-30 somethings,  waiting for a drink girl to serve you, and watching a bunch of girls walking around barefoot with their makeup running, stop by The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.

My favorite thing to do in Vegas is just walk around and see the designs of the hotels. On my last visit last year I stayed on the far end of the strip so I didn't get to see the Cosmopolitan. This time we stayed at the Aria so I was able to walk around easily to 10 different hotels.

I originally heard of the Cosmopolitan from the Ovation art channel. On the ""Art of Vegas"" episode the Cosmopolitan was featured as the strip's most artistic hotel. I would say they are pretty on point. Everything about this hotel is absolutely over the top and fabulous. 

When I walked in, I asked one of the workers if she knew where the artist in-resident studio was and she said that she in fact did. Actually her job is to just greet guests and show them around and be hospitable. I told her what an awesome job that is. She basically just walked around and showed me things and talked to me. If I ever move to Vegas I want that job. 

The artist in residence studio is located on the third floor next to the pool table. Unfortunately I couldn't see the artist because s\/he only works at night. But I think it's cool nonetheless. 

The most spectacular over the top thing I would say is the bar chandelier. It cascades from the top ceiling down to the ground floor and the bar is inside. I mean who wouldn't want to have a drink inside a chandelier?

All the lights are dimmable and controllable by the phone, wall switches and more.  Service is quick and just a click on the LCD phone screen or television away.  Valet check out is done by scanning your tickets and the car us ready in record times.

Look for Secret Pizza and make sure to set your alarm clock via the phone to wake you with pleasant sounds, music, TV, and automatic lights.

Despite how popular this place is (it was named one of the best new hotels for 2011), I found the service more friendly and less pretentious than I've experienced at several other top tier resorts in Vegas and that fits me fine.  

Cosmopolitan accepts all credit cards, including American Express.",3,1,3

We had the Terrace Suite with a spectacular view of the Bellagio lake and the Strip. The suite is ideally for two people but it was spacious enough for about 5-6 people. The only problem would be that there's only one king bed and the couch which is not a sofa sleeper. There are 2 full size bathrooms. One bathroom is near the entrance of the suite with a shower. That bathroom was pretty big. The 2nd bathroom is in the bedroom with a shower and a tub. Very huge bathroom. There's a small kitchenette area and oddly enough, there was no coffee maker. There's a little dining room area. The living room is spacious and has a sliding door to the balcony. The bedroom also has a sliding door to the balcony. The balcony is long with some lounge chairs. the suite is bad ass! Nuff said!",1,0,0

I am no fan of casinos, and it takes a lot to get me to go to the strip in general.... but when I heard that Cosmo had brought in Best Coast (awesome indie surf rock band, of whom I am a big fan) to play FREE shows, I was sold.  The band had a 4-day stint, playing two shows a night.  And they drew in a crowd rarely seen outside The Beat or Beauty Bar, aka hipsters.  Brilliant! This is what I mean.  Cosmo is looking at new ways to bring in and entertain a different clientele.  Very smart, and I look forward to more indie bands playing there (which LV is sorely lacking in terms of entertainment options.)

OK, so my night started out great thanks to Elnino F's quick tip on parking (garage is on Harmon right across LVB when coming from the east).  LOVE the high tech garage with numbers of available spaces clearly posted for each level, and the red (full) and green (empty) lights above each parking space.  Damn that's clever.  

But probably my favorite thing about Cosmo is the design.  Not the decor, which is gorgeous and all, but the floor plan.  The focus is vertical, not horizontal, so there's none of the labyrinthine feel and accompanying sense of hopelessness at ever being able to escape while walking through.  The casino is limited to one floor, with restaurants, lounges, and shops upstairs.  It's so easy to get around and find things.  

Ok, so it's super pretty and cool too.  Sound and Stage is slated to bring in more indie bands (yay!); Chandelier is doing amazing things with mixology at prices that don't break the bank (~$12 for fancy specialty cocktails); and at the very least, China Poblano and Jaleo have lots of vegan options for eating.   This place has tons of potential!",5,1,4

I booked room three month prior and ask for a good view room of the range that I paid. Which is $1500.00 for 5 nights. For special occasion, my mom birthday and her first time to Vegas. But when we got there, I have to ask for it again n just end up w a room at the east end tower which the view is the west end tower. It doesn't look as good as online pics. 
The room was dusty. No happy birthday card. No champagne. And we had the Under the sun package which is a little gift set of sunblock n stuff. They didn't give it till I had to went down to reception the next day and  waited in line for 20min to ask for it. The only good thing is the room was spacious and comfortable. However the fridge and counter was fully stocked. There barely room to put anything there. 
Doesn't deserve a four stars. 
The hotel look great. But the staff aren't that great. I think they would treat people who are high rollers or have a suite better than those blue collar. 
To them $1500 aren't much but I worked hard to have a good weekend w my mom for the first time in Vegas but got very disappointed. Definitely try a new hotel next time.",2,3,0

I love this place because of the crystal and pink chandeliers, the big stilettos you can take pictures with, the cool amenities in the rooms (changing the temperature and lights from the touch of your tv remote, holla!), the swanky lounges, this lounge area with a public pool table, lovely decor and art, variety of eats (check out holsteins and the secret pizza place behind STK) and the super comfy beds.  Great hotel to stay in for my birthday, thanks mi amore! xo

The rooms are pricey during the weekend, though I don't know the exact number.  We stayed there sunday till tuesday and it was still over 200 bucks a night.  I hated the pool area (not the one in Marquee) because it was small  and cramped with not a lot of free seats.  The loungers around the pool were by reservation only, so not sure what the process is for that.  It's not even a real pool, one of those wading ones that go up to your ankles so basically it's bodies sitting in each other's water.  It was disappointing  to go there and have to turn back around because there were no seats.

But overall, this has to be one of the nicest hotels of the strip.  I would've given them a 5 if the pool area didn't annoy me as much...",4,3,2

I love the girly vibe with all the crystals, modern artwork and lush colors.  My friends and I booked a Terrace Suite, Terrace one-bedroom and a City Room.  All were amazing and clean.  I loved the suites because each had a balcony overlooking the city and a huge tub for some serious relaxation.  There was a lot of counter space and mirrors which was a plus for when a bunch of girls are getting ready to go out!

What I love about this hotel are the many restaurants, bars, shops and places to sit.  The restaurant selection was pretty amazing and our group chose to dine at Scarpetta and Wicked Spoon (both really really delicious!).  I was able to check out the Bamboo Pool which was relaxing and also Marquee Dayclub and Nightclub...always a good time when with my girls!

Not only is there plenty of cozy places to seat to enjoy the show but you can exactly see the stage and everything going on.  I do not like standing in the front because I am short and can never see anything. Plus I hate people stepping all over me and getting all up in my personal space.

My husband and I checked into the cosmopolitan hotel Thursday night, while entering the hotel there was a foul smell that was disregard by hotel staff. Upon entering our room my husband and I would completely in awe with the accommodations in the room. There was a see-through shower in front of the king size bed, A jet Jacuzzi tub that overlooked the strip of Las Vegas a large living room upon entering the hotel room very nice flatscreen directly from of the king size bedand plenty of space within this Terrace suite exactly what we are hoping for. Unfortunately my husband and I were unable to get any sleep Thursday night due to the sound of flushing toilets and running water and what seem to be a very loud electronic sound that persisted throughout the night. once morning hit I called down to front desk to express my concerns and was told what were next to a maintenance room and to pack our belongings and we would be moved to a new location by 130 in the afternoon, we were to expect a phone call my hotel staff with our new room assignment. My husband and I packed all of our belongings and waited around, we never received that call. We summed it up to be the hotel just running behind schedule and we went off to enjoy the show thinking when we returned all would be fine. we return to the hotel tired and exhausted from our day and no sleep the prior night hoping for a good night rest, unfortunately our room had not been moved and when speaking to front desk staff we were told the hotel was at capacity and that was not an option I asked to speak to the manager.
The manager John reach the front desk and informed us that the hotel is at capacity and there was nothing he can do about the smell of the hotel and very rudely said the only thing I am willing to do for you is move you to a two queen suite but your room would have to be moved again tomorrow I explained to John that we are wanting to have the same accommodations that we purchased and the frustration of not having our room moved as promised, when the rooms were still available. I explained to John that the room he's offering is not comparable to what we paid for and his reply was ""well this room has a better view but it's not the same as your previous room"" I explained to him we purchase the room because it was what we wanted and did not come to Las Vegas to look out the window the whole time"" we wanted what we paid for not a two queen downgrade. John was extremely rude and unprofessional and at this point started to speak to me very demeaning and I asked him ""if this is how you speak\/treat all of you guest?"" He replied ""Im not going to answer that!"" I asked for another manager above him contact information.
We went back to our old room to remove our luggage and bring to our new location. we were in complete shock of the condition of the new room as well as the downgraded amenities. The new room had no living room, the bathroom was next to the front door,two queen beds with TVs on opposite sides of the room the bathroom was not tidy, there were bleach stains on the carpet scuff marks on the walls and the size of the room felt like half of the room we actually paid for.
I am completely dissatisfied of the level of customer service we received as well as the conditions of the room and hotel itself, throughout the hotel there is a foul smell, the carpets are filthy and this experience has been nothing short of a nightmare all we wanted to do was go on vacation and celebrate my husband's birthday instead we are up long sleepless nights,moving from room to room,horrible service, disgusting conditions.",0,0,0

The place is gorgeous and super stylish and the hotel employees were super friendly and always helpful (vs the employees in the Wicked Spoon).  My husband's platinum status got us an incredible suite with a balcony overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  

 The 3 pools opened up a few days before our arrival and we checked out each one.  If I understand it correctly, there are 2 hotel-owned pools and one in the center that's not open to hotel guests at night without a cover charge.  We were able to check out any of the pools during the day and the door man was surprisingly friendly for what seemed to be a swanky spot.  Bamboo is furthest off the strip and very peaceful and mellow.  Boulevard was our favorite, with a big pool and several smaller pools, a DJ and lots of umbrellas.  Free ping ping tables and fun table games.

What might have been the coolest part of the hotel?  Art between the East and West towers on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th floors.  Tucked into a corner near the meeting spaces was a vintage Pez dispenser collection so it wasn't super high-brow but it was very unexpected and appreciated.

If your Marriott status provides free weekday breakfast, they give you free access to THE most amazing buffet, the Wicked Spoon.  What a great perk!

Only thing I would have liked to see was some drawer space.  What we had was more form and less function.

I think internet service is free to all guests.

I've also visited STK upstairs and Marquee Nightclub. Loved STK...Sat in the bar and ordered heavy appetizers that were recommended by fellow Yelpers. Loved the bread. The DJ there was playing old school 80s\/90s music so we were eating and dancing in our seats. Very enjoyable experience. 

Marquee Nightclub is definitely a hot spot, especially on a Monday night. Money is a must! Bottle service is pricey, but being women, we lucked out when three separate parties asked us to join their table. Typical party fun in Sin City!

Large, nicely appointed but it reminded me of a W Hotel or a newer Westin - certainly not a uber-luxurious 5-star resort on the strip.  There's a reason why this hotel is consistently rated below the major 5-star places in Vegas - they don't go the extra mile.

Good:  great location at the center of the strip.  Lots of stuff to do inside the building itself.  Beautiful shower\/bath area.  The level of detail in the construction was quite impressive... It looked like they had a great QC person during construction.  Balcony was nice.

Bad:  on the strip so sirens were frequently heard even near the top of the tower.  Kitchenette was laughable.  Cigarette smell.  No extra blankets or details typical of a 5 star resort.  Cheap iron, blow dryer, etc.  cigarette burns on the tables.  Battered walls.  Some light bulbs were out.  It may seem like I'm nitpicking, but what do you expect for the price and touting itself as a five star place.  The Trump hotel is nicer (more 5 star like) and they charge half the price!

Concerning the kitchenette - Cabinets were empty and the room had fewer glasses than any other Marriott I've visited.  Fridge was a stocked mini-bar with sensors so don't think about putting your champagne in there or you'll knock over the $9 bud lights (and they'll be charged to the room). Why is there a microwave?  If the fridge was usable, a microwave would make sense.  I'm sure when it was first opened, they had kitchen items in the kitchenette, but they probably cheaped out and took them away.  The room also had a slight cigarette smell with some fragrance intended to mask it.  Upon arrival, it smelled fine but then when we returned later in the night, it was more prominent.

Overall as my first visit to the Cosmo, I would have rather stayed at the Venetian or Wynn.  It would have been less expensive and they just feel nicer.  Disclaimer - Marriott platinum member.",0,0,0

This review will finally be a complete review including rooms since i finally stayed here

Valet:
excellent.  we drove in, had a guy show us where to pull up, instantly had us a ticket and had a bell hop getting our stuff off.  gave us some pointers on stuff to do until we could check in since we got to the hotel at about 10am and check in wasn't until 3pm.  never had a problem with them between the transfer of our bags, car, or anything

Check in:
i have to say, this is where i was very very impressed.  we came back to check in after eating around 12pm and figured me might as well try to get into the room.  they let us check in early without early check in fees which was very cool.  we ended up upgrading from our city room to a suite.  i originally wanted the terrace suite but they gave us the upgrade to a terrace studio and comp'd extra upgrade cost for a fountain view which was very cool.  well we got up to the room on the 34th floor, and it was smaller than the room i was wanting (the terrace suite is about 940 square feet, the studio is about 610 square feet).  within being in the room for no more than 5 minutes the lady at the check in desk called up to the room and said she wasn't sure if we got the correct room (the one i wanted) so i told her i didn't think so and she told me to come back down to the check in.  at this time there was already a line building up at check in, but she had me come straight to her without waiting in line and then upgraded us to the terrace suite for free which gave us a bigger room, better view, and put us 14 floors higher.  very good customer service, followed by her giving me a number directly to her for if we needed anything else.  they even comp'd us a roll away bed that is normally $30 + taxes a night.  Excellent service

The room:
very spacious, but the hallway from the door to the living room was a little odd.  we had 2 seperate bathroom both with showers and everything.  there was a master bathroom attached to the bedroom part that also had a large jacuzzi tub and was a little nicer than the living room\/hallway bathroom.  2 seperate sliding glass doors to the balcony which overlooked the bellagio fountains and down the strip, it was truly a fantastic view, and we were higher than the top of the bellagio (see my pictures).  The balcony was honestly one of the biggest selling points of the room and it was very nice to have and be able to stand outside before clubbing to get some fresh air and prep for the night, or to have a couple drinks as the night wound down.  the bed was very comfortable, and there was plenty space for the 4 of us staying in the room, however since there is only 1 bed and the roll away is pretty small, sleeping more than 4 might be a little tough unless people are fine sleeping on the floor.  *there is no pull out from the sofa in this room* so keep that in mind.  there was a full kitchen which was nice just to have the double freezer to put all our alcohol in, and the fridge to put our other stuff in.  but be careful, there are drinks on pressure plates in the fridge so make sure you don't bump them or else you might get charged, along with the pressure plates on the counter.  we had no problems with charges to the room here unlike aria the nights before.

Casino:
as in my older review for the hotel, the casino is amazing.  always looks good, always good people walking by to look at, and i actually win money here every now and then.  The cocktail waitresses are excellent and are ontop of bringing drinks and making sure you have a drink (in 45 minutes at the casino, i got 5 drinks).  the staff at the tables are also very nice and helpful when you are watching or gambling

restaurants:
some great places to eat here.  i love wicked spoon buffet and have been there a handful of times as it is probably my favorite buffet in vegas (still have to try wynn though).  Holsteins was excellent as well (read my review for there also), along with secret pizza (also read my review).  the only place here i don't care for for food is china poblano (read my review).

Players card:
it is a very good idea to grab a players card for here because anything you buy earns you points.  our meal at holsteins got us points, our pizza from secret pizza got us points, even drinks and money you spend at marquee will get you points.  either present your card, or just save your receipts and take them to an identity players card desk and they will credit you the points.  very cool and helps you get stuff faster which is always a plus

Check out:
check out was amazing.  in line people in ipads came up, pulled up charges, and if it was ok, then you could check out with them and leave.  super easy and fast to do

overall, excellent place and will be my new go to place",0,0,0

5 stars for the chandelier 
2 stars for the layout
4 stars for the location on the strip
4 stars for the rooms
2 stars for cleanliness

The chandelier is a showstopper all on its own. Everyone has to take at least one picture in front of it. Gorgeous. The hotel overall is classy, chic, and very modern.

I personally don't like the layout of the hotel and casino. It's confusing and not conducive after a late night of drinking. You might get lost. 

The hotel's location on the strip is perfect. You are smacked dab in the middle of Las Vegas Blvd. The only problem is that the parking garage and taxi stand areas are so small and stuffy. You will have to wait a long time for cabs because they don't have a large area to drive into.

The rooms are nice and comfortable. I saw the rooms on the lower floors and they were very cute. Had a cute sitting area and a very homey feel. The decor differs on certain floors. I was also on the 60th floor and these rooms were AMAZING! Roomy, ultra clean, ultra modern. Everything was top of the line. This is where is the celebrities stay. I like the rooms, I just don't like the drastic difference of decor among all the rooms. This high end hotel should have high end rooms no matter what the cost. 

Level of cleanliness kind of goes with the rooms. I thought the rooms were thoroughly clean, but the places outside the hotel needed a good scrub down. The hallways in the lower level floors looked horrible (see my picture). They were grey and dirty. Again, a high end hotel should have high end finishings everywhere.

Overall, it's a good hotel, but for the price you pay, I expect the highest levels of cleanliness and experience.",4,0,0

As you walk in you are given a glimpse of the Chandelier Bar which is a hip & styling bar\/lounge located on 3 floors of the hotel.  You can access the floors in a glass elevator or use the escalators.  Although I didn't get to see much of the hotel on my trip out I did love the bar\/lounge.  The Chandelier Bar closed at 4am which I find a bit early.  As we were leaving the hotel we had a late night snack craving and saw someone holding a box of pizza.  We found out there is a late night pizza joint open on the 3rd floor of the hotel.  The aroma as we entered the pizza place was amazing!  Unfortunately, due to the hunger nature of after clubbers, the line was way too long and the place was pretty small with not many workers.

I have seen a couple of the rooms and, yes, they're divine, but I couldn't sleep under the same roof where some of the worst rudeness in Vegas happens. 

The few times I've been here have just been unpleasant. I once lost my keys  and they were turned in. The security manager condescendingly asked me three times to describe them. First, after the initial description things weren't going to change much. I mean, I can be pretty creative when helping people understand what I'm saying, but keys just don't give me much to work with. Second, please don't be passive aggressive. I'm a potential money loser for you. You have no idea how many quarters I have in my purse so simmer down there, Mall Security. I mean, Cosmo security. 

The second form of rudeness happened at one of the bars. I won't tell you which one because I'm pretty sure the treatment is the same anywhere. Let's just say I haven't seen anything to disprove that. I was at a bar and the bartender literally looked right through me. How can you see through an American Express card with no limit? I would have thought it might have blinded him. Oh, wait, that could have been the problem. But, not really, because someone else walked up behind me and they ran to him like I was only there to bus the bar or something. Maybe, just maybe, the Cosmo has so much money poured into it every day that someone ordering a few top shelf drinks isn't going to add to that. Well, okay, you win that one. I promise to never spend my money in your bars\/casino again. 

I just can't enjoy a place that doesn't show they love me. I need love, Cosmo, seriously. Show it to me.",8,2,1

Compared to Aria, I was very impressed since Cosmopolitan puts Aria to shame for being a boring casino\/hotel or even realizing how stupid Aria's name is. However, the people who designed the cosmopolitan should be applauded for the design and overall casino\/hotel configuration.

The decor is amazing! There are retail shops towards the front facade of the cosmopolitan. In the casino area, there are several bars which most people were gathering. The way they setup this casino is conducive for people gathering and watching. I though the players rewards card for this hotel is very creative. It is called ""identity.""

Also, the waitresses at this hotel are actually sophisticated. They are not in skimpy trashy outfits like the other hotels. It definitely adds class to this joint. There is an abundance of art work towards the back of the casino area which I have to say is also very tastefully chosen.

First the good...location location location. The Cosmo is centrally located on the strip. If you don't want to have to check the car out every time you want to head out some where; this place is IT. The Cosmo caters to the 20 something crowd so if you are into people watching this place will work for you. Bell desk and valet was on the ball. They arrived when they said they will and even called me to let me know they damaged my car while in their care. It was barely noticeable so they could have just disregarded it I probably would never have noticed.

Wicked spoon had some unique offerings like bone marrow and made to order ramen but is it the buffet to end all buffets?...not even close. 

The not so good...

I found the front desk to be extremely condescending. I called for the grocery pkg but was transferred around like I'm the idiot. Nobody had a clue what I was asking for till I finally told them to check their website. It's listed under hotel amenities...

When they finally brought the table settings and food to the room housekeeping must have moved things around in the refrigerator so of course  I get charged up the neck because their cans of red bulls and smart water was moved off their sensors. I called front desk to let them know it was not me that their housekeeping must have set off the sensors while moving things into the ""subzero"" fridge so please remove the charges. Their reply to me was not ""oh sorry we will remove the charges"" instead she tells me to not move the sodas and alcohols around if I do not want to be charged because they are all on weight sensors...oh really you think! I guess she did not hear a word I said to her.

Empty beer bottles and water bottles were left outside on the wrap around balcony...just a slight miss by housekeeping.

Housekeeping could not figure out for me how to turn on the stove or why some of the lights did not work. Eventually I figured it out myself.

I was confirmed for a strip view wrap around balcony suite at check in but of course they don't have a room ready for me so then why confirm it...offer me something else instead...don't let me wait around for 2 hrs. 

I ended up in a 52nd floor west tower wrap around balcony suite... Still pretty amazing views of the strip and the fountains. 

I can keep going but I'm not going to nick pick this place to death. The Cosmo has it's crowd and it clearly is not targeting me. I will stick to the Mandarin, Aria, heck even Encore next time.",0,0,0

When we did go down however one of the conceirge's saw how much stuff we had and helped us on the sly.

Which she did indeed. This hotel was a perfect choice to just come and unwind. 

Our suite had a king bed with 2 bathrooms, full kitchen, living room and dining room areas. The best part was the balcony. This is the only hotel in Vegas with balconies. So definitely worth the price when compared to other modern hotels. The views are unbelievable! 

If,you want to enjoy the Vegas life, they have a club , plenty of bars, really good restaurants including the Wicked Spoon and Scarpetta, shopping, and of course you're on the strip, so you can walk about anywhere. 

Room service, bellboy service, and valet were all great and prompt. The food was absolutely delicious in room service.

From first look, it was amazing. We get to the room and in the bathroom I step on an earring the cleaning crew missed. Hurt pretty good, but anything could be missed. Later that night tried to use the tub (the main reason we were sold on the upgrade) and the drain was broken. After 30 mins of filling it was nowhere near full, but after playing with the drain, we Got it to hold some water with a face cloth as a plug, but we had to keep water going most of the time to make up for it and keep it reasonably full. At midnight it is not worth calling them to fix it. 
I Used the iron in the room to get ready for dinner and sure enough it transferred white paint to my clothes (someone put it back on shelf while still hot I imagine and melted the paint onto the iron). 

Day two we came back late at night after a wedding and found housekeeping had not cleaned our room. No towels no nothing. We called down and they brought a few up for us 

Awoken on our checkout day at 9 am by housekeeping. Doesn't make any sense to come into rooms on checkout day when checkout is 11. 

At checkout we were told they would comp our room upgrade and resort fees to make up for it. We found it to be a nice gesture and left feeling ok about our stay. 

A Few days later, sure enough we get charged. Call them up and they say they have no record of saying they will comp us.

The woman made us feel like idiots hinting that we had no idea what we were talking about and no on would have told us that. I have reviewed several hotels in Vegas, and we have been there about 15 times in the past two years, so we know what we are talking about. 
After fighting for it, they ended up refunding our room upgrade and our resort fee. They told us it was ""the least they could do"". Had it happened at the beginning it would have been a nice gesture, but at the point it occurred it was unimpressive. I would expect more from the premiere hotel on the strip. 

To be fair, there are good restaurants in the hotel, DOCG is great. And if you go to the vesper bar get yourself an espresso martini. Best in the world. It's also a great casino.

+A few good restaurants

-Dried up chicken and beer bottle caps in middle of room floor that we check in to 
-Potato chip crumbs on bed of room we just checked into (at least I hope they weren't scabs or anything. wouldn't be surprised)
-You need your key every time you use the elevator. Always at least 2 elevator card readers that don't work
-Check in lady told us about a champagne deal available throughout hotel (""at the pool we ask?"" ""yes"" she says) Pool had never heard of it.
-Wrap around balcony floor was filthy. Hello. Ever heard of a power washer?
-Pool was MINISCULE. You have to be there before it opens if you want a seat at all. 
-Pool loungers had white stains and cigarette burns on them. Gross!!!
-Most of the pool is in the shade for the latter half of the day and since it's so tiny, there's no where else to go.
-No customer service guys at the pool to move loungers\/sell daybeds etc. You have to track down an already busy waitress.
-This one security guy said he'd get 2 loungers moved to the sun for us. Never saw him again.
-Pool has like 6 food items on their menu. not enough!
-No resort fee so instead they sock it to business travelers ($15 for 24 hrs of wifi plus $20 to use the gym)

I have to say, however, the room was quite beautiful and had all the amenities I like - quiet, comfortable bed, nice shower, but was then charged a 29.19 wine fee, even though nothing was taken out of the minibar.

Par for the course on Vegas hotels.  The newest ones are always the nicest and the Cosmo lives up to the standard.  The rooms are ridiculous!  We had to walk through the shower to get to the bathtub.  I would definitely stay here again, until the next, new hotel gets built on the strip.",0,0,0

There's also a great selection of restaurants.  We ate at Scarpetta, Wicked Spoon and Holstein's and there are several others I would have tried if we had more time.  The location is good too.  It's very convenient to the Vdara, Aria and Bellagio, and not a bad walk even as far as the Venetian and the MGM Grand.  The housekeeping staff was always friendly.  The casino floor is smoky, as all of them are, but because this is a newer building, the smoke has not sunk into the carpets and upholstery the same way it has at the older hotels and so it generally reeks a bit less.  

The crowd here is less diverse than in other Vegas hotels I've stayed in.  At most hotels, there are a mix of young couples, older couples, bachelor\/bachelorette parties, families, etc.  During our entire 4 day stay here, we didn't see any families or anyone over 40.  It's all young people here and they're mostly in huge groups and falling down drunk.  It made for some interesting elevator rides.  It also made for trouble sleeping.  Our first day there (which happened to be my birthday) we were woken up at 7 am (after going to bed at 1 am due to a late flight) by the people next door yelling and blasting music.  We made a noise complaint but as far as I can tell the hotel didn't do anything.  I also wouldn't describe most people here as super attractive.  If you like the Jersey Shore look, then maybe.

We tried to go to the Bamboo Pool, which is described as the ""relaxing"" pool (obviously we didn't even try to go to the ""party"" pool).  Even this pool was packed and loud in the middle of the day, but it was quieter when we went again around 5 pm.  By then, the pool itself was littered with the day's debris though, including cigars and beer cans.  Gross!

Every time we walked outside the valet area (non-strip side of the hotel), we saw multiple roaches crawling around (and I've never seen one elsewhere on a Vegas sidewalk).  I never saw one in our room, but they fact that there were so many right outside the hotel made me wonder what was going on inside the hotel.

I would not come back here (although to be fair I always like to stay somewhere new in Vegas because there are so many options), but I can see how this would be a fun place if your primary goal is partying.",4,2,1

First thing is first, go get your ""Identity Card"" (the players card)  As soon as you get this, they give you $10 for free to go gamble, yes $10 for free to gamble. Go to the slots, put in a dollar to activate it and good luck.  I won $10 with this card.  So I made $1 into $10.  Yay me :)

The slots machines here are about .40 cents and up.  There's very few machines that are .1 cent.  The tables are about $10  minimum.  If you have the cash, go and gamble your money but if you're looking for a little less to pay, go and get your Identity card, spend it and go somewhere else cus this place gets pricey.

It was a nice experience and we loved the live DJ inside, with a mixture of all kinds of music.

The room was also very clean and I liked the style and how big the room was. We had a balcony outside and it looked right over the pool. The bed was very comfortable and they had everything you would need from a dishwasher to a fridge. The shower and tub were very clean. The bathroom was so big and I loved how all the lights were connected together and you could hit one switch and all the lights would go on or off.

First of all, it's not worth anywhere near what they charge for a room, this is not a five-star hotel, period.

The bathtub was dirty, the carpet was dirty, the glassware was dirty, and the furniture was disgusting. 

Got back to the hotel on Friday night around 11:30pm and decided to look in the directory book found on the desk in the room only to find a folded up piece of paper with a mound of cocaine still in it from the  previous guests. Most people staying at this hotel would have considered this a bonus but I've been sober for 6 years and wasn't thrilled finding cocaine in our wrap-around terrace ""suite"" to say the least. I called down to speak with the manager, Caleb, and he sent security up to deal with the situation. Security interrogated my girlfriend and I about the matter like we were at fault for the cocaine being left in our ""suite"". They made me fill out a report, which I doubt ever made it to a file for the hotel and then proceeded to say they would flush the drugs, which we never saw them do, they just left with the cocaine. The night manager wouldn't comp us the night and only gave us a $300 credit. They finally moved us rooms, which happened to be in the adjacent tower, mind you it was 2am at this point and we were dead tired. He was almost patronizing us through the process like we were idiots for turning in illegal drugs found in our room. We switched rooms and the people next door were yelling\/screaming the entire night along with slamming their door repeatedly. After a sleepless first night we left in the morning after speaking with the day-time manager, who handled things much better than the night manager. The day-time manager was extremely apologetic and was happy to do anything to make our experience with the hotel a better one.
 
We left and went to The Wynn, which by the way is the nicest and cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in. The Wynn saved our relaxing Valentines weekend together. The Wynn offers exactly what would I expect from a five-star hotel.

I shut the door on him and he came barging in the room asking for I.Ds.

The suite was lovely. It contained 2 LCD screens, platform beds, desk, and living room area with a comfy blue tufted sectional. The wallpaper had a beautiful ombré effect. The closet is spacious and comes with the basic amenities. There is also an additional blanket and pillows. There is a small kitchen section without a stove. What is provided is a microwave, sink, stocked mini fridge, and cabinets. The bathroom has a jacuzzi style tub with jets and a large walk in shower with great water pressure and a constructed bench. The toilet is enclosed with its own door. The patio has seating and a clear partitioner. The railing sticks out to prevent anyone from getting so close to where they can fall over the side. We were located on the 39th floor in room 3930 and the view was fantastic. Our room also gave a good view to the pool.

I love the visual aspect in the hotel lobby and how the columns are encased in large LCD screens displaying art. The ceiling is mirrored and there are chandeliers a plenty. We did not try any of the restaurants or order room service.

Hotel Food: 5 stars
This resort is beautiful. The room was immaculate, and the cleaning staff was very understanding with our late nights and throwing off their cleaning schedule. The amenities were amazing, and every food choice was outstanding from the wicked spoon to secret pizza.

Casino: 2 stars 
Although the rewards are very lucrative, the payouts were horrible on the machines we played on. The staff at the casino was not very accommodating and the floor coverage was non-existent.

Floor Drink Service: 1 star
I love to tip great service. The drink staff was very rude, slow (30-45 minutes per order) and expected tips every time I ordered non-alcoholic beverages. I completely understand this is how they earn a living...but, to stand there expecting a tip, for long awkward periods of time...scoff...make comments under your breath that the patrons can hear....is simply unacceptable. Then to ignore that patron because you weren't tipped is ridiculous. I simply will not tip for every drink you bring me that is a soft beverage that takes 30-40 minutes to arrive. No excuse for the attitude, and unprofessional behavior of the staff. 

The Henry: 1 star
Was seated immediately. We ordered a soft drink and a milkshake, and asked the waiter to return for the rest of our order. The milkshake order was incorrect, ordered chocolate, brought back a strawberry shake. We then spent the next 40 minutes waiting for someone to come by the table for our order and to fix the mistake. I then had to go to the hostess because our waiter was flatly ignoring us. They did finally fix our milkshake order, and prepped it to go....we no longer were willing to wait any further for food since it took over 50 minutes for our waiter to come back to the table.

The moment I stepped out of the elevators and saw pink chandliers...I knew I would like this place.

The Cosmopolitan is amazing from the outside and the inside. Outside it looks like a small thin building and then you enter the parking structure where there are huge silver letters spelling out COSMOPOLITAN.

When I stepped in there was fuschia\/purple carpet with matching leather seats. I took the elevator to the main casino and looked up and saw the prettiest and coolest chandliers I've ever seen. Pink chandeliers!

The pink chandeiers are just the beginning. From the casino to the hotel lobby to the conference room there are unique art pieces everywhere. Among some of the cool things I saw: a brown fabric couch with an antique black dial up phone, a white shell art structure, rainbow colored paper art pieces covering the walls, colorful structures of people and paintings of all kinds. The artwork and unique things to see go on and on at the Cosmopoilitan. It almost gives you a feeling tha are in an art museum instead of a casino. It's really too cool.

Their shopping area is neatly layed out too. They have a window like wall with different colored lights and an each panel is an item that you can find in their stores.

Even their lounge\/bar called The Chandelier is awesome in how it is set up (separate Yelp review for that).

The conference room areas for The Cosmopolitan is amazing too. It is so spacious. Plenty of sofas and seating. Perfect for a big conference.
Even in this area there is plenty of neat artwork on the walls and in various stands. There are large windows in the conference room area and the view is the beautiful Strip. Another neat thing in these areas are they have touch screens that map out where everything is.

I was also able to check out the pool area which is called The Boulevard. It is beautiful. There is an area where people can play pool right by the swimming pool. One main big swimming pool is surrounded by palm trees and you see the bright lights of the neighboring casino. It's such a relaxing and perfect place for a nice swim.

I also want to state how clean this casino was too. It's well maintainted. I also liked how it did NOT smell like cigarette smoke at all. It's pretty nice when you walk out of a casino and you don't smell like an ash tray.

The pretty in pink chandeliers was the first thing I saw and it truly was and indication that I would like this place. Clean casino, cool art pieces everywhere, neat places to shop, eat and drink and a beautiful pool area. I am a fan.",12,10,12

I've stayed here twice and both times I got the Terrace One Bedroom, which is quite a decent sized room.  Kitchenette, nice long couch, desk, closet, two TVs, a bedroom separated from the living area with a rotoscoping door, and a fantastic bathroom with a large walk-in shower and, in this particular room, a Japanese soaking tub.  It's not a tub you can really lounge in, but it's deeper than normal tubs meant for sitting like in a Japanese bath house (I think, never really been to a Japanese bath house).

The hotel itself makes you want to dress up and go a little classier than Vegas requires.  The casino itself is kinda small, but I'm not a huge gambler (only a couple hundred bucks everytime I'm in Vegas) so it didn't bother me that it was small.  

Try the Wicked Spoon buffet, which is absolutely fantastic and probably one of the best on the strip I've had.  Their asian food selection was kinda meh, but they had plenty of seafood choices and some unique spin on some dishes.  It almost feels like I'm at a tapas buffet because they serve almost everything in its own little dish so your plate is full of little dishes rather than a pile of food.  

Every room in the Cosmo has its own outdoor terrace which is rare in a Vegas hotel.  This makes the Cosmo room a great place to chill outside and have some cocktails and enjoy the Vegas view and breeze (or, if during summer, the searing hot winds).  

Be warned, if you want a quiet hotel at night, you either need to be on the West Tower or high on the East Tower.  The Marquee Nightclub and Dayclub are LOUD and, even on the 53rd floor, we could hear the craziness if we kept the terrace door open.  Even closed, we could somewhat feel the bass as the GF and I tried to sleep.

Speaking of the Marquee, it's still a super hot club in Vegas and the last time I was there (Feb 2012), ATB was DJing and it was an incredible show.  A table for 14 people was a 5 bottle min I believe.  I was sad we couldn't kill the last bottle of Grey Goose :(  But I know we were there from around 10pm-4am and I know I had a GREAT time!

The only downside is that because the Cosmo is a hot hotel, it's really hard to find a good deal.  The City Rooms are your basic hotel rooms with two beds and a bathroom and closet, nothing special.  I've not stayed in a City Room so I don't know if there's a balcony or not.  The next step up from the City Room is the Terrace Studio which I think you should start with at the minimum.  

I would say if you're paying at most $150 for the Terrace One Bedroom, you're getting a deal.  It's normally $300 or more\/night (during Thurs-Sat).",5,2,3

The hotel lobby is very upscale, modern and I especially love the pillars that they have with ever changing screens - I'm mesmerized by the pretty flashing lights and colors. 

I admired all of the glitz and glam spread throughout the hotel and casino. I love shiny, sparkly things and the massive chandelier was dramatic and incredible. 

We stayed in 2 different rooms here: 

The first one is the standard room and it had a great view of the strip and the Bellagio fountain. The room was spacious, new, and clean. I loved the sexy interior decor, art, and the beautiful wallpaper throughout. Super stylish! There is no bath tub, just a large walk in shower with a floor to ceiling glass window view to the bedroom. You can close the blinds if you prefer privacy, or you can keep it open for a private show. You pick. 

We also stayed in the well appointed king terrace suite with a phenomenal view overlooking the strip and the Bellagio fountains. It was such an uber swanky room! The room was long and spacious with  a great big suede blue couch in the living room area. It also has a kitchen sink area with a microwave, mini fridge, and dish washer. It had a nice spacious closet area with a large mirrored wardrobe closet and a cushioned chest to sit. 

The king bed was separated in its own room with sliding doors for privacy. The bed was ultra plush and comfy. The sheets were soft and crisp - I slept like a baby. 

The best part was modern bathroom! Jack and Jill sink, a beautifully wallpapered private room with a toilet, an incredible separated bath area with a beautifully tiled standing shower with a floor to ceiling view to the bedroom and is also connected to a gorgeous and luxurious Japanese soaking tub that has a opening to overlook the bedroom and a large window that overlooks the Las Vegas Strip and the Bellagio Fountains. The tub was so tastefully done and the view of the strip in the day and in the evening were exquisite! 

I spent a lot of my time enjoying the breeze on the attached terrace. They had a nice patio lounge set in their sexy blue theme color. I caught so many Bellagio fountain shows, I lost count. I would say that the terrace suite rooms offers the best views of the fountain on the strip. That view can't be matched. 

Both rooms were well stocked with toiletries from Co Bigelow - I love their products! They are travel sized which is never enough for my long hair, but the staff was very friendly and accommodating and refilled my stock with however many I needed. 

They are very dog friendly - My dogs are not small, one is  over 40 lbs and the other is 26 lbs. Upon arriving to our room, they had 2 gift bags on the bed for my 2 dogs filled with a portable potty bags in a Eco friendly wrist case and also bags of treats. The doggy park (not really a park) but an enclosed potty area for them on the pool deck floor was very small and narrow but it did the job. 

They also have the best restaurants there! We went to their Wicked Spoon buffet for brunch and dinner. But I prefer their buffet during dinner! Many unique, tasty culinary options and their gelato bar is incredible. Secret pizza is so damn delicious as well! Love the thin crispy fresh out of the oven pizza. Expensive, but worth it! 

Last but not least, hotel guests can enter the marquee nightclub free without waiting in line, which is great since that line can be rather obnoxious. I'm not sure if it's always free or at a discounted price, but the night we stayed it was complimentary.",7,2,3

The good: super spacious rooms, balconies, awesome bathroom set up, comfy beds, lots of restaurants, a few decent shops, cleaner and more modern than other options.

The bad: pretty much everywhere includes a 20% gratuity and then suggests tipping in addition. Either admit your prices are simply even higher than listed or cut it out. Most of our servers were good enough to deserve it but the set-up makes it feel like begging or nickel&diming which is about as far from ""a luxurious resort"" as can be. 
Our maids were actually pretty bad, and I've never really had an opinion on maid service before, as it tends to be quite standard. They didn't replenish any toiletries whether mini bottles were depleted or even thrown out altogether. We had several light bulbs out that were never replaced, making doing makeup in the gorgeous bathroom difficult. One day (out of 4) they never came at all. Another day they knocked and woke us, we asked them to come back later, they asked when, we said an hour, they said fine...not 10 minutes later we were awoken again. Then again after 30 mins from the original time, at which point we put up our DND sign. 
The hotel boasts 3 pools online. The Bamboo pool is quite short on sunshine...fine. Boulevard is very hard to find but we had great servers. Then there's Marquis...where we were told they aren't owned by the hotel or part of it so there are lines, cover charges, and sell-out issues even for guests of Cosmo. Online it only says non-guests face a $20 cover. This I found to be complete bs. Hotel can't claim it's a hotel pool when pool claims it is not a hotel pool.
Of the 4-6 shops one is basically those kiosks in malls where foreign people chase you\/call you\/harass you to give you a ""sample"" and then sell you something. What?! How can this be allowed in the resort? Again...begging...not appropriate\/relaxing\/luxurious. Do you see anyone outside the high end shops in Aria or even Bellagio screaming at passers-by?? No. C'mon now.
The mini bar is weighted, even in the fridge, which also leaves ZERO room for leftovers or anything you may actually want to use the fridge for. So when I knocked over 3 bottles trying to balance my Poblano leftovers between shelves I had to take it up with the front desk or pay $40 for nothing. Annoying.",1,1,0

I understand even some of the best hotels may get bed bugs,  but what is more infuriating is their lack of response to our claims.   We have been getting the run around from their staff for months.  

All we asked them to do was to compensate us for the inconvenience and a bed bug heater that we had to purchase on amazon to treat all our luggage and clothes.

We are definitely going to think of this place when we want to visit Vegas again.

I'm still recovering from the crazy weekend coupled with two grueling days back in school (i'm beyond 'Case of the Mondays' and it's finals next week), but I just had to note that the dayclub pool party Marquee holds is ANNOYING. Well, to be more accurate, it was annoying because I was trying to nap when I first landed in Vegas where I had an insanely early flight (6:35am) and then had to wait for my room 3-4 hours after we checked in. Even though we were on the 29th floor, it didn't save us from all that bass flowing into the room.
If that is something you absolutely cannot stand then perhaps this isn't the hotel for you only because I couldn't tell you how you could avoid facing the pool and I don't know if they would actually give you the room away from it.

The noise level definitely knocked off 1 star off the rating even though Saturday it wasn't as annoying (I believe I started hearing music begin to play around 11am). It actually prompted me to wake up and start getting ready. Other than that, I enjoyed everything The Cosmopolitan had to offer.",1,1,1

Parking lot 5 stars again. For self park there are LED signs telling you how many open spots on each level, on top of that you have red and green lights to show open spots.

Concierge service 4 stars. We used them to help us book a restaurant in the hotel for a party of 10. The lady that helped us was very nice and ended up doing a seating of 6 and 4 as they did not offer a seating of 10, but she did put a note to seat us tougher. When we arrived at the restaurant they knew of the reservation, but said there was no note, and that they can do a party of 10. I blame the computer systems more then the people in this case.

Customer service was great. We had lost a room key and they have guys around the front desk just to help out for things like this. He asked us a few questions as we did not have a photo id, he requested the new keys, got them printed and we where on our way in just a couple of minutes. 

Check out 3 stars. Take a very very close look at your bill. We had been double charged for internet access, and we had mini bar charges. Everything got removed as we did not touch the mini bar, and we had paid for internet using a debit card and could show that we had paid for it already.  Front desk said that the internet thing was a new systems and they knew it had been an issue. 

Rooms are 3-5 stars depending on who you ask. I loved loved loved our room with a view of Beliago. We had a suite that had 2 bathrooms, a little kitchen area, living room, 2 TV's. While all of that was super cool there where a couple of odd things. There was only 1 phone, should of really been 2. One in the bedroom and another in the living room. Another things was the lights in the closet. The shut off automatically after about 10 min. That is nice to save power, but sucks when you want to go to sleep and you have light creeping out of the door jamb. Another couple in our party said the bath tub did not work very well, the motor for the jets ran, but nothing really happened. And another couple had an issue with water coming in from the ceiling in the bathroom. Maintenance said the upstairs bathtub was leaking or something, and basically said not to worry about it. For me the bed was just OK, bit soft and way too many pillows. I like a firm bed and firm pillows, but then again I was so tired from walking and drinking I did not really care.

Overall I plan on staying here again, I usually stay off the strip and save some money, but the Cosmo just does it right and I am OK with spending the extra cash and really enjoying myself.",2,0,0

I loved the bigger health club with the boxing ring and state of the art equipment.  I loved the free pools and had great times there.  I was thoroughly unimpressed with the Marquee nightclub and dayclub.  After a lot of hype, it was a big letdown and I stayed less than 1\/2 hour in both.

The Casino is smallish, but they have one of the few single deck Blackjack tables on the strip (most are standard 8 deck). Won $140 for about 20 mins of playing @ a $10 minimum too! Not too shabby.

One of the newest hotels on the strip, it is classy and classic... and definitely targeted toward the younger and affluent.  From the moment you walk into the lobby and then see the humongous chandelier that envelopes the Chandelier Bar.  Work you way up the escalator to the 2nd (or 3rd?) floor and you have a wonderful selection of delectably-delicious restaurants to choose from.

But I got a good deal on Southwest Vacation for the flight and stay. I booked a terrace studio with a balcony and ended up being upgraded to a higher floor and then paying slightly more for a view of the Bellagio fountains. That was the best decision, because the view and my room were breath taking. I'm not kidding... I wanted to spend most of my time on my balcony overlooking the beautiful fountains, the High Roller, Paris, and the mountains. What a special treat. My room was awesome: clean and large. My bathroom was huge! A walk-in shower connected to a large two seat Japanese soaking tub with a view of the strip. So this is how the better half lives! Lol the choices for restaurants are aplenty. We had the breakfast buffet at Wicked Spoon, and pizza several times at the Secret Pizza place. But there are also many other options within the hotel. The decor is modern and swanky. I was worried I was too old for this contemporary place, but there was a variety of people there. We even went to the Marquee nightclub for the Lebron James championship celebration (Go Cavs!) and even though the crowd was exactly what you would expect at a Vegas Club, there were some other people over 30 there to make me feel comfortable. I had great service at my check in by Jesse, and the concierge, Taylor suggested a great dinner option and made our reservation at El Dorado Cantina. The only complaint I have is regarding the mini fridge. All the food and drinks sit on censors so they can't be moved and there isn't any room for leftovers, or drinks, even though there's a microwave and partial kitchen within the room. But that's just a small complaint compared to the amazing time I had at the Cosmopolitan.

A few things I didn't like we're the carpet. For such a beautiful hotel, lobby, and exterior, the hallways leading to our room in the west tower were hideous. Also single ply toilet paper? I know this place make enough $$ to cover the fancy double ply Egyptian cotton ones. One last thing were the tables. Min. bet for all table games are 15$. But what you expect?

I just got back from a two day visit to Sin City, and stayed at Cosmopolitan. It's a bit confusing to get to the resort if you're not use to all these signs left and right on The Strip. As I drove in, I ended up at City Center which is not the entrance to Cosmo. I actually had to get out of City Center, back on the Strip and onto Harmon. The porte cochére is quite impressive. Self parking is state of the art. A subterranean level, SUPER easy to find parking. There are lights located on top of each spot. Sensors will let you know whether or not there is an open space. Blue lights means handicap, red light means there is a car parked, green light....bet your ass you better haul your rented Kia Sportage to that spot. You can spot the green lights as you drive down each level. I am really difficult to impress, but this caught my eye.

Registration was easy. The lady who helped me was extremely courteous, pretty, but had no idea where the rooms were located. She sent me to the wrong tower. Her instructions were very clear. ""Right behind you, take the elevators in the middle and it's to your right"". RIGHT MY ASS"", my room was not in that tower. I had gone back downstairs and asked for assistance. Security by the entrance of the towers did not even know where this room was!!! 30 minutes later, I find myself on the East Tower escorted by both security guards through the heavily filled casino.Tourists wanted to know who I was, as I walked in with dark shades, beanie hat, peacoat with the collar popped up. I felt like Angelina Jolie walking through Charles de Gaulle, but I was a bit pissed I couldn't find my room. I was dying to go drop the kids off at the pool...so alas!!!

Note to self, if you are planning to use this hotel as a hook up center for booty calls and prostitution...forget that idea.....you must use your key card every time you go up to your room to access your elevator. So even if you tell your prostitute to come on up to your room...you'll find yourself coming down everytime to pick up your 'sin'.  At first I thought this is amazing....great security....after so many booty calls and sin...I was tired. 

Rooms....SPEECHLESS. I had a one bedroom terrace suite. Very modern and the decor is impressive. Two plasma screens decorate the living room and the bedroom. If you're a shower and bath tub aficionado, this is your room. It has an extremely big Japanese sink tub along with an open space shower. It was heaven. The room is  very 'exhibitionsit' where you can see someone taking a shower from your bed or hop in to the Japanese tub from the outside. You have a big window that people from the other tower can look in. Another fun part of this hotel, each room has a set of binoculars....IMAGINE THAT! I know for a fact I was giving shows left and right when I showered and jumped into that tub.....I felt like Cirque du Soleil....""O"", but mine is called ""OH MY!!""

Here is the downfall on the rooms..housekeeping is a mess!!! They don't leave extra TP for you...if you tend to use a lot of TP to clean up after yourself, better grab the box of Kleenex....I had a BAD experience....they left me the box of Kleenex from the previous guests with only 5 tissues left, and the TP was not changed...so, after dropping the kids off from the pool as mentioned from above, I found myself calling housekeeping. They never showed up....my ghetto ass went downstairs and took a roll from the public bathroom located just outside of the East Tower entrance....HEY..you gotta do what you gotta do. I know they are slammed with  opening a new hotel, but there was no excuse for housekeeping to not leave an extra roll of TP in the drawers. They are all empty anyways.... All I have to say is that Housekeeping managers need to have a better check list than what they did.. they forgot a lot of stuff when the following day. They took away my soap and didn't replace it. And to call housekeeping to bring something to you....FORGET IT.... so I used my shampoo as handwash. I couldn't wait for housekeeping.

The casino, very cute and quaint, but small compare to other properties in Vegas. There is more bar square footage in that casino than casino itself. There is a cool pool table on the 3rd floor and some cool restaurants. No big names with the exception of Comme ça. The women that work there are super gorgeous and pretty. Great smiles and sense of humor. You can definitely tell HR at Cosmo are horny men with good eye for women. The men, mostly all the bartenders are also very handsome, but no sense of humor. They lack that extra umph of being a bartender. Yes, you're straight, but the men are the ones that shell out the dough for these drinks! Talk to us, fellows....don't be stupid. I noticed another fellow Yelper wrote that the females in his group liked the hotel better than the men did......that's because the bartenders are FUCKED UP.

Some mixed feelings, but overall the rooms are so superb (plus some unusual features for Vegas) and the design so interesting that I'll go with four stars. 

The lobby has lots of columns with digital images on them. It's definitely a distinctive feel compared to other Strip joints. Check-in did seem a little slow--thankfully there weren't many people ahead of me. I would not want to be here at a busy check-in time. 

When I got into the room (not until 4pm on a Wednesday, so don't plan on early check-in), it was literally stunning. It's really like a mini-condo more than a hotel room. All open with the living area at the door anchored by a huge curved sofa against the wall. The flat-screen is ginormous even by fancy hotel standards. There's a large closet and dressing area, then the bedroom beyond with a very comfortable bed and two cool circular bedside tables. Adjacent to that is... well, I hesitate to call it a bathroom. It's more a bathing area. You've got your sinks and WC, then through a glass door, a huge open shower area with opalescent tiles and beyond a step-up-and-in tub with a window overlooking the Strip. And where else in Vegas can you play with your rubber ducky and peruse the changing light on Paris and the Aladdin at the same time, I ask you? The tub is a terrific feature, though it's not a Jacuzzi and the levels of the two benches were not great for me. One too high (cold nipples), one too low (hard to hold a book out of the water). And getting in and out could be a production if you've had a cocktail or six.  There's also a terrace with the same view and a rounded-back lounger. The terrace is generously-sized. NOTE: The room described is the Terrace Studio Suite. If you're gonna stay here, spring for a room with a terrace. There's just nothing else with outdoor space on the Strip for mere mortals except the Imperial Palace and well...

Poked around the restaurant area (mostly on the third level) and had a late lunch at Comme Ca. Typical French bistro fare, well-prepared but nothing really distinctive. None of the restaurants really seemed to have a distinctive feel to me, but that was just from poking my head in. Most are open to the central area so you can survey them all. 

There is a distinctive bar set-up, with the chandelier that rises through several levels. It's hard to describe this feature except that it is beautiful and elegant and lends a continuity to the different levels of the hotel. 

Nearby, Julian Serrano at the Aria is still a fantastic spot to nibble your way through a tapas lunch--anything seafood I've ever had there is fantastic. The white sangria is heaven, and if you sit at the bar, the staff is a font of local inside scoop. Next door to that, Todd English's P.U.B. is still going gangbusters and has friendly beer-wenches in Hooters-esque gear slinging a wide variety of suds.",3,0,0

Oh, and if you have kids....3 words..Leave them home.  Vegas is not a place for kids especially at this hotel.  Take them to Disney or Universal Studios.  This is my Disney and I do not need to see kids.  That is why I left them home with Nonna and Nonno",0,0,0

Everybody from the front desk, to security, the wait staff, and the bell desk were amazing. They are fast, efficient, and happy to help. 

We were told the security deposit was computed daily and was going to be over $500 alone. While not a deal breaker, it certainly seemed like a hit we didn't want to take and tie up money we could spend elsewhere. We mentioned it to the desk staff who then politely excused herself and returned a short while later saying she had spoken to a manager and waived the security deposit for all days except our first. No doubt being a couple on our anniversary made it more agreeable than a suite having a party, but it was nice to see a human face rather than blind obedience to a written policy.  

While in transit to our room security stopped us to discuss our cooler. We had a bottle of vodka, some beer of my liking, and champagne for our room. He said they had a policy against coolers but could certainly understand our desire to have some personal beverages in our room. He seemed satisfied that we weren't going to have any wild parties in our room, and politely told us to enjoy ourselves while making some recommendations for dinner. 

The rooms were AMAZING with a view of the Bellagio fountains. The deep Japanese tub and room layout was exactly what we had hoped.  

The Vesper bar made one of the best martini's I had ever had and the entire experience, while not cheap, was perfect. We liked the absence of loud boisterous crowds and the general atmosphere was people looking to have a good time and enjoy Vegas. The giant high-heel shoe was a fascinating attraction to my wife and she took plenty of pictures there. 

The pool was the best we have been to. Small, clean, comfortable and with excellent bar service. A dozen other couples and us got together and socialized all day as we drank before moving along to dinner and dancing.

During my stay, I took in a show, shopped, dined, used their beauty salon and gambled all at this hotel. These were pleasant experiences. 

With that said, I will never return to this hotel ever again. I would rather stay with Brace from ""Gigolos"" than spend another penny at this hotel. The reason for this is because their finances and customer service are the worst I have ever experienced. 

If you look at my other reviews you will see I am normally a reasonable person. I try to take things in stride but I think this hotel's customer ""service"" has broken me. I only write this review to warn people: 
1 - Have $300 on your credit card available
2 - Don't split or make any changes to the card, they can and will screw it up with no apologies
3 - Upon check out, even if the lines are super long, wait and check out in person so you can have a physical copy and assurance you have been credited. 

I know I made some mistakes here but my overall frustration was with how terrible they handle their finances and the customer service is abysmal. All of my trust is lost with this place. I would have gladly referred my friends to this place if they hadn't been so awful after check-out.

- The entrance to valet or even self parking was nearly indistinguishable from an alley.
- Parking was terrible, the little space indicators are always wrong.
- Check-in took forever! I had to wait over 20 minutes and the person who checked me in didn't do anything other than hand me my room key (though I have to admit it was cool that all the stations had iPads to show the charges, but it was a bit excessive).
- The nice view is in the EAST tower, which I didn't get.
- The room (the terrace studio) had a HUGE window overlooking the shower! Granted there were blinds, but that was controlled from outside the bathroom! Definitely not recommended for groups!
- The rooms were controlled by the tv (lights and climate). Very high-tech. The phones were difficult to navigate.
- Service was slow. The concierge had no answers for any of my questions and they took forever to even answer the phone.  They also took 1.5 hours to bring me my hypoallergenic pillow (I requested this before check-in, along with extra towels and a feather-free room, none of which were available).
- Check-out took another 30 minutes. And don't even get me started on the person at the front desk again. They were argumentative and not big on the explanations.

The Jaleo is a Spanish tapas restaurant. Service was pretty good. The food came out slow and the portions were really small (yes, I'm aware that tapas are small portions, but these were ridiculously small). It was expensive too! The food was a little strange, too salty. The only thing I liked here was the grapefruit sorbet and flan.

The Wicked Spoon Buffet was supposed to be one of the best. If that's the cream of the crop, I'd be afraid to ask what the worst of the crop would be like...
- The line was long for dinner, and it was expensive too. So, we opted to leave. When we came back for brunch the next day, the price was the same as the dinner. Good thing I had a gift card, so I decided to try it anyways.
- The servers didn't bring refills for our drinks even though we had asked for it, until 20 minutes later. The place was nearly empty since it was still early.
- The food was mediocre. I don't know what everyone is raving about. The only good thing was the mint chocolate gelato and the ""Korean"" spare ribs. That was definitely not worth $40 a person.

Most of the clientele were jerks. Needless to say, I will not be returning here. Not for a stay, shopping or food.",3,3,0

The resturants in the hotel were incredible and the service was out of this world. Not a bad thing to say. 
The reason I could not give them a 5 star was the customer base. I am not old or a prude however, we felt a little out of place at times. Kind of like everyone was too cool for school. The crowd was younger - i am guessing its because of the day\/night club in the hotel. Plus the pool parties were big hits. It brought in a lot of people and there were many times we witness people starting fights, being drunk, girls walking around in dental floss bathing suits and high heels (which was kind of funny-never thought that was a good look).

1. Allows guests access to the balcony (never experience a Vegas hotel that allowed for this [i.e. The Palms\/Palms Place locked the balcony door preventing guest from accessing it])

2. Had our room upgraded to the 1 bedroom suite in the East Tower, on the 56th floor for $80 total :D

Negatives:

1. The architect who designed the entrance to the Cosmopolitan failure utterly to take into consideration differentiating a drive way lane for guests\/valet and taxis. My friends and I checked in around 11pm last friday night, it literally took 45 minutes front the car entry way to get to the valet because 2 very narrow lanes were the only way to get to the entry point and valet my car. 

2. The Cosmo has to be the only Las Vegas hotel i've ever stayed at that would not allow me to call the valet from my room phone for the car to be pulled up while i head down. Not to the mention the average 20-25 minute wait for my car to arrive.

3. The one bedroom suite for $80 was a deal. But we were three guys staying in a suite obviously designed for a couple \/ voyeur porno \/ peeping tom. The shutters to the bathroom were controlled by a tab on the outside, and the  ""window"" next to the bathtub did not even have a glass window, only wooden shutters, through which anyone could come as go as they pleased. Not to mention the fact that the sliding door did not lock and the shower\/bath was seperated from the sink area by a see through glass door. The lack of privacy was unacceptable. [reception guy screwed up big on that one.]

4. The pull out sofa in the living room was basically just springs...the sad excuse for a mattress might as well not have even been there. 

5. The entire mini fridge was stocked full of over priced drinks and gave us no room to put any water or our drinks inside. When I called and asked the front desk to remove the unwanted items in the fridge they stated to us that, that was not possible. [all the other hotels i've stayed at either removed the items or never even had them there in the first place.]


- Oh an we went to Marquee for the first time, Armin was playing that night. XS is way way nicer and larger than Marquee. I'll never be going back there again.

If staying at a fancy Vegas hotel makes me pretentious, so be it! A little pretentiousness never hurt anybody and you bet I'm gonna brag about the fact that the BF got us a Terrace One Bedroom at the Cosmopolitan! Nevermind the fact that I stayed at the Polo Towers for my last Vegas trip. The Cosmo is a billion steps up. I'm moving up in life ;D

The casino did me right! I sat down at a slot machine and doubled the BF's $5 in my first hit. Cashed out! ...I'm not a big gambler. lol!

The entire design and decor of the room is classy, hip, artsy and sexy. I loved all of the art on the walls, accenting wall paper, the color scheme, light fixtures, and furniture. http:\/\/su.pr\/1qcmi9 http:\/\/su.pr\/2WF8IA

One of the unique features about the Terrace One Bedroom is the Japanese Soaking Tub which is AWESOME! The shower is also interesting. There is a glass panel in between the shower and the bedroom. Ok, so it is voyeuristic. I'll let you imagine how playful that could be with the right partner! But there are retractable wooden blinds on the bedroom side if you're shy.

The bed is one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever stayed in. It has an excessive amount of pillows which can be annoying at times but I'd rather have too many pillows than not enough.

Our balcony had a great view facing the Aria, Mandarin Oriental, Planet Hollywood, MGM Signature, Marriott's Grand Chateau, and Polo Towers (lol!). We were on the 53rd floor and could see the pool area below us. Be aware that we could hear the Marquee Nightclub\/Dayclub music every night (and sometimes during the day). Even if we closed our sliding glass door, the bass still came through.

One downside about the room is that the mini fridge is stocked full with drinks. It's monitored by this weighted system so if you move it, you get charged. We bought our own drinks across the street from Walgreens but couldn't fit them in the fridge. There is space in the freezer so we ended up freezing our bottled water then defrosting them overnight or during the day while we were out. The kitchenette counter top was also stocked with snacks and goodies monitored by a weighted system. FYI, they charge you if you use the wine bottle opener because we got charged $7.50 for accidentally moving it. But a quick call to the front desk and they removed the charge :)

Also found on the kitchenette counter top's monitored weighted system for your (ahem!) convenience: http:\/\/su.pr\/8ey6l4

I loved staying at the Cosmo! A big part of me feels that this will spoil me for future Vegas trips. I expect upscale fanciness from now on! :D

Okay, so this place does attract a certain pretentious crowd. In fact, I'd like to end this review with a very douchey situation that happened to us while waiting in the taxi line. It was 7:45pm on a Saturday and the group in front of us looked like they were dressed and ready to hit a club. Maybe a pre-party since it was too early for a club. Anyways, there was about 6 girls in short tight dresses and one guy. Suddenly, the one guy decides that it's too hot in this line and just nonchalantly removes his shirt. HE REMOVES HIS SHIRT!!! Trying too hard to impress these women much??? I had to restrain my laughter as he stood there shirtless while trying to have a normal conversation with these women. They didn't seem all that impressed either ::eye roll::  LOL ;P",6,10,5

Our first time staying here at The Cosmopolitan and we enjoyed every bit of this place.  It's in the middle of everything so everything is just a walk away.  


WHATS IN THE ROOM??? 
---books---yes they have lots of books for you to read or glimpse through pictures
---bed with a tv that looks out to the view of Bellagio water show
---a closet with an iron and two robes 
---a living room with it's own tv ( that's right Cosmo have two tv screens) 
---a mini snack bar counter (NOT FREE )
---a microwave\/dishwasher\/sink
---a mini fridge with COSMO's drinks\/liquor (NOT FREE).   There is space at the bottom inside the fridge for you to store your own drinks and you can control the cold temperature to your desire.  
---a big bathtub
---a sink with two separate sinks which included a hair dryer in the drawer below. 
---a separate shower---( the water temperature is a little tricky to control so test it out first).  Their shower is very similar to Aria's shower which is big and spacious and the water is strong so that is a plus! 
---a separate restroom with an AIR VACUMM----NO WAY---YES WAY ( this is the first hotel that I have stayed in that actually have an air vacuum so far---HOORAY COSMO)  :) 


CLEANLINESS: 
----BED\/TOWELS:   when it comes to hotel I'm very picky to the bedding the most.  I like WHITE BEDDING because you can see whether or not the sheets are clean.  I don't like colorful bedding cuz they hide the stains and who knows what else is still stuck on the sheets.  This is also same for towels and pillows too.  I'm sure you would also agree to this. 
--TIP:  bring your own pillow if you can't sleep on their pillows.  


MATTRESS:  ok about the comfy of the mattress,  I guess their mattress was a little bit too soft for me???  I mean it's very comfy like most bed.....I'm not sure somehow I woke up aching or maybe I'm not used to the comfiness...haha :) it's probably just me I know! 


AMENITIES:  Cosmo gave us mini bottles of: body lotion, toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash (yes they gave us toothbrush\/toothpaste\/mouthwash--once again only seen this from Cosmo so far), bath\/soap bar, shampoo\/conditioner\/shower gel\/ear swab\/cotton balls. 
----TIP:    bring your own antibacterial hand soap always.  


HOUSEKEEPING---they did a good job of cleaning our room during our stay.  Nothing was missing or touched which by the way is a plus right there.  


OVERALL:  get a room with the view to the Bellagio water show\/ Paris Eiffel Tower (it's very beautiful at night).  Cosmopolitan is in the middle of everything so it's very convenient to walk from one place to another.  Try out their ""secret pizza"" and wicked spoon buffet... Take beautiful pix at the chandeliers.....take funny selfies with your love......enjoy the water show and the beautiful view at night from your room.",2,0,2

The hotel rooms? Aint cheap...I checked and it was $300 for a normal regular size room. I'm not sure if this is their normal rate (certain events hike up the prices like boxing event and such)

First of all, i love everything about it.  The pool, the hotel rooms, the chandelier bar, the buffet, and the nightclub.

I have always enjoyed my time here and its such a wonderful place to relax at the chandelier bar and go bananas at the nightclub. 

The buffet is really good, the food is in little pots and plates which i liked it that way because its a good portion control and you get to try a little bit of everything they had.

Great hotel in the las vegas strip!",5,1,1

But, I will not be returning any time soon.  It is not a four or five star hotel.  Upon entering my room I found two people there that told me they were inspecting the room and the light in the bathroom stall needed to be fixed and someone would be right up.  5 hours later and sitting in the pitch black, they finally sent someone up after a second call asking to move to a new room.  The bathroom was better in the dark.  In order to get to the square small deep tub, that no one could ever be comfortable in, you needed to walk through the shower which by that time was slippery and dangerous.  The bedroom area was ""Gothart""...that means SMALLER than my dorm room at college.  There was a red stain on the floor by the bed that made me very uncomfortable.  I must say that the service was wonderful and the food pretty good.  The lobby is noisy and so was the room....all night long, with the patio door closed I was woken up by sirens and beeping horns.  I could not wait to return home to get some rest and take a bath. This hotel must be paying off websites to list them as the best.

The most annoying light was to the bathroom. It wouldn't always turn on. And the phone stopped working but front desk sent someone immediately to fix it. 

The people working here were very helpful and friendly. They helped us get into the Marquee nightclub, which was an interesting task, and let us borrow their tape to decorate the room for my friend's birthday. And hotel guests will always be able to get into the Marquee no matter the event. 

The pools were really nice. Since it was a little chilly, there were a lot of people lounging on the chairs and no one in the pool. And I love the Chandelier bar. Just so pretty.

It has the charm of the boutique hotels off the strip combined with the capabilities and service of any of the top hotel casinos on the strip. 

Shucks, even before I set foot the dang casino they were already thinking about me. The digital billboard telling you how many parking spots are available, the Shepard Fairy wheatpaste in the parking lot, cute lil green lights on the parking lot's ceilings to tell you whether a spot is open for you. I'm amazed. Then there's the DJs and performers they book. Anywhere else you're in the country you are gonna pay to see performers such as Mayer Hawthorne, Aloe Blacc, as well as DJs like Eleven and Cosmo Baker. Not at good ole Cosmo!

At the center of the hotel is the Chandelier bar---it takes up a good 3 floors and has probably a dozen or so bars---you literally have drinks inside a massive Chandelier. Food selection is great too...be sure to check out Blue Ribbon Sushi;)

The rooms are massive---try to get upgraded to a corner terrace room if possible.

You know life is good when you look down on Planet Hollywood and Paris. The room was very well kitted out, tons of interesting art work and art books.

At check-in, the woman was lovely and gave us an upgrade for our special stay to a beautiful terrace room. Unfortunately, it went downhill from there. The shower opened into the bathroom and had a clogged drain. It flooded with over an inch of water into the LR, and after we reported it, they only cleaned up all the towels we had put on the floor, and we didn't know the drain had not been fixed until it happened again. They finally fixed it on the 2nd day but because they didn't properly clean the carpet, we were left with a squishy carpet and a horrible mildew smell for the remaining 2 days. The room had a great view, however, needs better sound proofing due to excessive street noise. Service was inconsistent. At the pool, our waitresses Dana and Ellie were attentive and very engaging. However, the birthday party was at Rose, Rabbit, Lie and despite an open tab, the bartenders in the ""Study"" were rude and literally had their backs turned to the room. We had to beg for drinks. For dinner, the food was good, but the service was only OK and the entertainment we were supposed to have in our area of the club never came, we were told due to a schedule mix-up. Overall, I was very disappointed with a stay that we had looked forward to for quite sometime. I have stayed at several of the luxury hotels on the strip, and this was the most expensive stay to date, with a result that prompted me to leave my first negative review for a Vegas Hotel.

Only 3 check in clerks with plenty of people waiting to check in.  Hope this is not a preview of what is to come.  Update: finally got checked in and they upgraded our room to one bedroom terrace suite.  I did hear the clerk next to us updating another couple so I am thinking they just gave us what they had available as hotel was 100% occupancy. We needed a refrigerator and it was delivered free of charge to our room.  Good location.  Update at end of our stay:  ok this was a nice hotel as pool area was nice.  I am not sorry we stayed here but most likely will not stay here again as I feel other places are just as nice and rooms are most likely just as nice.  This hotel does have a private terrace for each room so that is a plus as many of the hotels to not provide this.  The main thing that really bothered me was the shower.  There was no controlling the water for hot and cold and seemed to work hap-hazardly.  Lastly the hotel does not go over and above anything.  We asked for late check out as our flight does not leave until 10:45 pm so we are getting another room for the day at Westin to hang out until we have to go to the airport for our long journey home.,0,0,0

The suite was beautiful and overlooked the fountain at the Billagio Hotel.  I was very disappointed with the check in process as it took them 4-5 hours to get you in your room.  The gaming is really bad there and the clientele is a younger group on the weekends.  What was disgusting to me was seei g all the young hoochie mamas dressed like street walkers and throwing up all over the place because they drank too much.  I liked the hotel but don't think I will go back again.,0,0,1

They are so comfy and soft and soft and comfy. Not to mention, the view from the bed is quite a view, and I'm not talking about the view out the window. When you're sitting on the bed, directly in front of you is the shower and jacuzzi, and tv of course. The shower and jacuzzi are separated from the bedroom by glass and blinds. However, the blinds are controlled from the bedroom side, so if you're getting bored of watching tv on your bed, you can watch something else by opening the blinds.

Not only are the rooms amazing, but everything else about the hotel is too. It's so pink and glitz and glammy. It also has Marquee day and night club. So fun and glamourous.",4,3,4

Long story short: no one cares--except for that nice lady at the front desk. We weren't comped in any way after being burglarized. The security of Cosmo said they did not have cameras in hallways and have no way of knowing whether or not someone broke into our room. We were redirected about five times and had to walk all over Cosmo to find security\/help desk\/management\/investigators who redirected us over, and over, and over, and over, and OVER AGAIN. In the end, there was no resolve. Management told us filing a police report would be ""useless"" because the police department won't be opened until Monday? We were checking out Sunday. It's funny how such a ""high-class"" hotel is so lacking in its security department. This whole shenanigan wasn't worth our time for what we paid for. You decide for yourself whether or not this kind of experience is worth it for you. 

Did I mention this all happened on my 21st birthday? Thanks again, Cosmo.",9,3,1

It's slightly higher end, it's new-er, it's trendy and now that I'm not graduate student poor, I'll splurge a little. Also, I always book through Visa Signature because you get additional perks like VIP status, $25 food and beverage credit, automatic room upgrade, etc. The best perk for Cosmo is the free breakfast at Wicked Spoon that's included, which is one of the big reasons why we stay here. Especially considering it's $35\/pp for breakfast on the weekends that's like getting $70 more. You're also entitled to check in at the VIP autograph lounge where there's coffee, water, paper, and shorter lines.

Despite being not so new anymore the hotel is still ""hot"". It's trendy, a lot of people my age and slightly older stay here. Though I hate Marquee (their club) with a passion, it still seems really popular. They've got a few bars, like the chandelier and Vesper which are cool hang out spots and have great, albeit expensive drinks. It's just a ""happening"" hotel still so staying here is really convenient, you're part of the action automatically by virtue of being present. It's great for people like me who enjoy shitshows but don't want to partake. Their location is also excellent, we never had to drive once. It's across the bridge from miracle mile shops, walking distance for walgreens and earl of sandwich. We also somehow walked all the way to NYNY too for shake shack. Either way, thumbs way way up for not having to grab cabs or ubers the entire weekend. 

I've stayed in the Terrace One Bedroom and also the Terrace Studio. Obviously the bedroom is more expensive because of the Japanese soaking tub but the studio has the jet tub. Either way I find both comfortable, there's a large living area, a kitchenette, super soft king sized bed, big closets and a terrace. Their suites are pretty massive anyway so it's great to have your friends over and hang out. The mini fridge is slightly annoying because it's all rigged with temptations, like a can of coke for $6 and you can't use it to chill your own drinks unless you put it in the freezer section. There's rigged snacks and shaving kits, etc on the counter but there's also a mini bottle opener for free you can use which is thoughtful! I panicked for a moment when I tried to open my wine and had realized I didn't bring a bottle opener. Appreciate the touch! 

They've also got very nice quality robes and slippers and C.O. Bigelow toiletries! Usually shampoo\/conditioner from a hotel is total crap but theirs is actually decent. The rooms and hallways show wear and tear but they've done a decent job of covering it up. I imagine in a few years they'll need to redo carpeting and give the place a fresh coat of paint. Also, Cosmo is super clean and reminded me a little of my private undergraduate university, people are cleaning ALL THE TIME. It's ridiculous, you can see people cleaning 24\/7, everywhere. There are many people who work very hard to maintain the hotel so be nice to them!!! Tip generously. Aside from this the casinos are also one of the cleanest ever, somehow the cigarette smoke is absorbed and dispelled elsewhere so you don't stink of cigarettes while you walk around. 

Parking is free which is great and may no longer be a perk we can enjoy in vegas much more, staff are courteous and nice. I wish they were a bit more clear on the perks for booking through visa signature. I've done this twice and each time they forget to tack on the $25 food\/bev credit so I always have to go down to the check out desk. Either way, I always have a good time here and it's really appropriate for where I am in my life now that I don't want to get dressed up, wait 20 minutes in cold for cab, get ripped off, get in line for 40 minutes to get into some dumb club. I'd rather have one nice $16 drink than a bunch of Fat Tuesdays, this is the hot yuppie hotel for me! 

Also Yelp just reminded me by asking ""good for kids"" the answer is NO. Vegas as a city unless you're doing something wholesome like seeing the hoover dam or grand canyon is NOT good for children. My friends saw a couple with a damn STROLLER at 11PM at night in the elevators here. A drunken person almost ran into their stroller\/baby and it's vegas, can you REALLY blame the person for being drunk in sin city or the irresponsible parents who are keeping their infant out past 11pm? Ugh, just think through what you're doing parents.

One FINAL thought, I HATE the bathroom walls. I've posted a picture and you can see it's black wallpaper with a repeating silhouette of conjoined girls dancing or something and when you're hungover or puking it's THE WORST. It makes me dizzy when I'm sober so when you're drunk? *shudders* Just No.",14,8,7

Rooms here are spacious and classily decorated, the bathroom is huge, and there are a ton of mirrors to accommodate a ton of girls getting ready for a night out in Vegas.

Service was awesome here.  We came back one afternoon and our room REEKED of marijuana.  One call to the front desk and someone was immediately up in our room spraying air freshener.  They later brought in an air purifier once we were out of the room to get rid of the smell.

The one pool I went to was really pretty.  The gym was okay.  It definitely has all the basic cardio and weightlifting equipment you need, but the view out the window was kind of gross (a rooftop\/wall of another building, if I remember correctly).

The room?  Nice size.  Good bathroom, well appointed.  The desk space was roomy too and the overall feel was just fine.

However, City Center is tough to get in and out of.  Best to walk to wherever you want to go or a quick taxi.  I parked my car and only went back for it the day I left.  Of course, had plans to scoot around, but it is a pain getting in an around the Strip these days.

I had room service and went to some of the restaurants.  The Henry for breakfast was god with good coffee and friendly wait service.

This was our third stay at the Cosmopolitan and the experience couldn't have been more disappointing. We had reserved a fountain-view, wraparound terrace.  What we also ended up receiving was a room above the Marquee Dayclub and Nightclub.  This meant unceasing bass both day and night.

Realizing this when we first entered the room, we immediately tried to get another one away from the club.  They said there was no other room available  None.  Try calling again at 7 the next morning.

Ok, we thought, we can deal with this for a night.  But for the entire five nights that we stayed we were stuck with a room in which we couldn't find quiet during the day or any peace at night.  The noise was pervasive and there was absolutely no escape.  The staff, with the exception of a couple of wonderful members, showed zero interest in trying to help us at all.  There was no warning that  staying in these rooms would mean having to constantly listen to terrible house music, nor any reduction of room rates because of it (I don't mean getting a comp, I mean having these room cost less because you would not be able to use them to actually sleep)

What was supposed to be a restful stay was instead a long, weary slog with so little rest that we are both looking forward to returning to our yelling toddler and our home, since that way we can at least get a few hours of rest when the child passes out from exhaustion.  The same could not be said of the Cosmo partygoers.

The Cosmopolitan used to be an eclectic place of art and music blended together (see Rose. Rabbit. Lie for the only remnant of that vision) but is now just a party scene flooded with drunk 20-somethings who fight and drink and vomit (not necessarily in that order) and while the management might be sympathetic to the problems this creates, they will do nothing to address it or aid you in avoiding it.",5,3,0

For one they charge quite a bit for the resort fee and on top of that they don't offer free parking for hotel guests even when we're paying that resort fee. So there really is no incentive or loyalty to customers that are staying at their hotel. It looks more like they're trying to nickel and dime as much as they can from their guests. A resort fee usually encompasses all amenities being offered at the hotel. Another issue with the hotel was that the elevators were really really slow, especially during afternoon to evening times. There is at least a 5 -10 min wait during those peak times. Comparing to other hotels on the strip that is way too slow and they need to seriously fix this issue. Check in times were also atrocious. After a long flight the last thing I want to do is wait 20 - 25 mins in line to check in. There was clearly not enough people working at the check in desk so these delays could've easily been avoided. The check in staff were very nice and courteous under those conditions and could've used more help to alleviate those lines. 

The room was decent sized, I had a king suite room which had a nice view of the Bellagio Fountain. However the room had no dressers so I had to find creative ways to put my clothes away. There was a closet with hangers but then there wasn't enough hangers either. The cleaning crew were decent but my cupboards on top of the kitchenette sink had opened containers of sugar, salt, cookies, wetnaps and some other things. It wasn't organized either so I don't know if the cleaning crew forgot to clean up from the past guests or if that stuff is supposed to be there, if it's supposed to be there then they should organize it a bit better. The toilet had issues where it would run constantly throughout the night so I had to occasionally flush it again to stop it from running. The light switches would also take forever to turn on the lights and sometimes I would have to press really hard just to make them turn on.

If you have a conference at the hotel and they offer a discounted rate then it might be worth it to stay there. But if you're vacationing there with no discount and with the really expensive resort fee and incredibly pricey parking fees added on top of that then it's definitely not worth it. There are cheaper alternatives on the strip. The hotel had nice views, comfortable bed and decent sized rooms. But with the negatives it really weighed down my overall score of this hotel. It's a shame it's a really nice looking hotel but there are just too many issues.",0,0,0

Unfortunately our room on the 58th floor overlooked a pool so we effectively attended the day party from our room..... VERY loud music and DJ noise.   I can only imagine how loud it was down at the actual pool!   I know most people won't be in their room in the middle of the day, but we were locals on a staycation so relaxation was the name of the game for us.   I didn't knock any stars off for this since again, most people won't be hanging out in the room during 

Despite the other reviews, we couldn't hear any noise from the adjacent rooms so maybe that's something they're addressing as they renovate.  

Great selection of casual as well as upscale dining.   

Not much in the way of shopping in this hotel's footprint, but close enough to Crystals if you have the urge to help our Vegas economy and drop some retail cash.  

There are two towers..Boulevard (farthest from lobby & check-in) and Chelsea.  It's a hike between the two of them so if you are parking a car, I suggest valet or park closest to Chelsea elevators since that is closer to the lobby. 

ALL hotels in Vegas have a check-in line that looks 500 people deep & wait time of 30+ minutes in the afternoon so manage that expectation and grab a drink before you get in line and you won't be disappointed.   

This is not a great hotel for families IMO....there are  properties better suited for families and the kiddos could enjoy the pool\/amenities.  

They are dog friendly and have a small dog run on the 14th floor of Chelsea tower.  It's not much so don't get too excited, but it works in a pinch.   To take your pup on a walk, exit from the Boulevard Tower onto Las Vegas Blvd and go left to the Bellagio property where there are lots of trees, bushes\/shrubs and mulch for doggo to sniff and take care of business.

Cons: Room was LOUD. Not sure where it was coming from, but multi-hour music thumping and screaming voices into the wee hours of the morning (and I was on the 66th floor!). Needs maintenance. Robe hook in the bathroom fell off the wall, faucet in the shower was loose, jet in the bathtub would magically go on by itself for no reason,  food (was there for a conference) was not good - cheap quality ingredients, prices are famous Vegas ($$$$), added 1\/2 dozen items to my final bill from the minibar that I did not order - though they took this off without question and credited me back. JUST WATCH YOUR FINAL BILL! 

Honestly, if it were not for the fact that every person that I interacted with that worked there was very helpful and friendly, this place would get a 2.",0,0,0

High points: 
-Very friendly and accommodating front desk staff. It was truly a pleasure dealing with them. 
-The food at Wicked Spoon is DELICIOUS. You will never run out of options. 

Low points: 
-The cleanliness and condition of the room and hallway was unacceptable. The carpet in the hallway was very stained and I could tell that our room was beat to hell and never recovered.  It really needs a deep cleaning and touch up.
-The elevators move at a glacial pace. 
-The bell boy we dealt with was completely rude and treated us like were idiots for choosing to drive back to Los Angeles at the time we did. 
-The process for picking up your car from valet is a nightmare. I felt like I was in an overcrowded bus station in the holding room that had NO AIR CONDITIONING. It was miserable and took about 30 minutes to get our car. 

Overall, the only reason I would return to the Cosmopolitan was if I got a great deal on a room to make up for all of its shortcomings.",0,1,0

Came here on thanksgiving and this is one of the nicest, most luxurious hotels, probably my favorite!

I had so much fun coming here and playing the Lord of the Rings game with my boyfriend, his brother and family! The machine kept winning! So much 8 hours later we left at 6am! 

I will say service is hit or miss though. We found the sweetest lady named Kathy who asked us all if we had player cards which we didn't and she took our ids while playing and came right back with cards! Awesome!

We did have a cocktail waitress, or a few. Some really were nice and efficient and as time went on the service really diminished. My boyfriend found a player card in a machine & went to return it only for a waitress to rudely say pretty much who cares ""they can get a new one"". Ruudddeee, (I think that one ""magic"" song when it comes to this, um ""why you gotta be soo rudeee?"").

Nonetheless this place gets a 5 from me, still Cuz it's just so beautiful. I've been to their Marquee nightclub too and I've had loads of fun!

You are high maintenance and a total scene, you are young and trendy and therefore super immature, but you're the prettiest girl on the block (the strip) and you're worth it.

I've done Vegas a LOT.  I've done Vegas cheap, borderline-homeless cheap, and expensive because someone else is paying.  I've gotten frustrated by staying in the wrong hotel and wasting money on cab fare just to stand in line at Drais, or chase the crowd over to Tao from Haze because we heard Leo was there, or simply get wasted and then lost, and then cry in the bathroom of the Bellagio.  I've also known what it is to be in a 30s\/40s crowd as a 24 year old young woman and wonder what in the hell I'm doing at ANY lounge in the Wynn.  Who the F stays at the Wynn? 

So when I planned a Dirty 30 Celebration for my wonderful, sweet, demure blonde friend (basically she had VEGAS VIRGIN tattooed on her forehead the whole time) I knew we were staying at the Cosmo.  We weren't struggling with cabs and doing the whole barefoot scene down the strip with achy feet at 3 am.  We are settling down in the nicest hotel on the strip and letting the party come to us.  And by party I mean Rose Rabbit Lie and Marquee.  We'll have breakfast at The Henry, we'll wind down at Chandelier, and we'll always be coiffed and put together because we NEVER HAD TO LEAVE THE HOTEL.  

I'll write a separate review for Rose Rabbit Lie because it was incredible and deserves a separate nod.  Best parts of Cosmo that I took full advantage of: 
1) free valet parking - if you are renting a car you want to stay in a hotel that isn't going to charge you an arm and a leg,  the Cosmo's free parking has got to be a glitch in the system, I felt like I was getting away with something.  
2) concierge - concierge will not exactly discount you (especially if you are rude, I watched that happen, and honestly the price is the price people), but if you are friendly and simply want their help they will tell you insider-Vegas stuff about where to go, at what time, and where to avoid, they're also superb at getting show tickets and reservations.  We had our daily ""resort fee"" waived.
3) the spa - Sahra spa offers $25 day passes which we basically owned for the 3 hours we were there.  I even sung in one of the steam rooms.  There are snacks in the room where you wait for your treatment, theres a cold mist room, a dry and a wet sauna, a gorgeous hot tub with a fountain, bathrooms have all the amenities, a gym and a gift shop.

ROOM: The rooms are trendy and hip and vibey and teched out.  Our shower had a glass wall that made the view from the beds a LIVE SHOWER SCENE.  (We abided by the Honor System and kept the blinds down while each girl showered.)  (Or so this reviewer wants you to believe.)  (Just kidding.)  (Or am I?)

POOL: My only complaint is the Marquee pool (shitshow) and the Bamboo pool (the more private one) were both closed.  We had the Boulevard pool which looks out on the strip and was still a good time.  We just didn't have options and a girl likes her options.  

MARQUEE: Was awesome.  Monday night is industry night!  It's a must!  We skipped breezily to the front of the line because we were key holders (guests of the hotel) and also didn't pay cover (there's a cover charge for girls? what is this miami? rude.)

OTHER BARS (Chandelier, Bond): Bond offers a free show constantly, whether its boys in suspenders on swings or girls with feather peacock tails standing on the bar, I even saw a guy on stilts once.  Chandelier is a gorgeous bougie lounge where I've never been known to wear anything other than a tiny dress and I've also never been known to receive a bill for any of the drinks I've imbibed.  High rollers welcome.  Spacious, trendy, relaxing, ornate, glamorous, it's adult disneyland.",7,6,4

I called the operator using the house phone by the elevator, and again, from our room... I informed them of the situation and I was told they might be having problem with the pipes and they will send someone to SPRAY the area.  I asked if I can change rooms or floors, but all they did was  to make attempts so the smell goes away. It lasted a while before they were able to mask the smell.  It ruined the excitement of my birthday stay.   But hey, I do want to say thanks to the front desk lady Melissa who sent me chocolates for my birthday, she did make a good impression.

Check in reception was slightly snotty and bratty, which was vaguely offputting but the room itself and the view was amazing - we got a West Tower, Bellagio Fountain facing room with a great view of the Strip as far as the Venetian. 

Certain parts of the room have been updated over time (it's easy to separate the dated headboards from the updated wardrobes, the tired lighting from the comfy patio seating). Suspect that they could do with a bit of an overhaul as the hallways were looking pretty rundown, the couches had seen slightly better days. (Although after checking the state of rooms in other similarly priced hotels - I can safely say the Cosmo is probably one of the best in its category)

It was completely draining but the view from our room made up for it. We were upgraded to a terrace suite after the host who u booked with completely screwed up my reservation. If you're debating which room to chose definitely choose the suite it has a jacuzzi tub with a window that overlooks the city. I mean it doesn't get better than that. Everything was great until 5 am came along and we were woken up by guest services to check if we had any leak. ( protocol) Definitely pissed me off. Then 9 am came along and I was hearing the workers hammering nails into our ceiling. Management was nice enough to comp the room. Second night came along and we had drunks knocking on our door continuously and running away. At this point I was already to annoyed to even call and complain to security.

We checked in on Friday and were told that our room wasn't ready. I asked for a quiet room on a high floor and they said they would call us when it was ready. We waited in a long line to have our bags held then went for a snack. The pizza at the hidden place was delicious. After walking around the hotel for awhile we finally got word that our room was ready. It was gorgeous, had a great view, etc.  We had to wait for about 30-45 minutes for our bags to be brought up as they wouldn't just leave them in the room. At this time we also discovered one of the tv's wasn't working so we had to wait longer for someone to come up and reboot it. We had dinner at the Wicked Spoon that night. The wait times were atrocious.... Close to 30 minutes just to pay and an additional 60 minutes to be seated!!! Food was great though. We traveled all day and wanted to get an early night's sleep so we got into bed around 10:30. At this point our walls starts vibrating from the club... Quiet room it was not! I called to complain and after being told they couldn't move me I told them that we were going to check out ASAP. Finally they listened and switched us to an actual quiet room, however, the person I was speaking to thought he was speaking to his coworker and started talking bad about me without realizing I was the customer and not his coworker. 
They said that they'd credit us $100 for our troubles. 

We finally got settled into room 2 and got a good night's sleep. On Saturday AM we went to the buffet again - same horrific lines, but fabulous food. We were told that we would get a call when our next new room was ready... At 5 pm I called to check and was told that new keys would be brought up shortly. After waiting for over an hour and a half, it ended with my husband going downstairs and getting in a fight with the front desk due to waiting in line for 20+ minutes without being helped even though he was the first person waiting in line. 

So finally we got into our next new room and it was missing the following - Kleenex, a second remote and a working light above the shower. At this point we decided not even to complain or ask as we knew it would just be a waste of time. One thing we did have though was bobby pins on the floor (not mine). Gross!  We ate at both Holstein's and Milo's that day and loved both!

Now onto the kicker... My husband made a bet on the Monday night football game. We got back to the hotel at 10:03 pm and the sports book on the 2nd floor said that they were closed for the night and to go downstairs to cash it. We did and they were closed too with a sign saying they open at 8:30 am.  At 8:45 this morning he went to cash his bet on the 2nd floor as we were leaving for the airport soon thereafter and they said they were in the midst of a ""surprise audit."" They sent him on a chase throughout the hotel for 45 minutes including a stop at the Casino Cashier and couldn't get his bet cashed as we were going to miss our flight. When he went back to the 2nd floor he was then told the ""computers were down."" It's one thing if you make a bet for the future and know you'll have to mail it in. It's another when you're there and ready to cash it and they're too inept to do so. 

Also when checking out they had no record of the $100 credit offered to me and tried to make it MY problem by questioning who I spoke to, etc. 

While we loved the vibe, buffet, restaurants and shopping in this hotel, we will never return. There is zero management, the customer service sucks and the housekeeping in pretty non-existant. If you want a 5 star hotel, don't stay here. Consider yourself warned....",6,1,1

The rooms are legit, we got a suite that had two separate bathroom areas, you can close off the main bedroom and the suite basically splits into to two so this is great for couples trying to share with somebody else as the master bedroom has it's own bathroom.  The suites come with a full kitchen and what caught me by surprise was that the suite had a washer\/dryer!

Inside the hotel they lack the variety of places to eat, they have that one hidden pizza spot where you can grab a cheap quick bite to eat other than that everything is a fancy sit down restaurant.  

They have 3 pool areas, one is a family pool, another is a standard pool area where u can play pool, fuse-ball, and even video games, and lastly they have the Marquee Day Club Pool which is always popping Friday and Saturday afternoons.  Hotel guests really don't get perks, they might let one person go in free per hotel key or if you are a group of hot looking ladies you probably don't have to pay...so sexist but that's like that with every Vegas Pool Party...the Marquee Pool though is very small as compared to other pool parties like Encore Beach Club

My husband and I opted for the studio on a Sunday night and didn't want to leave the room. I was digging the Johnathan Adler bookends as my husband was reading aloud from the kitchy, quirky books that lined the shelves. 

The studio: Perfect size for two. Roomy without being stuffy. The bathroom had a separate door leading to the toilet to separate the funk from the flowers. The literal water closet has nifty wallpaper, no need for a book in the John! I took advantage of the chic shower and hot tub in one weekend. Both great. The toiletries were huge and yes, I brought them in my carry-on. Lavender-rific! 

The living space was cute and the desk was oh-so-adorable with colored pencils! The wet bar had a variety of goodies, safe-love products and binoculars. For real? Yeah. The closet has the most amazing wallpaper and cushy robes are available. The bed was a cloud of luxury that hugged me to sleep like an angel in the sky. And yes, we slept with the balcony cracked open in January 'cause we could. The balcony overlooking the Bellagio was absolutely awesome. In the end, we broke down and ordered secret pizza from downstairs.

I can not wait to go back and spend a full weekend at the Cosmo. Seriously. It was kicking, but the pools were a bit cool this time around. See you soon, Cosmo.

I estimate 1500sqft, 2 bathrooms, separate bedroom and L-shape  balcony which can fit 100 people overlooking the Bellagio water show and the Las Vegas lights. The hotel is truly cosmopolitan.",0,0,0

The hotel on the other hand is fabulous.  We were lucky enough to be comped for a room in the west tower with the view facing bellagio and the bellagio fountain.  The view from the 57th floor was just spectacular! You can pretty much see the whole strip from Paris Eiffel Tower, the new linq Ferris wheel, the bellagio fountain show every 15 mins, even a glimpse of the mirage volcano show every half hour, all from your own open balcony.  It's really nice to hear the hum of the city below while you're relaxing on their patio chaise lounge.

They have 3 pools one for 21 and older pool club and the other two are suppose to be family pools . When we got there the hotel room was amazing and they even had color pencils for the kids to draw with but they didn't have a fridge but they brought one up for us .Then when we tried to order room service they didn't have a kids menu. I had to order boiled pasta with only butter on it cuz the kids would not eat the things they had on the menu and it came out to be $21 . For just boiled pasta that prob cost them $2 to buy which is crazy . The pools opened at 8 which was great  we got there before the drunk groups came and the kids got to swim but once 3pm hit it become a meat market . Literally it was really pathetic to watch some of this guys with their lame pick up lines . Once that started I got us a cabana room and had the kids watch some tv eat and rest and then go back to swim for one more hr and leave . There is no family entertainment in this hotel so you need to go to the neighbor hotels for that . Overall it's a great hotel room for ppl without kids but this would not be my first choice for family's,1,2,1

This is a great intimate venue (3000 capacity),  the acoustics of this place rock and it's outdoors; and I believe, the only pool which overlooks the strip. Tickets were wicked cheap and no line to get in! They keep the pool furniture out, so if you want to lounge around during the show you can. Not a bad ""seat"" in this spot.

Rooms are modern with flat screens throughout, nice art and wall coverings, a full media hub, comfy beds and sheets, bathroom a bit naughty as the shower has an open window looking into the room. All +'s for me. The real problem is the snottiness of most of the cocktail waitresses and dealers on the floor. Me n the boys were at the $100 min craps table with nearly a grand spread out each, you'd think the stick man or the chip dude would be ok with a lil hootin and hollerin, it's a craps table for chrissakes! We were asked several times to quiet down. Guess they weren't feeling our nasty field and yo bets! This is not the Vegas that I know and love. As a child I remember watching my uncles go dumb on the craps tables, tearing their shirts off, high fivin, slapping girls butts. Guess that's the Vegas of yore.

We absolutely love it there. I love the central location as well as the balconies which are so unique to that property. I have never had anything but exceptional customer service there from front desk, to housekeeping, to the casino floor and the restaurants. 

It is very easy making reservations with this property. We have booked through the Cosmo via phone and the service was above and beyond to find us the perfect room with the perfect view for our price-point. They were willing to offer us a special not advertised Angle Suite for a larger balcony (we had previously stayed in a wraparound and loved that size though we did not quite have the budget for it) though we ultimately went with the Terrace One Bedroom Premium View.

We arrived via cab and the bell desk was fantastic as always ushering us happily through the doors, helping unload baggage. They are so kind and willing to help either by checking your bags if your room is not quite ready (for early birds like us) or holding on to garments that are being picked up to be cleaned. 

Check in was extremely fluid. We checked in at approximately one, there was not more than a five minute wait. Service at the desk was exceptional. We first inquired about a room in the East Tower but the attendant did confirm for us that is was a lower floor than what she had available in the West Tower which would put us very close to the strip and Marquee Club noise. We elected the West Tower room for privacy and did not regret it!

The casino is smaller than some properties, but as is the hotel and I have only ever felt that was an added benefit to the property. There was no shorter of games or cocktail waitresses for dirnks, a huge bonus in my book! The table minimums are relatively high on the weekends, but that is to be expected in the newer hotels, they are no more the Aria or Bellagio and this is not a hotel that should come to mind when looking at a tight budget.

I love that this hotel is full of lounge space, I much prefer that to clubs or bars with pricey covers. I am all about relaxation. From Vesper right at the check in area down to Bond with the lovely performing artists. Of course the central Chandelier Bar is gorgeous and always worth a drink there. Book and Stage is another great hangout right in the midst of the action.

It definitely has a younger crowd and feel which can sometimes be overwhelming (Ie the pools are very crowded in the summer) but I think you know that's what you are getting when you stay there. So much of this hotel is centralized, with the restaurants tending to be grouped together or the shops all grouped together. I enjoy that because I hate walking all over properties in search of a place to eat, then drink, then game.

The rooms are beautiful I have stayed in a Wraparound Terrace with a Premium View and this trip stayed in the cheaper Terrace One Bedroom with a Premium View and still greatly enjoyed the room. My one complaint is there was no dress in the One Bedroom which may be an issue for long stays, but with amble closet space and some shelving in the closet I was able to get everything stored away fine. I love the big chairs on the balcony and feel asleep out there on more than one occasion. The soaking tub in this room literally deserves a review all it's own, fantastically deep with a view of the fountains, it is literally impossible to find a better spot to relax, it's truly more of a mini hot-tub than a bath.

I will stay here again, I just love it!

First impression, not great! I walked in after being on a plane for 5+ hours to find no line for check-in, YES! However, it still took me about 15-20 minutes to get the keys to my room. I have never seen a slower process. I guess they were trying to find me a good room, which I did not request but of course was appreciated. I finally got the keys to my room and headed up! WOWSERS she did find me a nice suite in the West Tower with a balcony over looking the Bellagio Fountains. 

The room was spectacular! Nice sitting area, comfy bed, huge balcony, small kitchen area, huge bathroom! I loved it, just wish I could have spent more time in my room ;) 

I didn't gamble so can't talk about the casino part of the hotel. I did  eat at some of the restaurants. I love the burger and shake joint (can't remember the name). The fried pickles were to die for. I also had the alcoholic Mint Chocolate Chip Shake- YUMMY! I often got breakfast to go at Va Benna ( I think is the name),rather expensive but usually quick and had good Chai Tea's and pastries.

The Hotel: ultra modern, hip, trendy, with a crowd that tends to be more stylish and - Cosmopolitan.

Parking: my first 2 trips here I was confused with their parking, as I hate valet - waiting 15-30 minutes for your car is no bueno. However, just drive in the main enterence, and stay in the middle lane past the taxi and valet line for self-park. There's also a bridge to Aria. 

Marquee: the nightclub in the hotel played mainstream house when we went, because we entered with the VIP Host, we were treated well, however, I chose to leave after 10 minutes since I wasn't in a clubbing mood. 

Food: so many options! Seriously, I can recall at least 6 different restaurants. Even with a VIP comp card, I simply couldn't eat anymore. There's pizza, Chinese, American, Japanese & French. 

Bars: With 3 floors of entertainment, this venue is excellent for hosting a party! I prefer the 3rd floor lounge, which is surrounded by the crystal lit by pink and red lighting on 3 floors. 

Gambling: With my Chinese family that gambles a large amount of money, they again tell me the Feng Shui is designed to the advantage of the casino - however, I enjoyed my 2 days, each in 5 hour increments, at this hotel.

The rooms are great.  Very wide, give you a lot of space, and the Tv is perfect for a hotel.  The bathroom is HUGE, and the double sinks are dope.  They have a combo door for the bathroom and the closet though.  So when the bathroom is closed, the bathroom is open, and vice-versa.  That would be my one complaint about the rooms, but overall top notch.
The casino is very nice and there is tons of jawns walking around all all hours.  I play blackjack, and there wasnt as many tables as I hoped, and there seemed to be an abundance of single deck tables.  I would have liked more tables and more 5 or 6 decks.  
The pools were great.  Very fun, very nice to look at and clean.  A lot of nice places to eat, however besides pizza there was not much food you could get at a counter.  It was almost all a sitdown, and not quick.

I was in LV for CES the 2nd week in January at the last minute I was moved to the Cosmopolitan.  What a treat!  
- Loved the in-room technology where everything is run from the TV.  At night, through the TV, I would set the room to wakeup at 7am. Lights only in the bedroom to come on low, TV to turn on at low volume with Sirius Radio jazz station and the temperature to go up to 70 degrees. Awesome!
- Restaurants were great and the breakfast buffet was fantastic and felt like a good deal at $15 compared to everything else nice on the strip. 
- Service was great and I hope they keep it going.  Everytime I needed something they were quick to help.  I asked for a newspaper in the indoor poolside restaurant.  They didn't have any but the went and found me two!
- My only real compaint was their integration with the Marriott hotel system was incomplete, no one seemed to know anything about how it should work.  I'm a high level Marriott Rewards member and entitled to certain benefits and according to the website the Cosmopolitan is part of the new Marriott ""Autograph Collection"" and the bennies are specifically called out for this group.  I was a little frustrated so I called the front desk to find out what was going on.  It took them about 30min to figure out that they are part of the Autograph Collection but also a ""Resort"" which most of the benefits don't apply.  Not clear at all on the website.  So, just a warning if you go as a Marriott Rewards member.

You've just lost $1000 on the tables and you get a crappy martini served in a small glass. LAME! Maybe that's why my boyfriend always drinks beers? It's pretty tough to mess up a bottled beverage.

I completely expected to have a crappy drink while gambling at the Cosmo but was pleasantly surprised when our drink girl brought us the best Comopolitan I've had in my entire life!

...too lazy to write a review. to end it, the wrap-around was awesome but my bf was itchy, then it was me. i think it's the detergent or something, that they use to wash their bed sheets, towels, etc. unless it was something we ate that made us itch.

anyways, would definitely stay here again. i'll probably stay here once more to see if it was indeed the bed sheets, towels, etc.

til then...i'm going back to the Aria for my birthday come this August! made reservations just now, for the wonderful corner suite! =)

Always nice music, friendly and helpful staff, delicious drinks and food. Rooms are being cleaned and bath products are restocked everyday. Their casino is always clean too and very modern.

Tried their famous Wicked Spoon Buffet - personally wasn't a fan, I guess we don't enjoy buffets that much. Eggslut was delicious and so worth the wait.

I tried to order room service around 10 am this morning. I was on hold for five minutes, twice. Then they called back 10 mins later to say the food is going to be around 75 mins wait. Said it is a busy weekend.  Hmmm never had to deal with this at any other hotel on long weekends. Did they not know Labor Day weekend would be busy and plan ahead? 
We went to multiple restaurants in the hotel trying to get food, they are either not open or long wait. Finally we went to the grill at the pool. Line wasn't bad because this one is only for hotel guests. There are multiple open tables just sitting open and there are people waiting. We walked around for a half hour, went back, those tables are still open and the same people are still waiting! Getting food in Vegas should not be this hard, especially at a hotel at this price point. We finally got a table, it was out in the sun in 100 degrees. The entire time we were there, there were a couple tables in the shade sitting empty. 

The lobby and public areas are nice, their thing is the crystals and chandeliers. But once you go up to the room floor, the hallway looks poorly maintained. There are stains on the carpets and walls. The room is big and nice, the pools are great. 

To me nice facilities are expected in Vegas. service really distinguishes a hotel here. food is a very important factor to me. I was not impressed.",0,0,0

The hotel's check-in time is 3:00 pm. In order to compensate us, they gave us a $150 discretionary account to use on whatever we wanted in the hotel as well as an upgrade from our terrace suite to a wraparound suite. We believed this was more than fair and were perfectly happy to wait until our upgraded room was ready. When we were notified that it was, we checked in and the agent confirmed with us the $150 account.

After a lovely Saturday night of enjoying the admittedly beautiful view provided by our upgraded room and the drinks from the bar paid for by the $150 discretionary account, we cleaned up and checked out at 12:00 noon. 

The front desk agent told us that we would be charged $94 for incidental expenses beyond what was provided by the hotel. We knew that it was highly unlikely for us to have spent that much money that night, and asked for a receipt accordingly. The agent pulled it up and told us that the hotel had originally given us $50, not the $150 figure which we had been told - twice! After I corrected her, she brought in the front desk manager, David Bayley, who told us that he couldn't do anything and that we'd have to wait until 5:00 pm for yesterday's front desk manager to arrive so that she could sort out the issue.

After coming back at 5:30, we asked a front desk agent, Kira, if we could speak to yesterday's front desk manager. She said that yesterday's manager wasn't there and that we should talk to her instead. What followed from Kira was an extremely condescending if superficially pleasant treatment of us, implying that we were lucky enough to have been upgraded to a different room and that we should have been happy with what we received. Eventually, she deigned to give us an additional $50 comp credit out of ""good will"", but refused to do anything else, telling us that she'd ask the original agent we received the $150 credit from later to verify our story and that she'd follow up with us via email.

We, of course, were profoundly skeptical that anything would be resolved over email and asked to speak again to the manager, David. After Kira briefed David about our complaint, he came out to tell us, essentially, to leave the hotel and be happy with what we already received. Only after requesting to speak to David's superior did he finally decide to call the original agent to confirm our story. He told us that the original agent couldn't remember the amount she had compensated us, and that they'd cancel out our balance of $94.

First of all, this incident shows a stunning lack of integrity by the front desk agents. They had first told us to wait until 5:00 pm for a manager that never showed up, then told us to leave Vegas while they investigated the incident and that they'd follow up via e-mail, and finally that they'd give us a $50 credit out of ""good will"" - admitting no wrongdoing - and that we should just leave. The entire time, we felt that they were trying to delay and make it as inconvenient for us as possible so that we'd leave without the issue being resolved. Only after threatening to escalate the issue to upper management did the David take any substantive steps to solve the problem.

Second was the painfully condescending attitude of the front desk. Kira and David seemed to believe that $94 was a great deal of money to us. It wasn't. They didn't understand that our complaint was about the principle that we shouldn't have to pay extra for administrative mistakes made by the staff. They told us that they'd give us a $50 credit to our account out of ""good will"" with all the smug superiority an aristocrat might throw a dime to a beggar, treating us as though we were simply haggling to get the best deal we could. 

Finally, the whole incident reflects the sheer incompetence of the front desk. Even if they believed that we were lying about the original $150 credit, which certainly was the impression we received, good business sense behooves them to simply cancel out our balance. $94 is nothing compared to the thousands of dollars they're going to forgo via our entire network of friends who will never again stay at the Cosmopolitan. 

At the very end, after they finally canceled out our balance, I asked for Kira and David's business cards so that I knew whose names to mention to the world. David, to his credit, wrote down his name and contact information on a slip of paper. Kira, however, wrote but one word on a slip she handed me - ""Kira"". No last name, no phone number, no email address. My friends and I couldn't help but laugh at the cowardice she displayed through that simple omission. Anyone decent person doing his or her job competently and with integrity has nothing to hide - unfortunately, Kira seemed to lack both.

Key cards\/elevators: Maybe they should be checked. Like many hotels (I learned), you need a key card to be able to properly use the elevator. I never fully figured out how to perfectly work it - sometimes it appeared you had to leave the card in, or pull it out fast, or slowly, or hope, or pray. We also received two keys for one room and four for the other, which seemed odd. Also had a morning when we literally had an 8 minute elevator ride, because it stopped on EVERY SINGLE FLOOR. It was also filled to capacity for the majority of the time, so every time the door opened an awkward moment of staring with the downhearted elevator recipient-hopefuls would take place. I thought the whole point of separate elevators with separate key cards was in order to ease congestion. First-world-problems, yes, but still first-world-annoying.

Rooms: Very poor lighting.  Don't mess with poor lighting when you have 8+ girls trying to put on makeup in a hotel room. It'll get ugly. 

Also - major problems in getting into the rooms. We ordered two rooms off Gilt City, and were somehow told that we would have adjoining rooms. Even though three girls' names were put down as registered to the room, one room only ended up being under one girl's name, with the other two girls being registered to the other.  This was problematic because said single-girl's flight got delayed, so all 8 girls had to sleep in one room for the night even though we should have had two rooms. They also told us that they could not guarantee adjoining rooms, even though this was expressed to us upon ordering it. The only other option was to see if the adjoining room vacated at a certain time, and then we would claim the room between 12 and 1 PM. Not possible if you're trying to get drunk at a dayclub during those prime sunny hours.

Pros: Beauty, cool screens, ambiance, and they don't have a problem with alcohol being in your room.

All in all, a nice place to stay, despite all. I suppose Vegas without hiccups wouldn't be Vegas.",0,2,1

We stayed at The Cosmopolitan in 2012 for our honeymoon. It was a dream stay. This time around it was not.

We arrived to find very long lines to check in, followed by finding out the room reservation I made for sofa sleeper room wasn't made right so I was promised a free rollaway and breakfast. 

We arrived to room to find sink backed up, no room in kitchenette fridge because it was filled with mini bar items (if you advertise kitchenette, there better be room to refrigerate items), weird sticky residue all over door to bedroom, and dirty lamp and headboard (like someone had soda explode). 

I later discovered there was charge for rollaway I had to call to get removed. The next morning I called to find out about free breakfast, was told to go to Identity desk where I was told it was hotel issue, but guest service guy told me unless I had email proof or something there was nothing they could do??? Nice.

Went to bamboo pool and it was shut down for over an hour for reasons they couldn't tell us. Not enough servers around so we kept having to go to bar to get drinks while we waited. Finally swam and the pool was filled with garbage - literally garbage from drinks and food.

Later that night we discovered AC only blew into front room and not bedroom so we had to put three blankets on kid stuck in rollaway to keep warm while we blasted AC to get enough air into our room.

The next night we went to movie night at pool. Would've been a perfect evening but again NO SERVERS... and my daughter had me put on goggles to look underwater where I almost puked from seeing food, cups, and toilet paper everywhere! Do they not clean the pool until the end of the day???? We called ahead to find out about dinner sever at movie night and were told Henry's had a preset menu you could order from at the pool- turns out that's not true- so cheap hot dogs and bad nachos it was.

We had woman come tell us mid trip that our room keys had expired... Called and found out check in screwed up reservation again. Got new cards and again was told we'd have credit to use for breakfast. Next morning tried to use it at Wicked Spoon and it took 20 minutes for cashier to talk to someone to get it to work.

And the Wicked Spoon used to be great- a dream, but it has gone down hill in both variety and quality. Desserts seem to be prepackaged.

It was nice to take a short stroll down to the in property Starbucks and head back up to the room to watch the sun rise. The sports books in Vegas are always pressure tested with the sheer volume of wagers being placed and the number of rookies placing them. All in all the lines moved well and while it took a little advanced planning I was able to get a timely wager on every game played over the four day weekend. The pool and cabana area was also a real plus. It's not inexpensive to say the least but split enough ways it's a great way to spend a warm sunny day in March.

2nd-  about to go to bed and notice weird smudges on the pillows.. I don't know what the heck it was but quickly realized we sleeping without pillows tonight and thank god I packed my own blanket. 
3rd - no security, anyone can walk into the hotel and go up to the rooms. For an expensive place you would think it would require you to need your room key to go up the elevator but NO; anyone can follow you to your room with loads of money in your hand. 
4th- For some reason they have express check out But not checking in?? That's awesome considering seeing that line that morning we were leaving.. BUT wait we still had to stay in that awful check out line because they charged us 90 bucks with no explanation !! Just says room charge . Thank god our flight wasn't till later cause we stood in that stupid line. Came to the front and found out it was a charge for the over priced drink and snacks they have for you in the room which we DIDN'T touch!

From check in to the bars and restaurants, the customer service is slow and the staff treats you like you're a complete inconvenience to their day.  There was an incident that happened where their security harassed two of the ladies in our group, mistaking them for ""call girls"" and instead of dealing with this in a professional and considerate manner by simply asking the ladies to produce room keys, they embarrassed them in front of the friends they were speaking with and continued to harass them.  When TWO complaints were filed (one with Connie at the front desk and another with the manager who had the second shift at the front desk) we were assured that they would follow up with us on the incident....NO RESPONSE!!!
This behavior is completely unacceptable.

WTF!! i specifically gave them my room number when we checked the car in and NO ONE informed us of a broken key during my first time stay at the hotel. my car comes and they tape my key back together and start my car.  

who the hell drives from LA to vegas with a broken car key with 3 other people in their car? where is the logic in that? yeah i would LOVE to be stranded on the desert while waiting for AAA. 

i submitted an incident report and went to the nearest gas station to get gas, i turn off the car to pump gas and when i try to start the key again the car wouldn't start and i was stranded at the gas station for 30 mins trying to get AAA to come with a key to start my car. 

luckily i made it home ok and never made a stop during the trip because we just wanted to go home after the bullshit ordeal. 

to make matters worse, their risk management and insurance provider were of NO help at all. and i didn't get ANYTHING for the inconvenience and time lost during the trip while dealing with their negligence and carelessness with their guests' belongings. especially forms of transportation.

+\/- there's the day time Marquee pool party that looks hopping but at a cost; and then there's the free pool which doesn't get much sun since the tall buildings around it creates shade
+ beautiful king bedroom suites
+\/- the view from the wrap around terrace is pretty but not that impressive (really windy on the balconies)

Note:
I think the rollaway beds are free, at least we weren't charged

- Jetted Tub in the bathroom

- Not as updated in technology as other hotels such as Vdara + Aria etc 
- Rooms aren't controlled by an iPad(TV\/Curtains\/Lights)

I typically really enjoy it. It's clean and girly and there are chandeliers everywhere. This last time it was not great I'm sorry to say.

Problems: 
-Even though we arrived at 8pm after driving from LA, our room wasn't ready. We had to wait 1.5 hours. How is my room not ready at 8pm? I had booked a 2 room suite 2 months in advance.
-When we arrived to the room it was a handicapped room with low counters and low showers and no tub. I'm glad they have those rooms, but I'm 5'8"" and the shower head was below my shoulders and was broken.
-The valet screwed up my car once, and it was taking so long to rectify the situation, that I took a taxi instead.
-You can't order room service to the pool in the winter even though it's 80 degrees. There was no breakfast options anywhere except huge buffets. I was only offered the option to purchase chips and salsa at 10am at the pool. I should be able to order eggs wherever, whenever. 
-I asked housekeeping to bring me something and it never came.
-We ordered coffee before work and it took over an hour to arrive.

I guess the silver linings is that the rooms are clean and spacious. That's about it though. I think next time I'll take my company to the Wynn.

There are some great things about it: 
(1) If you're a frequent business traveler, you can use Marriott points here
(2) Wrap around balconies in the suites are awesome, and their views are phenomenal
(3) Some suites have mini kitchens and even washer\/dryers!
(4) Central Strip location

But, there are things I just don't like about the Cosmopolitan:
(1) Even 20 floors up, the beat of the nightclub was so loud until 5AM that I didn't get much sleep.  I know, I know... not supposed to sleep in Las Vegas anyway, but that should be by choice and not environment.  
(2) Casino floor is very small.  You'll very likely end up going elsewhere to gamble.  
(3) Have only tried a few Cosmo restaurants, but they weren't in the ""blow your socks off"" category the top ones on the Strip offer.

Bad things: I've never seen a longer check in line in my life. Took us over an hour just to get to the counter. Unbelievably, they don't have coffee makers in the rooms. While the room itself was not smokey, the common areas were, and after two days, I was ready to check out and get some solid fresh air.

The location is great, rooms are spacious and the staff (every department) is, frankly, one of the most helpful and friendly I have encountered is some time. Room service food was actually good and the Casino is on the smaller side but again, very nice. 

So why only 2 stars? The cleanliness of our room was disgusting. Absolutely 100% the nastiest, dirtiest room I can remember. I was frankly shocked. Even when I spoke to Andrew, the Resort Manager, who offered to move me to a larger room, we turned him down. I asked him to just make sure our room was cleaned thoroughly and we would be fine. Upon our return, it was still a petri dish of filth. I personally ended up cleaning some of it myself. The list is just too long to list. We were there for 4 days and half of the items I gave to Andrew were never taken care of , including simple maintenance items. I shudder to think what it would look like if a black light was turned on and what it would find. I believe there is a SERIOUS health issue here and I hope the management takes it upon themselves to do a full assessment of their housekeeping department. 

So, it would have been an easy 5 star review if we simply had a clean room. Unfortunately, this never took place. I cannot recommend this hotel unless management addresses the complete failure and disregard for hotel cleanliness.

I was told that because I'm a marriott gold member, I am eligible for an upgrade (yay!) ...for an extra 50 bucks...(HAYL NO.) we got there 11pm and had an early start so I was not going to pay 50 bucks more just to sleep in an upgraded room. And as a gold member I usually get free upgrades (turns up nose in disdain). So even though we had a standard room (shudders with disgust), I expect at least some basic cleanliness; especially for a hotel with a good reputation.  Instead there was someone's mascara stuck on the mirror, tape and leftover construction paper on top of the doorway (I assume it said something like Last Fling Before the Ring or some other celebratory message), the tile on the bathroom was cracked like the previous vacationers had a WWE match in there, but worst of all, the shower flooded, and oddly enough, the carpet right outside the door got wet even though the tile by the entrance of the bathroom stayed dry. It was a curious thing.

The gym is like a Las Vegas club--dark, crowded, and there's always that one person who got the body odor. I didn't have to wait for a treadmill, though, so I'm not upset. If you bring in someone who is staying in your room, but who is not on your account, you must add them to your account, or you will get charged an extra 20 bucks in addition to the 28 dollar resort charge you've already paid.

It's new, it's modern, and it's fancy shmancy.  But best of all, it's CONVENIENT.  Right across from PH with the miracle mile shops as well as the new designer shops near the Aria hotel.  PLUS, SECRET PIZZA is here and the wonderful chandelier in the middle makes for awesome pictures. 

The rooms are nice and surprisingly spacious.  Each standard city room, which is the cheapest, comes with TWO queen beds and the entire right wall is a full length mirror. LADIES, you all know how we love dem large mirrors.  
The bathroom is a good size, but the only awkward thing about it is the bathroom door and shower door.  It's NOT secure and the shower door is glass with the other side being blinds ... that can be opened from the other side hahaha. So just make sure you feel safe when showering :) 

And of course, I was extremely lucky to get to stay in their bungalows for a night.  Let me just tell you that if I had all the money in the world, I would stay there every time I go to Vegas.  It's HUGE.  Three stories of awesomeness ... and it connects to Marquee?  Shoot,  I'm down. 

BUT for all us other regular Vegas goers, the price for the regular rooms are $$$. Luckily, we got a deal for $170 a night ... instead of the usual .. what, $200?  And that's the cheapest room.

I really wish there was a studio here in South Florida that has his routine because I would be first in to sign up ! Not only did he provide a great workout with variety in each individuals strengths that he could accommodate at each circuit but he taught you about certain muscles and ways to excel the workout or training to help you target more of what you are looking for in yourself and goal as well as a prep on foods that would and would not help you reach that end result.

I will qualify this review, as we did not stay here, but we played here. Our friends stayed here, so we checked out their rooms. I have to say I was a bit jealous of the beautiful view of the Bellagio lake, and I'm fond of C.O. Bigelow products. But, I had to laugh when they showed us the peep-show shower. Yep, an involuntary peep-show that is controlled from the outer wall of the shower. I'm sure all of the boys who shared this room... didn't shower all weekend.

The chandelier bar was very sparkly. I'd hate to be the person who has to feather-dust it every day. This bar turned out to be a pretty decent spot in which to watch the last Super Bowl. Too bad the last Super Bore was such a dud. 

Secret Pizza is also hidden away in this hotel, and it was a life saver. We were able to order whole pizzas (or by the slice) and bring em down to the sparkly bar while watching the game. Unfortunately, I didn't find out about this pizza until I already spent $15 on 3 tiny street tacos from China Poblano on the 2nd floor.

During a prior stay at this hotel, I had some type of mental break and ruined a relationship that I had thought was strong as steel.  I didn't blame the Cosmopolitan for my own stubbornness, but whenever I thought of this place, old memories were revived and it was too painful to consider.

Flash forward nine months...the wounds on my heart still open.   I have to attend a conference that is being held at, you guessed it, the Cosmopolitan.  With much trepidation, I took a cab from the airport and entered the lobby I'd last left in tears.  Holding my head up high, much like Reba McEntire in the video for ""Fancy"", I checked in and went to my beautiful room in the West Tower.  Opening the door, I was blown away because this room was much nicer than the one I stayed at in the East Tower and it had a different layout so I wasn't reminded of my prior stay.

The lyrical dance of the Bellagio Fountains right outside my window was a balm to my soul...a step in the process of healing.

The service everywhere I went was outstanding.  It was so subtle, yet thorough, it was as if every person I came in contact with knew my secret pain and wished to ease it, if even in the slightest way.  

Each successive day, I felt stronger and my heart was lighter than it had been in months.  I got to the point that I felt I didn't need to leave the hotel.  With fantastic bars and restaurants, it had everything I needed to have a great time.  By the end of my stay, I felt like Eloise at the Plaza (only a middle aged dude with a receding hairline and great legs instead of a little girl) and I never wanted to leave.

But as happens, the conference ended and I had to return to New York.  The big difference was that this time, I left with a smile on my face and a spring in my step.

Bless you, Cosmopolitan, for showing me that rebirth is possible.  Will I be able to love again.  Ah, who knows?  But thank you for helping me reach a place where I could even conceive asking that question.",1,2,4

We stayed in the West Tower on floor 43. The room was exquisite. I was even excited to use their mouthwash and lotion provided just because the labeling was so unique. It had an old English vintage look to it. The bathroom had some pretty neat black and white wallpaper that when you really observe it...u can see females all over. It came with a ginormous spa tub and a 10-person capacity stand up shower with a bench inside. The view from room 4309 was glorious.

It was a small suite with an enormous bathroom, a sitting area, kitchen, and bedroom. My deck overlooked one of the pools (and, bonus, the sliding door was thick enough to block pool noises when I no longer wanted to hear them).

Everything was gorgeous - from the bathroom tiles to the throw pillows on the couch. I wanted to take pictures and try to replicate in my own home.

I even took two baths during my stay (yes, I took a bath in a hotel. In Vegas. It was a large, jetted tub - don't judge).

The location is excellent. There is a casino on the bottom floor, several restaurants, and a nightclub (although seriously, I can't see myself ever having enough stamina to wait in the ferocious line that was present at the nightclub each evening. You'd have to be pretty gung-ho).

We stayed for 3 nights during the weekday. (Parking was great and apparently we got a good deal as well.) Our room was located on the 55th floor of the East Tower which gave us a view of Marquee and the pools when we lounged outside on our terrace. 

Now onto the room. The room was amazingly spacious. At the same time you're able to have privacy between each room by simply pulling on the door divider. One plus in my book about this place was that not only did they provide bath robes, but slippers as well. YAY! Along with your expected toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, soap, body lotion) Q-tips and cotton balls were provided as well. (It's the little things that matter!) Not only did the room come with a minibar\/fridge, it also had a sink, microwave, and dishwasher. (But didnt leave a set of silverware or dishes for us so was the kitchen area just for looks?) The shower itself is a bit on the weak side when it comes to water power. The 2 people square bath tub looks out onto the terrace so it provides a nice view while you relax in the tub.

Would have given this place 4 star if it weren't for the following reasons:

-2 TVs with only 1 remote. Made it difficult to change the channel on the televisions when one was located in the living area while the other in the bedroom.
-Did not grant us late check out. In all the years that I have been going to Vegas, hotels have been courteous in allowing guests to check out an hour later. This one didn't. 
-Upon checking in to our room, the ash tray was not emptied and the bathroom supply was not restocked with shower gel.
-Room was missing ""Do Not Disturb"" sign so every morning at 9am, housekeeping came a knocking :(
-Adamant Housekeeper. Usually this is a plus but when I just woke up and we told her we don't want housekeeping, she insisted on coming in saying it would take only 10 minutes. Not only was it awkward watching the woman work, after 10 minute has passed she was still cleaning up the place so we were forced out of the room in a sense :(

I'm hoping my next stay would be a 4+ Star that Cosmo is known for.",0,0,0

With great views of the strip, extremely comfortable beds and spacious suites, it's surprising that I'm giving The Cosmo only two stars.

Here's the deal:
My check-in was an absolute nightmare.  When I first arrived, I did what any normal person would do and checked my bags... especially after being told that my suite was on the opposite wing of the hotel. The last thing I wanted to do after traveling was lug  2 large suitcases across a massive hotel! NO THANK YOU.

After finally arriving at my hotel room, I called downstairs to see how long it would take for my bags to be delivered.  I was told a MINIMUM of FOUR HOURS.  I couldn't believe it.  The hotel clearly knew they were fully booked that weekend, so they should have staffed accordingly.  Also, I should have been informed when I first checked my bags how long the wait would be... then I wouldn't have checked them in the first place!

Anyway, I sure as heck wasn't going to wait until 7pm before I could access any of my stuff.  So, there I was.... sweaty, tired, and wanting nothing more than to take a shower and a nap before a long night out in Vegas.  Instead of being able to relax, I had to drag myself across the hotel AGAIN, wait for 30 minutes for them to locate my  suitcases, and then spend another 20 minutes walking back to my room. By the time I was done with the whole ""getting my bag"" ordeal, almost two hours had gone by.

What a nice way to start my trip in Vegas... and so much for stress free!

I don't remember being put through any such headache at The Wynn or Encore.
So, yeah, I've experienced better.",16,8,5

What a dump! The staff is extremely rude and I saw on two different occasions women being harassed in elevators. It wasn't until i got harassed by a dude also that i knew i made a bad choice!

The bar on the casino floor level is a serious joke. I was standing against the bar having a beer (minding my own business) and was harassed by a man. I was polite but was not interested and explained that to him. He started to get smart with me. It was when his two ""girlfriends"" joined him and together all three started calling me names that I got tired of the scene! Come on! I am just trying to drinking my beer in peace! The bartender heard the conversation and did nothing to assist me.  I saw numerous underage drinkers as well (part of the overall underlining problem). How did I know? I watched as their friends bought the drinks and just handed them over. The bartenders could see what was going on and did nothing about it. The bartenders have ZERO customer service skills.

the rooms: we had a one bedroom terrace suite so there were two tvs - one worked properly and the other one worked only half of its destiny. when we clicked the tv to show ""tv"" it went blank and we could only hear the dialogue\/music. it was weird but it didn't really bother us as the other tv worked fine. i loved the ""entering"" and ""leaving"" light switches too. one click and all the lights in the room would turn on and off. it was so convenient. 

the bathrooms: i liked how it was all sectioned off. there was a door to the toilet. the main vanity area was open and spacious. and there was also a door to the shower and hot tub. the hot tub was right next to the window overlooking the strip so it was just heaven!! they offer c.o.bigelow toiletries and a toothbrush set

the beds: soo comfy!!! i really wanted to take their pillows too. they were so big and fluffy and it gave me one of the best sleeps ever! everything was just so lush..

I even wondered into their high roller section and the worker was happy to show me around how the high rollers roll.  I believe even their gift store clerk greeted me.

This whole hotel is an artwork.  You can spend a hour or two just touring this hotel.  Check out their garage, it has artwork.  I started to take the elevator to B5, B4.. just to see the art.  Big shoe, chandelier bar, and it's fun people watching at night when the Marquis club goers come out.

On Monday nights (during the summer), they had a movie night where you can sit in the pool and watch the big screen with everyone.  How cool is that!?

I really can't think of anything bad to say.  Maybe that their limit was a little too high.  I was ready to bet big at a Craps table on Wednesday night, but then I saw the limit was $25 and I found out that I wasn't big at all.  That's what she said.",8,6,4

I'm in Vegas often and every year I host a weekend for 30-40 friends and this year (Jan 2016) we made the biggest mistake and choose The Cosmopolitan. They have the audacity to name their Group Sales Department the Celebrations Team; however my interactions were anything but celebratory. Samantha was my initial contact (I say initial as she no longer works for the hotel) who often had a ""take it or leave it"" attitude, when she quoted me a price, I had a buddy call and he spoke to someone else who quoted a less expensive price, when I explain this to her she got furious and indicated that he would no longer be given those prices and if i didn't take her prices now then they would be no longer valid either. I unfortunately had to work with Samantha 3 weeks and during each conversation, she was rude, condescending and disrespectful. Finally I couldn't take it anymore and looked up several customer service emails and detailed my experiences with the Celebration Team and received an email from a different person, who offered nothing other than an apology.

Example: I was in the process of booking their biggest Penthouse until I was informed that outside drinks or food would be prohibited inside the Penthouse. When I asked if my kids had an ice cream cone from a business outside of the hotel what would happen, and they informed me that I would be subjected to an 18-20% penalty.

But don't we go to hotels for SERVICE?  The staff was actually very nice, but the way things are run, kept up and managed, i would give ONE star, IF that.
Honestly, the people who work there were all lovely.  But on our FIRST day, the TV broke twice, the phone needed fixing, the bathtub needed fixing, the room service table wouldn't fold up - It took FOREVER for anyone to ever answer the phone OR respond to requests. I was told by one lovely tech, ""John"" that your communication system (whatever it was called) was DOWN for an hour. 

Meanwhile, I'm having to HOBBLE to the door every time someone knocked due to an injured toe and open an EXTRAORDINARILY HEAVY door for the bath tub maintenance guy, housekeeping for extra hangers we requested about 2 hours prior, the tech who had to come FOUR times, and room service twice (as they didn't send water with no ice, as i requested)  Meanwhile, the tub tech showed up on top of that with hangers because he overheard me complaining to the front desk about my experience in just the first few hours.

NOT cool - when they would try to please us with say, a cheese\/fruit plate and a bottle of wine before going down to the spa, (ONLY after our very angry complaints where they were CLUELESS as how to ""take care of their guests properly"" we came back from the spa and would you believe, THEY TOOK IT BACK!???  The FIRST day of our trade show, after all the crap that happened the first night, OUR ROOM WASN""T EVEN CLEAN by 4 PM!  It was OUTRAGEOUS and the manager REFUSED to give my fellow guest the name\/number of the higher up, who turns out, she did get on her own (very resourceful girl).  She, by the way, booked the room ON MY REQUEST, as it was my FIRST break since pregnancy from my two year old and I'm EMBARRASSED at what lengths and inconveniences we experienced relocating, having to re-pack, etc.  NIGHTMARE.   We then relocated (and forfeited the next two nights prepaid) to the ENCORE and received 5 star, 5 diamond treatment (and two free nights because she is a big player - but also because they say this happens a lot)  WHAT a difference!!!  Sadly, by the time we got there, it was TOO LATE to have a nice dinner outside of our room.  NOT FUN, okay?

The hot tub was located in the shower! Our views were amazing, and it was cool to see Marquee below. The room was perfect size for a pregame. The Marquee below  is top notch, we saw Kaskade there and had a blast. This is now one of my favorite places to see a live DJ. Being that Cosmo is centrally located, entering \/ exiting the resort with your car can be tricky on the strip side.

I have stayed in all the rooms and suites in this hotel at one time or another. You would think as a frequent flyer I would be given a little special treatment. Nope doesn't happen at this hotel.

In most hotels they check their reservations that morning and try and get what the guest wants. Every time I come to this hotel I'm treated like I've never been here before. It's been 5 years since this hotel opened and in Vegas time that's 15 years. It's time for a remodel. The carpet was torn up. I still don't understand why you have a kitchen and no utensils. Also, I don't know a hotel that doesn't allow outside food or drinks. That's ridiculous. We had to hide our food in a suitcase to get it upstairs. I had a good time at both pools. Although the bamboo seems to be for the older crowd, which I'm a part of. I think this is a great hotel but it's going down hill.

Also our room was located next to the staff room, so there were constant loud noises the first two nights. When I complained to the front desk, the man was very understanding and he took care of it. 

Pool: pretty standard pool. It was a little too hot outside for us to truly enjoy it.

Check-in rep was a little bit dweeby but did nothing unprofessional, just didn't match the branding.

Once we saw the room I saw the Cosmo I'd been expecting. The terrace one bedroom with views of the Bellagio was one of the most badass rooms I've seen.  The layout of the bathroom is crazy sexy, and the tub fills up really fast, comfortably fitting two.  Bring your own bubble bath like I did!  Nothing like a soaking tub while watching the fountains.

Others have mentioned their neighbors getting busy on the balcony and I can confirm this.  Nothing like a loud couple going at it as your alarm clock on a hungover Sunday morning.  Haha.

Music situation was a little lame.  No aux cord in room (bring your own or wait 20 mins for front desk to send one up).  There really should be a better stereo system in here.  If you can get a chandelier, swaggy bathroom and this much space they could at least throw a bose unit in here or something.  The other bummer was that the room wasn't as clean as I would like.  Blinds were dusty and kitchen area floor was straight up sticky.

You'll be immediately greeted with glitz and glamour upon walking in. This place speaks class with it's shiny chandeliers, sparking crystals, fancy decor and a magnificent casino, definitely standing out from the rest of the competition.

Not only is the hotel itself spectacular but The Cosmopolitan rooms are just as amazing. With 1200 sq ft. the wraparound Terrace suite includes 1 bedroom, 2 bathrooms, a living room, dining room and three glass doors that open to 480 sq. ft. of private terrace with panoramic view of the Vegas skyline, it's luxury at it's finest. From the top, it's absolutely breathtaking especially after the sun goes down and the Bellagio fountain show begins, it's the best seats in the house. 

It's also home to some of the finest restaurants and hot spots such as The Wicked Spoon, Secret Pizza, Holsteins, STK, Milo and The Henry. You won't have to go far for the nightlife as The Chandelier, Marquee Nightclub, Bond and The Vesper are also at The Cosmo.

Having came here to celebrate the Best friends Birthday, it was a great choice. From our suite to watching Vegas light up at night out on the terrace to sipping on Cocktails at The Chandelier, it was a phenomenal experience. The Cosmopolitan is the place to be.

Pros: BEAUTIFUL hotel. We stayed in the wrap around balcony suite in the east towers over looking the Bellagio water show. It was gorgeous. Extremely deep bathtub, great showers, COMFY bed situation, and the technology in the room (especially all that you can access just from the TV) was off the chain.
Their pool area on the 4th floor was equally gorgeous. Cabanas were very relaxing.

Room service breakfast was really good although, FYI, they injecting something in them pancakes because they were Jurassic!

Valet service was VERY quick. We never had to wait to long for our car.

CONS: Customer service fail! They've got a lot of work to do. We were told because of our VIP Gold card status, our drinks would be comped at the bars in the hotel. NONE of the bartenders new what the hell we were talking about. Every time we tried to do it a manager (who wasn't around) has to be called. It ended up being too much of a hassle each time so we just said forget it. We even went to the designated VIP lounge and they had not been informed. 

We ordered a roll away bed and some more towels at 1am, went to Drais after hour spot, came back to the room at 7am (we went hard) and no one had even been there. Called two more times and still no one brought anything. Wasn't until we called angry about it that we finally got a ""oh the order wasn't entered correctly (all three times???) excuse.

Another issue: As I said, we spent a lot of money at this hotel, one of their most expensive suites, poker tourney, VIP status. The problem is VIP means not a damn thing at this hotel. There are no perks! We decided to go to Marque, the club inside the hotel, because they had a hip hop room and we weren't about the house music. We had 3 girls and 4 guys. Everyone dressed lovely. We get there, flash the VIP cars ans the bouncer tells us the guy to girl ratio is too low. We need one more girl....I'm not even going to discuss this further. All I'm going to say is, I'm VIP in your hotel and I can't get in your club because I'm short one damn female???

They've only been open about a month. They have a lot of work to do. They need to take better care of their VIP guests. If you're trying to do Vegas VIP...this ain't the place.

We've stayed at other hotels VIP and I have to say Encore has been the best as far as perks\/customer service goes.

First impression of the hotel is that it is for the young at heart. If you're planning to stay here for a family vacation, you're better staying at another hotel. Lots of young folks everywhere so if you don't want to hear music blaring at all hours of the day throughout the hotel or don't want the little ones to see women in their 6-inch heels, boobs hanging out, or asses hanging out- you're better off at Excalibur or Circus Circus.

Anyhow, the rooms are very modern. There's a big balcony, gorgeous tiled shower, big jet bathtub, & spacious two sink counter--& with five girls staying together we were very comfortable. Aside from the mini bar & mini frig, there was also a microwave & dishwasher. Although we didn't use the dishwasher, the microwave did come in handy.

I also enjoyed my time at the 4th floor pool. Back & forth chillin on the patio chairs & in the pool, drinking my frozen alcoholic drink while enjoying the Las Vegas sun. Beware of ordering food however, it takes forever! So either eat before you come to the pool or be very patient.

Don't forget to stop by the big chandelier to take pictures--I don't know how many pictures we took. There's also a bar so just chill there while waiting for Club Marquee to open.

Every genre of music at Club Marquee. No one will feel left out! There are also lots of tables & cabanas for bottle service. It gets packed quick so girls beware of wearing those 6 inch spikes-the only time you get to sit down is if you have a table to crash at.

Don't forget to eat at the buffet called The Wicked Spoon. Ate there for brunch and I really enjoyed my made to order omelet and my ready to build lox bagel. 

There are also other restaurants throughout the hotel. However, don't forget to eat at Holsteins. It's a pretty good burger joint. Milkshakes for the kids and you can also add alcohol for the adults. Not too hungry for an 8 or 16 ounce burger? No problem, they also serve tiny burgers which is a great little snack before the club. They come in three's so it's always good to share. 

Overall my experience at The Cosmopolitan was a pleasant one. Heard the customer service isn't that great but luckily I didn't experience any of that this past weekend. On my next Vegas getaway I will consider staying here again.",4,2,3

I remember vividly when the Hard Rock as the place to go 15 years ago. You would hardly see anyone over 30 in the clubs back then. As a new hotel opened up the Palms became the place to go with it's Ghostbar. Cosmopolitan appears to be one of the best party hotels on the strip these days.  This place appears to be thumping and bumping. You come here in the evening and it's like walking into one big night club with go-go dancers dancing on stands and elaborate lights and decor. Drinks are flowing and there appear to be people everywhere with deep bass music! 

Beware **** there can be some aggressive intoxicated-inebriated people like I've witnessed and the scene can get pretty sloppy as the night gets later. Also this is known to be a big place where lots of call girls come to try to sell their services to you. If you see a group of girls out together chances are they are not call girls.  If you see single girls coming up to you being extra friendly be cautious.  I'm not saying they are all shady, but beware.

I have some personal experiences here. I have enough personal experiences here to self-publish a goddamn, shitty book. 

Cosmopolitan is nice and shiny and at first look: a cool, slick resort casino. I was a big fan when Book\/Stage was hosting mini-residencies of eight shows. I practically lived here.

Yet, my troubles started once Deutsche Bank took over. 

Boulevard Pool
As chronicled in my Blvd Pool review (linked below), they kept me from entering shows that I had tickets for because I was arriving too late (according to them). To contextualise: they basically did everything that they could to keep me from an Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros (when it was the full group with Jade still) and I had to sneak into it. Never mind that there thirty minutes of live concert still fucking remaining for me to enjoy after I wasted ten minutes sneaking in. 

Casino Floor\/Identity® (Player's Club)
In terms of the gaming: I played and played in two promotional offers from Identity®. One of these promotions I recall vividly because it still pisses me off thinking of it today: Adele. Two tickets to Adele at Chelsea (the old Chelsea). One had to be present when they were awarded, so a gift homer if one accrued the points and showed up at the time of the stupid giveaway. Except for one little detail that was so hidden in the fine print one had to be a corporate attorney to catch wind: it was only on specific machines that no employee that I came across could tell me with certainty. Fucking scam artists. 

Concierge
In terms of the concierge: this is where they earn their rating. I purchased floor tickets to Kevin Hart, early show. Something came up and I couldn't go. I called the concierge and asked if I could switch them to the late show. Paraphrasing: well, those seats are sold out for the late show. 

Okay, I understand. How about you give me the shittiest tickets you have for that late show and you can give away or sell once more or so whatever the fuck you want with my much more expensive early tickets? I'll paraphrase their response once more: well, tickets are nonrefundable and no exchanges. 

Alright. I understand the standard, corporate language on the back of ducats. This is not my first rodeo, asshole. I am calling you because you are supposed to be a concierge, asshole. Moreover, why didn't you say this to begin with instead of sharing with me the pointless information that all tickets on the floor were sold out for the late show (if you weren't capable of exchanging)? Fucking assholes. 

The tickets went to waste; and you get a fucking one-star for it, you useless scumbags. Enjoy!

Instead of like other hotels who have a security guard at the entrance to the elevator, at Cosmo you had to put the keys in the elevator to actually even press the floor level. I find this more convenient then the security guard.

While beautiful, I just don't think this place is worth the price. The walls are horribly thin for such a new building and I've spent the trip listening to the very clear conversations of our next door neighbors that start at 6am and go until past midnight. Not acceptable when I'm paying ~$300\/night. And while the open room layout is nice to look at, it's not very functional.

If you are intending to open a resort in Vegas, well, there's the model by which you should meet or exceed!

I suggest getting there early and leaving late.

Arriving to the hotel is like arriving to the set of a movie (or some island resorts if you've been to few with the epoxy drive ways, etc).  Once you turn off the main street and into the valet area of the hotel, you know for sure you are in for an ultra-hip experience.

From the fragrance that fills the air to the details of the 5 story chandelier, you know that no detail was spared the hotel. The thing that's most impressive about this resort is the casino area on the first 5 or so floors. WOW. 

I beg of you - get to the Marquee early!

3 fantastic pools!  The strategy should be different for all 3.  #1 - Bamboo - go here in the morning for a more peaceful atmosphere and brunch. #2. Boulevard - check out this pool for the special events or if you want to do lunch and play some games in between soaking in the pool. LOVED it.  Louder younger crowd.. #3 Day Club pool - this is a spot for all day and night.  I believe it is connected to Marquee, but I can't really  be sure. I should have asked.

The Bond Bar - uhm basically a club, sans the $25 cover charge.  I preferred being here for that reason.  Great drinks and nice bartenders. Oh yeah, and it practically sits on the strip!  So people walking by wave at ya if you're sitting on the near side of the bar... they just basically wish they were you.

my only complaint is the Cosmo's rooms just are not as nice as Aria's rooms.  Aria has the Cosmo beat on rooms.  Other than that, no other casino can open down there and not be compared to the Cosmopolitan.",3,1,2

We arrived and checked in at VIP Registration. While my wife grabbed some juices and sodas, I spoke to the clerk who offered a suite with a connector for my 9 year-old son. While he checked on availability, I was offered an array of alcoholic options. Although I declined, it's nice to know that champagne and such were available.

The collection of rooms was - in a word - huge. To give some perspective, I didn't know we had a third bathroom until we were about to check out on Sunday. Luxurious bedding and pillows, prompt service, and easy to use technology.

The staff - across the board - are friendly and courteous. We only had two major meals - room service and buffet Saturday night. Total cost for trip? Under $25.

The location is terrific, by the way. Easy walk to Caesar's in one direction, a short hop to MGM in the other. Who could ask for anything more?",0,0,0

We were on the 26th floor east tower.  I was disappointed to know the Marquee nightclub is outside on the weekends and is open until 4:30 am.  We paid the most for that night and had to listen to the club music echo off the building. It sounded like the party was on our balcony.  I called down to the front desk, they did offer to move us but they didn't have a room free.  They did offer us ear plugs.  But we paid a lot of money for our room i should be able to go to sleep in a quiet room.  I called about something at least twice a day.  It shouldn't be this way for a 5 star hotel.  We have stayed at Aria and Bellagio twice.  I don't think I would return here.  Other than its pet friendly I would come back MAYBE with my dog.  It's a great place to hangout and party then go back to a clean quiet room

Customer Service:  I would say they did the best they could do with the amount of complaints they receive.  They comp'd us for our troubles.  They clearly are coached on what to say, I  can only imagine the number of complaints they get.

Room: When we checked in the room was filthy.  The ash tray on the balcony was still filled. Glasses looked like they were just whipped down with a towel and ever replaced.  There were light bulbs missing from the room, the remote for the tv had the batteries taken out, scale in the bathroom didn't work. (not that i want to weigh myself on vacation, but i expect things to work) We called daily about things not being cleaned in our room.  Every morning the maid would knock on the door at 9:00 am asking to clean the room. the sign was on the door but they insisted to clean the room now.  We eventually stopped answering the door.  The towels were never replaced.  Sometimes they were just left on the floor.  AND we left the maid a tip every day.    We returned one afternoon to find a cigarette butt on the floor EWWWW we don't smoke.  The Internet was not working, you shouldn't have to pay for wireless these days.  Its  15.00 a day.  The air jets in the tub would turn on randomly.

Food: The wicked spoon was GREAT well worth the money.  Brunch they offer all you can drink bloody mary's and mimosa's with the purchase of a beverage.  Great deal.  The word on the street its one of the best buffets, people know it so you get a lot of outside traffic.  Expect to wait in line in peek hours.'

Overall I think the hotel staff is very green, they need to revamp the house keeping staff and do something about the nightclub. The rooms are expensive on the weekend, people shouldn't have to deal with that.  Or warn people on the weekends that they can opt to a different room.",1,0,0

Hopefully they'll sort it out eventually BC the rooms ar gorgeous, the casino is gorgeous, the staff is extremely friendly, they have a great selection of casino games, the restaurant line up can't be beat and its a very unique property.

I ended up not checking in till after 6PM.  On top of that while talking to the front desk and pleading to have my room ready,  there were other people in line to complain.  Meanwhile front desk people were trying to upgrade people's rooms like a high pressure timeshare representative. 

Needless to say, when I walked the stairs to go to my room, I saw employees hanging around the steps, some smoking.  I got lost and asked for assistance, but the employees said they did not know. 

Scary thing is none of their employees wear badges.  All employees were hesitating to give their names.  Why? I don't know, but weird.

My anticipation to stay at this hotel was off the richter scale. I made a reservation for my 25th birthday knowing that it was not going to disappoint. 

Driving into the structure you leave the old Las Vegas behind and enter an extremely high class futuristic modern take on the new transformation of the strip. Huge silver metallic letters spelling out COSMOPOLITAN adorn the wall as you enter the valet\/drop off. The lobby is a sight to see in itself with huge pillars displaying screens of moving art and fashion. The check in process was a breeze and met with great customer service and smiles. They seemed to truly make sure my birthday was going to be met with satisfaction. He saw that I had previously booked a wraparound balcony suite yet cancelled since I had a smaller group going. I told him I still wanted an amazing view though. He said ""let me see what I can do"" and left. He then came back and told us we could have a wraparound for 100 more a night. We immediately took him up on that. The room was huge and the balcony, being on the 65th floor, made our jaws drop... and not retract till check out. Large living room, huge full kitchen, oversized master bath and also a guest bathroom. The bed was out of this world and made me sleep in both mornings. 

The food options here are great. HOLSTEINS was a new take on a burger restaurant with quirky names and ingredient combinations. I had a salmon burger since I'm pescatarian. The burger was ""ok"" yet I have had much better. I guess that's what I get for eating at a burger themed restaurant when I don't eat red meat. Both my other friends did enjoy their meals though. Before heading to MARQUEE we grabbed a bite from Secret Pizza which is hiding down an unmarked long hallway. The pizza joint looks very new york with no frills and a simple menu. Honestly, some of the best pizza I have ever had. 

MARQUEE was one of the best clubs I have ever been to, with multi levels and different themed rooms playing different types of music. The main room was a full on party with fog blowing out so much at moments my vision would go white, and the pink and purple metallic confetti raining over the audience. 

This hotel has remained my favorite yet and I can't wait to go back and stay.",1,0,0

There was built up dust under just about everything, the patio's ashtray had not been emptied, the window was in desperate need of cleaning, the bathroom floor was dirty, there were no wash towels, no glasses, and no coffee maker in the room.  When we checked out we had a HUGE bill for all the snacks and beverages that are in the room (even though we did not use any of them).  Turns out all the snacks and beverages are sitting on sensors, so if you even move one, the system assumes you have consumed it.  While they did remove the charges, the hotel clerk curtly told us that the refrigerator was only for the items offered for sale.  A quick check on The Cosmopolitan's website list ""refrigerator"" under the amenities.  Ridiculous!

First off let me say that we did not stay at the Cosmopolitan only had dinner at the Wicked Spoon Buffet (excellent! Best Buffet in Vegas). But while spending some time in the hotel it occurred to me that I could never stay here. The crowd this hotel draws really is for the 21-30 crowd and the majority of them were hip, trendy and metro. I'd bet the majority were single too. Not your everyday working class folks if you know what I mean. This crowd does fit the hotel though. I doubt you'd see as many kids here as other hotels. I really did fall in love with this hotel too. OMG to the decor in the Cosmopolitan Hotel! Amazing decor! Make sure to tour the whole second floor the restaurant is on.

It's sultry, sexy, and sleek without being overly pretentious, smoky, or dark.  They have a nice bank of cheap penny slots (the only ones I play) which still gets plenty of attention from the nice and nicely-dressed cocktail waitresses.  The staff at the Identity desk were also very nice and helpful.

As with most things in Vegas, the Cosmo is bigger than you'd think and that means there are some nooks and crannies where one can get away from the crowds and find some peace and quiet for a bit.  The designers planned for this and added some little surprises and amusements tucked away in the back halls.  Even in the more active areas, the space is generally easy to move through and the skybridges connecting to Aria (via the Crystals Mall) and Planet Hollywood are very convenient.

We didn't stay at the hotel, so I can't offer any opinion on the rooms, but we spent by far the majority of our time here and liked the Chandelier, Secret Pizza, and China Poblano (see my reviews for more details).  However, we were sorely disappointed by Holstein's.  Can't win them all, I guess.  We also got to pop into their pop-up chapel (pun intended) to attend a mock wedding for charity, which resulted in free champagne and mini cupcakes.  Who can complain about that?  

Last but not least, we came here to catch a cab back to the airport and found the experience as smooth as one could wish.  The taxi stand is to the back of the hotel, away from the Strip, and we were able to walk right up and be helped into a cab with our luggage.",1,0,3

I recently stayed for 4 nights and will definitely be making a repeat visit to Cosmo.   Check in was easy, the staff was great, the hotel was impeccable, and the gaming was great too. The casino was not too big and getting around was easy, which was a nice change from many of the other hotels I have stayed at in Las Vegas. The location was by far the best, being right on the strip near the center. Additionally, the three pool options and many dining and drinking options were fantastic.

I enjoyed the young vibe and energy that The Cosmopolitan offered. The location was very close to Aria and Bellagio and offered many activities, shopping and food within a short walking distance.

My 'Studio with Terrace and View' room was fantastic. Clean, modern, luxurious and comfortable. And it was quiet inside which was important to me. But being on the terrace meant street noise and a\/c noise but that is to be expected. There was nothing I could have complained about with my room. 

The room was huge and the bed very comfortable. Lights, alarm and TV are controlled by the TV remote control. Easy to use once you get the hang of it. Or you can use the light switches as normal. I had a great view of the Bellagio Fountains and also some of the Strip. It makes for a pleasant time on the terrace with a wine or two! 

The japanese bath was about 4 feet deep and very welcoming after a long day.   I only ate at the Wicked Spoon for buffet brunch so can't report on anything except that. It was good, small pots so you don't take more than you really should. The omelet station was great. And the dessert bar with gelato section was also great.

While every new hotel in Vegas is getting bigger and grander, Cosmo is keeping it classy. This place is very boutique hotel feeling, more intimate and sexy. 

Heard the hotel was originally suppose to be private property condos, so the rooms still have the home like feel. Walking into your suite will feel like winding down and settling back at home. Tastefully done artwork, very mod furniture, upscale New York feeling. I've never been so impressed with the detail of a hotel - and they have awesome toiletry, you really get what you pay for. Full service mini fridge and 2 tvs, open concept like a real loft.

Aside from the visuals, service was great - champagne was served upon notice that their computers were down (which caused an hour wait). This is where I dock a star, in consideration that I stayed here over New Years and everything is pretty new, they still have A LOT of kinks to work out. The phone in my room didn't work, causing me not to have access to bell desk or late check out. They had server problems. The door key wasn't working properly.

Originally we were booked to stay in the Terrace Suite. However, when I checked in, the nice front desk woman offered an upgrade to the Wraparound for only $45 more per night (originally $200 more per night online). She also let me in on a little tip; when checking into a hotel, it's almost always better to book the less expensive room and then ask for the upgrade at check-in. It makes sense cause they probably just want to fill their rooms, assuming they're not completely booked. I'll have to test out this theory at my next hotel stay.

The most unique part about The Cosmo is they have balconies for a lot of their rooms. In the wraparound, the balcony literally wraps all the way around the two external facing sides of the room (imagine that!). Being on the 63rd floor we had an amazing view of the strip and could spend time out there on the two sofa seats. The room itself was very spacious and luxurious.

For a 1000 dollars a night you would think customer service would be better. Room was nice but the trouble to get to it was mot worth the hassle,1,0,0

I was sexually harassed in the elevator my first day. (According to video the guy poked my behind. When I reported it I just said he touched my behind in someway since I wasn't positive what he had done) a security manager took my statement and assured me it would be handled. It wasn't. The tapes were not even reviewed until after my nearly weeklong stay had ended... 

On my second to last night, I was assaulted again in the elevator. I was 100% sober. The report does not say that because it was EDC weekend. I will admit I got in the guys face after he shoulder checked me and I was screaming and red hot angry, but I did not touch him or threaten to. I just made sure he didn't leave, notified cleaning staff who called security. I was extremely shaken up especially because this was the second incident of unwanted physical contact in less then a week! I have an anxiety disorder and nearly had a panic attack so the guard ex courted me to my room to take my medication then asked if I wanted the police called. After saying yes, I was taken to the security interview room. That is when things got ridiculous. I was still incredibly upset and had my friend with me. I was asked for my story several times, when the security manager (same one that ""helped"" me with my first incident) came in. When I said I wanted to press charges he scared and threatened me out of doing so. He said the guy who hit me could and would press charges against me in retaliation and that he would personally kick us out of the hotel as trespassers. When I asked to speak to another manager he denied my request. I felt trapped because I would have nowhere else to stay so I didn't press charges. 

When I checked out of the hotel I told a manager what happened he was polite and curtesy of course and he said he would pass it on. 

It was passed into risk management.

The guy dealing with my claim admitted he did not watch the tape from the interview room and refused to do so because reports from that day did not mention the managers threats (surprise, surprise...) and that I was intoxicated. When I responded by saying that it was wrong that he didn't even consider the possibility I was telling the truth bc a report made by people working under the manager said I was drunk and that I changed my mind about pressing charges and it shouldn't matter because he can watch the video and hear the manager threaten me himself. He responded by saying he had watched enough videos and would not watch it. 

As I told him, I hope his (you or your) daughter, mother, or sister is never judged and treated the way I was after being assaulted and then further mistreated by someone who is SUPPOSED to get down to the truth.

I am shocked that a hotel I paid $2000 for and charges more then that usually would tolerate employees speaking to a guest like that and bullying them. Even if I had been drunk he threatened me with eviction if I pressed charges! So wrong.

Needless to say I am seeing what the Las Vegas police can do about this matter. I may not get anywhere, but I will do whatever I can to see that this doesn't happen to anyone else.",6,4,1

The room smelled like flowers and drinks were located in the mini fridge, for a fee of course.  It's still vegas people.

My boyfriend and I were lucky to get free tickets on their last day. When we got there, there wasn't a small line. The line took a bit of time because everyone was on the tablet(3) set on the side for people to sign wavier forms. Each adult must fill out a form. A minor can be attached to an adult's form (I think, I didn't have a minor so I didn't do this part). After filling out the form, which took less than a minute, there is another person who is holding onto a tablet with the wavier forms. He'll ask to see your ID to verify and you receive a wonderful stamp of an ice skate. After this step you pay for the skates (on the receipt it said $10 per person) You need the receipt to show the next booth to get the skates. The skates run in men sizes.

WARNING: Do not, I repeat, do not take off your shoes first. I made the mistake of taking my shoes off before finding a place to sit and put on my ice skates. Let's just say I had one sock that got wet and I hopped to find a seat. 

It was FREEZING cold, but you can easily get warm with varies of heater around.
As this was my first time ice skating, I wish I had more room to practice skating. It was very cramped and it didn't help my nerves when people were skating out of control. It was embarrassing but I'll admit it. I use the plastic animal seal they have for beginner skaters. I mostly saw kids with these or parents with their kids. I was more embarrassed in the beginning but I was having way to much fun towards the end to even care. MY SO asked if I wanted to sit on the seal, which you can to be pushed around. I was already embarrassed using it. I didn't need to bring it to a whole new level.

We had to stop half way in because they had to redo the ice, which took almost half an hour or so. It started to get cold after this because we were only sitting around waiting. The wait felt like forever. I was tempted to just leave but I was just getting used to the skates so I decided to stick to it and wait. We did two more laps and left because it was getting awfully crowded.

This is a great place to take for a date, maybe a small family. Since it can get crowded, don't expect to be skating fast. The rink is only the size of a swimming pool and not a large one either.

I would probably do it again and maybe go early so there is less people skating.",0,0,0

I love the set up of the lobby. It reminds me of Inception when I look up at the ceiling and see all the mirrors up there.

The casino is pretty nice. There's no strong smell of smoke compared to other casinos I've been to. The slot machines are not loose though! I wasted my money here.

The staff is very accommodating though. One of the slot machines ate up our $5 bill and wouldn't return it, and one of the workers came over within a few minutes and gave us back a $5 bill right away.

We stayed in the City Room, which has 2 queen-size beds. The bed was a bit too soft for my back. I actually woke up the next day with my back hurting a little, but it didn't bother me for the rest of the day.

I find it hilarious how the shower has a window, so people hanging out in the bedroom area can see you shower if they want to. There's a curtain for you to pull down so no one can view, but the curtain is on the bedroom area side. The shower window is definitely something I wouldn't like having if I was living in this hotel with goofy\/drunk friends I can't trust.

If your dream is to be in the center of it all, this is the place to be!  

The rooms are exceptionally stylish and really do live up to and exemplify ""cosmopolitan"".  My view from the 25th floor presented breathtaking vistas of the Bellagio water show and the Eiffel Tower of the Paris and much more eye candy on the strip.  
Be sure to request a room with such a great panorama of Vegas with which to take in the spectacle!

While I truly loved and enjoyed the room and the service of the hotel, there was surprisingly no coffee maker or alarm clock\/radio in the room and the windows were far overdue for a cleaning, which did distract somewhat from that spectacular view, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.

All and all, this hotel is swank and sophisticated, both a great place for a business conference or just decadent Las Vegas vice, and well worth a stay.  One more thing, the Chandelier Bar is absolutely spectacular and must not be missed!",2,1,2

This is like my 4th or 5th time heading to the city & we've stayed at many hotels but lusted after staying at the Cosmopolitan because it's GORGEOUS & so fab :)

We weren't disappointed when we checked in. Our bathroom had a huge tub & huge shower. There was a little partition that covered the little opening they had between the room & the bathroom. Our balcony had the BEST view of the strip. We got to see every single Bellagio fountain show from the afternoon to late at night. Our suite had two TV's in it & a dishwasher, lol.

Now that we were in the middle of the strip all the clubs we went to were on the Mandalay Bay side which is where we stayed many times.... Not Cosmo's fault though, just simply stating the obvious :)

There's also a bar next to it, and there's even a display case where I saw a woman dancing in the display case one evening.

Upstairs there's a swanky nightclub, and some cool shops and restaurants. I ate at China Poblano (don't recommend... see my review) but there's also Holstein's Burgers and Shakes next door that looks promising.

Wicked Spoon buffet is also here. I haven't had a chance to try it yet, but know there's a buffet option here.

We stayed for 4 days. The hotel staff never cleaned our room. They never dumped our trash or provided clean glasses. They did not vacuum the floors or clean the bathtub. There were hand prints on the mirror that were never windex'd the entire time we were there. They only made the bed and provided new towels. We also walked into our bathroom toilet area reeking of weed. There is no ventilation to another room and it is a separate room to the main bathroom area, so it was obvious it was the staff. 
We had discovered Secret Pizza which is the best part about the entire hotel! Until a fight broke out inside and after a 30 minute wait no one got pizza because the place was covered in blood and had to be shut down. 
Due to the concert they chose to hold that evening the Las Vegas Gang unit was all over the hotel, apparently they missed this location. 
The chandelier bar also is visually amazing, however when you sit and pay $20.00 for a beverage and you have a kid dump their solo cup over the couch on you, it makes it all a bit lack luster.

With it's modern decor, it's appealing to the younger\/hip crowd that wants to do Vegas large. I stayed here for a bachelorette party and shared the room with a couple of girlfriends. It also works for a romantic weekend or if you just want to indulge and spoil yourself, when in Sin City.

The room was pretty large -  a terrace studio with two queen beds. Enough to accomodate two queens, a small sofa, armchair, coffee table, desk, huge bathroom, two closets and a kitchenette. In no way, did it feel crowded, even with the entire bachelorette party (about 12 girls) stuffed into our room to take shots before heading out. Lots of shots.

From a bachelorette weekend standpoint, there were three benefits to staying here. The first was having the Marquee located in the hotel. No need for us to hail a taxi to drive out and come back. If there were any walks of shame, it was straight back to the hotel room. The second was the Boulevard Pool. Our second day there, we rented a day bed and scored some lounge chairs, under some palm trees, to recover from the previous night's activities. The last benefit was The Wicked Spoon. Nothing like ending a great party weekend with buffet food. I kid you not. I'm all about the buffet.

Would I stay here voluntarily? Not necessarily. The hotel is pretty expensive. It averaged about $500 a night for our room. If it weren't for a friend who hooked it up because she stays here frequently, it wouldn't be my first choice of hotel. Then, there's the crowd to consider. It's definitely a party hotel and unless you don't plan on sleeping, you can hear crowds of folks going back to their rooms at all hours of the night. It is Vegas. Duh.",4,2,2

My first time in Vegas, which was years ago, I stayed at the Bellagio. At the Bellagio my room was basic and cost about $300 that night and didn't have a good view at all. In order to watch the fountain show, I had to actually go outside and view it with a bunch of frumpy tourists. My patience for that type of thing is very limited so I got over it fast. It was really nice to be able to watch the show while having a few drinks on the privacy of my own balcony at The Cosmopolitan. I've additionally stayed at the Wynn, Palms and Palms Place and The Cosmopolitan has them all beat.

The casino of the Cosmopolitan is nice, are there casinos in Vegas that I find to be more classic? Yes, but the Cosmopolitan is very hip and...cosmopolitan. Due to it being the newest hotel in Vegas, it does draw in a fair amount of trendy people. This hotel is definitely a great place to stay at if you're looking to have a crazy, fun Vegas trip, there is a lot of that energy here.

Additionally, the pool is amazing because it's complete with a view of Las Vegas unlike the other good hotels (Bellagio, Wynn, etc.) which have pools on the ground level.

Marquee is the dayclub and nightclub at the hotel and definitely one of the better venues for drinking in Vegas. I'm not going to say the crowd is amazing because it's relatively general public, like everything else in Vegas. Essentially, you dress up, wait in a line and get in. I will say, the space is nice and because it is the newest spot in Vegas, you will get a lot of attendance. What I love MOST about Marquee is the staff is extremely accommodating and nice. They go above and beyond to make sure their guests are having a good time and are very attentive. There's a frozen lemonade alcoholic beverage that is AMAZING as well.",1,0,0

Only complaints are that housekeeping came by relatively late in the afternoon (3:30-4pm). But we arranged for service at a later time with no issues. 
Also, it did get a bit noisy at night, and I'm talking about street noise that we heard 39 stories up.

from the commercials and these reviews, i was expecting a super luxury posh place similar to bellagio, wynn and venetian.

This place had more of a boutique hotel feel to it.  

It's a lot smaller than i thought.   The main attractions from what i could tell were a couple bars, the middle chandelier that goes from the top floor to the bottom and the restaurants.

I was a bit disappointed to find out that the restaurants were the same(at least in name) to some in LA.  I believe they have a Comme Ca and an STK there.  

The bars though were actually quite chill.  We spent the bulk of our time over at Bond which is on the right side of the casino, near the doors. We were there on sunday night so it might not have been as packed as a typical weekend.   The smaller crowd size on this day is definitely one i'd prefer over a packed madhouse. 

There was also a cool assortment of seating scattered around upstairs that i really enjoyed.  I think i sat in about 4 different chairs ha.

The main thing i didnt like about the place was the gaming.  I walked around everywhere(which isnt actually very large) looking for a 15 dollar minimum blackjack game, but on this fairly slow sunday, all i could find were 25 and 50 dollar minimum games.    Also in my search, i noticed that the further back i walked, the less glitzy and fancy the place got.

so yeah, i'd check it out again but it's definitely more of a place to just check out and not stay too long.",3,1,3

I WAS HARASSED, ACCUSED, VERBALLY ABUSED, SLANDERED, HUMILIATED AND DISCRIMINATED BY COSMOPOLITAN SECURITY STAFF WHEN I DID NOTHING WRONG.  If you ever stay there please know THIS HOTEL WILL AND CAN THROW YOU OUT FOR NO REASON AND NOT REFUND YOUR MONEY! THEY CAN HARASS YOU AND REMOVE YOU AT ANYTIME!  
On vacation from Atlanta my girlfriend and I were exiting the elevator when we were approached by one of the hotel security guards requested to see our IDs and we willingly show them to him. He thanked us and was glad to see that we were of age and let us go on about our way. My girlfriend needed to go back to the room before we went out to the club to dance, and I decided to sit on the sofa and wait for her to come down the elevator. Meanwhile a gentleman sitting in a chair across to me kept making eye contact and started asking me questions. I answered and since he was horse I mention he could come sit next to me to finish our conversation.  Immediately the same security gentleman came back over asking my full name.  He later apologized and the manager Aaron came over to apologize.  Then in a matter of minutes he comes and whispers in Aaron's ear and next thing I know I'm being asked to leave!
The first reasoning was that he claimed I was soliciting. Which to solicit means asked for or try to obtain something from someone, ask for something, or a call someone an offer someone a service as a prostitute. I did engage in a conversation with the man, but I did not in any shape or form solicited anyone! 
Then the security tried to say that he is removing both my friend and I for suspicious activity within the last few minutes.  I turn to the two police officers and ask them if I did anything wrong and why they were asking me to leave. The police offices themselves said that I didn't do anything wrong and that they were not asking me to leave but the hotel being on private property reserves the right to remove guest for unspecified reasons.  The fact that no one could give me a reason as to why I was being removed indicates that there was not a valid reason. Especially since I did not do anything suspicious or Illegal! 
As cooperative as I could possibly be I packed all of my belongings answered all of the security questions, gave security my identification on five occasions, and was escorted out! 
The hotel did not refund our money or security deposit!! 
I'm not sure if someone with the same name as me has had an issue, but I am sure I have never stayed at the cosmopolitan in my life.  And I've only been to Vegas a total of three times. 

The security guards even went to the extent to slander us by mentioning to one of our male friends\/colleagues that,""He should Stay away from us because we are from here."" That was news to my friend being that he knows us from Atlanta and we all flew in to Vegas tonight on vacation.  
Again, I'm not quite sure who the security thinks I am? 
I am a hard working entrepreneur visiting Vegas on vacation, and I don't understand why I was persecuted against this morning?
Had I been an 400 pound lady, I'm pretty sure this would not have happened. 
This experience was obviously embarrassing, humiliating and I was made to feel like a criminal when in fact I did nothing wrong. And if I had I'm sure I would've been ticketed or arrested being that I was being so closely watched by both security and the police.",8,2,0

My room was right above the pool so the noise was deafening during the day but the point is that no one is in their room during the day. There were lots of great restaurant options though once I discovered Secret Pizza, it was hard to eat anything else.

Needless to say, the experience we had at the cosmopolitan was less than average. We stayed at the Palazzo before and for the same amount of money, the cosmopolitan lacked the basic 5 star hotel necessities. 

To begin- we got into the hotel room and the bathroom light did not work. We called down and it wasn't fixed that evening. It wasn't until the next night that it was fixed. We had 4 people in a 2 queen bed room. There were only 2 towels. We asked for more towels and they took so long to bring us towels that we just left. We had to bug them so many times to bring us more towels. 

Let's talk about cleaning- when we got there, there were pecans and walnuts in the bed between the frame as the mattress. When we left, they were still there. They didn't clean the room... 

The design of the room is really inefficient. The closet door is the same sliding door for the bathroom... If the room is supposed to accommodate more than 1 person, why make a door that if someone was in the bathroom, could not get out if you have someone else getting changed from clothes in the closet. Sigh

Overall, not satisfied with the experience at the Cosmo. We were expecting a really great experience and tried to do something different than the usual Palazzo hotel.",5,3,0

Our terrace studio was beautiful, our house keeper did an amazing job, and valet was so excellent... until our very last night.

Had some difficulties with my flight but arrived safely on Tuesday.  The day before, I noticed a cheaper AAA rate was available, and called the hotel to ask their local reservation office to change the rate.  The hotel operator was on hold a half hour and was never able to reach them, so they sent me to the national Marriott reservation line.  I specifically asked to not do anything to the reservation except change the rate, which they informed me they had.  When I arrived, I found that the Marriott operator cancelled my old reservation and created a new reservation, which pulled a second deposit on my card (they pull the first night's rate as a deposit).  The system also decided to keep my first deposit.  I was able to speak to someone and eventually get that deposit refunded, about a week later.

So much about my reservation.  Marriott Platinum - not worth much here, except you do have your own check-in desk, so you don't wait in the giant check-in line.  Platinum status is good for a one tier upgrade which won't be available.  A suite is about 13 tiers from the City room, so if you want an upgrade, you will have to pay extra.  My upgrade was about 5 tiers and the extra charge was reasonable.  It's Las Vegas so expect some differences.  The Internet was free for Platinum so that was a good perk, and I got a discount at the buffet.  No early check-in or late check-out.

The room - remember I did get an upgrade - it was spectacular.  I was in the Chelsea Tower on the 58th floor, with a balcony, and was able to see the Bellagio fountains the entire week.  The bathroom could have been a little more private but the only people able to see into the room would be in the many choppers flying by.  Service was iffy - but adequate.  They asked for a time to come service the room, very nice to do that, but never showed at that time.  They normally came by around 4pm.

Casino - this was very nice, we found some games to play and won a little money.  Entertainment is available here and other places, shopping was OK.  The best thing about the Cosmo is the location, it's a quick walk to the other Casinos, shopping and shows.  There is a bus stop right outside the hotel and one across the street by footbridge.

Only word of caution is that if you don't plan on coming back soon, you might request to get Marriott Rewards points instead of their Identity Rewards points for your stay.  I ended up with Identity Points, enough to get me a single night free (likely not an upgrade), but I lose them if I don't come back within 12 months.  I don't even know if Marriott Rewards points were an option.",2,0,1

It's a new and very modern hotel with a lot of great dining options; however, there is something a little bit different about the Cosmo compared to some of the other hotels in Las Vegas (such as the Encore). I think it's because it tends to attract a younger crowd so the rooms look and feel like they've seen a lot of partying. 

The Cosmo also has smaller casino floor compared to some of the other hotels. The hotel does feature the beautiful 3 story chandelier bar which is definitely worth checking out. The room rates are very reasonable and the Bellagio fountain view rooms are amazing. The suites are also very spacious with small kitchen, livingroom area, desk, multiple TVs, and a luxurious bathroom. Again, the suite feels like they have seen a lot of rough nights which takes away from the feeling that you get at some of the other higherend hotels. I also think the people theme throughout the hotel is  a little creepy. 

Bottom line, not sure the Cosmo will be our ""go to"" hotel spot but it will definitely do the job if you need somewhere to book on the south end of the strip.",6,3,3

Decor is outstanding..but a few details comparing to the likes of Aria, Encore, Bellagio. No newspaper on the door, no chocolate on the pillow after turn down, no bath salts or bubble bath for the Japanese soaking tub. O.K the mini bar has an extra compartment for your stuff at the bottom but beware its a sub zero section. Bedroom T.V lost network connection and took several hours to get the I.T guy to reboot it (seems like a common problem there). Meal at Overlook grill was pretty bad (see my review). Who orders a fruit salad and expects only to get grapes and pineapple (and not even fresh).
Superbowl Sunday saw blackjack tables (on the main floor) $500 minimum. Even roulette was $25. Went downtown to gamble. Most high end places make you show room key to get near an elevator. Here they skip that and make someone on the elevator put in a room key to go up. Not quite as secure.

Consistency is the key to success and it is obvious that the experience you will receive at the Cosmopolitan is not consistent. As I entered the room I noticed the carpet at the entry way of the room was coming apart. The privacy screen to the bathroom was broken. The sink in the bathroom was cracked. IT services was called to my room twice to get the tvs working. When I ordered room service for breakfast, the sausage was raw on the inside. The icing on the cake was the housekeeping or lack of housekeeping. I left my room at 10am. I returned at 5pm with the expectation that my room would be clean and ready for company. To my surprise, housekeeping had not cleaned my room, AT FIVE PM, I STILL HAD A FILTHY ROOM WITH DIRTY TOWELS ON THE GROUND. I was supposed to have people over that night and my plans were ruined. Oh, I almost forgot the best part, the bathtub jets turned on, by themself, every couple of hours and through the night. The room was poor quality and the attempt at service recovery was pathetic.

We got the terrace suite (separate kitchen\/living room and bedroom). The first time it happened, my boyfriend and I got back to the hotel and stayed in the bedroom. 5 minutes later I walked out to the kitchen\/living room area and there was a bottle of 7 up on the table. Neither of us bought 7 up, we didn't hear anyone come in, none of our stuff moved\/taken....why is there soda on the table?! I was pretty freaked out. We went to the front desk to see what was going on and a few minutes later they said Insomniac left it there because we purchased the room through their promotion. Not sure if it was Insomniac or just staff in the hotel, but they came in anyway.

The second time it happened, we called front desk to request for a late check out. The next day, the lady came in thinking no one was in the room.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, the mistakes, let me count the ways:

1. Room was not available on check-in. The desk clerk refused to give an estimate on when it would be ready, but promised a text message.

2. There was no text message when the room was ready. Eventually, we checked back at the front desk, and they said it was ready. (Much later that night, finally the text came.)

3. They gave us the wrong room type, with no warning.

4. Ichabod at the front desk was very RUDE.  When we asked about the wrong room type, he tried to convince us that we really wanted the room they gave us. There was NO APOLOGY at all. He was DISHONEST about it. He said that the room we got was bigger (it's smaller) and more money (it's the same price). I told him he was wrong, as I was looking at their website on the web browser at the front desk, which had the room dimensions and prices. He implied that there was something wrong with us for wanting the room that we reserved. He said that he always stays in that style room. He said that he has never had anyone be unhappy with that room. The room we wanted was all booked up. (Apparently, everyone else thought the room we wanted was better too.) Terrible customer service. No excuse. If I order a chocolate shake, and the waiter brings me strawberry by mistake, he shouldn't try to sell me on the merits of the strawberry shake.

--The Cosmopolitan could have just told us from the start that they had to switch our room type and apologized.--


5. The bell desk took about 45 min to bring up our bags. We had to call twice, because they did not come after 30 min.

6. Several of the light switches in the room did not work. There were lights that we couldn't turn off or couldn't dim.

7. The TV remote was dying.

8. Room service: the crackers and flatbread were missing from our cheese plate.

9. White stains on the couch. (Hmm. . .Where's Catherine Willows with the UV light?)

10. What is with the lack of trash cans?? And no coffeemaker. . .You might as well pretend that the kitchenette does not exist, especially since no outside food or drink is allowed. It is an illusion.

11. Poorly designed shower-tub layout (in the ""terrace one bedroom""): The shower looks awfully pretty, but once you're inside, you realize the layout is a bad idea. Because the shower is open on one side, there is nothing to contain the warm, steamy air. The open side connects to the tub, which is open to the bed area and the whole unit. Outside that stream of water is nothing but air conditioning, which feels great when you're dry, but not so much when you're wet. Whatever side of you not facing the water gets cold fast.

I'm not super enthusiastic about the ""Japanese soaking tub"" either. It's a small, square tub with two benches on opposing corners. When I sat on one of the benches, the water came to about. . .my belly button. . . and I'm only 5'4"" tall.  

12. The in-room TV checkout is useless, because the bill was not itemized. It combined all of the food and beverage charges as one line.

13. The kiosk for airline flight check-in didn't work.

14. There were erroneous charges for the mini-bar. Some were for items that were already missing when we arrived. Others were for items not missing at all. The desk clerk claims to have removed these charges. We'll see.

  Although we live in Vegas, we chose to wait until the weather got a bit warmer to stay, so that we could just kick back on the terrace, enjoy some wine and chill.  The 20 pictures I loaded in will attest to the overall comfort of the Tower Suite, the amazing views and just a beautiful amibence. Living in town, we can eat, club or whatever at anytime. What we like to do with a room is......check in, go up to the room and have a drink or two and enjoy some personal time. Next is take advantage of the great showers and tubs, get cleaned up and go down to the casino. We both played and won a little, saw a kick-ass rock band in one of the bars and got upstairs at 2:00am. Ordered up room service which is flat out great here both with service and food, ate it on the terrace while loving the view and then start over and sleep. Wake up and get some more room service, it's too good to go out for. Then down to check out, make the long 10 minute drive and we are home. That to us is a perfect sta-cation and the Cosmo moves right up to the top of the list for a return visit.

Just a few shout out's to people, who if you are lucky to meet, will make your stay that much more perfect.....Devon at the front desk, the desk manager, Lana, Karen and Kim in the housekeeping department, Rudy, who brings all that great food up to the room and lastly, Connie, one of the casino hosts who was most helpful and friendly.

- Location - situated about in the middle of the action and next to the Bellagio (try and get a fountain facing room) and part of the whole complex of hotels
- Restaurants - there are quite a few great restaurants on the property. The buffet is definitely among the better options in Vegas; Great burger place, Holsteins, with unbelievable milk shakes (with or without liquor); mexican-asian place, etc.
-Pools - three or four pools with great 'scenery.'  There is also the Marquee Club at one of the pools
-Balconies - not many, if any, hotels in Vegas have balconies.  If you can, get a suite - the balcony wraps around and it is unbelievable!
-Marriott property - so if you're like me and like rewards, get in on it

They didn't clean my room because their policy is not to clean unless I specifically request it. I've never had to request to have my room cleaned. Sometimes I've opted to go green and ask for it to not be cleaned, but never the opposite. I wasn't happy coming back to an unmade room after a long day of conventioneering. This could have been explained at check in but they neglected to mention it. 

The in-room movies didn't work my first night and they didn't offer any thing to make up for it. Not a complimentary drink voucher..nothing. Too bad so sad. I had just flown in to LV and all I wanted was room service, a movie and bed. 

The valet wouldn't bring up my car when I called down ahead of time so my car would be waiting for me-I had to be down there in person before they would get my car. They took so long to get it I should have skipped the stupid valet and just self-parked. 

Room service was a minimum wait of 1 hour each time I called... A pizza delivery would have been faster, I wish I had thought of that at the time. 

The coffee wasn't free! Couldn't believe this hotel would nickel and dime me for the usual free coffee. 

On a positive note, this hotel drew in the young and beautiful crowd of people at the casinos and clubs downstairs. No grubby tourists in their Keen sandals and cargo shorts to roll my eyes at here. Not too many kids either, which I hate seeing kids that have been dragged to Vegas by parents who lack good sense.

Many hotels\/resorts go out of their way to ensure the entrance, lobby, common areas, etc. have that 'wow' factor and the 'C' is no different. The great thing about the 'C' is they carry the wow factor into the guest rooms and throughout the entire property.  The crowd seems young, young, young...and I'm amazed at the lack of clothing worn in many of the common areas (away from the pool).  I could care less if the pool areas were clothing optional, but near the restaurants\/bars\/shopping areas, I don't need to see all that skin and\/or bare feet.  But enough about that.  Simply put: The property is impressive!  ...and my stay was great, but not without a few hiccups. 

Cool technology:
The parking garage has green\/red lights above each stall so you can immediately locate available parking spaces from several rows away. LCD screens throughout the property all responding in unison (whether music videos or simple electronic patterns) -- particularly impressive are the screens at the front desk. Many of the posted menu's and advertisements are actually interactive screens. In the guest rooms, the temp, the lighting, the music, etc. are all programmable through one of the two large, interactive LCD TVs. The technology is very cool!  

The Guest Rooms:
My room was large with a living area (including seating\/TV area, kitchenette and work station--free WiFi), a dressing area, a bedroom (w\/ a second TV) a large bathroom (including a separate tub, shower and toilet closet) and a large deck with an oversized  lounging chair.  I have to say, my favorite thing about the room, is the bathroom. Both the tub and the spacious, walk-in shower have windows with blinds that open to the bedroom. The deep, square tub also has a window that looks out onto the strip (if you're lucky, onto the Bellagio fountain-side - I wasn't lucky and looked out over Aria and City Center with MGM and 'New York' in the distance.  The rooms also smelled great--strange that I would notice that.  My experience in Vegas has been that many of the rooms smell of stale cigarette smoke, which was absolutely NOT the case in the guest rooms...and quite frankly, I didn't notice it throughout the property.  I was on a lower floor, so it was a bit loud...but not bad.  COMFY BEDS!  Maybe that's why I didn't hear much noise.  

The Property:
Overall, very cool!  The pools (3) and casino were good (I'm not big on either one of those things).  I ate at Henry's which was okay and Holsteins, which I thoughts was great!  The Chandelier Bar was also great.  All of them were overpriced...but everything at the 'C' was overpriced.  Although Holsteins did have a $1 beer special for dinner!

The Hiccups:
As others have commented, the housekeeping was not up to par with the rest of the 'C' experience.  My room had a dressing area with a bench in the middle.  The bench had a storage area and in it were clothes from a previous guest.  Strike 1!  I left a message for housekeeping to remove the items and also mentioned it to the front desk as I left for the day.  When I returned that evening, my room had been cleaned, but the clothes were still there.  Strike 2!  I called housekeeping again, who was clearly aware of the issue and said someone would be right there to remove the clothes.  I stepped out for just a moment and when I returned, housekeeping had stopped by and placed the laundry service bag with a note explaining I needed to complete the form to have the clothes laundered.  Strike 3!  I again called housekeeping who said they would send someone to pick up the clothes.  A short time later, an individual arrived and again explained that to remove the clothes I needed to complete the laundry service form.  Strike 4!  After several attempts to explain these were not my clothes and that they were left by a previous guest, he removed them.  The next day, I received a call from security who informed me that some of my clothes were turned into lost and found and they needed me to call to confirm that they were mine.  It wasn't that big of an issue...but housekeeping was the only area that didn't measure up.

After a 4-day stay last weekend, I can see why.  The patio glass rail\/windows are filthy, obscuring your views.  It's shocking how dirty this place has become within the last couple of years.  During peak hours the men's room in the casino is disgusting.  I've been to cleaner bathrooms at dive bars.  It's not being maintained nor managed properly.  Worst of all, every one of the casino staff this visit was unhappy, unfriendly, and sometimes downright rude.  There is nothing fun about gambling with an unhappy casino staff!  Gone are the days of friendly engaging dealers, bosses, and bartenders, and bustling good times.  This is definitely not the upscale and fun place it once was.

The shining light here was the restaurants.  Be sure to check out Blue Ribbon sushi, Jaleo Spanish tapas, Holsteins burgers, and even Secret Pizza (see Yelp tips to find this one!).  Expect to pay through the nose (except the pizza), but overall food quality is world-class at all of these places.  Skip the Mexican\/Chinese place - not bad but definitely not good.

I was told that this property has recently changed ownership.  Either that's the problem, or the solution - only time will tell.  I'd consider possibly staying here again, but there are so many better options now, and I certainly wouldn't play this casino again.  Quite a disappointment.",5,0,0

Prepaid.  I specifically booked and paid more for the king one bedroom terrace because I wanted AT LEAST that.  To our horror, we were informed at check-in that they had oversold the king one bedroom terrace rooms and therefore they had to give us a room with two queen beds.  I couldn't believe my ears.  I showed them my pre-paid reservation and explained that it was our first year anniversary celebration --- we would like to at least sleep in the same bed... and comfortably (my husband is 6'7'').  He apologized but said it was not possible as there were NO rooms with king beds left in the entire hotel.  To make up for the inconvenience, he offered us two free cocktails from the minibar.  I was in disbelief.  First of all, I was being DOWNGRADED two room classes and there was no offer of reimbursement for the forced downgrade.  How does that work?  They tempt you with upgrades for some nominal amount when you check in.... but they don't reimburse you for a forced downgrade and think they can ""make it all better"" with two free cocktails??  I calmly asked to speak to the manager who did nothing more than offer us the reimbursement for the downgrade that they should have offered in the first place.  But then the offer of the free cocktails for the inconvenience was rescinded.  Unbelievable.  The manager said it was common practice for them to downgrade clients when they oversold, prepaid or not.  I really don't understand how rooms can be oversold.  And I don't understand how only downgrades are possible and no upgrades available.  I seriously doubt that there wasn't even ONE king bed left in the entire hotel that night.  Then they said they would TRY to get us into a king one bedroom terrace the next night.  TRY???? I just about lost it at this point.  I was on the verge of tears --- the celebration of our first year of marriage ruined.  After some more pleading, they finally were able to reassure me that they had pre-reserved a king one bedroom terrace for us the next day --- but we would have to check in the morning when we would be able to move.  I spent that first night writing an email to the reservation department of the hotel to let them know how wrong this whole situation was.  The response I got was ""thank you for sharing your experience with us.""  It's mind-boggling to me that they feel they can get away with this type of practice with the economy the way it is.  The service at this hotel was also pathetic.  It took over an hour for us to get our bags delivered to our room.  We were also not given any fresh towels and our minibar was not replenished.  It's like no one at this hotel cares.  Also, their internet is NO LONGER free (policy changed after our booking).  It's now $15 per 24h period.  When we finally got the room that we had booked and prepaid for, it was a nice room.  And the location is fairly central.  However, there are plenty of other nicer hotels with better service. I don't ever need to take or give this place another chance to ruin my holiday.  Would not recommend anyone take a chance with this place as they can ruin your entire trip\/experience. I would give this place zero stars if I could.  Go somewhere where you'll be appreciated.  Just read some of the reviews about the questionable accounting practices so I just emailed them to get a detailed itemized list of charges to the room.  I had a $125 credit and according to them I exceeded it by $130 and would only give me the list of things that weren't covered by the credit.  What if the stuff they used the credit to cover was bullshit??  I'm hoping for a response but somehow I don't think I'll get one.  Will update this review if I do get a decent response to be fair and told them so.  Odds are they won't care enough though.

UPDATE: Hotel will not provide list of charges supposedly ""covered"" by resort credits -- says their system does not allow them to do so???  WHATEVER!!!  This is such a shady business.",4,2,0

Stayed in a terrace room overlooking the bellagio fountains on the north side of the room. Loved having a balcony. The view was awesome. Location is great, on the heart of the strip. We love vegas buffets, and the wicked spoon was probably my favorite so far. 

Really nice place, definitely worth a stay if you want to try out different strip hotels. 

Things keeping it from being a 5:

-The casino and everything on location was too expensive. Blackjack is never under $15, and it's usually $25 (during peak hours and so forth)
-Everywhere was too expensive, e.g. drinks and so forth. But that's the strip for you. This place was somehow... worse though than other places. 
-Room didn't quite get cold enough for my liking. (I see some other complaints about AC) But I do like to be colder than most.
-No mini fridge except for the one full of overpriced drinks. 
-Ice machine on my floor broken the whole time there. 
-The pool on the west side is a lot better IMO. Don't waste your time at the trendy pool that's really shallow and filled with rowdy bros.",1,1,0

It was a hard fall and I was in shock and pain. A security guard approached me and said that he watched me fall and if I was ok and if I needed to go to their medical\/security office. I said that I wanted to get checked and to put ice immediately on my knee and hip. It was an awful experience, I was treated as if I did something wrong.

The hotel took no responsibility for not cleaning the liquid off the floor. There was even a mother and daughter who had witnessed this and filed a report with security. The hotel didn't do anything to ensure that I was ok. I do not recommend anyone stepping foot in The Cosmopolitan if you want to keep safe.

Stayed here 1 night because my friend had a comp'd room, it was a nice suite with a balcony. Nice room, very expensive though for what you get. The check-in process was an absolute nightmare, spent over 30min waiting in line to check-in. Since we arrived earlier than the 3pm check-in time, we were given keys and told that they will txt us when our room was ready. So we decided to get grub and come back. About an hour later, we get a txt that the room is ready, the room number and our keys have been activated. That's nice. So we walk straight to our room and the key doesn't work. We talked to one of the housekeeping ladies and she tells us this happens all the time!!! WHAT? all the time?? That means the system is sh*t! 

So we called the front desk to have they call someone to come up and help us with the keys. 10min later, nothing. So my friend went downstairs to talk to the front desk, once again long line to get any assistance. The front desk did issue new keys, and we were able to get into the room.

Here's my breakdown of everything:

- The hotel itself was gorgeous and very Carrie Bradshaw. The detail in everything was phenomenal, and you can tell that so much time and effort went into the esthetics of the hotel.
- Our room was spacious, the beds were comfy, the shower was a nice size, and I loved how you could control the lights and temperature right from the phone! Some of my co-workers ended up with rooms with balconies, hot tubs, and full kitchens!
- The gym in the west tower was nice. There was a lot of equipment, although I personally was not a fan of the treadmills. It was difficult to move back and forth between speeds and I run intervals, so I wasted a lot of time just trying to move back and forth between my desired speeds. Also, I tried the Spin bike by the boxing ring one day, and the bike itself was really off.
- The pools....the first day, we went to the Bamboo pool. Very nice, plenty of waitresses around for food and drinks. My biggest issue was the positioning of the pool and the sun. Aria was completely blocking the sun by about 4PM at both the Bamboo pool and the Boulevard pool, which we went to later in the week.
- As far as the actual meeting space, the main ballroom was big enough for all of us. The banquet food was actually pretty bad, especially compared to the food in the rest of the hotel. There were plenty of meeting rooms on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th floors, so it was nice that all of our meeting rooms were confined to those three floors, for the most part.
- The location is great! You're right next to the Bellagio and across from Planet Hollywood. Although the hotel itself stretches back, there is an entrance right onto the strip by The Henry restaurant.

The studio terrace with a fountain view is by far one of the best rooms I have stayed at in Vegas and the pit bosses and casino hosts are not shy about giving comped. rooms.

Last time we did a cabana at Bamboo, that was pretty dope and the service was really good.

If you get late night munchies, be sure to hit up the Henry and get the truffle tater tots with whatever you order, they are the shit.

-The sheets were a bit scratchy for somewhere that is so fancy. I mean really, spend a little more for luxury, that's all I'm saying.
-More importantly, and the REAL reason for minus 1 star was the noise. We had a room overlooking the outside part of their Club Marquee. The view was awesome, but OMG the noise! If you are planning to want to SLEEP in your room at night DO NOT GET A ROOM THAT FACES THE CLUB! It was so loud until 4am that I could actually HEAR the DJ pumping up the crowd and yelling ""shot, shot, shot"" into the microphone! Honestly, it was impossible to sleep Saturday night until they shut the place down. I think they need to go back through that side of the hotel and sound proof the sliding glass doors.  Now, if you're not planning to sleep since you're in Vegas, then this probably wouldn't be a problem.

Now the GREAT--

-The rooms were amazing to say the least! Sleek & modern with a large living room\/kitchen area. Walked through a mirrored hallway to the giant, fluffy bed, but the best part? THE BATHROOM! One whole wall was glass so you could see right into the shower from the bed! On the other side a giant sunken tub for 2! Very romantic...not a good room for sharing with anyone other than your significant other FYI. It was honestly the nicest hotel room I've ever stayed in ANYWHERE and I travel a lot! 
-Also had an entire floor dedicated to restaurants. We ate at Holsteins and it was great...really good burgers and shakes, kinda fancy for a burger joint. 
-They also had this huge multi-story bar area called The Chandelier and MAN was it glitzy!!!! It was utterly beautiful! One of the coolest things I've ever seen!
-The place is huge, including the gaming area and probably one of the nicest gaming areas in Vegas. 
-The pool areas looked great from our view and online, but we never made it down there...but I hear good things.


The best part? All of this was FREE for me! I got a letter in the mail saying they wanted to give me 2 free nights, a $100 dining voucher, and $100 in free chips..good until the end of February...I was DOWN! Their marketing worked because now I'm telling everyone it's my new favorite hotel in Vegas and I will DEFINITELY pay the little extra money to stay their next time!

Stayed there twice in the last month and both stays were very nice.  Room price is very reasonable but then they nickle and dime you with charges for the gym ($15\/day), high restaurant charges (brunch is outrageous cost) and high drink costs.  However, it's still a 4.5 stars in my book.  It's a very chic place to be with all the young and glamerous. It is hopping at night as the Marquee Club is the hot spot in Vegas right now. Make sure you get west tower, Bellagio side if you want to be able to sleep at night. Marquee pumps it out, LOUDLY, all night... and I mean ALL NIGHT!

That is not the case at the Cosmo. I just stayed there last week and my experience at the hotel was below my expectations.

If you are using Marriott points to stay here like I did, you may want to think twice because they are charging you PREMIUM number of points for a hotel that needs 100% customer service improvements. 
I would recommend staying at another that offers better customer service, better housekeeping and good night's sleep like the M resort Green Valley or Golden Nugget. This hotel is not Marriott managed property I am accustomed to with high customer service 

The Good
Rooms are spacious and decor is nice. View is awesome from the balcony in west tower terrace suite.
Most of the restaurants are good especially Wicked Spoon, French Reataurant, Blue Ribbon and Scarpetta.  

The Bad
Check in area needs better customer training.  I had to wait over 10 hours for a room because it was not ready, not acceptable.  No offer for drink or room credit--no compensation for the long wait.

The room service is below average.They mixed up my order and gave me someone else's french fries instead of my steak.

Housekeeping service is poor.  My friends room was filthy upon check in and they had to wait 7 hours for another room.   Again Front desk did not offer  a drink or food compensation for their inconvenience 

Marquee nightclub walking area is too crowded. Hotel needs to hire additional security staff to better manage crowd control.

Loud music blaring all night and I was in the West Tower with door closed.  I can imagine how loud it would have been if I had stayed in East Tower.

Order for VIP amenity.   Delivered to wrong room.

Very few customers in the casino playing the slots except at the crap tables. I'm curious as to how much the hotel has made since December grand opening......probably losing  money because hotel cannot succeed without gambling revenue.

This was our first time staying here so we were excited to see how the rooms looked. We initially thought we booked a room with a balcony and little kitchenette but found out that they did not have this room available when we checked in due to us booking through my wife's conference room block. This wasn't a deal breaker but it would've been nice to see it. We did luckily end up getting the view of the bellagio water show. This was a plus as we got to watch the water show from our room everyday. 

The room was nicely decorated. The bathroom shower had a window to the room. There was a curtain that you could pull down to put some privacy as well. It was weird that there wasn't a clock in our room or a radio. Not sure if it was just missing or what. We just had to use our phones to see what time it was.

The casino is decent. The table games get kinda pricey especially at night and on the weekends. I like playing low limit tables but +$25 gets too pricey for me. They had a lot different games to play. Not a bad layout.

The restaurants are on the second floor as well as the wicked spoon buffet and a few shops. They have a nice chandelier bar at the front of the casino next to Las Vegas blvd.

Anyway, The Cosmo is full of cool lounges and bars to hang out at. Other lounges and bars in other hotels just seem to be overlooked and ignored. The Chandelier Bar is probably the most popular one to kick it at. There's another one at the entrance of the strip by Bellagio, but that one turns into a little mini club at night. Obviously Marquee provides residency to some of the biggest names in the EDM culture right now, so you know there's almost ALWAYS someone to see (like Kaskade)!

When the decor is just as breath taking as the hotel itself, and the staff is extremely friendly, you cannot resist to come back again and again!
The check in process with Sue was more than efficient and friendly. She gave us a map of the ginormous layout of the massive hotel and explained where everything is and the best way to navigate. She gives advice on where to eat and even told us about the secret pizza restaurant located on the third floor.

while heading up to the room, I spoke with a few employees all who have been working for the hotel since they opened. They were happy about working there and clearly they are treated right with such little turn over in the hotel. Coming from a hospitality background, this proves to be critical in the service provided. happy staff, happy stay.

The rooms are fantastic. The terrace overlooking the pool is incredible. If you go higher than the 30th floor, you wont get as good of a view of the pool but still amazing.
the east tower has a better view than the other if you want to face the strip.

The spa was incredible. receiving my first massage in months, I couldn't have asked for a better facility.

Wicked Spoon is the buffet and it is a buffet indeed!! I was extremely impressed by the quality of the food and the attention to detail available. Such a great deal for the price!

My new favorite bar is Bond! I wish I chad known about it the first night we were here. I would have loved to spend more time here. Great music, go go dancers and friendly vibe.

a little tip: go to the mezzanine at the chandelier bar (1 1\/2 floor) and order the Verbena.. It is a secret cocktail.
the thing floating on top is the Szechuan Button, also known as a buzz buttons and electric buttons, which is the bud of an Acmella oleracea plant.

I first stayed here a couple years ago, my mom was with me and with her Marriott points we were able to get an upgraded suite. It was beautiful and with the upgrade, we were comped a free meal a day at any of their restaurants. The service was fantastic and we really felt special. Truly VIP service. 

BUT we just stayed here again this past weekend and I have to say the difference is night and day. Maybe because my mom didn't have enough points to upgrade us, we didn't get any special treatment? We got a basic room this time which was fine but there was so much wrong with it. Before even getting to our room, as soon as we stepped out of the elevator, the carpet was horrifically disgusting. It looked like someone changed their oil on the carpet. (Floor 43 if you want to check it out.) Then once we got to the room, we found the sliding door to the bathroom was absolutely stuck. My mom tried pushing it open and in the process strained her shoulder (it bothered her the rest of our trip). The door was stuck halfway open so anybody who wanted to shower had no privacy so we called the front desk and asked that they either switch our room or sent maintenance. We informed them ahead of time that we were in a rush and had to shower and change for our dinner reservations and show so we asked what would be quicker. They said maintenance would be there within 15 minutes. WRONG! 45 minutes later we had no update from the front desk so we called and cancelled. We even informed them that they were ruining our plans and also the fact that my mom had injured herself on their faulty door. All they did was offer a first aid kit. I then had to jump in the shower and make sure nobody walked by the door. Such a hassle! They eventually came later that night to fix the door, no apology or comp whatsoever. 

There were also no perks like free breakfast or even coffee like we had the night before at palazzo. Also, apparently they're revamping all of the ice machine rooms somehow so everybody had to get their ice from the ice machine on the 14th floor. Imagine trekking from the 43rd floor all the way to the 14th when it's usually just a few feet down the hall. And their business center where we had to print our boarding passes and show tickets is run by fed ex so they charge you to be on the internet per minute and charge you also to print per page (with the exception of boarding passes.) Another thing that irritated me was the fact that they had roped off large portions of the lobby\/casino to wax the floors during peak hours on Halloween weekend. Can't they do that early in the morning when the place isn't packed wall to wall with drunks? We used to feel like royalty here, now we're glad we found better service, cleaner facilities, and cheaper rates at the palazzo which is also extremely beautiful. Never again.",4,1,0

When you step into these rooms it feels like you are entering a condo or someone's deluxe apartment. You really do forget you are in a hotel. The two person rooms are just as amazing as a suite somewhere else. Of course you are paying for it as the Cosmo is incredibly expensive but if you have the money to drop and you want to hotel to be as much of an experience as your Vegas trip you owe it to yourself to get a space here at least once in your life. 

Besides being home to the Marquee which is one of the better nightclubs in Vegas which you will get free entry to by being a guest you also have some of the best room amenities. The showers are huge as well as the room sizes. There are two TV's a separate section set up like a living room with couches as well as a bedroom in the main room and one off in its own area. The TV shows personalized messages to you and has connection to almost every kind of audio device you can think of. The rooms have amazing sound systems and food and drink options within the rooms as well. There décor is top notch with a  mix of stone and granite in the room and the color scheme just feels so modern and sleek. 

These are some of the best suites in the city which are all that I have been in in the Cosmo. If you are going to pay that much you might as well go all out. Also you should get a room that has a balcony so you can head outside and night and get one of those classic Vegas profile photos with the whole city and skyline behind you.

So if one escalator malfunctions, everyone must wait for an elevator. Since this happened to us, I can tell you that we became impatient and frustrated.

So we waited, and waited. I've never waited for a room to be ready in Vegas, have always been lucky. Two out of three rooms are finally ready 3 hours later.  At check in we asked to upgrade one of the rooms to a view room and it didn't happen. Went down and were led to the VIP desk and the lady may as well have been a robot. No sympathy whatsoever. No help. She had nothing to offer as to why the upgrade didn't happen, nor was she interested in making it happen.

Disappointment again. Third room is finally ready 5 hours later. I understand the appeal of the room to the younger crowds but I just wasn't wowed. Yes they were nice, but no drawers for your stuff, just shelves. I'm a grown up, I need drawers, not cubbies. The glass shower door was cracked and wouldn't close all the way. The blinds, which are the only barrier that separates you and a private shower from a full on show were completely dusty and dirty and there was still hair on the shower walls.

I won't stay here again, they don't seem to care about the guest as much as other hotels. Or at least, they don't care about the older guests who aren't club bound.",0,0,0

I stayed from May 6-10 and didnt want to leave. YES, I had to wait a hour and a half for my room at 5 o'clock. How did I remedy this? Holstien's while I watched the Bulls playoff game. Never been so full off a turkey burger, it was delicious. Went back downstairs got keys, and went up to my terrace one bedroom. To keep from restating the coolness that is this hotel from other people, i'll give some notes:

Room: way bigger than expected. I was there on a busy weekend, and was STILL offered upgrade due to girlfriends birthday to a room not published online with 360 degree views but no balcony. I stuck  with my room and was NOT dissapointed. People say that you cant share this room because you can see in bathroom. Garbage. I had friends in a penthouse in MGM visit and just closed the shades, and wall perforation, you couldnt see a THING in there. (By the way my friend said he LOVED Cosmo and hated his choice of room. In your FACE bro, told you.)

Hotel: THE place to be. If you want to be in the middle of it all, THIS is where it is. The whole ""earth shaking noise"" people complain about is non-existant in my eyes. I was on 38 floor in east tower too, so it wasnt i was too high, you people are complaining just to do it. Shut yo face. Only saw 1 pool but hell, that was impressive enough. The stores are great in the fact they are unlike the rest of the stores you are tired of seeing on the strip. The whole place feels new everytime you look at it, it was refreshing.

Restaurants: holstiens got my business twice. Delicious, son. If I had to give kudos to just ONE other restaurant i couldnt, because the buffet and the pizza place took my money ALL weekend. The pizza is great for that late night bite, or nuked in the mic for vegas breakfast. The buffet had unlimited mimosas and crab stuffed salmon. Nuff said.

All in all i'd never stay anywhere else. the balcony for breakfast, a drink, and whatEVER else comes to mind when you have a strip view balcony and a sig other (ahem) cant be beat. Ignore the hate, see for yourself. And if your friends book somewhere else, well the will hate you, but whats vacation without the jealousy stories??",1,0,0

Vegas is pretty dead during weeknights in mid-December (hence much cheaper), so I figured on my most recent business trip that this was a great opportunity to finally stay at The Cosmo and not feel too guilty about tacking it onto my expense report. Nevertheless, my cab driver told me she still thought the cost for 1 night was way too much.  Ironic, the only thing that's more of a ripoff in Vegas than a hotel stay is a cab ride.

LIKES
-huge room, if I would've known in advance I would've invited guests or planned a party
-it's almost like a fully furnished apartment, but way fancier of course
-beds were very comfy
-after leaving your room you can get off on the 2nd or 3rd floor elevator to bypass walking through the casino (since I'm not a fan of casinos, this matters to me)
-I don't mind the long walk, I enjoy seeing all the artwork and large heels on display

DISLIKES
-if you leave the sliding closet door open, it blocks entry\/exit into your bathroom. Weird
-the charge for WiFi
-the maid barging in on me when it took longer than 10 seconds to answer her knock (like I said, it's a large room so it took awhile to get from one side to another)

Perhaps my cab driver was right, I don't know if I would've footed the bill had it been my own money.  If I split the room with someone else I probably would, but since I spent little time in the room it was just good to finally stay here and be in the same building as most of the places I visit.",5,6,7

The best part is the the large bathroom and the Terrace with a decent view of the Vegas skyline. Unfortunately, there were a few mishaps.  The water pressure in the shower was not strong enough. Another issue was that one of the sink stoppers in the bathroom malfunctioned. The last big issue was the noise coming from the refrigerator compressor that was super irritating. I called guest relations but they never took care of it. Since this is a Ritz- Carlton affiliated hotel I didn't expect to have these issues during my stay.

We had a standard room, but nothing was standard about it. It was tastefully decorated and modern. We had nothing to complain about the entire stay. The staff was friendly and the room was always clean after house keeping stopped by. 

Unfortunately we didn't get to try the buffet, but we had no problems finding places to eat inside the hotel. Next time we'll try the buffet and the spa.

The Cosmo was a short walk to the clubs and restaurants on the strip that we wanted to go to.

The bathroom is sectioned off into three parts, the vanity area, the bath and shower, and the shitter, which is awesome for couples. The only weird thing was the bathtub, it's a deep tub and you can submerse yourself neck deep if you're short like me :P. However, it's box shaped and only allows for you to sit upright instead of laying back like other tubs. 

Downstairs area is always alive and full of people, not to mention how beautifully decorated it is. They have chandeliers and crystals all hanging from the ceiling which gives this place a fancier feeling lol. There's plenty of restaurants of which we tried The Henry, Wicked Spoon (highly recommended), Holsteins, and Secret Pizza. Honestly they were really great places and are all worth visiting.

We really didn't need to go far.   We loved Secret Pizza, Chandelier bar, Rose Rabbit lie, all the shopping, and Holstein burgers.

After 6 PM we were finally notified our keys were activated and we could go to our room, only to find the keys didn't work. We trudged back to the front desk, where we were told to wait in yet another line for someone to help us. Made no difference that we were in an expensive suite.

Also, the pool areas are highly over-rated. Much smaller than the pool areas of nearby resorts, with few shaded areas and little foliage.

The room itself had a musky smell and a definite odor of vomit. We immediately called the front desk and they were able to change rooms, resolving the situation quickly and efficiently.

The room was nicely laid out and very upscale with nice amenities. I was blown away by the assistance by jesse harris in concierge. He went out of his way to assist me in my marriage proposal by having things delivered to my room. I am so grateful for his help and he made the evening perfect! 

As for the casino itself, it is among the nicest on the strip. The casino is decorated beautifully, especially the chandelier and crystals at the entrance from the strip. They have excellent selection of bars (the one near check-in has excellent craft cocktails), restaurants, shops and gaming. As part of city center plaza there are even more options in all areas.

So I read a whole bunch of reviews prior to choosing Cosmo and I also took into consideration my love for the decor when I visited the place last year (Casino only).  I figured that staying at the new resort in town would be a good idea.  I read about 100 reviews or so on Yelp and decided that the good outweighed the bad.  I also noticed that many of the complaints had to do with the music being so loud they couldn't sleep.

So on to the review:

I booked a 2 queen terrace view room for myself, girlfriend and her best friend and when we got there they were very friendly and accommodating and even upgraded us to a strip view version of the room which faces the Bellagio fountains.  We are now very excited and head up to the room.  1 King bed.  So while I know Vegas is a place where crazy stuff happens, I doubt a threesome with my girlfriend and her best friend is happening.  The view was GORGEOUS....fountain show every 20 minutes or so that we were able to overlook.  I called downstairs to let them know of their error and they apologize however they do not have any double Queen rooms available unless they downgrade us into a non terrace room.  Naturally I throw a fit with them on the phone and they say that they will correct the mistake and clean a room ASAP.  They ask we give them 3 hours so since it was about 7pm, we decide to go eat dinner while that happens.  11:30 comes around, and no call.   I decide to be proactive and reach out and they have no idea what I'm talking about when I call.  No one has been working on the issue.  The lady I speak with on the phone this time helps me out but says the only room they have available doesn't have the view.  So while its the room we originally booked, its still a downgrade.

We get back to the hotel and go to get our luggage from the old room to find out the keys have been changed since they changed our room and have to go all the way back downstairs (a process) and wait in check in line again to get it fixed.  It is now 1am and we are all very tired since we worked this day and dealt with all of these issues and just want to get to bed.  We get to the room and everything is fine.....other than stains on the comforter (looks like old sweat? or makeup?) and rug that is torn up in certain areas.  We are too weak and tired to complain.

People who complain about the noise will be glad to know that its been fixed, not a single chord can be heard in the rooms anymore and we found out why.  Supposedly Marquee listens to complaints because when we went to the Marquee club the next night, it was quiet...and we asked why and they said because after midnight they turn everything down to not disturb the guests.


Pool was a joke, its tiny.  Good luck getting seats unless you are the first one there or buy a cabana.  We had friends staying at MGM and joined them at their pool for most of the trip.

No poker at the casino.  6-5 blackjack and x3 odds craps.  So its not even a good place to gamble at.  Unfortunately since I was staying there, I still gambled there so I suppose that is what they are counting on.

I'm getting tired of typing as I am sure you are getting tired of reading.  I'd rather go start a review for the good experiences in Vegas.

My opinion? Do not stay here.  There are FAR better options for the money.  Go try Venetian\/Palazzo, Wynn\/Encore, or even Mandalay Bay.",1,1,0

We checked in about 6pm and surprisingly the line was not that long. When we got to our room was when the problems began. The rooms here (along with the hotel) are very nicely decorated. But upon further inspection we found hair in the tub of the 1st room. Quite a few pieces actually. We immediately called the front desk and told them of our issue and they said we could relocate to another room. Upon going to the floor of the next room, the hallway had a horrible order (the smell of garbage), I was praying the room did no smell the same. We entered the second room which looked the same, and upon inspection found hair in this tub (a lot more this time) and large pieces of food in the purple couch. We weren't to happy by this time. My husband called down stairs immediately and asked what was going on and explained this room was not cleaned and even in a worse condition. My husband explained that this was not a good experience (esp. us being Marriot members), and that having his pregnant wife relocate for a third time was not cool. The front desk explained they were sorry and said they would send someone up to clean the room and offer a one time credit. When the cleaning lady entered the room she was very sweet and apologized for the unclean room. She began to clean the tubs but I assume the front desk did not communicate that I was pregnant and the cleaning fumes became to much. Again, I am not putting this on the cleaning lady she was just doing her job-- but she clearly was not informed of the situation. She apologized over and over again, and we told her it was not her fault. The cleaning lady was also waiting for someone else to bring her a vacuum and something to clean the couch due the major amount of crumbs. We had to call downstairs again and inform them we could no longer stay in the room due to fumes. The said they would have to call us back. Call us back what?? We waited for a long period of time and the cleaning lady even had to notify them that we were waiting on them to call us back. The smell was so strong by this point I had to place a chair in the hall way. By the time they called us back he asked us what tower we would like to move to-- we said we wanted to stay in the same tower. When my husband got the room number of our new room the cleaning lady informed us that was in the next tower over, after we clearly stated we wanted to stay in our current tower. No one was sent us to help us with our bags and no other offer was given for our inconvenience. We tried to call back but no one would answer. On our way to the next tower we stopped by the front desk check in (which was now full of people trying to check in). I finally found a manager to speak with about the situation and she completely did not listen to our story. She said we would have the same view and same type of room. I explained to her that was not the point and this was horrible customer service. She said she was very sorry, and she would call to check on us in a few and see if there was anything else she could do. When we finally got to the third room, it seemed very musty! We were just over it by then and decided to go eat. When the manager did call back all she said was how is the room, and we informed her the same. She only said, ""Ok great! have a great stay"". And hung up. The Cosmo is nicely decorated but due to the cleanliness and horrible front desk and upper management service, we will not be back.",3,1,1

Beautiful interior and rooms as well - I had a large room on the 61st floor, with a sitting area, balcony, huge bathroom with jacuzzi tub, two TVs, fridge, sink, microwave, the works. The meeting facilities are also top notch as far as I could tell. Location is convenient as well, as you're basically right in the middle of everything. Final result is an awesome awesome hotel that I would stay at again, hands down, no questions asked!

Some slightly negative things to mention as well though, brace yourselves -

There was some noise from the club at night. I'm as much a of fan of bumping bass as the next guy, but it was a little loud until about 3am (and I was on the 61st floor and still hearing it!). I know some other Yelpers mentioned that as well, but it really didn't bother me that much. I put a fan on and went to sleep - come on, it's Vegas! 

My jacuzzi in my room was weird. Maybe I don't know how to use jacuzzis well, but mine would turn on in the middle of the night by itself. It sounded like a vacuum cleaner kicking on, and woke me up in the middle of the night two nights in a row. Not a huge deal - jumped out of bed, turned it off, went back to sleep. Maybe my room was haunted? Or odds are I just screwed up and put it on a timer or something. Who knows?

My room was starting to show a little bit of wear and tear - carpet becoming a little worn, edges of the tables and desk getting a little nicked up. Just me being nitpicky though. It was still a beautiful room.

My fiancé and I fell in love there, so we like to take trips from LA to Vegas probably about , on average three times a year. We like to stay in a different place each time because all it makes us feel like we are experiencing Vegas for the first time. We had never stayed at the Cosmopolitan, but we always gamble there. It is such an amazing place to stay. If you follow my Yelp reviews, you know that I very rarely dish out five-star reviews, but the Cosmopolitan has earned every star and more. From the moment you step foot in the Cosmopolitan, you can see how much effort has been put into the detail of the overall modern & chic resort. The branding and advertisement is everything. It is SoHo meets Las Vegas, city-chic, smart and stylish vacation property. Anyone who watches an ad will want to stay there. Bravo to their marketing team. It is in a great location on the strip, I would say pretty much the middle of everything so when you walk out you may either take a left or a right and be able to walk without taking a car. Our check-in process was disappointing because when we got there, they were having an issue magnetizing their keys so we went up to our room, our keys didn't work and we had to go back down. When we went back down, they redid our keys and said this may not work either. ""We're having a tough day here at the Cosmopolitan."" Wasn't exactly what we wanted to hear. Either way, our keys did end up working and it was one of the nicest places I've stayed in Las Vegas. Next to the Wynn. We got a Terrace suite with a balcony view. We got to look down on all three of the pool properties from our room. You can definitely hear the music from 10 AM to 7 PM, but who sleeps in Vegas anyway anyways? We had a great bathroom, with a separate toilet, shower, bathtub, and vanity area. A big closet, kitchen, beautiful balcony view, and a living room and desk area. What more could you want? It was like we were in our own swanky studio apartment. There is a video attached to this review that gives you a mini tour. They had Bigelow bathroom products, which my fiancé and I both love. The spa looked beautiful, I was thinking about doing a day pass - but for $55 it's seemed pretty steep for what little they really had. I believe it's $45 on the weekdays. I'm sure the services are amazing, but they were very expensive. As you would expect at any spa at a resort in Las Vegas. The fitness center was amazing. I did a walk-through but didn't get to work out. Definitely bring your workout clothes because they have a great set up there. We were in the Boulevard tower on the 32nd floor. There's also another Tower as to not get confused. The dining experiences are awesome. There is so much to choose from. Those will all be in separate reviews as well. I had a blast at the pool. We didn't go to the Marquee, but the main pool in the Boulevard tower was amazing. Best drink menu I've seen in a long time. We had such a blast, there. They have incredible seats that are located inside the pool. There will be many photos to be shown there, as well. I definitely recommend going there. Get the ""lovely bunch of coconuts"" drink  but ask for an extra shot of coconut rum because otherwise it will taste too much like pineapple. The gambling is fun. It is a great environment. The bars are all very chic. To be able to experience the entire cosmopolitan would take you a while. But I would start with the weekend and grow from there. Enjoy! You will not be disappointed.",1,0,1

Self parking is located off a tiny driveway off Las Vegas Blvd.  Blink and you'll miss it.  The check in desk is located in the WEST tower, and should be labeled as such in the garage.  It is a long walk.  Check in was smooth.  My attendant, Abby, was helpful and sweet.  We were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite with a view.  She walked me to bell service and Daemion loaded up our stuff and took us to the room.

The hotel has a very upscale, modern feel.  Lots of chrome, and highly polished wood.  The Chandelier Bar is a great place to sit and watch the action unfold.  The crowd seemed to be mostly people int he 25-32 range.  And at night, everyone looked good.  The Casino weaves throughout the 1st floor, with the occasional bar in between.  I did not gamble, so I can review the casino, other than to say the people in there were young and good looking.

We were in the East Tower, which is closest to LV Blvd.  The room was well designed and beautifully appointed, if you like contemporary design.  It has a very modern look, and if you don't like that, you won't like this hotel.  I loved it.  There was a separate living room with a curved sofa, over-sized coffee table and chair.  The kitchenette was small, but had a microwave and dishwasher (to wash what?  There were no dishes), along with the Sub-Zero refrigerator\/mini bar.  NOTE: that space at the bottom on the mini-bar is a FREEZER!  it's not a space for you to put your beer.  As we discovered the next morning.

The bedroom had an incredible view of the strip and overlooked the Bellagio fountain.  There was a dressing area that separated the bedroom and living space.  The bathroom was huge, with double sinks, a separate toilet room and a Shower\/bath room with windows opening into the Master and the deck.  The tub was big enough for two, easy.

The hotel is located next door to Bellagio, across from Paris and Planet Hollywood.  It was easy to get to several hotels on the strip for dining, shopping etc.

It's like whatever was on sale at some discount hotel supply store was thrown together into a very crowded hodge-podge of ""design"" and ""art.""  Brand it as edgy and ""wrong,"" and you've got an identity that needs to deliver.

Just touch the 3 story chandelier and you'll quickly realize it's all cheap plastic.  That says it all.  If you're looking for an edgier version of The Palms, you'll enjoy the show.

As the newest addition on the Vegas strip, I think The Cosmo is making it's mark.  Though there are somethings that are keeping it from getting 5 stars, I think this may change after some time and getting some logiistical kinks worked out.

Here are some of the things I loved about The Cosmo:

1.  Wraparound Terrace Suite:  Amazing views of the strip on your own private terrace.  Moderm kitchenette with sub-zerio freezer and in-room washer\/dryer made it like home.  Perfect for long stays, and warming up left overs from the restaurants.  Although the decor tried to seem ""modern"" I found the actual living space to be plain and small.  TVs were not working properly.  The entrance to the bath area had no privacy doors.  This room may be a no-no if you're sharing this room with friends in which you demand privacy while you're showing.

2.  The Wicked Spoon buffet was AWESOME.  See my review for more details.

3.  Though they boast a 100,000 sq ft. casino, it seems much smaller.  Everything kinda seemed cramped, not a lot of table denomination selections.  You're basically stuck with $50 minimums on BJ and $25 on Rouleete.  But the friendliness of the dealers and pit crew makes up for it.  They are trying to be a ritzy joint, but the personel don't act stuck up like they do at Wynn, Encore, Bellagio.  Big plus for the friendliness. 

4.  Marquee was a popping club.  It seemed like all the hipsters were out to play.  For some reason, this place filtered out all the hoodlums. hahaha.

5.  The Comso has easy access to the Las Vegas Blvd.  At other resorts, you would have to walk miles and miles just to get some freshair.  

6.  Many restaurants to choose from.  But I think they need to have a more consistent tasting Chinese restuarant.  China Poblano was horrible.

All and all.  Really great place to stay and play.  I was only here for 2 days and have not been able to check out everything they had to offer.  But so far...so good.",3,2,2

The only downside is, in the last few weeks I have noticed that as the night goes on, the place isn't being kept clean, go to the mens room and it looks like a bomb has gone off, nobody cleaning it, nobody emptying the trash cans.

The vibe for this hotel is definitely sexy and sophisticated - I didn't see as many families here as the other hotels and it's new enough so the smoke from the smokers in the casino weren't saturated in the carpet and furniture.

It's close enough to the Bellagio, Aria and Caesars if  you want to do some high end shopping.

Our room had a view of the Bellagio fountains and it was so nice to sit on the balcony with a glass of wine and enjoy the show.

Their cabanas and infinity jacuzzis were amazing. The gym was the nicest gym I've ever been to, and I've been to my share of gyms - it was clean and organized with the best equipment.

The Vesper bar with its crafted cocktails served us some of the best cocktails we've ever had! The Chandelier Bar is pretty to look at, but the drinks can be pedestrian so head over to the Vesper.

Of course with the sexy atmosphere they hire hot people and they were definitely trained well in customer service - not a frown in sight and super friendly and helpful.

The Cosmopolitan deserves its accolades and awards for its service and attention to detail. A definite place to stay when in Vegas.",6,1,1

With everyone in our group the wrong side of 30, which is like 80 in Cosmopolitan years, we worried about spending a weekend among thousands of hormonal himbos and bimbos cramping our relatively elderly style!  But I am beyond thrilled to report that almost every fear was laid to rest.  Here's why: 

Customer service was outstanding - the room was ready when they said it would be - roll-away bed was provided at no charge- extra towels and supplies were provided on time and with no issues, check out took mere seconds - everything was just so shockingly effortless I never wanted to leave!   I've been to Vegas many maaaany times, much to my bank account's despair, and have literally NEVER experienced such an easy check-in\/out process.  It was absolutely fantastic.  

The room cost a pretty penny but it was super luxurious and clean and with the bill split between the group, not too outrageous.  There was a huge balcony, incredible views, two bathrooms and a full kitchen, on top of all the standard features. 

Their buffet food (yes I like buffets, whatever!) was surprisingly good quality - not inexpensive but I highly recommend the brunch -it's wildly popular and the lines can be crazy but totally worth it; if you go early enough there is very little wait in fact. 

The Bamboo pool seemed a little tame for our taste, but the Boulevard pool was awesome - we got a day bed for $1,000 which included unlimited food and drinks.  Again, split 5-ways this ended up being great value for money - we spent the entire day lounging by the pool, eating and drinking as if we had been subjected to months of starvation.   

The Marquee day\/night club was magical - truly, if you somehow manage to get your name on the list and so avoid waiting in line, it is well worth a visit - loved the music, loved the setup, loved the whole experience.   Of course it gets very crowded and drinks are expensive but that's just Vegas for you.

The one disappointing feature here is the casino section.  After all the great work and effort on the interior design, on the food, on the rooms, the pools, the clubs and every other feature of this amazing hotel, the casino seems pretty shabby in comparison.  It has this inescapable ghetto vibe which completely contradicts the rest of the place - claustrophobic and uninviting it is easily the most inferior part of the whole thing - which is a great pity because I actually enjoy spending an hour or so flushing my money down the slot machines once in a while.  

The cosmopolitan is party central for sure and as such not a destination for pure relaxation, but it's a super fun, hip and trendy venue, still successfully hanging on to its cool factor and managing to enthrall and engage in ways that was really unexpected for me.

Thanks to the sweet gentleman at the front desk of course. Oh and there are NO RESORT FEES!

Room 
As others have mentioned, I would like to reiterate that yes, the rooms are smaller than the Venetian\/Palazzo but it's still very nice.  However, the magnificent view outweighs having a larger room.  Trust me.  Imagine relaxing outside on the terrace at night (which you don't get at most Vegas hotels) sipping on a glass of wine or cocktail, and watching the amazing Bellagio light show, while the serenity of the music is playing. All in the company of your significant other or whomever is right next to you.  Can't beat that.  Heck, I felt bad not being in the room more to enjoy the view more. So guys, I definitely recommend getting a room here to woo a girl. Make sure you get a room with a terrace facing the Bellagio fountains on the higher floors. 

The room also had a little kitchenette with a microwave.  The only thing I didn't like is the window that connects the bathroom to the bedroom.  It gets a tad annoying when you're trying to sleep and someone has to get up to go to the bathroom because you can hear everything! (Not them using the toilet, thank goodness.) The bed is also super comfy! A+++

Hotel and Casino
The hotel and casino itself is absolutely beautiful. From the chandelier, to the modern and chic decor. I really loved the smell of the hotel when it first opened. There are a lot of young people. Good place to people watch especially at night after all the drunks get out of the club.

Places to Eat
There are plenty of restaurants to choose from. Check out the Wicked Spoon Buffet. 

Partying
 For those of you party goers and clubbers, another great thing about staying at this hotel is that Marquee is located in the hotel. You don't have to worry about cabbing (which is a big hassle, especially for you ladies after walking all evening in 6 inch stilettos).  I also really love the rooftop pool area at night. They have an area for you to lounge around, watch sport games or play pool or foosball.  

I love the Venetian\/Palazzo, but I think next time I'm in Vegas again, I will probably make my reservations here.",7,3,4

Truthfully, I have mixed feelings with Cosmopolitan. Definitely take some time and look at the many pictures uploaded here on Yelp...or even go on YouTube to see what your room\/suite will look like ahead of time. 

I enjoyed my staycation because the rooms were meticulous and clean, location was literally perfect; you're at the center of The Strip...and everything was completely walkable. 
But at the same time...I wasn't too fond of the clientele here. Granted, maybe Labor Day weekend brought out all the douchebags but they're either perverts, lacking in some major common sense, or just straight up obnoxious. I'm over here thinking I can still pass for a 23 year old....I'm still young...I'm hip...but no....this crowd literally made me say to myself, ""I'm too old for this shit"" multiple times throughout the weekend.

The rooms are beautiful and modern. We stayed in a City Terrace Suite overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Great view! We were in the West tower. The added balcony touch made some great memories ;) but I wonder how safe can this really be? Housekeeping seems to be very personable here. Every time my boyfriend and I walked through our hallway, any member of their housekeeping dept greeted us by our last name. (How did they know that on top of their heads, by the way? Was it because of our VIP check in? IDK...either way...it was a nice touch.) Pillows, bedsheets, towels, counter tops, showers, toilet....everything looked really clean. 

We visit the two pools (Boulevard and Bamboo) every day. Separate reviews on those later. We definitely did NOT check out Marquee Dayclub. I saw enough obnoxious douchebags in the casino already. We ate lunch one day at the pool and Secret pizza. We had dinner one night at Milos; a greek seafood restaurant. Definitely not my cup of tea but boyfriend wanted to eat there. $$$$$$$

One minor mishap: VIP set us up for a late check out but by 2pm....we weren't able to get back in our room. Apparently, some genius decide to check us out already even though there was a note of a late check out for our reservation. We couldn't even watch TV anymore because of that generic ""Thank you for staying with us. You have successfully checked out....."" etc etc on our screen. 

But overall, it was still a solid staycation. Ever since they opened 5 years ago...I've always wanted to check out their rooms. Would I stay here again? Ehhh....maybe....not? Pools were a bit small and I'm not too fond of the clientele. I much prefer the Bellagio\/Wynn crowd.",14,6,4

It has all the coolest restaurants, awesome decor and a great location.  The real reason I'm giving it 5 stars, though, is the fact that my room had a balcony.

I spend at least 2 months of my year in Vegas for work.  Usually, I'm confined to meeting rooms with no windows all day before I retire to my room only to gaze out of my tinted window at a beautiful view of a rooftop.  It's not the view that bothers me, it's that I can go days without breathing fresh air.

This time around, I was only at the Cosmo for 3 days.  Unlike usual, though, I wish I could have stayed longer.  My room was beautiful, comfortable, and that balcony made me feel human after a long day's work.  I swear, I probably spent most of my time just sitting out there.

I realize that most people will go for vacation, but if you go for work, here are some other 5-star features.  

*  The staff was truly a pleasure to work with (something you don't find every day in Vegas)
*  You don't have to trek through a smoky casino to make it to the meeting rooms.
*  The layout of the hotel is easy to navigate and set up so that you don't have to walk for miles to get where you're going.

I really enjoyed my time there and I can only hope I spend a lot more of my two months in Vegas staying on that balcony...I mean, room.

I couldn't have imagined a better place to stay for a Bachelorette weekend with the girls, except of course, cheaper room service, holy pricey. Vegas, am I right? Just the drive up to the hotel is swanky as heck with the huge 'COSMOPOLITAN' signage displayed in giant lettering, you feel very glam upon entering. However, once you enter even more glam. The hotel was beautiful, the coolest interior, so much to look at. The elevators lead you to different areas of the hotel, some only go to certain floors so keep your eyes open for that. So many bars, so many restaurants, so many tables and slot machines, I could spend a week in this hotel alone, not leave and have an amazing time. They have Eggslut, Starbucks, Momufoku, a juice bar, little convenience shops, gift shops, Overlook Cafe by the pool, which is sensational. The pool is absolutely amazing. Multiple outdoor bars, no swim up bar though, which would have been clutch. They do have people constantly walking around the pool area to take your drink order, which is awesome. They have shuffle board, pool tables, so many activities so little time. The view from the pool deck is just stupid cool, you can see everything. The Chandelier bar is very cool and they have the biggest chandelier on earth, possibly not a true statement, but it also may be true. Near Starbucks they have this cool lounge area with loads of television screens. I'm telling you, stay here a week and you don't need to go anywhere else.

Our rooms were nice, beds comfortable, nice large bathrooms with a door that separated the toilet from the rest of the bathroom so that was nice. Hilarious bathroom feature, you can pull up the blinds in the bedroom and see right into the shower, it gave us a good laugh when we first got there. We had two conjoined rooms for 10 girls, we fit just fine. The rooms had television with Netflix, bedside tables and a little bar desk area with lots of goodies and drinks. Make sure you don't touch the drinks or goodies unless you want to pay for them because apparently they operate on sensors and even if you touch one, you get charged. The fridge in the room was unfortunately not accessible to us because they were fully stocked with purchasable items as well and there was no room for any of our stuff. We had to put all of our drinks on ice in the room, slightly inconvenient. Room service was so expensive. One night I ordered a pizza and chips with salsa, boom $60. VEGAS, gotta love it. Our view from the hotel room was absolutely incredible, gorgeous view of the Strip, I mean really could not have been more beautiful. Back to room service, the people who answered the phone and took our orders were the nicest people alive, seriously wonderful. The food was not bad, we ordered breakfast one morning and my omelette was delicious! I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone who comes to Vegas. It was my first time here, so I can't speak for other hotels, but I would absolutely stay here again. Everything was perfect except the last night I was here I was playing slots and someone swiped my shopping bag that was right next to me.

We asked for handycap accessible and the only amenities for handycaps we grab bars by the toilet and a shower seat, we had to go to Walmart and buy a toilet  riser so my wife could get off the toilet  which we donated to the hotel so the next person to use the room will be able to use it if they need it.
  The room was too crowded with furniture to negotiate  a wheelchair. The beds were very uncomfortable  and the pillows were too soft, you had to use 3 of them to get close to comfortable.
 The room also smelled of cigarette smoke the whole time we were there from the rooms around us. I can't believe their non smoking room is surrounded by smoking rooms.
 The staff was friendly when we checked in and the valet staff kept our car close so we didn't have to wait long. I have nothing bad to say about the people we dealt with that work for the hotel.

My personal favorite is the wrap-around suite. Came here for my girlfriend's birthday and it is extremely delightful. Very nice renovations and architecture with lots of space! Heavenly bed, and multiple TVs. Also has its own little bar with alcohol, food and etc which you have to pay for. If you don't plan on expending any of the provided condiments, then don't use them. They are tracked by some laser and repeatedly taking off any of drinks or foods will charge you, and yes they are expensive. On the other hand, they have a fridge for your own food and drinks! 

They also have a great and HUGE balcony that can possibly oversee the whole Strip. Definitely some romance involved in that. 

Not only do you get to access one of the best rooms but you also get complimentary access to the best club on the strip, Marquee! Just show your hotel key and you are given admission. And trust me, if you're a guy, you want to take advantage of this. Marquee normally charges each male anywhere from $50 - $80. But for your stay, you get to experience a rapidly rising club at no charge!

Not only is this a good honeymoon spot(or something in that matter), but a good spot to hold a party with your friends. This wrap-around suite itself can house a party with an occupancy limit of up to 40 people! The balcony truly does wonders in providing spaciousness and air! Just don't stay out too long cause in higher altitudes, there are mosquitos. I stayed out in the balcony so long that a mosquito bit me on my forehead, leaving me a lump on my forehead. 

Lots of restaurants and shops in the 3 story lobby as well. Personally did not like the Wicked Spoon buffet as it is overrated IMO but it's only a few steps away. Don't waste your time and money staying at a lower-tier hotel where it may be difficult to experience the city that never sleeps, for the Cosmpolitan will grant you ease during your visits.",1,0,0

- My hotel room had a balcony overlooking the strip, which was above the Boulevard Pool.  So free balcony seats during the Kid Cudi concert on Friday night.  Bonus!
- The elevators require a room key to be usable, which kept the ratchets away
- The pool was also only accessible by presenting your room key.  Guest only pool = see above
- The parking garage is state of the art, which had red and green lights above each parking spot to let ya know that there was a space available
- Secret Pizza was just downstairs and was open til 5 am.  Who doesn't love a good slice of pizza after a shenanigan-filled evening?

CONS:
- There were a lot of obnoxious groups roaming the casino floor on Saturday night, which was a minor inconvenience at most

My friends and I got in Friday night to the Cosmopolitan.  We were pretty excited because the Cosmo is a fancy hotel and we had heard their night club was fun.
We went to Marquee for a couple hours and then decided to go gamble.  I left my friends so I could go use the restroom.  Well you know how you can easily get turned around in a casino.  I was wondering around by myself for a hot minute trying to find my friends.  A security agent approached me asking to see my ID.  Not a problem at all.  I gave it to him and made a joke about how he made my night because I'm 30.  He completely ignores me and starts saying my name into his radio.  Thinking that he'd only wanted to see my ID to verify age, I asked him what was going on.  He held up his hand and shushed me.  Well I'm sorry but I'm a grown women staying at your hotel and you've taken my ID and aren't giving me any details.  This has now upset me.  I ask him again what's going on and he continues to talk into his radio.  I tell him I want my id back and he tells me I need to calm down.   Still not explaining to me what's going on.  I told him I was staying at hotel and he asked my room number.  I left one number off on accident and he tells me I'm lying bc that's not even a room there.  He then tells me I have to leave.  He walks my outside and tells me to leave.  Well at this point I'm a little frantic because my friends are inside and I'm being kicked out of the hotel FOR NO REASON!!!!  I come straight back inside and so they call metro police on me.  A gang unit.  Yes a single female staying at Cosmo with some friends had a gang unit called on her FOR NO REASON!  I'm being argued with and held and still no one is telling me what I have done wrong.  Finally the shift manager from security comes and pulls me aside and speaks to me in much more respectful manor.  He explains it's protocol to stop people that might be part of ""suspicious activity"".  Yes, that's right I was being confused for an escort.  I paid for an expensive room at The Cosmopolitan only to be held for 15 minutes because I could possibly be taking part in suspicious activity as I walk around lost looking for my friends.  Well needless to say I am beyond upset at this point.  They finally check to see that my name is in their system as being a guest.  Couldn't they have done that within first 5 minutes and avoided all this?  Avoided offending and embarrassing me in front  people in the casino watching the whole debacle take place!  I get to leave finally and return to my friends.  The next day we go straight to the security office to file a complaint.  We thought for sure the Cosmopolitan would be very apologetic and quite frankly embarrassed that their security treated a guest this way.  Not at all!  I barely got an apology.  I was informed I can email risk management and that could take up to two weeks to hear back.  We then decided to go to guest services.  Surely someone on their staff is going to want to rectify this situation.  Surely The Cosmopolitan isn't ok with treating guest this way.  Haha wow was I wrong.  The senior manager at guest services was condescending and rude.  He implied that it was my fault.  Saying that ""metro police had a negative experience with me.""  Ya think?  You held me without reason for 15 minutes in the assumption I was an escort!  Most people would be livid!  I spoke with 4 different departments at the Cosmopolitan and no one was helpful.   It seems this is standard for them.  Unless you want to risk being harassed by security, I would stay far far away from The Cosmopolitan.  There are plenty of wonderful hotels on the strip that treat their guest with respect.  
My friends and I will not be returning!",16,3,2

We got a 1-bedroom with premium view (hoping to ensure a view of the Bellagio fountains). The room was incredible. Everything looked as it did on the website, but looked even better in person. Utterly enjoyed every moment in this room. Best part was watching the Bellagio fountains... from my 3' tall bathtub.

Great amenity was the TV system from which you could control any light in your suite, turn the temperature up or down, etc. You could even create & save ""atmospheres"" for instant party\/romance atmospheresupon your return.

Tips on coffee situation: they have their own brand of coffee makers & trying to bring the right size pod is a gamble. With a pot of coffee from room service @ $18  plus tax, tip, & delivery charge (& the in-room ""kit"" at $7), that was never gonna work--a week's worth of coffee would have been more than my plane ticket. We brought Via from Starbucks since they DO have a microwave & mugs.

No really, that's a thing at the Cosmopolitan. Just gives the room that extra little bit of creepiness if you were for some reason craving it! 

In all seriousness, though, it is a kinda cool feature of the room if you and your S.O. are into that kind of thing!

But, in case you were interested in staying at the hotel for any reason besides the shower, there are plenty of them! The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas as, as many know, the newest hotel on the strip, and you can really tell when you're in there. From the moment you enter the lobby, you're greeted by giant LCD screen pillars, which have all sorts of different artsy displays on them at any given time. When I went, it happened to be right on the cusp of Christmas, so I got to see a lovely, snowy little village. Of course, just minutes later, they displayed some very pretty autumn leaves falling down. 

The Cosmopolitan is also an extremely clean and sleek looking hotel, from top to bottom. Dimly lit in most areas, you almost feel like you're walking through a night club the whole way through. In the best way, of course! 

The selection of restaurants at Cosmo is also extremely good. Having stayed there ~3 days, we only got to hit a fraction of the places that they had to eat. Not to mention that all of the places in there felt very upscale (it is Vegas, after all). I also have to say that there was not one thing I ate in their restaurants that I didn't absolutely love.

Similarly, the bars that Cosmo has to offer are also extremely nice. Although I didn't get to have a drink there, Chandelier Bar was absolutely gorgeous. I mean, it's really hard to describe with words, but it honestly feels like a crystally wonderland when you're walking through there. I only wish there had been a little bit more seating so that we could've had a drink there on an admittedly busy Saturday night. Still a massive thumbs up, though, for ambiance alone. The bar that I did get to actually have a couple of drinks at was Vesper; the more relaxed and casual bar that's located about 100 feet from the entrance to the hotel. We did go there as a plan B when Chandelier was full, but I have to say, I'm actually glad that we went there instead. The atmosphere is much more ""chill"" than Chandelier's seemed, since all of the little club rats were pre-gaming there for their big nights. There's another bar in Cosmo that I know of as well, but it's name escapes me. It looked really cool, too, though!

As for the Cosmopolitan's rooms, they were very nice. Cushy beds with nice bathrooms and a big screen tv. Pretty cool stuff! The room even had a nice view of the Nevada mountains. Granted, the view could've been a bit better if we'd been given a room with a balcony, but I suppose that's what you get for checking in at 1am. The one thing I could've stood to have a little different in the room were the pillows. Those things got so flat when you put your head on them, that they may as well have not even been there.

The one other gripe I had with Cosmo is that they took about $400 from my bank account for what I assume was a safety deposit on the room or something like that. Now, something like that is understandable, especially somewhere like Vegas. The only thing was that I'm not sure whether or not they told me they were going to do it or not, or if I just didn't hear in the loud lobby. Regardless, when I panicked over $400 randomly going missing from my account and called to inquire about any charges or anything, they gave me nothing, which only added to my panic. Of course, that could just all be on me. Who's to say!

All things considered, I had a wonderful time staying at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, and I sure wouldn't mind staying there again. I'd encourage anyone looking to travel to Vegas to give it a try as well!",11,9,13

I was extremely excited at first to stay at such a (at first glance) a nice, elegant hotel. However, visiting and staying at the hotel are two completely different things as I was unfortunate enough to experience.


The reasons for my 2 stars:

CUSTOMER SERVICE
Let's start by mentioning the front desk:
Why in the world do we have to complain multiple times about the room?
My first complaint was about how the room key was not working. So after a night out, we came back at 2am to find that the room key was not working!! I went down stairs to front desk, and the concierge told me that they will get it fixed ASAP and got a security guard to walk us up to our room. My friends, who came in later than us, couldn't even get into the elevator or room and had to resort to banging on the door at 6am. We woke up in the morning, to find that the room key was still not working and went back to the front desk. Same story: they told us they were going to fix the door and get it working ASAP.
Three hours later:
Door was still not fixed when we came back. And again we complained.
Once again, they told me they are working on getting the door fixed ASAP. 
Another two hours later: our door was still not fixed and we couldn't even get into our room without going to the front desk and complaining.

 I found this to be completely ridiculous since we're in Vegas expecting good service for the price we paid for the hotel! 

In the end, we had to complain 4 times to get our room keys to work on the door. Seriously?? 

To add, our room phone was not even working!

We ran out of toilet paper the first night (BTW we called multiple times for more, and they didn't bring it until the next day)  and resorted to using baby wipes. Why do I feel that I am camping again???

Even more, the front desk did not know how much their buffet costs and told us the wrong price.

Lastly, this hotel does not accommodate their guests in any way. For the buffet, we had to get in line like regular guests. (I know that other hotels have a VIP for their guests that are staying at the hotel). And there was a cover charge for the day pool party. What??? I don't mind paying, but at least provide us with something for being guests. 

For being a Vegas hotel, I was incredibly disappointed. I'm sure this doesn't happen to everyone but I was unfortunate enough to experience it. 

Overall,
The customer service does not outweigh the aesthetics of this hotel. I would not be staying here again. I don't usually get angry or overly snobbish and demanding but this is one of the few times that i felt the customer service just sucked.",4,3,1

We spent a week here between Xmas and New Years and despite the busy week, the service was top notch all the time.  Our three visits to the front desk were all met with above and beyond level customer service.  My favorite was when we checked out at 7 am on New Years Day there was a stuporous drunk wandering around the lobby and leaning on our checkout agents desk.  Watching her manage him with courtesy and kindness was like watching Michelangelo at work!

The lobby and public areas are drop dead gorgeous. After reading some reviews, we asked for a quiet room and were put on a ;high floor  in the West (Back) Tower.  The room was totally quiet and we were never bothered by music or crowd noise.  We slept with the balcony door open on New Years Eve and even that wasn't noisy.  

Our room was amazing, with a sitting area, changing area and bedroom.  Also, the most amazing bathroom ever.  The huge tub with a picture window overlooking the strip was fun, also the enormous shower that peeked thru to the bedroom.  (Blinds provided for the shy).  In addition, we took plenty advantage of the balcony. Enjoyed the view of Bellagio Fountains and northwards down the strip, Eiffel Tower right across.  We could see 5 fireworks displays at midnight on NYE!

We loved the bars, restaurants, shops and casino throughout the hotel.  Great, Great, Great Hotel.  We are already plotting our next trip!",1,0,1

We upgraded our terrace suite room for a fountain view at check in, and would highly recommend to anyone especially if you will be in your room for any length of time during your stay. Enjoyed many of their on site restaurants. The cereal milk soft serve ice cream at Milk Bar was fun to try. ""Secret"" pizza was good, had the white pizza and it didn't disappoint. At Wicked Spoon buffet highlights were the shrimp and grits, fried green tomato, coconut cauliflower curry, carved turkey and prime rib. I liked the Oreo rice krispie treat and the full gelato bar is a fun option for dessert. Scarpetta was really good. I tried the spice rubbed NY steak which was great and so were all the fresh hand made pastas. Buy coffee at Ve Bene and keep your receipt to get free refills throughout the day if you wish. Location is convenient for those staying in the Chelsea Tower. The Starbucks up by the Boulevard Tower closer to the Strip is great for people watching of course but tends to have long wait times in the morning so for those who may not want to wait every day, I'd give Ve Bene a go. Plus the staff was friendly and fast. Overall found most everyone in the hotel to be friendly and accomodating. Our housekeeping\/room stylists did a great job making up the room every day. Slot staff and waitresses were all very nice also. Based on this stay I'd feel very comfortable recommending this hotel to anyone!",0,0,0

I didn't have much expectations since it was a discounted room, but it was absolutely beautiful !

We got the Terrace One Bedroom.

Once you walk in, there is a living room with couch, coffee table, full work desk, flat screen TV and a kitchen with a full bar and snacks.

As you pass the living room, you walk through a hallway with full closet on one side, and bathroom on the other side. The closet even came with separate shelves for laundry, shoes, and iron. The bathroom had its own slidable door. Came with two seperate sinks, seperate bathroom, make up mirror, and other amenities such as soap, lotion, tissues, cutips, and hair dryer.

The shower was really unique, it was its own walk in room with a large clear glass door. In the middle was another short hallway with full shelves. And on the other end was a Japanese soaking tub. The tub was a bit on the small side but was nice because the hot water actually worked and didn't take a long time to heat up.

The bed.... felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. King size pillow top mattress with feather down comforters and tons of pillows of all sizes! It was heaven. There are two end tables on each side with individual lamps. At the end of the bed, lays another flat screen tv. 

Lastly, we had a balcony that overlooked the strip. I thought it was really nice that they even had a small day bed outside with a table and a candle.

Overall, it was one of the best rooms I've stayed in. It was just perfect. I could just live in that room. Lol.

Only downfall was that when we were trying to check out of the room through our flat screen tv, there was a charge that said we used an item from the mini bar, when we did not use anything. So we had to go wait in line at the front desk in order to check out which took up some time.

AND I didn't realize I had forgotten my make up bag until we got back home to San Diego which was very unfortunate. Luckily I was able to call the lost and found the next day and they had it in their possession. I was able to locate my missing make up bag quickly, but would've liked it better if they had called us as soon as they found it the night before, so that I could've picked it up while I was still in Vegas.

But nonetheless, great customer service and quality.",3,1,1

The first thing I saw when I walked in was Bond bar.  There were girls dancing in the ceiling.  The DJ booth looked like it was from Tron and he had a guy suit playing the electric guitar behind him.  Walked to the next bar Chandelier which is a multi-level bar in a big ass chandelier.  Every floor was doper than the last.  Plenty of table and easy access to the bartenders everywhere.  I've never seen a place like this.  Next I walked thru the casino floor.  There was club music playing and no old people or kids.  I busted out the expletives and did my philandering.  And I gotta admit this place had HBD, high bitch density.  Top caliber too and that's not the alcohol that talking, because I noticed a light peppering of mingas in the mix.  Even my gay buddy said he was going straight for the night.  I eventually made my way to the front of the hotel near the check-in area.  They had these 6x6 mirrored columns running along the floor.  But they weren't mirrored.  They was LED screens!  I was checking my hair out in my reflection and all the sudden the image changes.  Blew my mind.",1,2,0

It was the THING since it's the newest hotel on the Strip. I was in love with everything inside. The visuals in the hotel lobby, at the front entrance, in the elevator, etc just make it so modern. The casino is so classy-looking too. I think the shininess makes it so easy to be lured into the table games. And how could you resist a drink at the Chandelier Bar? It's so relaxing just to sit in those comfortable sofa chairs, sipping on a Hot Mule, looking up at the dazzling crystals. The Cosmopolitan lived up to its name.

While the shopping isn't the most spectacular thing inside the Cosmopolitan, it has a very decent restaurant collection. Holstein's have the best burger for a good price. Kobe beef burgers, with a large side of shoe string fries, and a free house beer if you check into foursquare? It's amazing! The only regret I have was being too drunk too early to enjoy my burger 100%. I had to check with my boyfriend whether I was eating an amazing burger or I was just drunk. Don't worry, he reassured me that the burger was indeed delicious. Milos on the third floor has such great deal and view for lunch for $20.12. Jaleo was okay, perhaps I'm not too thrilled about Spanish cuisine. I can tell you that their paella isn't overly salted and the presentation of that lobster paella is amazing. However, not all of their dishes are worth the price, for they are a bit too bland or boring. Overall, the choices available at Cosmo's restaurant collection is enough to feed through a weekend trip.

I've stayed in their Terrace Studio and their Terrace One Bedroom. First advice, do not stay here with just friends--especially friends you do not feel too close with. Their bathrooms are amazingly nice and roomy, but lacking in privacy. We had four girls sharing the bathroom in the Terrace Studio, where the window above the jacuzzi tub was just a hole in the wall, covered by a thing paper blind. If your friends are trolls, they can just lift up the blinds from the living room and see what you're doing. Unless you're doing your #1 or #2, they will be able to see you in the all glass shower or in the jacuzzi. My boyfriend quoted the bathroom in our Terrace One Bedroom as an orgy bathroom. You can see the shower from the bed, though there are blinds covering the shower windows. and there's the paper blinds covering the Japanese style sitting bathtub on the other side of the room. You can literally climb into the bathtub from the bedroom! So imagine how uncomfortable your friends will be if you guys were to share a room like those. 

Unfortunately, their noise cancelling windows don't work too well. My Terrace One Bedroom was located right in between Marquee and the pool. Day and night I can hear the music blasting through my closed balcony doors! As much as I love Marquee, I think it's bringing in a crowd I don't want to be around when I feel like a R&R moment.",0,0,0

We had a short wait at check in and were welcomed by Natalia, an incredibly friendly young lady who upon collecting our information exclaimed, ""You're getting married?!  Congratulations!""  At first it confused me, but then I remembered I wrote it in the comments section on my
reservation- proof that they DO see that section!  She hit a bunch of buttons and with a huge grin says, ""I got you a suite!""

She nabbed us a wraparound suite with two bathrooms, a kitchen and dining area, a livingroom and 60 feet of terrace that spanned around the corner of the building.  The free upgrade was an incredibly appreciated gesture and made my last sleep as a single woman very memorable.  I got the suite with my bridesmaids the night before the wedding.  :)

My first disappoint was with my room location.  After accumulating many Marriott points and redeeming over 100,000 points for a three night stay (advertised price was $110\/night) my room was located in the lower floors of the West Tower.  Traveling over 150+ days a year I have soon realize the lowest end rooms tend to be at the lower levels.  And my fears were confirmed.  

Next was how unclean my room was.  Water streaks on the bedroom mirror, streaks on the bathroom lighting, a desk with dust, and a TV that was intermittent.

Third, during my entire stay I never once received replacement wash cloths.

Fourth, I was highly disappointed in the race\/book by Cantor.  I did not know they no longer had parlay cards and pushed hard to have you sign up for their phone app (which from the reviews, only makes straight wagers).  Great, just what I want on a three day weekend trip to Vegas, sign up for an account, no clue how to close it when I leave (not even sure I could) and god forbid do not be a winner.  Probably end up with a 1099 and then have to document playing other slot\/table games.  Worse.  Sportsbook. Ever.  Do not even get me started on trying to cash a Cantor Cosmopolitan wager at the Cantor Hard Rock.  Long story short, you cannot.  Any property with a Cantor book is off my list for any future stays.

Fifth, somehow I missed the small print when booking my room and had a nice $28\/night ""resort fee"" or over 25% of the advertised room rate.  Again, any property that forces a ""resort fee"" I will no longer be a guest.

Thankfully, one of the Caesar properties was across the street and made my stay much more pleasant.

The terrace room views was excellent (nice to be higher) but the quality of the room and casino left much to be desired.  Pass on future stays.",2,0,0

Playing blackjack on a Saturday night, the dealer misread my California driver's license, and tried to throw me off the table for having an ""expired"" license.  He failed to read that it was the issuance date and not the expiration date - in front of a large group of people.  No real apology from him, but a grumpy frumpy ""sorry.""

We got a room with 2 queen beds. One reason I subtracted 1 star is because of the shower situation. See pic for example. So this room is ment to sleep 4 people. I don't know if it's because I'm in Vegas and people get more frisky here, but there should be no reason to have a floor to ceiling window into the shower for everyone to see your goodies. And yes they have horizontal blinds to cover that window, BUT THEY ARE CONTROLLED FROM THE BED SIDE OF THE WALL! I felt so uncomfortable showering knowing that there was an inch gap on either side that the blind did not cover and if my friend wanted to get a show, he could. So so not cool Cosmo! !! What were you thinking? Not okay for a 4 person room. I know a few immature friends that would have had fun with that if more people stayed with us.

Also, the other reason I subtracted 1 star was the mini fridge. Having a mini fridge in the room is pointless if it's 100% jam packed with items they want you to purchase. There was no way to keep my food cold at all. 

Besides that, I thought the room was very nice and I liked the interior design.

It was my friends graduation. We told them we were going to have a celebration and they suggested to get a bigger room to have more space. So we booked one of the nicest rooms on the top floor and it wasn't cheap. We had about 10 people over we went to dinner and then went to the room for drinks. By MIDNIGHT (which for vegas is like 9pm) had a knock on the door saying we were too loud. So we went to tell everyone to tone it down. Not even 5 min later we had another knock for a 2nd warning! Are you kidding me?! How can we settle everyone down in less then 5min?! So we turned the music off  and seriously toned it down. 20 min later we had our 3rd warning it was ridiculous there was 8 security guards trying to escort us out! A little dramatic don't you think? It was now 1am. 1AM for Vegas!!!! It was so beyond stupid I started to record it and one of the security guards grabbed my wrist and yanked my phone out of my hand and told me I couldn't record them. First off they ARE NOT allowed to touch you in anyway unless you give them permission or under arrest. I tried to talk to a manger but they refused and said we were now crossing private property. Long story short we left. No. Actually they walked all of us out of the hotel!! I will never get a room at Cosmo again. Vegas is known to party. Their commercials are ""the right amount of wrong"" we were not doing anything illegal and everyone was over 21. Being a local I have been to plenty of hotel parties. Even some where there were 20-50 ppl and live DJs and not a word from security.
It's one thing to be in a tiny bedroom and being loud but  We were even in the huge luxury suite. They may be the hot new hotel on the strip. But not worth it to end a party by 1am.
Oh and not to mention that one of guards told me on the way out that he has been doing security for 20 yrs and if we wanted to have a hotel party that Hard Rock is the place to be and we won't hear a word. That Cosmo is good for the clubs and bars. But they cater to business people For their hotel rooms. 

So maybe they should change their
Commercials cause its false advertisement . come to the clubs but don't plan on sleeping there. I'll book my next hotel at Hard Rock",7,3,0

Only so often in my life do I have the absolute bliss of knowing that after all the analysis, I ended up making the correct choice in every way.  

There were 5 of us; we got two adjoining rooms each with 2 queen beds and views of the Bellagio fountains and the strip.  The rooms were totally comfortable enough for 5 people (and one night a few more, but that's a different story).  The hotel has some great restaurants, great clubs (Marquee is fantastic), and an epic location.  

Sorry to put too fine a point on it, but there were absolutely beautiful, elegant, wonderful, amazing women, EVERYWHERE.  Hardly anywhere else in Vegas did we find such a dense preponderance of beautiful women.  As a pack of heterosexual men, this was important; and even though most of us weren't looking to ""score"", it invited the opportunity to meet some great people in a more casual way.  I do wish that there were some lower stake tables to kill some time gabling, however.

We were actually quite pleased with our room.  We stayed on the 22nd floor in a terrace room.  They offered us an upgraded Bellagio fountain view for $50 more and we declined.  We figured out why later on that night, even though to us, it didn't really matter.  We were on the east tower which is around the corner from the Marquee beach club which is ""thumpingly"" loud during the day (which we heard while coming in and out from shopping\/eating out etc) and ""thumpingly"" loud at night from the club.  We were there Fri\/Sat night. 'Club nights' lol.  Like I said, to us it really made no difference because we weren't really disturbed by it because we weren't in the room all that much, but I can see how it wouldn't be okay for people that like some peace and quiet. The room itself is very nice. It has a kitchenette, big closet, separated bedroom sectional couch in living room\/mini office, two flat screen tvs, a bubble tub, and a HUGE seated shimmery glass mosaic shower  roomy enough for two, or 3? The kitchenette has a dishwasher (weird?) and a microwave, but no dishes or silverware. No coffee either? I did have enough foresight to bring some of my own alcohol with me and the kitchenette did work out well for this.  :)  Nice robes and little slippers too.  The balcony is a nice touch-haven't seen too many of these in Vegas, but again, not really functional. It is at least 5 times louder when you open the sliding glass door! hehee.

Decor:
Beautiful, luxurious, modern. It definitely looks more feminine than many of the other hotels with its gargantuan chandelier, crystals, pink and red color themes.

Rooms:
We got upgraded to a suite in the West Tower. It was very spacious with a fridge, sink, dishwasher, living area with a pullout bed, bath, shower, and a balcony. I thought it was a little weird that the blinds to the shower and bath were on the bedroom side rather than in the bathroom.

Casino:
Higher limit so the cheapest blackjack tables are 25 minimum and roulette and craps were $10 minimum. Pretty big casino.

Food:
1) Wicked Spoon - delicious and very popular, so there's a long wait. Around $33
2) Holstein's Shakes and Buns - One of the cheaper restaurants, but still expect to spend $15-20 minimum.  Very delicious burgers and spiked drinks

I was told by the bartender at Holsteins: ""it's 1:30 am in Vegas, expect to spend some money"" (because HE didn't tell me that in order to sit in a booth, each guest had to purchase $20 worth of food and drink). 

This same person at Holsteins pocketed my 54 cents in change and did not give me a receipt. When I asked for a copy of my receipt I was told: ""I will have to dig it out of the trash"" --- I did get a copy of my receipt and their trashcans must be sparking because my receipt was spotless and crisp.

I was going to let this slide because I thought that after I told the floor manager (of the floor we were staying on) about this issue, he would do as he said and ""discuss this with the management team and make things right"" but I didn't ever hear back from him, nor have I heard back from the hotel after I got home and emailed them about this experience (I waited one week and now I'm here letting y'all know not to waste your money here).

We then got there early (9:00AM), early, and didn't have  room yet, but were able to check in. We already planned on spa day, and so had reservations for mani\/pedi, scrub, spa-ing all day (See Sahra Spa review).

We had our fill, but not before taking amazing pics of the dogs and the stilettos in the foyers.

We then went to lunch at the Wicked spoon...awesome! What fresh farm to table cuisine, lots of fresh veggies, and fruits concocted in the most amazing presentations, with such dishes that I will try to find and order o the internet!  I am picky about eating fresh, raw veggies with my meals, and I just adored the gratifying steamed and lightly steamed veggies Wicked Sppon offered as part of the entree, and even as an entree...

We then went to the Spa to have a Shellac Mani-Pedi, and Salt Total Body scrub. There was some patron there trying to convince us in the steam room that we should have spent our money elsewhere i.e Aria, but beware of competition in the form of blondie girls looking to lure you!! Weird!! I know!!!

We went to the spa, the cold plunge, steam room, sauna...see my review under Sahra Spa!

We then went to our room. I paid for a 1 bedroom suite, but April (my sweet concierge) decided to upgrage us to a Bellagio Fountain View (OMG). I ordered a dozen mylan balloons to be there for my twin sis, and a delish fruit basket, thanks for setting it up, including our bags.

That night we got ready and went directly to Encore for La Reve!!!! Super Duper!!! You HAVE to see it!!!

We came back, stood in line at Marquee for about an hour...a little flirting got us NO where, so we left and went to Bond...see my review there...LOVED it!!

We then went back to Marquee...slipped the ""guy with the clipboard"" a $20 and got in to the front of the line....IT WAS 2:20 BY NOW, FYI, and the lines were outrageous...we danced our souls away until 5:00AM, and OMG did we have an amazing early birthday celebration in Vegas...

I can't wait to come back...I'll definitely come back just with my twin too!!

Look out for us!!",2,2,3

My wife and I go to Vegas 3 times a year, we have stayed at every hotel on the strip and Cosmo is by far the nicest we have stayed at. We got a special suite that has an out door balcony that wrapped around our hotel room, it had 3 sliding doors, that's how long it was. 2 full bathrooms, 2 large LED TV's and a kitchen.  The casino is very nice, it is very modern and definitely appeals to a younger, more hip crowd. At night there is a club pool side, although this sounds nice, it can be tough to sleep with the music pounding outside your window.
Service: Practically impossible to get a drink. The waitress came around maybe once every 50 minutes.  I spent a lot of money gambling, I should get drinks faster then that.
Food: There many many places to eat, pretty expensive and you get the feel of it as soon as you walk in the casino. Everything just feel more expensive, kind of of like the Bellegio and The Wynn.  

Overall, I really enjoyed the place. We got a special promotion of $300 free slot play and $275 free food, don't know how much less I would of liked the stay there if I was actually paying for it? But It was very nice and it feels good sometimes to relax in a place way out of your normal life.  A very high class modern casino\/hotel that plays dancing music all through the night. I would stay there again if they gave me the same free promotion, otherwise, I probably cannot afford it.

And, no sports book! What's up with that?",0,0,0

I stayed there last weekend and had such a blast.  My stay was almost perfect except for a few very fixable, very forgivable things that I just cannot ignore: 

-the in-room phones are SO techie that we didn't know how to use them.  Before you roll your eyes and think we are tech-illiterate, I was with almost 30 people, all of whom know our way around our smartphones like it's our backyards.  Calling down to housekeeping to request more towels was a chore!  And then at one point during the weekend, our room phone's screen went black, so we unplugged it, and plugged it back in, only for it to turn on so we could order room service, then have the screen go black again!  Annoying.  

-the back staircase leaving Marquee is just unacceptable.  How do you have a glitzy sparkly club like Marquee and then have the back stairwell so undone and disgusting?  The hoards of people going down those stairs was scary - in heels, a little drunk and stumbly.  Scary.

The rooms are stylishly modern decorated and the casino is hip with all its glassy glitz.  I wouldn't consider this a family hotel but good for us as a couple as we do not have young children.  The slick visuals and glass make this place interesting and classy.  We were disappointed that the one Italian restaurant we wanted to eat at here (and the main reason we stayed here this time) was closed for Thanksgiving week. Something to remember for future reservations - always check on the restaurants or stores that you want to visit first to see if they're open or still there...  Check-in and out was a breeze (the staff are extra nice). The only room complaint we have is that the water pipes in our room were extremely noisy all night (coming from other rooms as well!) and this was very disturbing and difficult.  Too bad, seems like the glitz is a facade for cutting corners on construction. Too bad.  We did like that the hotel has free and easy parking, although they get you with a high resort fee on top of the room rate (most Marriott Hotels do this - NOT NICE MARRIOTT!). But, at least this place didn't charge for parking too... The little coffee bar near reception is horrible and unhappy not nice people work there - and their coffee is nasty... the lady never acknowledged me and never said thank you or you're welcome even after I said it three times! But, overall, I would stay here again because of the convenience on the strip, it's easy to walk everywhere, and the large stylish rooms are very clean and nice....",0,0,0

I stayed in Vegas from Thursday-Monday, but only had a hotel until Sunday. At 10:30pm, I approached Brandi at the front desk and told her my situation: I didn't have a reservation, I just got a massive tattoo (I was exhausted and slimy), and I had to be at the airport by 4:15am. I needed a place to shower quick and get some short sleep. I would not be using the pool, spa, fitness center, or even the wifi, so I didn't want to pay the resort fee ($33\/night). 

Brandi quickly got on the phone with the front desk manager and told them my situation. After a couple of ""okay. yup. got it""s, Brandi told me they'd reduce the room rate and waive the resort fee. This was stark contrast to another center strip hotel that, while half the price, was not willing to waive the resort fee. If you don't believe there's a difference between 3 star and 5 star service, then you've got to stay at the Cosmopolitan and see the difference for yourself. I wasn't looking for anything fancy; again, just somewhere to shower and lay my head. I got a city room (which is their cheapest room) with a fountain view on the 36th floor. I was blown away!

The reason I can't give the Cosmo a 5-star rating was because of a couple of things in the room that didn't work well and\/or weren't user friendly. As a former hospitality employee, I've got an idea of what a 5-star property requires. The shower handle was loose and the towel rack on the shower door was quite jiggly. The lighting in the room was way too confusing to try and figure out. I pressed the ""Hello"" button by the front door to turn everything off, but I had to go back to the door to press ""Goodbye"" to turn everything off and navigate back to the beds using my phone's light. The buttons on the lamps didn't seem to do anything to turn them on or off.

Regardless, if the price is right, I will DEFINITELY be making a point to book my next Vegas trip at the Cosmopolitan. My only lament was not being able to enjoy the room\/resort for a longer period of time than 4 hours.",0,0,0

The rooms are well designed and large. Every room has a terrace, most with great views. The Casino is a bit small compared to those at MGM or even Harrah's, but we don't gamble that much so it's not a deal breaker. But the tables and slots they do have are well maintained and very nice.

The restaurants are probably our favorite part. Eggslut, STK, the secret pizza place are always good. But our favorite is Milos. In the 8 years we've stayed here we never bothered to stop into this restaurant until this trip. It's better than most restaurants in NYC. It's simple Greek food but done exceptionally well. They have a prix fixe lunch special for $29! You get an app, entre, and dessert. Normally this would be around $60. It's an insanely good deal. But the food is just phenomenal. Try the octopus app and the tomato salad. And the yogurt dessert is the best choice. We went three times during our last stay because we couldn't get enough.

The hotel is sort of centrally located. Nearby the shops at Aria and walking distance to Bellagio and even Cesar's Palace. As a hotel guest, you get a complimentary ticket to Marquee. It's worth $40 at least. On some holiday nights, they up the cost to $100. It's a great deal if you like going to clubs.

We also recommend signing up for the Identity membership so you earn points. Each year, we get a free stay.

Last weekend I stayed at the wrap around suit with 4 other guys to celebrate a bachelors party for my good friend. When arriving at the hotel we were sure that after staying there for 3 nights something would have to go wrong.... like, waking up with no front tooth, tattoo on our face or finding a baby by the name Carlos in our suit :) ... but after 3 nights of lots of fun, none of the above happend and we had a blast and we all got home safely. After unpacking my stuff I realized that I was missing something... what I was missing was a brand new Rolex Yacht-Master 2 that I've got from my wife 6 months prior. Like an idiot I took with me on this trip both of my Rolex watches (not a smart move since it was a bachelors party) and I ended up living one of them in the room :(  The feeling of living behind something that cost you around $18,000!!! is not the greatest feeling in the world.... Thinking that its long gone by now I gave it one last try and called lost & found at the Cosmopolitan and spoke to a guy by the name Christen, as I was telling him the story that ive lost my rolex he stopes and askes me if the rolex was a white face Yacht-master!!! I jumped up and told him YES!!! He said that yes they do have it and that the room cleaner found it and placed it lost & found and that they will ship it out to me....now I've heard many stories about many things but this one is just unreal and shows what kind of people work at the Cosmopolitan. To sum it up if i could give them 10 stars I would and its not only because of this story but also the service, the restaurants, the casino, and may I add the beautiful people that stay and work there was what made this trip the perfect trip!! 

Thank you again Cosmopolitan from the bottom of my heart.",4,3,1

My friend was invited to spend NYE and he invited us to experience Cosmo for the first time.  I really like the hotel and will definitely return.
Location\/Hotel:  Great location at City Center.  Everything is near by and within walking distance. The hotel is still relatively new (3 years) and is still fresh.  The whole hotel has a different vibe than the other ones I frequently visit (Venetian, Aria, and Palazzo).  The vibe is more hip and upscale.  Not really a snooty feel, but they definitely know they are the sh*t.  The hotel is not terribly large and I kind of like that.  You can get from one side of the resort to the other in a relatively short time frame.  If going from west tower to restaurants, I suggest walking on the second\/third floor to bypass the traffic on the casino floor.
Room:  We stayed in a 2 bedroom (wrap around suite with connecting terrace suite 44th floor) on the west tower.  There was never really a guard checking for room keys.  You are required to insert your room key in the elevator before you can press the button.  Sometimes the room key doesn't activate the elevator and it is a kind of a pain.  The room was very nice.  I loved the fact that the room had a full kitchen.  There were no pots\/pans\/plates to use with the kitchen (you could probably ask for it though).  The minibar price was def overpriced, so I would suggest bringing in your own beverage.  The rooms had nice modern electronic components but no iphone dock or sound system in the whole suite.  The terrace was great and offered an awesome view of the strip.  There was 3 full baths in the suite.  I loved the bathroom in the terrace suite.  The japanese soaking tub was too small for a grown man...but had a fabulous view.  I loved how the shower and tub was in the same area and you could walk out of the tub and straight into the shower.  There were great bathroom amenities.  Beds were really comfortable but once again, no ipod dock or charging station.  Another complaint that I had was that the light switches were a little confusing.  There was a main switch but then each individual light had one too but was confusing to turn on and off (maybe it was just me).  All in all, I really really loved the room.  
Service:  Decent.  However, biggest complaint was the long long long wait for room service to pick up the phone.  I literally waited 15 mins, hung up, and called the operator to help me.  Unacceptable.
Restaurant:  Lots of good choices.  But no fast food options.  Best place for a fast grub is the secret pizza restaurant.  

The casino floor was not terribly big but was a perfect size.

Let me back pedal for a bit. Those commercials about the casino seem to make people think that there are a lot of animals, bestiality and Aerosmith video extras hang out around the hotel doing all kinds of West German expressionist wackiness.

Clearly, the casino is not that. The lighting was strange. It was bright but the walls were black. It was kind of night clubby, but it had lots of glass\/ plastic beads refracting light and colors all over. 

The music alternated between funk and vintage Motown\/ soul. Where do we sign the petition that top 40 easy listening music from the 80's has to be phased out of casinos? This casino gets it, creates a theme or a difference without announcing it's brand. 

I haven't been on the strip in some time, so when I did I made a conscious decision not to dwell on the past and what was gone. My mission was to carve off the lip of the newest things. Hashtag trendy.

In volleyball, when the ball comes over the net, the first to make contact has to slow the blast down, pop the ball up a little to set for the second person to spike it back over. Cosmo bumps a little on décor, a little with music, a little with the art. It doesn't try to spike a return and overdo it like a few other 5 star wannabe casinos. 

It's a little artsy, but doesn't over douche it. Locals recognize a bit of first Friday, eclectic art here and there and constantly new from the halls to the rooms to the parking structures. 

The even have it to go in vending machines, which some people recognize as cigarette machines. And we get to think about there being a time when people had self discipline of when or when not to use such machines. 

Even the stores and restaurants don't over do the gimmicks, but there are noticeable things to check out: an oyster bar, live bikini models, the not really secret hidden pizza place. I purposely stopped listening about it so I could take my time and find it on my own, as if I taped the superbowl and had to block out any results til I got to see it myself. 

The thing is, it's not just pretty stuff to look at, but there's a lot to actually do there. There's weird little elevators all over the place that look like time travel booths. I noticed them and thought what are they? There's no floor number above. Where do they go? They just end with nothing above it and we're not on the top floor? They beg to be taken to explore. It's not the generic bank of elevators. 

They layout of the casino itself is unique and different. It reminded me of Beverly hills streets, the halls curve and wind and you're not really sure of even the direction you're going. My trick of not getting lost in a casino actually didn't work in this casino a couple of times. Wow. 

The balcony views are expected to be wonderful, but the surprise it that they're so accessible, from walkways, some restaurants and bars. 

I did have one agenda when I came in, I know 4 people that work there. I went all over to the restaurants and bars where I knew they worked and could find no one. Bummer. 

For a place that opened months ago, there are thousands of reviews and pictures. But there are dozens of pictures that aren't like any of the others. There's definitely a lot to take in as you wonder where this way goes.. 

Cosmo is liked by locals and I was pleasantly impressed for a new casino. It takes a lot for a local to want to push their way thru fanny packers to get to a lounge or bar with any regularity on the strip.

for such a nice hotel, it's strange to me that there aren't any high end shops here.  but it's connected to the crystals shopping court inside aria so maybe that's why.  the walk next door was pretty convenient.  

the parking structure tells you how many spots there are on each level, and those red\/green lights above each spot to tell you where the availability is.  pretty helpful.

both times we stayed in the suites (aka terrace studio), which are pretty nice and spacious.  i'm sure the regular rooms are nice too.  i'm just glad both trips were free.  i wouldn't pay (or allow anyone i'm with to pay) to stay here.

psst....go find the secret pizza place (open late night only) on the 3rd floor next to the pool tables.  the line was uber long so we didn't try it, but i'm kinda curious how it tastes.  though i guess that late at night, when everyone's drunk, anything tastes good.",7,7,4

I stayed in the west tower with 7 other girls with two terrace rooms double queen beds total of 8 girls all together. We all flew in for the weekend to meet up with other friends for one of our closest friends bachelorette party. Maid of honor got her sister the bride a suite decorated with pink and black streamers, chocolate strawberries, cupcakes and cake plus the alcohol to share. Hired a male entertainer(stripper) for 1 hour which was everyones first time getting to experience. 19 girls in total came to witness the strip tease hired by this male stripper. Fresh $1 bills ready to be disburst. After the show stripper asked to wash up we allowed him and as he went to the bathroom to ""wash up"" he checked himself out in the mirror which had a LV clutch on the vanity with money in it. Bride witnessed the male entertainer putting money into his pocket as he walked out passed her. She ran to her wallet and the money was gone. She started to yell histrically at what she witnessed and the party came to a stop. He was asked to honestly admit and give back the money and leave. He admitted to take the money out of the clutch saying he thought it was his tips. We call Cosmopolitan Security, they come up with at least 2 then 4 then 6 then 9 in total were present. Would not let any of the bachelorette party involved girls to leave. Took all of our Identifcation cards and took pictures of it with their phones, treated us as criminals not allowing us to leave, when had planned to be at a club for bottle service . Yelled at us to be quiet and do as they say or they will kick us out and say we are trespassing...mind i tell you few girls had rooms at the Cosmopolitan. Called a resort manager to discuss the outcome of the situation. Conclusion we were 86ed. Meaning kicked out permanently and escorted off the property.  Security also took mug shot like photos of us on their phone for some reason then handed us our IDs one at a time. Me and the girls who stayed in my room at the Cosmopolitan were escorted to our rooms with security front and back of us to our rooms to gather our property (belongings) and escorted off the property. I asked if i would be charged for the room that i had already booked for the night he said yea policy is policy. I said wait i havent done anything wrong and ive been kicked out?!?!. We have told cosmopolitan we were there for a bachelorette party and yet they still treated ua like criminals after going to STK steak Resturants and having booked 2 rooms and a suitw becausw the stripper claimed we took his money. All i have to say it was a experience i never had happened to me or my girls Before. We are made of mothers, wives, daughters, small business owners, registered nurses, practioners, teachers, and social workers why were we punished for what had happened? I will not bad mouth an establishment without reason. Cosmopolitan is highly not recommended for bachelorette parties. And I will be telling people of my experience there that happened. Will be posting on yelp and the other girls and their worried family and friends will be too for the experience we had to go through. and yes my other friends from ca getting married soon will be canceling their plans with Cosmopolitan. We were basically held captive in a suite with security not sure why we werent allowed to leave. Told us resort manager decision and we should clean up to make it a easier decision. I felt like my rights as a human being was violated by holding us in that room from 1030 to 130am. We were escorted to retrieve our belongings from the west tower we were staying. I had my bra and panties laid out on the bed, I felt disrespected as a woman. We were the ones who called security to help and instead of accommodating their paid guest they just wanted to kick us out. And yes i will be asking for a police report from that night as well as calling kron4 on your side to find out why of all people did i get kicked out got being at a bachelorette party at the Cosmopolitan. Never in my life have I ever witness such poor service at a hotel. I even had a spa appointment there for the next day and couldn't even do that. This is the power of social media.

Was perfect for our party of 3. Spent most of my time on the awesome balcony with the lovely views of the Bellagio. The east tower is closer to all of the Cosmos amenities and establishments and the strip, but further from the cabs. Had really good times and the Cosmo's central location was such a relief for making moves easily and the lovely ambience and was always so nice to come back to. I was always so pleased with my choice to stay here after visiting other hotels for venues. The Cosmo looks and smells so nice! (Yes, it has a nice fragrance throughout the hotel, other places smell quite old and musty, so its noticeable and memorable) Also worth mentioning, the Walgreens and liquor stores are right across the street. Our great experience last year led to us making another recommendation for us to return this year, this time with a party of 5 for a bachelorette\/birthday, we got a terrace suite this time, but with a connecting one bedroom like last year. The terrace suite gave us a full kitchen with fridge where we could comfortable store our booze and left overs, (big deal, cause in the regular room theres only a pre-stocked mini fridge with no room to put your own stuff) also the terrace suite has 2 additional bathrooms which is so essential when rolling with a group of girls! With our connected 2 room setup, we had a total of 2 king size beds and 3 bathrooms, and we got a good deal on the room rates by booking directly through the cosmo with their 1 free night promotion. This time around we were in the westend tower, the view of the Bellagio fountain and strip is further back than it was last year when we stayed in the east tower, but the suites only come in the west tower, and the view of the Bellagio fountains didn't really matter since they barely turned it on this year. Staying in the westend towers was the reverse of our last stay, because it was more convenient for getting cabs, but then we had to walk across to the east tower many times a day to get to amenities, such a secret pizza, chandelier bar and the pools. I'd say if you're not staying in a suite, try and request the east tower for more convenience. But the view alone from the west is really not that bad. Based off of our first experience, I would have given this place 5 stars, but unfortunately the quality of service noticeably dropped from the last time we were there. We had to call the front desk and speak to people several times to get simple requests, like more hangers and towels. When we did get hangers, they were wire hangers. Totally unacceptable. Then having a suite with a ""full kitchen"" was useless, when there was not a single plate, glassware, piece of cutlery, a pot, a sponge, or even a squeeze of soap to wash a dish. None. We had to call down several time to get basic supplies to actually use our kitchen and rinse our wine glasses since we were drinking wine nonstop and they would take forever to bring a new set, and each time we spoke to someone, we were met with resistance and confusion. They wouldnt even lend us a pair of scissors, claiming that it was a safety concern, which is the stupidest excuse ever, when you have knives and glass in the room, how is a scissor anymore distinctive? And what kind of clientele are you hosting that is asking for scissors for such reasons? It was all very frustrating. Only after speaking directly with a few managers and taking names did we finally get them to roll up a cart with 5 of everything to stock the kitchen for our group and received a small resort credit which we spent at the overlook grill for breakfast, because we explained how disappointed we were in choosing this place, where they clearly made it a point to note the bachelorette\/birthdays we were celebrating, but offered no incentive to acknowledge the occasions or make us feel special for being a returning full price paying customer, thats bringing more people and booking more rooms than the previous year. There are too many options of where to stay in Vegas, especially new ones, for the Cosmo to disregard or not give thanks and appreciation to their patrons for any reason. We didnt even need much, just a simple bottle of wine, or a small box of white chocolate covered strawberries upon arrival would have been a nice enough touch to make us feel good about dropping so much money just to be here, but the lack of stock, combined with the poor service and attitudes we met throughout the property, and frustration in trying to resolve all during our short stay, were very discouraging. I still think i might stay here once more, to give it one more try, because once all the stock and incentives issues were somewhat resolved, the place is still fine for their comfy plushy beds, great terrace views, and convenient central strip location. Plus its just pretty. Tighten up on your service and room stocki",1,0,0

It's one of the most aesthetically pleasing casinos I've ever been to... until you reach the hotel suites. The main floors of the hotel are modern, glamorous, and digital. So one would assume the same would be applied to the rooms, hence I was extremely excited to stay there. So when I entered my suite I was utterly disappointed. Granted I was lucky enough to stay in a suite and not a standard room, which I assume has more amenities and is more spacious than an average room, yet the lack of technology left me highly confused. I felt as if they'd spent so much time and money designing and building the common areas that when it came time to build and decorate the rooms they ran out of funds & time? That's the only explanation I have for the underwhelming room. Considering how high tech and new this place is, they still have the type of curtains that require manual work via plastic rods for open and closure. Their blinds requires the use of a hand crank rod. Kitchen and furniture looks cheap, somewhat comparable to some nicer Holiday Inn. Everything else was decent at best, but nothing too spectacular. 

So why 4 stars and not lower? Despite my utter disappointment in the room, I love everything else about the hotel and the casino areas. The lobby is decked with high-tech beams displaying some fantastic graphics and images. The attention to detail throughout the main floors are drool worthy. Lastly, the view from my room was breathtaking. If I were to only frequent the common areas and not be a hotel guest I would definitely give this place  a perfect score.

My boyfriend and I reserved a wraparound terrace suite with a premium view for three nights to celebrate my birthday. Upon arriving we were very promptly helped with bags and valet.

Our room was only on the 21st floor, would have definitely liked a room a bit higher but this isn't so much of a complaint as it is a preference.

The room was absolutely gorgeous, very chic decor and brilliant layout. One side of the terrace faced the Bellagio fountains and the other faced the strip, excellent views especially at night. The kitchen comes with absolutely nothing, so you've been warned, but if you want check out the in room cooking options in the back of the room service book. Awesome toiletry freebies and clever wallpaper in the bathrooms.

The bars are incredible, Never get tired of looking at The Chandelier bar. Beautiful bartender at Queue Bar who can whip up some killer drinks, Vesper has a sophisticated modern baroque feel. Do yourself a favor and order a Cosmo, not just to say you had a Cosmo at the Cosmo but because they are so mouthwateringly delicious, they don't make it like a traditional Cosmo and I must say I much prefer this version.

China Poblano= AMAZING! Quail egg shumai will blow your mind and the China Paloma cocktail was refreshing and new. 
My new favorite flavor fusion. Very balanced.

Wicked Spoon= AMAZING! The bruch deal is killer. Ten extra bucks gets you all you can drink Mimosas for your whole table. The food is clever and fresh. I didn't run into a single thing I didn't like. Watermelon salad with balsamic reduction and marscapone cheese is amazing as well as smoked trout mousse. Was addicted to the wicked juice, single serve smoothies in cute little bottles in the buffet, plus they had roasted bone marrow bones cut in half. First time to ever see that in a buffet and it was deeeelish!!
Everything was set out in perfect portions and I definitely liked that there was a lot less food waste. 

Overall excellent experience. Prime location in the ""heart"" of the strip. I can honestly say that I would recommend this hotel to any and everyone. Best hotel thus far.",0,0,0

The hotel\/casino is a happening place with an overall younger crowd (20-40s) that makes for good people watching and celebrity sitings.  There is a vast array of great places to grab a bite, a drink, or shop.

Currently, they are showcasing outfits and items of Liberace's!  It it a VERY impressive display.

Although the rooms are nice, they aren't overly impressive compared to the casino and the prices, however, the balcony was great as well as the view.  My only major complaint about our stay was the lack of coffee makers in the rooms!!!!  This is VEGAS and I need a pick me up ASAP after my long nights!  Not only is there no coffee makers in the rooms, trying to find a coffee is like some sort of treasure hunt.  Since we stayed in the West tower, we had to walk all the way over to the east tower to grab our morning cup of joe.  We were told they are adding a coffee shop in the west tower but until then, be prepared to hunt and walk.

It cost me a fortune but I think that Cosmopolitan really lived up to my expectations. 

The fountain views were probably the best part of our stay, we could hear the music and the splashing which was somewhat relaxing and a good background soundtrack to our weekend there. As for the interior of the rooms, I think it seemed a bit less than expected with the simple decor and lack of interesting design. To me it just looked like a super nice apartment room. With it's classy, luxurious design of the rest of the hotel, the room just seemed boring with lack of effort, especially considering it was a suite. I guess they wanted there to be a sense of simplicity which did made us feel at home. The japanese style soaking tub was pretty cool, the kitchen area looked brand spankin new, and the bed was also super comfortable. 

I loved the different pool areas there. The one we went to was the Bamboo Pool which had a very chill vibe. I think that one is known for being a soothing environment to kick back at, and our friends and I definitely enjoyed a relaxing afternoon there. 

The crowd at Cosmopolitan seems to be on the younger side and its probably because of Marquee's day\/night club and the fact that it is one of the newer casinos\/hotels.

The staff at Cosmopolitan was also very courteous and good to deal with. There were some pretty unfortunate issues that happened on our third night there; however, they were pretty reasonable in regards to handling the situation.

Arriving at the hotel your hit in the face with the most awful scent ever. My boyfriend described it as ""urinal cakes"". Yummy.

Check in went fine, and we headed up to our room. Well we walk in and the room is boiling hot. Turn on the lights and it looked like someone attacked the shower area. The only covering that makes the shower private was sprayed out across the floor. Looked like an angry bear mauled it.

We called down and they sent someone up about 20 mins later. Mind you it's past midnight at this point, we're hungry and tried. As we waited we noticed the tv wasnt working. Well maintenance fixed that, but said the shower cover curtain thing will be held off till morning. They never came to fix it. 

So good thing I was rooming with the boyfriend otherwise it would have been rather uncomfortable showering with the world to see.

Our mini fridge and bar food area was half stocked. That's cool..okay thanks? No hangers, except two that said to enjoy their bathrobes. Those didn't exist!

Before heading to bed we ripped the place apart searching for the 'do not disturb' sign. Well it didn't exist. So we called down and said ""hey please don't send room cleaning over-we don't want it"". 

Next morning as I'm snoozing away. Some dude parades in and walks all the way to the bed before realizing I'm there. He left right away, but whoa come on!  (Happened three mornings in a row after calling them and saying not to send anyone up).

When we did ask for the room cleaning they never restocked our toilet paper (there was also none when we arrived)...thanks! Also we were charged $76 for the room cleaning. That's never happened to us in vegas before.

We called down again to have the mini fridge cleared out (not that there was much anyway). Well the lady came she grabbed everything then stocked our stuff carefully above the sensors. LOL! 

During check out low and behold we were charged for everything the woman took out of the bar. They took it off but what a hassle that was.

Marquee is attached to this hotel as well and you get in for free or at a discounted price if you're a hotel guest! Score!! Their daylight club is pretty fun FYI! 

There is also a mall called ""Crystals"" which is home to the higher end stores like Prada and Gucci.. But it's always fun to window shop, right?

Overall, a must stay while in Vegas!! You won't be disappointed!!",8,1,6

The location was great in the middle of the strip. The restaurant choices were great and enjoyed several fabulous dinners while here. The lounge options were fun and plentiful as well. The multiple pools to choose from were excellent. They pools had a good amount of people but were not overly crowded. The room was spacious and clean. This hotels has everything you could ever want for your Vegas visit. I would definitely stay here again.

Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was exactly as I expected, and the bedding and pillows were extremely comfortable! My only complaint is that the giant windows were pretty dirty, tarnishing our lovely view. Also, we never received our sundrenched gift bag that was supposed to come with the room we reserved. But the service provided by every staff member we encountered made up for such tiny flaws. The valet literally jogged over to open and close our doors, the desk clerks were really nice and looked up rooms for us that had a nice view and were located by the pools, and the concierge was extremely helpful with all our questions.

The Cosmopolitan was also perfect for us because most guests were around our age, in their 20's. All of my friends that stayed at other places complained about all the old people around, but the majority of people I encountered were young. I also LOVED the Marquee, which is now my favorite nightclub in Vegas, but I still need to check out Surrender. The entire layout of the hotel is beautiful, especially the pools (there are three to choose from!!).

The decor inside is nice and they have fancy touch screens everywhere.  The lobby is amazing with these crazy digital pillars with screens covering its entirety.

Once you get over the glitz and glam and actually get into the room, its just okay.  The window in our room had all kinds of nasty grease stains on it, like someone pushed their face against it but the cleaning people didin't clean the windows.  There was also some hair in our bathroom, disgusting.

My friends' room had a coke bottle left in it and the windows was in a similar condition.  We asked to have the room re-cleaned, but no one came.

The beds were decent, but the phone is high tech, controlling the lighting and temperature as well, the interface was kinda clunky and slow though.    The phone it self was pretty crappy, had echos while calling people and felt like the phone had some part seriously broken in it and clanking around when using it.

Still a decent hotel, great since Marquee, the hottest club in vegas is jsut downstairs and hotel guests have a special line to go in.  But if its a saturday, its still hectic to get in.

I stayed at The Cosmopolitan for three nights this past weekend and it absolutely exceeded my expectations. Not only have I found my new favorite hotel in Vegas, but I think I have found my favorite hotel that I have ever stayed at!

I booked directly via the hotel website and was able to snag a City Room with two queen beds for three nights for $483 which included all taxes and fees. While the City Room is the basic level, it didn't feel basic at all. The best part about our room (5541) was that it had a partial Strip view and overlooked the Bellagio fountains. I don't think there is much that is better than getting ready for a night in Vegas while being able to watch the fountain show.  Overall the room was huge and I imagine if there had only been one bed in the room, it would have felt even bigger. I loved that the bathroom had a separate toilet, so someone could go to the bathroom while another person continued to get ready at the sink and mirror. The shower stall was huge which I appreciated. As a warning, the shower looks out into the room, so if you are sharing a room with someone other than your significant other, make sure to lower the shade! The only negative about the room was that the shower water never got really hot - it got warm and was fine for showering, but as a person who loves a hot shower, it never quite got there.

The whole hotel is sparkly, glitzy, classy, and...well, cosmopolitan. There is a lot of crystals and bling, but it's done in such a modern and beautiful way that is comes across as classy, not cheap or gaudy. There are a ton of bars to sip drinks at with the best one being the multi-level and beautiful Chandelier Bar. Our bartender on Saturday night at Chandelier Bar was really friendly, fast, and chatted with us despite it being pretty busy. This bar\/lounge was quickly added to my ""must visit"" list for Vegas and I will be recommending it to all my friends.

Other little things that I really liked about my stay:

1. It didn't feel like it took forever to walk from one end of the hotel\/casino to the other. In some of the other Vegas Strip properties, I feel like I am walking forever to get anywhere.

2. Great location - it's a quick walk to Crystals and Aria on one side, Bellagio on the other, and Planet Hollywood and the Paris across the street. 

3. Very friendly service - from the front desk to the guys at the taxi stand, every staff member we encountered during our three night stay was incredibly friendly and really seemed to like their job. 

The only real complaint I have was about the elevators - you have to use your room key to access your floor and it took multiple tries on some occasions for it to actually read the card. We heard complaints from fellow elevator passengers about this same issue, including some from people who have stayed at the hotel multiple times since it has opened. Hopefully The Cosmopolitan will fix this issue soon. 

I will definitely be staying here on my next visit to Vegas so I can check out the restaurants, pool, spa, and Marquee.",4,1,1

Pros:

* Great location, center of the strip

* We had a 1 bedroom terrace suite with balcony - the view of the strip was amazing since we had an actual balcony and not just a window view - rare in Vegas. Not only did we have a strip view, we also had a view of the Bellagio Fountains

* Beautiful hotel with gorgeous Chandelier bar and chandelier decor throughout the entire first floor

* As mentioned above, The Wicked Spoon buffet is amazing, many dishes are served small plate style so you're not sharing utensils with the general public (but you are on some things). Just a classier way to do a buffet

* We ate at STK for dinner one night and it too was amazing with great food and interesting drinks

* Fun Boulevard pool w\/Strip View dedicated to lounging and not actual swimming (lol)

Cons:

* Hallways are kind of drab

* If you want a seat at the Boulevard Pool, you have to arrive by 8 or 8:30 am. My hubby got up early to save us two front row lounge chairs on a Sat morning. He did succeed in getting us primo seating, which we occupied until about 2 pm, since he worked hard to get it!

* I needed to call Housekeeping for extra washcloths, and my hubby waited on hold for over 20 min from our hotel room phone for someone to pick up, before I remembered reading a Trip Advisor review that said to call the Front Desk from your cell phone for quicker service. Sure enough, I called the front desk from my cell phone and someone picked up immediately, and I was able to request my washcloths. It then took another 45 minutes for the towels to be delivered, which I feel is unacceptably long given the amount of time we had already waited to request the towels in the first place

* I paid our room deposit a few weeks before our trip on my credit card, which I then closed prior to arriving at the hotel, not ever imagining this would create a problem. The Cosmo requested a current credit card and said they had to put the entire balance on my new card, even though my old card had already been charged & paid for 1 night's deposit. Not only that, The Cosmo then refunded my CLOSED credit card for the 1 night's deposit, which caused me alot of stress trying to call my old credit card company to get a check issued to me several days after the refund should have taken place. I don't see why they had to do this, why couldn't they have just charged the remaining 1 night to my new card?? Why refund my old, closed card and then charge my new card the entire balance? Seems like a waste of energy and resources

Overall this is a young, hip, party hotel. We are early 30's and I felt like our age group was the oldest I saw there. Once in awhile we did see a few older couples, like in their 50's, and they looked out of place at The Cosmo.

Credit card snafu and washcloth wait aside, we had a good time, great food, great drinks, and a beautiful room with an unbeatable view.",0,0,0

First, I suggest calling to make a reservation rather than doing it online.  The reservations staff will inform you of any specials- for example, I got 20% off my room rate because I was a first time guest! I'll take it.  I arrived at the hotel, and the bell boys (er, men) asked if they could take my bags.  I declined their offer, and went to stand in the check-in line.  The wait wasn't too terrible, and the person behind the desk left their station to walk up to us and greet us.  I told the staff 'It's my birthday!' (I blame the champagne from the limo ride over) and he found a better room for me, for no extra charge!  56th floor corner suite, with TWO bathrooms, one with a Japanese soaking tub, with a LARGE balcony (with two loveseats, one on each side) and a more than EPIC view of the Las Vegas strip, including the Bellagio fountains.  I always felt safe, and always saw security guards patrolling the hallways.  The casino and restaurants are beautifully designed.  The staff is professional and friendly.

He was absolutely phenomenal. The check in process this time wasn't as nice as last month. It was rushed, but nevertheless, Alain was so fabulous so I know it will be hard for anyone to top his customer service. In December, we stayed in a studio terrace suite with fountain views. It was a gorgeous room in the West tower. This time, we stayed in a one bedroom terrace suite with fountain views in the East tower. I must say I prefer the studio suite vs the one bedroom. It had a more spacious feel and the bathroom is much larger with double doors. The studio suite had two full bathrooms vs the one bedroom suite with one bath room. The studio suite we stayed in had a much larger terrace than the one bedroom we stayed in. Both rooms were gorgeous. The decor is detailed , bed and pillows were comfy and the views of the Bellagio fountains are breathtaking and well worth the extra charge for the premium views. Both rooms had a Japanese deep soaking bathtub which was fun. The hotel itself has a hip and artsy vibe. Various artists' work is displayed throughout the walls and halls of the hotel and parking garage. To sum it all up, there isn't any other hotel I've stayed at that compares to Cosmopolitan.

Gorgeous property.  Great vibe and energy.  Alas, beauty really is only skin deep.  If you don't want to read this sad tale just skip to the bottom for a few hints on what to do and not to do here. 

To start, they were understandably overbooked.  I get it.  Vegas on a long weekend. My issue is how the management and front desk handled (mishandled) the situation.

The first hint should have been the incredible long wait to check in.  When we finally got to the front of the line we discovered that the wait was long because no one was being told what the problem was.  Be up front!  We finally had to guess.  We were a group with three rooms, two suites and a king.  We were told no suites were available until tomorrow night and that we would need to take a double for the night and move to a suite the following night.  No offer of any compensation. Two drinks when we asked.

Here's the kicker. The king ends up in a gorgeous suite for the entire stay.  The two suites stay in doubles the first night and move into suites the next night, ours being a handicapped suite with an un-stocked mini-bar.  We don't know it's a handicapped suite until we move ourselves...no offer of help.   Again...be upfront!

I'm leaving out lots of details and conflicting stories from the staff but you get the point. 

BTW the mini-bar never did get stocked.

The Cosmopolitan is where you'll find all the young hip beautiful crowds who love the trendy, upscale and glamour of Las Vegas.  You will see lots of girls in mini sparkly skirts and super high heels on every floor of the hotel, especially the third floor where you'll find a hip nightclub, shops and dining.

My favorite place here is the famous Chandelier Bar, where you'll find gorgeous bartenders, hip live music and blingy decor that you can only find in Vegas.

Try the Vesper bar for a quick cocktail it's located off the lobby. so upon check-in order up a martini shaken not stirred.

The Wicked Spoon buffet is one of my favorite buffet restaurants on the strip. Here you'll find most anything yummy like an entire macaroni and cheese bar complete with lobster and bacon mixin's!

I went to Vegas with two other girlfriends for a birthday weekend and was not disappointed. It was my first time in Vegas and the Cosmopolitan was definitely the place to stay. It's beautiful, classy, elegant, chic and clean. After walking through several other hotels and even seeing other rooms, the Cosmopolitan hands down had the nicest rooms. This place is a lot more hip and inviting to younger crowds, which I was into.

We stayed in the standard, cheapest room (it was about $200 per night for 2 double beds) and it was HUGE. Twice the size of the standard room I saw at the Bellagio. The beds were like clouds, incredible pillows, clean comfy robes, fluffy towels. My only complaint about the room was the shower had a floor to ceiling window facing into the bedroom, and the blinds\/curtain was on the outside, so whoever was in the room could look into the shower whenever they wanted. Kind of weird. The bathroom was very spacious and the shower was soo relaxing. 

Being a guest of the hotel gets you two free entries into the Marquee (don't know if this applies to males). They told us that's only guaranteed if you arrive before 11pm, but we showed up at like 1am both nights and got in no problem. In fact, we didn't even have to pay for our third guest the second night we went to Marquee.

I did have a bit of trouble with the airport shuttle. I called ahead to reserve a spot, which the lady on the other end of the phone told me was confirmed. She said it would arrive at 4:30, and if it wasn't there by 4:35 to give her a call back. I called and waited on hold for almost 10 minutes. By 4:48 the shuttle hadn't shown up, so I started walking inside to go to passenger pick up and wait for my friends who were almost to LV. 2 minutes later the lady calls me back saying the shuttle is almost there and can she have my payment info. I told her I had waited 15 minutes longer than I wanted to wait and wouldn't be needing their services. But will for sure be staying here again when I visit next!",0,0,0

The highs...The cool modern decor.  The free shows at the Book and Stage.  The Chandelier bar.

The lows...The inconsistent service, bordering on rude. The lack of focus on the details, I will explain.

We had never stayed at the Cosmo before, we had only gambled there a couple times.  We go to Vegas a lot (maybe every 2 to 3 months and pretty much always have free rooms at the Palazzo\/Venetian since we are Platinum grazie members.  Yes, I gamble way too much  ; )

We got an offer from the Cosmopolitan to stay free for a couple nights and while I felt like I was cheating on the Palazzo I gave them a try.  I really loved the feel there and it definitely extends up to their rooms.  We had a great room with a terrace overlooking the strip.  The room was on par with the level of the Palazzo\/Venetian and we enjoyed all the cool features.

Were they go wrong is with some of their staff and the details through the hotel.  To start some of the cocktail service staff was just inconsistent and seemed really not to care to make the customer happy.  While I'm throwing my money away on their slots, that never payed off, I at least want a drink without an attitude.  I always felt I was inconveniencing them when I asked for a drink.  Now maybe they were still tired from the late night stripper gig, but not my problem.

The other miss was it seemed they were often not properly staffed.  From some of the restaurants to the bathroom conditions on the main floor of the casino.  I would expect more from a top level hotel in LV, especially with all the competition to get my gambling dollars.

Now the sad thing is I got an another offer for a couple nights and $150 in slot credit and I'm not sure if I'm going to use it. I'm probably back to to my old faithful. Flings are usually just that...may be exciting at the beginning but when digging into the details is when you realize it is not meant to be. Also, the $500 in slot credit from the Palazzo helped twist my arm. : )

If you are there for a night at the club, drinks at a bar, or even some of the restaurants you will have a great time but staying for multiple days may expose some of their holes.",9,8,5

Well beautiful it is, but considering how new the place is, the cleanliness is a big factor. We checked in on a friday night and upon arrival on which we upgraded to a balcony room, i step onto the balcony and there is garbage on it, clearly was not even looked over during cleaning, which makes me wonder what else was looked over. There was old food in the refrigerator, and the room was a little dusty. I was willing to overlook all of that, but then saturday we went down to the pool, left the room at 9:30 and returned at 5:30 and the room had not been touched despite the ""please service our room"" tag on the outside of the door. There were many little details that the hotel should try and straighten up, it's those little things that make a big difference. I did like the hotel overall and would be willing to give it another shot, maybe they were short staffed, but cleanliness was a major issue.",1,0,0

This hotel is in the perfect location, directly in the middle of the strip. On either side you have shopping and a verity of restaurants. We have tried multiple rooms at the Cosmo but have been most impressed with the Wraparound Terrence.

While parking is almost never a problem in Vegas, I found the Cosmo parking garage to be quite nice. Spaces are marked with individual lights depicting whether the spot that you covet is empty or full. This is a true win in my book. Get in, get your spot, and get on your way. 

After a walk from the garage into the main hotel lobby, you continue your journey to your room. (For me, the Terrace Sweet)...  Your senses are given a show when you arrive to check into this interesting place. Images flitter across the walls providing you with distraction while waiting  to get your keys. Employees are nice and well put together. 

As you finally arrive to your room (a walk not as far as some hotels - such as the MGM Grand), you are greeted with personalization on the TV and telephone. 
Crisp white and cobalt-colored linens adorn the comfortable beds. 

There is a small kitchenette with a convenient sink for your stay. Adjacent is a cozy living space with couch and table covered in beautiful art books. This didn't thrill my husband as much as myself. What a great touch! 

Each detail of this room was well-though through, even down to the wallpaper inside of the closet. If you are a Fornasetti fan, then you'll love the famous Fornasetti Plate wallpaper hidden within the closet. 

The restrooms have a beautiful iridescent tile on the shower walls. The mirror is large enough to prepare to look your best for the day. 

The private terrace is my favorite aspect of the room. This is a rare treat in Vegas. Your room comes with a lovely view, normally, and this is a great place to spend the sunrise or sunset- if you want to take time to enjoy these types of things while in the Sin City. I had the lower-tier view of the Henderson side of the building, but love this view, so I was thrilled.

Other highlights:

Secret Pizza - Simply the best pizza around. Maybe it's the fact that it's secret? (Well, not really anymore). LOVE IT! 

Marquee Nightclub - Love the different themed rooms here, but the club is quite claustrophobic compared to the larger open-style clubs that are usually seen around town. It definitely make this one unique. .. . but I just don't prefer it.  I do, however, LOVE the vast selection of artists that the Cosmo brings in to play\/mix here. 

Artist in residency - Some of the best artists show off their work for YOU to see. 

The Henry - Not bad at all. I like to people watch here if I can get a good seat. 

 In nearby Aria - Jean Philippe Patisserie - LOVE the macarons. 
 In nearby Mandarin Oriental - Mozen Bistro - EVEN BREAKFAST is amazing here. 

So - highlights in summary - Fresh view, delicious food, comfortable stay.",4,0,1

The Cosmopolitan was a good choice. We got a large two bedroom city suite which accommodated us nicely. That sense of relief when arriving and getting past the inbound travel. We were all too excited to begin party mode after checking in, which wasn't a bad experience. Even though the lobby was packed, the line moved at a reasonable pace and the front desk was well staffed with friendly associates to help us out. Refreshing citrus water dispenser nearby too.

After getting room keycards and deciding who was the least irresponsible to carry them, we made our way through the promenade, over to the elevators, and towards our room. Take photo of room number...just in case. It's quite the hike to the very end of the hallway, and as the doors push open we hear the choir of angels. More like the grunts and groans of cavemen, knocking luggage from the cart, staking their claim on bed space, opening every door to everything, and pushing buttons to see what works. Hey guys, the curtains open and close like magic! Neato! There's a TV in both bathrooms! Please lock the mini-bar this time. We don't want to pay the market price of freshly harvested Beluga caviar that just arrived from the Caspian Sea because your buddy opened a half-can of Pringles.

The rooms are really nice and I was put on the 62nd floor (which is fake and maybe about 35 floors up).

The next day, it was more of the same with no on staff stopping outside boombox from playing.  The rooms and the views are magnificent. The food at the Grill and Sushi restaurant were amazing.  This housekeeping staff were the nicest of all the staff.   This place looks like it should be 5 star but the service at the front desk and pool area are more like a two star.

Located in the center of it all. Parking is a breeze with lights that help guide you to open spaces (brilliant). Fun & interesting decor. Bars, lounges, restaurants & shopping galore.

Shame, shame, shame on the Cosmopolitan Hotel Las Vegas and United Airlines  for promoting a scam. On the recent March 15, 2015 morning flight from Houston to Las Vegas, United promoted the Cosmopolitan Hotel by passing out scam coupons on the flight for the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Upon our arrival in Las Vegas, 6 of the 8 golfer's golf bags did not arrive in LV. Then, we had to wait 3 hours for the next Houston flight to get our golf bags delivered. We thought we would take advantage of the 2 for 1 Brunch Buffet coupon at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. I was in Las Vegas in December 2014 and the dinner buffet was $20 per person, so a brunch buffet coupon sounded like a good deal for 2 people. To our surprise the Buffet cost $35\/person and we were charged an extra $15 gratuity charge because we were a group of 8 guys (that is an extra ""43% gratuity and tax"" for a self-service buffet). So that was a total charge was $50.44 for 2 people. The Buffet was very disappointing, i.e. no fresh seafood of any kind, no shrimp, no crabs claws. The only seafood were oriental shrimp balls that were disgusting. In December, 2014, the Cosmopolitan Buffet dinner was $20\/person and it included lots of fresh seafood. Therefore, 8 guys paid $25\/person for a substandard buffet (Golden Corral's buffet is better that the Cosmopolitan) or a total of $201.76 for a bait and switch scam buffet promoted by United and provided by the substandard Brunch Buffet at the Cosmopolitan Hotel.

Not surprisingly, not disappointed. This place has everything and you really would never have to leave if you didn't want to. Plenty of restaurants, casino action, and even shopping located within this small metropolis. 

I didn't try all of the restaurants but am a regular at the secret pizza place and can't recommend it enough. Also tried China Poblano. I wrote separate reviews on each so I'll limit this to the Cosmo as a whole. 

Check in was fast at about 11:00 am on a Sunday morning. A server was walking around those in line offering chilled water. A nice touch. 

I had read some reviews about up-sells at the front desk when you check in, attempts to get you to pay for an upgrade to a better room. I also experienced one of these. But it was very tastefully done, not like a used car sales pitch at all. It went something like this...

So being 11 am, I was told my ""basic"" room was not ready. But if I wanted to pay $40 for an upgrade to a nicer, much larger room which contained a balcony, why sir, your room would be ready right now. 

Okay come on. We both know there is a basic room ready right now as well. I place the odds at about 90%. But okay. You win. I know you won't give me the basic room so my choices are: (1) wait several hours for the basic room to be ready, check my luggage, tip them folks, then lock an item I'm carrying in the safety deposit box, fill out that paper work, then have to come back and get it later, etc. Or (2) Drop the $40 and be done with it. 

Since I wasn't paying for this room anyway, I chose option 2. But honestly, it's games like these I don't like.

The room was immaculate (see a few photos I posted). Way more space than I needed and a very generous balcony in terms of square footage. You could actually stretch out there and even pace around if you wanted to (although you might look a bit strange pacing out there). It's private too. You can't see the other guests on their balconies. Very well placed. 

The bathroom is huge and the toilet area is sequestered off behind a door, which could be useful if you are not traveling alone like I was. Climate control in the room was perfect (I like it cold and could get it nice and frosty). 

Elevators are fast and kind of entertaining inside. Low lighting, digital ads, music, lights, etc. Hey if you have to ride in an elevator, it might as well be entertaining, right? 

Every staff member with whom I came into contact was friendly, helpful, and professional. Even though the place can be crowded, I never felt lost in that crowd. But to give you an idea of how happening this place is, I got up at 5:30 am on Monday (being on east coast time) and walked downstairs only to find the place was mobbed - mostly with the rave convention crowd which had not even gone to bed yet. 

Youth. It truly is wasted on the young. 

I silently thanked myself for being 41 and having gone to bed early the night before. I was refreshed and hung out at the Book and Stage area, which is very laid back. At night the B&S even has live music. 

I would not recommend Cosmo if you're traveling with kids. A party atmosphere permeates throughout and I don't recall seeing any kids or families during my entire stay. 

So all in all, I love the Cosmo. It can get packed and the restaurants are hit or miss. But I think everyone should stay here at least once to check it out.",3,1,1

Let's keep on being honest..I did it for the view. 

Check-in was the best. Sadly enough I did not get the young girls name but if management is reading this, she's the one who can probably type the fastest and she used to work for the Wynn. She was super cool about explaining everything to us, although we got there 40 minutes or so before check-in time she was willing to give us a room, but we preferred to wait for one with a higher floor. Accommodating to the fullest.

We received an east tower room on the 35th floor, just a tip, IF YOU STAY IN THE EAST TOWER, self park. Enter through Las Vegas Blvd. and find yourself a spot, trust me, valet is not worth the Harmon Ave. hassle. 

THE ROOM: Exactly what I had seen in pictures, spacious, cool features that really made this room new generation Vegas. Cleanliness was top tier. The bathroom was nice, but unfortunately the tub was jetless, what a disgrace. 

THE CASINO and hotel itself is luxury. Everybody loves the chandelier. The restaurants available range from pizza to steakhouses. They have a sports book, which doubled my cash with a Bengals win. It's a nice one. 

So you must be thinking, my review has all the makings of a 4 or a 5, but why a 3?

Well, personally after the check-in, I just felt like 1 out of the thousands of guests at this hotel. Maybe because I was right? But just the atmosphere overall of the hotel felt like a perfect music video idea for Mad World by Gary Jules. Service after the front desk was lacking genuine attentiveness. For a room with a price tag of 300+ a night on a weekend, you'd expect a little more. Guest services needs a bolstering, something as simple as asking for a plastic laundry bag couldn't be met? Instead I got 3 ice bucket bags? The dryness to the service overall of the bellman, valet and as previously mentioned guest services was obvious to me.

Do I recommend a stay here? Yes if you're looking for the best balcony view on the strip and\/or if you aren't as picky as me about how a hotel should make their guests feel. But as for me, for my next few visits in Vegas I'll be sticking to more boutique like hotels that can treat you like individuals rather than groupings of people. The hotels foundation is incredible though and I will give it another shot for my 30th birthday or something.",11,5,4

It's a beautiful property that I find so opulent that it kind of makes me feel like I'm playing dress up at a grown up party, but I love it.  And then the miraculous happened, Cosmo sent me an offer for two free nights?  Shut the Front Door!  I immediately booked it.

I knew that I might be setting myself up for disappointment with my high expectations, but I couldn't help it, I was super excited.  

Check in was a breeze.  There was no line and we were able to check in earlier than the 3pm check in because they had rooms available.  We unloaded our luggage at the valet area with the assistance of a bell person.  What was a huge disappointment was that the Cosmopolitan apparently has a rule that you cannot bring your own alcohol or coolers into your room.... what?   That was a new one on me.  We ALWAYS bring a cooler so we can have cold drinks in our room and we always bring some beers with us.  Doesn't everyone?  So, luckily, the bell person was helpful after explaining that rule and we did end up bringing our cooler with us and some drinks.  What was weird is that in the room there is a small kitchenette, including a refrigerator, but of course, it's stocked with items for purchase.  HATE THAT.  Also, there was a dishwasher in the kitchenette, but nothing to wash in it except a couple of glasses with the bar set and there was a sink, but no towels or bar cloths.  Really strange.

The Parking Garage is COOL.  ON each floor you can easily see where vacant parking spots are based on what color the light over the parking spot is.  LOVED IT.  Just be sure you know which tower you're staying in (East or West) so you can park on the right side of the garage!

That said, the room was very nice.  The bathroom was gorgeous and huge and the room had a living room with work area (and the aforementioned kitchenette) and then a bedroom area and they were separated by a low wall.  Of course there was a small balcony, about 10x4.  It was a comfortable room and included robes and slippers - love that.  But, while it was a really nice room and very modern and ""hip"", it really wasn't any more fancy or special than rooms I've stayed in at the Palazzo or the M.  Unfortunately, I ended up being sick for my trip so I was very happy to have a comfy bed and pillows and TWO tvs, one in the living area and one in the bedroom area.

I reallllly loved the bathroom amenities; they provide C.O. Bigelow products in the lavender peppermint scent and I liked all of them!  There is both a HUGE shower that was WONDERFUL and a bathtub with air jets to give you a Jacuzzi type experience.  I used it all!  I loved the bathtub and it was the perfect size and shape for me, but I don't know if it would be as wonderful for a taller person.  For me, HEAVEN!  I wanted to pick up that bathroom and plop it down in my own house!

They have the lighting buttons that allow you to turn everything on or off with one touch, which can be handy and we discovered USB chargers on the television with only regular plugs on the desk. and extra plugs next to each side of the bed, which is appreciated.  With your $25\/night resort fee, you get WiFi in your room

We only dined in one restaurant, The Holstein Burger place, during our visit due to just being busy with other plans and we visited the Vesper Bar, which I really loved.  I was excited to find that due to the ice skating at the Boulevard Pool, they actually had the Hot Tub open up there, so we took advantage of that.  We had been told it would be closed, so that was cool.  It was COLD outside, but still wonderful in the hot water!  That was pretty much the extent of the amenities that we took advantage of during out stay.

Overall, I thought it was a really nice room and I enjoyed my stay there.  I'd love to stay there again, but oops... I didn't get a chance to do any gambling there on this trip, so unlikely I'll get another offer and I'm too cheap to pay the prices for these rooms when I can stay at my timeshare across the street!",2,1,2

We arrived on Saturday at 2 pm and spent about an hour checking in.  Fine, no big deal, it's to be expected.  But I happened to forget a room key at 2 am, and lo and behold, there was another hour long line!

I was in Vegas for my brother-in-law's bachelor party and I was more than ready to throw down money.  I paid $1300 for a 2 bdrm sweet.  I was ecstatic to find that they ran out of those suites and were going to upgrade us to a Penthouse with a butler.  The butler service was great in concept, but the butler did little more than fill up a tub of ice for us and leave.  For the rest of the evening, it was nearly impossible to get ahold of hotel staff.  I don't think that's any fault of their own -- the Cosmo just needs to hire more people; bottom line! The room itself was amazing, no doubt.  It easily slept our relatively large group and came with some outstanding views of the city.  I wouldn't expected no less, however, for the amount of money I put down on a non-holiday weekend. I would expect that on top of the room, however, there would be some perks to staying in the hotel.  For instance, access to the hotel clubs and pools would have been a plus.  But at the Marquee club and at many of the pools at the hotel, the employees make it a point to denote that the Cosmo does not own these facilities and instead contracts out these venues.  This is absolutely ridiculous -- why contract out the two main attractions (pools and clubs) at your own hotel?  The people running these venues had a very snotty attitude as well. 

Everything that could go wrong seemed to go wrong.  It took ages to check out in the morning.  We ordered pizza and it literally took two hours for it to arrive.  We were graced with someone at the concierge desk who tried to remedy the situation -- he actually got us to the front of the line at the buffet downstairs.  Still, keeping 10 guys waiting for 2 hours is unbelievable.  

The casino itself is stuffy and lacks class.  The Chandelier bar is overcrowded and annoying.  And the acclaimed pizza at the Pizzeria on the 3rd floor -- well, I've had better in a high school cafeteria.  All in all, not at all worth the time and effort I put into this reservation.",6,0,0

Upon arrival my wife and I were amazed by the inside of the hotel lobby, pillars of screens that entertained with great visuals as we waited...and waited...and waited. Granted it was labour day weekend, but we were in line for over 30 minutes. There was a girl passing out bottled water to ease the situation but I felt their check-in process was extremely slow (the visuals become less entertaining when you're there long enough to see 2 or 3 cycles of the same thing). 

Finally at our turn to check in we were advised that the room was not ready but ""we can upgrade you to a balcony room for only an extra $100"", I found this odd as we booked through a third party website and upon my many phone calls to the hotel for planning they told me they could not perform any kind of changes to the booking (I guess that rule doesn't apply if you pay extra).  We declined the offer but our clerk was very persistant and actually referred to our current choice as ""not a very nice room"" and started bargaining ""ok 80 dollars per night, alright 40 dollars is the best I can do"". The situation felt really odd  and we insisted to stay with our original choice, after that he wasn't very helpful at all and seemed to rush us out (which made sense as he left the desk and probably went on his break). Immediately we went to guest relations, waited another 10 minutes for a manager and explained the poor service. The manager was great, he apologized, asked the employees name, listened to every word we had to say and then to solve the issue offered us the upgraded room for free. The room was very nice, had an ok view and we were happy that we could finally settle in and enjoy our vacation. 

That night we discovered the TV by the bed and phone didn't work and the tub had an issue with the drain. Also, using the elevator required waiting up to 15 to 20 minutes so we once tried the stairwell...15 floors down with my wife in heels, this was our only choice other than wait the night away for the elevator or stay in our room for the night. Oh, I forgot to mention that the stairwell was filthy with GARBAGE! We actually ran into a staff member with whom we tried to explain the issue to but they just murmured ""oh dear"" and walked off. A great moment, I think I actually enjoyed sitting on the plane to Vegas for 2 hours more so.

That night around 10pm, I called the front desk and asked to change rooms but the manager on site said she couldn't do anything until the next morning, she was not even able to request someone to call me when possible which I felt was ridiculous. Eventually she had found a loop hole in their policy and she was able to have someone call me in ""regards to a rebooking"" the next morning. 

So, finally the next day after receiving a phone call and waiting another 30 minutes, two managers arrived, upgraded us to a room with probably the best view in the hotel  (over looking the Bellagio Fountains that we could watch all day). I quickly checked every electronic device, light fixture and toilet before the managers left as I didn't want to play this game any longer. Everything worked, I was very please but shouldn't everything work in all the rooms anyway?  I got to thinking that the first ""free"" upgrade to smooth over the front desk clerk issue earlier was to the room with the most problems which explained why it was ready for us so quickly, we got the lemon that no one else would take. They made sure we were happy before leaving by gifting us a $100 gift card that could be used in the hotel and insuring we could get into the Marquee Club as VIP with no waiting in line. Nice gestures but the issues we had pretty much messed up two days of our 4 day visit.

The hotel itself is very nice, attracts a younger crowd (too many things to see that will get us married folk in trouble) and has a great location. I have a review up for the buffet ""The Wicked Spoon"" if you are interested (under my profile). 

I'm hoping all of the trouble was just due to the place being over booked but the service was really up and down for the most part. I would come back again but preferably during the slower season. 

TIPs:

-Sign up for the Identity membership and you will get a $5 credit per member to use on the slots (my wife won 40 bucks!)

-Buy the 24 hour transit pass for $7 it is worth it and there is a stop just outside the hotel where you can get the passes.

-TicketsTonight Stands don't always give the best deal, do your research if you want to save",3,1,1

The problem was: It IS a pretentious nightmare of douchebag hipsters. Douchebag trust-fund hipsters, to be precise. What we had enjoyed briefly, thinking for some reason that everyone was in on the irony, was quickly revealed to be entirely literal. The simplest way to describe it: Bellagio is old money. Cosmo is new money. 

The Marquee Day Club is modeled after South Beach clubs, with beds and bottle service and fake boobs perched on anorexic ribs and tanning bed tans and life-of-leisure abs. The ""attitude"" is as thick as the Pour Homme. Basically, douchebag mating grounds. 

Our wrap-around terrace suite was absolutely lovely (1887) with a commanding view of the Strip and the Bellagio fountains. Yet little things were...off. The towels were rough. The washcloths worn. There was no trashcan in the kitchen, nor a coffee maker. The bedroom phone cord had been ripped out. The robes were cuddly soft, though. 

My husband was genuinely freaked out by the uber-attitude, to the point where I think he was actually spoiling for a fight (you can take the boy outta da Bronx....). I reminded him that we were in THEIR world, that it was WE who had to adapt or die, that they were all behaving in exactly the appropriate manner for who they are. Please, thank you, excuse me...all as foreign to them as thrift stores and coupons.

Next year? Back to Bellagio, where pretention is the frosting on a classy, moist cake, not the acai berry in the small-batch vodka of the month cocktail.",14,10,12

The room was amazing, 2 full baths, living room, dining room, little kitchenette area, full size fridge and the mini bars was not mini....close to full sized bottles lol, a HUGE master bedroom and a full length outdoor furnished balcony overlooking the fountains at the Bellagio with sliding glass entrance doors from either our living room or master bedroom. It was an amazing room. There are 3 pools on property but one of them was closed this weekend, we spent some time at the Bamboo pool which is the most relaxing pool, if you want to party hit up the Marquee pool. The casino at the Cosmo is very nice too, a little bit of everything and you can usually find room at a table even at busier peak gaming times. Cosmo is no bargain basement casino so if you are looking for $5-$10 tables this is not the place for you, lowest I saw was $25 tables, at least at the times I was playing. Hotel amenities are nice, there are lots of different bars, clubs and dining options right on property, also a few nice shopping options.

I'm closer to 40 than 30, so we were looking to have ""grown-up fun,"" as opposed to the usual Vegas shenanigans. (though it looks like those can be found EVERYWHERE). We've also stayed all over the Strip- from the Four Seasons  and Wynn to the Luxor and MGM Grand, so were excited to try something new and upscale.

We had a Studio room with a fountain view that overlooked the Bellagio fountain and the Strip and it was amazing. The room was great-- the perfect size- and we liked the open floorplan. The decor is lovely and we felt very at home and comfortable for the three days we spent there. Definitely book a room on a higher floor-- we were on 33 and I think I wouldn't want to be lower than 27ish for the view we had.

The check-in\/out\/front desk\/concierge staff were all great-- as were our waiters in all of the restos where we dined. Everyone was VERY attentive and it seemed like that was a priority throughout the resort, sans the doormen- of which I actually never saw one (maybe they dont have??)

We got drinks at the Chandelier bar, which is fun and a very cool, unique idea. The casino is actually pretty small, but it was fun and much nicer than the places that seem to go on forever. They have interesting art to look at and the LED screen pillars in the lobby are a very cool touch.

We had an AMAZING dinner at Scarpetta. The food and wine were delicious and the service was impeccable. I LOVED our waiter!! We had a table for two right in the window facing the same Bellagio fountain-- I couldn't have asked for a better birthday dinner. I will definitely go back the next time we visit LV.

We grabbed a quick lunch at the hidden pizza place one day-- and it was DELISH. there was a long line out the door and no sign marking the place-- and you could see why. it's a definite must for anyone staying at the hotel... We had lunch at Holstein's the following day- which was a good place to go if you want upscale diner food. I'm a Veggie, so the burgers (which are apparently pretty good)- were wasted on me- but my onion rings and milkshake were quite tasty. :)

We spent one afternoon at the Spa and Hammam. I visit spas around the world and consider myself an aficionado of sorts, so was a bit surprised that I was disappointed with this one in the end. The decor is ok and the staff mixed-- the girls in the locker room couldn't have cared less as it related to ""service"" and jammed everyone visiting the spa into one area of the locker room so we were all on top of one another. My husband and I BOTH noted that they also should have a clock or two in the spa, so you know how much time you have before your treatment appointment. I was also given the wrong size shoes and robe and it was also VERY messy-- there were open\/used lockers and towels dropped on the floor or draped on doors in every corner, as well as an overflowing wastebasket of water bottles in the jacuzzi area. kind of gross...  we got a couples treatment in the Hammam, which was actually beautiful inside. the room itself felt very natural and modern at the same time and the heated stone is VERY cool. Our treatment (Red Flower Hammam Experience or something like that) wasn't at all what I expected from the written or verbal description I received (a bit lack-lustre) and IF we were to go back (which I probably wouldn't)- I'd opt for a massage with an add on scrub instead. I hate leaving disappointed and not relaxed-- especially after dropping $700 in about 2 hours- but hey, it was an experience and you have to try to know.

the only other fault we found with our otherwise delightful Cosmo experience is the ""dog-friendliness"" of the hotel. As all of their commercials feature Great Danes (and other animals), we assumed it was a dog friendly hotel. It turns out it is- if your dog weighs less than 20lbs. Ours is about 10lbs, so it was fine (though I still think it's weird they show giant dogs in the elevator in those spots!)-- but the hotel ISN'T really dog-FRIENDLY. The Four Seasons and W chains offer in-room services and even menus for dogs-- they have dog beds, bowls, toys and leashes waiting in your room when you arrive or send them up- and offer pet-sitting and special treats, etc.-- but there was NOTHING at the Cosmo. As its Vegas, and there's nowhere to really TAKE your dog ""outside""- they do have a dog run-- it's about 3ft wide and 10ft long. With as much real-estate that this place has dedicated to everything, we were REALLY surprised that they didn't have a grassy area where guests could sit and play with their dogs-- even a 12x12ft space would do, considering the dog size restrictions. Actually-- it would be GENIUS if they had a place that was a dog store, daycare, grooming and ""park"" area, as people pay big bucks for these services and I'm sure clients and locals alike would LOVE it.

Anyway-- that's my novel of a review on our stay at the Cosmopolitan... all in all, I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10.",3,1,2

I'm only leaving one star because I can't leave zero. The only positive about this hotel are the rooms, while beautiful and spacious (mind you, you get what you pay for), there was not enough redeeming factors to make our stay better.
 We walked into a foyer filled with noisy, bratty 21yo's clearly there on daddy's trust fund money and strutting around like they own the place (most did not even stay there). Our bags were taken at check-in, and even the staff that checked us in were quite pretentious at this stage. After traveling for half of the day and wanting to make the most of our afternoon and just go out and eat, our bags took over an hour and a half to arrive to our room. We had to call twice to find out where they were. That was day 1. 
Day 2 we walked out to the elevator area to see the pool area on fire - although this can't be helped, and was purely accidental, the staff were more interested in watching and taking videos of the fire from our floor than to give us some reassurance that we didn't need to evacuate. Later that day we had to fight through the mass of hotel guests who were expressing their anger about the inconvenience. Most of the staff at this stage were begrudgingly offering discounts etc to the guests who had issues with this. At this time we were asking for minibar charges of over $90 to be removed from our bill because we tried to use the fridge. When I called initially to tell them about this, I was rudely told ""the fridge is not for personal use"" and it was $25 to get the minibar removed. 
The worst we experienced was Brad at the Marquee day club, who first refused to accept our travel card because of ""hotel policy"" that had nothing to do with him, and then later did not seem to care when we asked him about WiFi availability for hotel guests, stating ""I don't know, go and ask a bussy"". The moment I was disgusted was when we asked the other hostess to move us (which she did), and shortly after, Brad walked past with two other customers and shook his head, glared in annoyance and pointed at us because we had moved to a shadier spot (it was over 100° this day!!). 
The only thing that helped this situation was Daniela who checked us out and was the ONLY person in the hotel that we dealt with who cared, showed some compassion and understanding in our frustration and did her job as employed in the SERVICE INDUSTRY to ensure hotel standards were met.

The 36th floor suite in the west tower was very nicely appointed, clean and spacious. Fountain\/strip view (see pics) was second to none. I would like it to be better lit though; it seemed dark at times even with all the lights on. Check out was easy on the TV.

The room and meeting wifi had good coverage and provided decent speeds. The gym (included in resort fee) was great, but only had a smith machine and dumbbells up to 80lbs.

For examples, the casino is smaller with off-beat limits. During NBA Conference Finals, the sportsbook was giving away 1 drink ticket per $300 bet. A bit unreasonable if you ask me!

We put the concierge to the test upon our arrival as one of my trips was on Valentine's Day and we arrived without dinner plans. The concierge successfully booked us tickets to Zumanity and reservations for Scarpetta without any problems and we had a fabulous evening. 

What about the rooms you ask? Awesome. We were upgraded to one of the rooms with a kitchen and balcony with a view of the strip. They even have corner rooms available with views of the Bellagio fountains. Definitely the trendiest new hotel on the strip in my opinion.

The casino is huge, in true Vegas fashion.  It seems geared at drawing in the 20 something party girls, which naturally draw in men of all ages.  I was impressed at how beautifully the place was decorated.  It reminded me of Mad Men, but not so dated.  They have a giant shoe on the floor, where you will find girls in little outfits taking pictures.  One day, I'm going to have to fortune of watching one of those inebriated girls fall out of the shoe, and I will laugh.

If only they had a poker room, but I'm not holding my breath.  They have a business model and it is working.  They have plenty of table games, and well, as I said, I'm good with table games too.  Besides, when it's poker I want, I can run next door to the Aria.",1,0,0

Yeah, the commercial is pretty accurate.  To my dismay, there were no puppies and kittens in any of the elevators.  I checked them all.  Everything else is on point.  I've never felt like such a rock star.  Affordable and swanky.  Unique and yet something for everyone.  I don't think I will every want to stay anywhere else when I come to Vegas.

This hotel did it right.  Located in the middle of the strip, it is a perfect place to stay. Every little detail in the design from the taxi shuttle to the bathrooms is awe-inspiring.

I knew when I walked up and the stone gargoyles outside the main entrance had lipstick kiss marks on them, we had made the right choice.  Entering the lobby, there are floor to ceiling pillars animated with changing graphics.  So cool.  Check-in is very personal and at the desk we were offered an upgrade for a discounted price on our room.  Thirty ninth floor ""view room"".  I could have stared off our balcony for hours.  The view was amazing.  Our balcony faced the Bellagio's fountain.  Our pictures almost look like postcards.  

Walking around and checking out the restaurants and bars made me wish we had more time there.  We stopped by the The Chandelier Bar, which is 2 floors with a giant cascading chandelier going through and around the entire bar.  We saw a live act- The Leftover Cuties.  Went to Book and Stage and got a crafted cocktail.  Bond bar is so intense with LED's, lights and music it's vibe is electric 24\/7.  You just have to explore it all and take it all in.   Amazing artwork everywhere and shops you can empty your wallet in.  Great restaurants and buffet. I didn't visit the pool since it was still a bit cold the time of year we stayed, but they have concerts by the pool!!  Concerts. By. The. Pool!  I want to make a visit just to see Florence and the Machine here in a few months.  Speaking of the music, they play the BEST music here!  Just walking around I heard all of my favorites coming through the speakers (not popular radio stuff).  I jammed out in the elevators on more than one occasion.     

 Excellent service from everyone on the staff.  The rooms are completely controlled by remote.  You can turn down the air, dim the lights, turn on some Sirius Radio and order room service all from the comfort of your bed.

This is where I diverge from most people, I head straight upstairs to get an a massive goat cheese cheeseburger from Holsteins. Anyways, I've diverged.

The rooms are amazing, I highly recommend the Bellagio-fountain-facing rooms on the upper floors with the massive wrap around patios. I was there last on the 4th of July so it was great to watch the fireworks show as the fountains were going off.

Loved our room!
Stayed in the Terrace Studio
View was great - across from PH and Marquee
Try to get the East Tower - best tower because of the location especially since Marquee was just steps away from our elevator.
Easy access to their cafe for coffee\/tea in the morning
Gym was awesome - treadmills with tvs
Bathroom was big even though i thought it was weird they have a blind to cover the space between the living room. 
Modern, spacious room
Felt like I was living in a condo
You can control anything in your room from your TV - temp, room service, make reservations for dinner and etc!

I am not sure why a lot of people are dissing the customer service because i thought the front clerk was super nice even though his voice was kinda quiet. There was a long line and he just walked up to me and my friend and helped us at the counter.

Plenty of options for late night eats - Pizza place, 24hr cafe and of course Holsteins.

The bars are kinda cool. Bond was fun. Dunno why there was go go dancers because thats Vegas for you!

We stayed in the city room (cheapest), but it was still a very nice room, very modern.

Their amenities in the room were uptodate and very fashionable. 

One side of their shower is actually glass, kinky almost. But who knows, maybe some people like to watch the tv while showering or look out into the strip?

We stayed for 3 nights and the beds were just so comfortable, made me never want to get up. HAha

We also ordered room service one night for their skirt steak quesadilla and crab, spinach, artichoke dip. Both were delicious!! I was surprised at how tasty the dishes were. 

Cosmo also has a player's club called ""identity"". You can collect points everywhere you spend at the cosmo, and you can redeem points for food or your next stay. We ended up saving almost $10 at the buffet because of spendings and gambling. Instant savings for our trip, not bad at all.

When staying here, you rarely have to leave for much... save to get your feel of the strip and of course your taste of Old School Vegas... oh, and to get to Casa Fuente and the Galleria Bar at Caesar's of course... but I digress... 

We had a blast here, enjoyed the food, the gaming, and accommodations... all of the employees were great, save for one girl who was working the Identity booth, when I was getting my folks (who were visiting) their cards... she was pretty rude (read: witch), which threw me off because everyone else here was absolutely kind and happy to offer their help -- even some of the suited execs whom we caught in the elevators by chance.

Swanky. Upscale. Has its quiet nooks and escapes + the service is there.

Vesper, near the entrance is cool, but The Chandelier Bar was the real stunner. It's all schmancy, but the cocktails are about $10-$12, which isn't absolutely horrible for a schmancy joint. The service could be better, but they've got some interesting cocktails and the decor is just - AMAZING.",27,16,23

The property itself is beautiful: starting from the lobby which changes the scene via screens every so often, as well as the vintage yet modern art scaping the halls, to the doghenge, giant heels, etc. There is also this fantastic smell that hits certain part of the hotel. If they sold this scent, I would definitely buy it to put in my room, car, bathroom... it's great! Fat Tuesday in Planet Hollywood, Walgreens for all your alcohol and convenience needs, and a McDonalds, Subway, Panda Express are all very closeby for quick bites to eat.

The service: good. The front desk agents were very helpful and walked out from behind their desk to welcome each guest they were helping in -- not something you see at every hotel. The lady we spoke to was very kind with answering all our questions and in trying to accomodating our requests (such as asking for both of our rooms to be to each other), although we did have to pay an extra fee per night to get a view of the Bellagio fountains as we were booked in the Terrace Suites. This upgrade fee was definitely worth it. Whenever we called for more towels or other items, it did take quite a while for the items to get to the room but I understand it's a large property. Also, phone operators were very knowledgeable and helpful. Only thing I must complain about is that housekeepers come knocking on your door to clean your room early in the morning... 8am? I mean we're in Vegas, where most people are probably hungover in their room each morning. Also, elevators are pretty slow.

The room: we were booked in the Terrace Suites, but upgraded to the City View Terrace Suite. The bathroom is huge... probably the same size as the area the beds were in. What is awkward though is the shower will have you completely exposed so if you are sharing the room, you will need to lock the whole bathroom and everyone's access so they won't see you showering away. There was a living space area, and two TV's that you could ask for a free audio jack to plug your phone in and play music to (perfect if you want to blast music while pregaming.) The beds were so-so, nothing special and weren't the most comfortable in my opinion. The balcony was awesome!! We got to watch the Bellagio fountain show every quarter past the hour from our room, and there is a seat outside where I helped myself to take a nap one afternoon.

Nice property, the opportunity of a balcony looking out to the heart of the strip, and being in the middle of the strip... not bad Cosmo, not bad. Thanks for making my 21st fantastic!",1,1,1

Let me point out, I come to Vegas about once a month, I always give a tip like this at check in, not ""expecting"" anything crazy, but some level of effort. Nothing is ready, no upgrade, nothing. The reason I am writing this is, I didn't even get a THANK YOU. This stuff matters to me.

The room was spacious with everything controlled through the TV including the lights!    The room was clean and we had plenty of towels so perhaps they have worked through some of the issues other Yelpers have noted.

My only complaint is that the Marquee is very, very loud both day and night.

Ice cold to scalding hot water and wildly inconsistent water pressure. 

The room was dingy and grimy upon arrival, but I didn't care as I came here to get married and enjoy myself. Nothing less than losing a limb could put me in a worse mood two hours before I say I do than a bad bathing experience. 

I chose to wait until after my ceremony to address the issues. The hotel manager probably cared more about what the weather was going to be like on this day 17 years in the future than me, a guest in her hotel who was dealing with her operations shortcomings as my very first action as a married man. They first offered to send laborers to work on our plumbing. I didn't pay for a broken room was not the response she was hoping for. Our new assigned room is smaller, in a different area, with a terrible view. At least the shower works.

Four of us booked a room with two double beds for a couple hundred bucks a night.  Sounded like a real deal.

CHECK IN:  When we checked in, they claimed that the reservation was for 1 person and that if we wanted to add three more to the reservation, there would be a $60 surcharge per person, per night.  Uh, no.  We definitely booked the room for four and wouldn't have booked at the Cosmopolitan if it weren't for the quoted rate.

ROOMS:  Spacious and clean, but tiny windows with no view and the bathroom lock didn't work.

DECOR: Guess they're going for some sort of hybrid fin de siecle \/ James Bond thing, but I wasn't really into it.  Felt a little cheesy, with the strings of diamonds and whatnot.

Let me begin by saying how excited my husband and I were for this trip, and especially to stay at The Cosmopolitan - the newest, hottest hotel on the strip. We've stayed at 5 different other 5 star hotels so far in previous visits, but were sure this one looked even better. We've had this trip planned for over a year and met friends out there whom we hadn't seen for just as long. We arrived Thursday night, and were immediately blown away by the lobby. We looked at each other as we stood in line to to check-in, ""Oh yes, this has got to be the nicest hotel built in Vegas yet."" Excitedly we went up to our room in the East tower. I found it cute when the woman who checked us in said, ""I put you guys in the East tower because it looks like you want to have fun."" We rode up to the 22nd floor - headed to room 2288. The 1 bedroom suite was seemingly a dream suite for a 4 night stay in Vegas! Spacious with a jacuzzi overlooking our balcony, and a good sized kitchen area! I took pictures and proudly showed off where we were staying on facebook right away - with the caption ""By far the best rooms in Vegas to stay in - better than Encore even!"" We quickly unpacked all of our things into the drawers of the bathroom, and hung all of our nice clothing. We had already grabbed drinks and snacks from Walgreens across the street, so our little mini fridge was set to go as well. We were settled in nicely, waiting for our friends to arrive from across the country. Now is where the tables turned fast about this place. I opened the door to the toilet (small room that is sectioned off from the bathroom), and had already started to crouch and sit my behind down when there it was - fast and bright copper, about the size of the width of a credit card, was a COCKROACH - right on top of the toilet, crawling on the spare roll that the hotel has wrapped in blue silk. I've never jumped and screamed so fast in my life out of that room, straight onto the couch where my hands met my face in immediate tears. My husband looked at me in horror asking what happened. I told him in panic as I checked my skin over and over for creepy crawlers. He went and checked, (admitted to not believing me when I first said it to him), and came out smiling , ""Wow you're right. And he's a big boy too."" The first thing he did was get a good picture of it too. I screamed at him in more tears, ""It's not funny!! Grab all of our stuff right now! We need to leave!""He told me to calm down and call the front desk. I did just that, and a woman answered. I hurriedly told her what we just found in our room, and her immediate calm response was, ""Oh alright, would you like me to put in an order to maintenance, to have someone come up there and get it for you?"" !!!!! ""Excuse me?!! Get a maintenance guy is your response to this?! YES! & while we pack all of our stuff up, we cannot stay here! What can you do about this ma'am? I am horrified!"" in more tears. ""I'm sorry but we're fully booked, it's a holiday weekend."" I immediately demanded a manager, knowing I'm bound to get some sort of immediate solution and\/or relief from whoever was to pick up the phone next. As a business owner myself, and manager, I would be furious with an employee who took such a coy approach to the disaster unfolding. Jeff, the night manager gets on the phone. I quickly get him up to speed, although I soon realize he was already prepared with what he said next. It was at least 3 minutes before I was put through to him, which felt like an eternity as I'm standing there, scratching my legs, arms and my eyes are scanning every inch of the room. He immediately takes the ""friend"" approach with me and asks if it's ok to call me by my first name. ""Rochelle, what would you like us to do about it? Don't worry, she already put in the order for it to be removed from your room. I don't know how long it will be though, we are very busy. I realize this is an unpleasant thing to find in your room, but I really can't move you anywhere else. We're booked solid, I'm sorry."" In horror, and almost a squeal I said ""JEFF, maybe you didn't hear me correctly, but I FOUND A MASSIVE COCKROACH in my room that I paid a lot of money for!! This is a 5 star hotel that I booked based off of great reviews and reputation. This is not OK, and whether there is an infestation of roaches on this floor or just one, its enough to make my skin crawl and feel absolutely filthy and paranoid obviously. I cannot stay here, especially not in this room or floor for that matter. Put yourself in my shoes! "" Manager Jeff continues, ""I understand they're not a fun bug to look at, but I can assure you the whole time I've worked here no ones found one. They're like the moths that fly in guests' rooms sometimes, sometimes they're there. Nothing you can do but get used to the idea that you might find one from time to time.

- if you want the Bellagio view, it's extra, this is called the ""premier view""

- if you want to use the gym, it's an extra $25 daily fee, not included in their resort fee, as we found out the hard way

-you want internet connection? It starts at an extra $15 per day, also not included in the resort fee as they claimed to be. Also learned the hard way when we checked out.

-if you go to Marquee pool and would like to sit down on one of their pool reclining chairs, be prepared to dish out $200. Yes, that's right. We checked out this pool on a Thursday (no pool day club), the place was dead yet they required you to purchase a minimum of $200 in drinks if you would like to recline yourself in one of their chairs...what a joke.

In conclusion, Vegas is a place you don't go unless you are willing to spend a good amount of $$$.

This is definitely the creme de la creme for Marriott Rewards Points hotels. Yes, folks it's part of the Marriott Rewards ""Autograph Collection"" of hotels.  I think you need like 1 billion points to stay one night.  Kidding aside they have done a superb job with the look and vibe of this newer Vegas resort.

There was an amazing performance in one of the lobby bars from a bada** chick on the drums. I would go back to see her again in a heartbeat!


Now for the Event  -
I felt like a rat in maze trying to find the location for this performance if you can call it that. There were way too many halls, escalators, and elevators to deal with & NO WHERE TO SIT DOWN!!!!!!!  Get real cause I am not paying several thousand dollars for an over-rated table behind some concert barricade. You must be crazy! We already felt bent over paying $180 to see this trick.

With so much hype and anticipation (we heard this guy's music was life changing) leading up to this show I found myself saying this guy better blow the roof off!! 

Note to self: don't wear 5 inch heels ever again. Damn, I wish I could still pull off my raver pants and sneakers. ha ha 

Note to self: always remember to pack slip on flats for a night out in Vegas, especially if you decide to be a slave to fashion. Your feet will thank you.

Note to self: shows in ball rooms SUCK BALLS!! Hands down one of the WORST venues ever and I have been to some pretty sketch places. It just wasn't conducive to a good show. 

Note to self ---it is not a good idea to walk down the strip from Lavo even in comfy shoes to the Cosmo. It's much further than it looks and your mood will not be brighter.  Save your feet and get a cab. 

Sorry - I am no fanboy for the mau5. He may fool the dumbed down masses who think Katy Perry has talent, but not me or my crew. It's sad because I really wanted to like him.

His deep base is bad ass, but not consistent, and churning out disjointed high pitched noise that you can't dance to at 3am --- when the party should be jumping hardcore is a big NO NO!! Save that for experimental small shows not the main event Saturday night of LDW.

We should've gone to Afrojack! :-(

Any DJ that comes to the stage from 2-4am no doubt needs to be slamming the beats. Only hardcore mau5 heads will feel like this show wasn't a letdown. 

Too much dead time, too much warm up DJ, and Paris Hilton gyrating her hasbeen a** on stage - Really??? Need I say more? bleh

That's the best your headliner can do? I mean at least have some professional dancers.

Maybe he is too edgy or futuristic or maybe he is just a fraud in a mask. Only time will tell. All I can say is he certainly is no DJ Monk who was bringing the sound of the underground to the masses long before roadkill hit the stage.

Oh and you can take your $6 dollars for a cup of H20 and shove it!",1,1,0

The parking garage is also one of a kind. With each spot they have a pressurized sensor that either reads red for ""spot taken"" or green for ""available spot"" this makes parking less of a nightmare unlike a lot of garages.
 The Cosmo also has some of the best restaurants in Vegas. CHINA POBLANO by chef José Andrés created especially for Las Vegas showcases his personal take on Chinese and Mexican cuisines. Noodles and tacos come together in a festive, stylish setting. Ive tried the majority of items on the menu but my favorite are the chocolate tacos. amazing. STK is another one of my absolute faves. The bar is the centerpiece for this lively new aged steakhouse. This is a must visit place.
Marquee Day\/Night Club- Vegas's newest hottest club on the strip. 3 stories of awesomeness and different themes for each, there is something for everyone here. The Library (3rd level) is my favorite. with the employees dressed up as librarians and the room rings true to an old fashioned library. 
The Boulevard Pool- Best place in Vegas for concerts. this venue is absolutely stunning with the palm trees and city center as the back ground. Its also pretty cool too because the crowd stands in the pool that s drained out for concerts, and the stage is up close and personal. very intimate setting.
Shopping- you cant forget the shops! DNA2050 is a one stop shop for the ultimate denim fit, style and trend. A boutique offering a unique and contemporary way to shop.
CRSVR Sneaker Boutique-Specializing in limited edition sneakers and men's & women's casually dressed up fashion.

All in all this is an amazing property and its def a must visit!!",20,10,15

So, I decided to spring for the more expensive hotel with the hopes that I would have a 5-star experience.
I was checked in and upon arrival in my room, I promptly found peanuts on the floor. I called guest services and asked if this room really was clean, as the peanuts were obvious. They said housekeeping would immediately come take care of it. After about an hour, housekeeping came and vacuumed up the peanuts. Right as soon as she left, I spotted a condom wrapper sticking out from under the bed. I was disgusted. Look, I know that it is Vegas and lots of things happen in these rooms....but remember, I was paying more because I wanted top service and no evidence left behind of other people's sexual encounters in the room. I immediately contacted Marriott customer care, who said the GM would contact me. Never did.
I checked out yesterday. I left at 4:30am and got my car out of Valet. It was early and I was tired, so I didn't check my car out before leaving. I guess I should have. Once I was about half way home and it was light out, I noticed that the panel underneath the glove box was ripped down, gum was on my passenger side floor mat, and cigarette ashes were in my center console. My car is 6 months old, and I do not smoke. NOBODY is allowed to smoke in my car. Since I had left the property, I just knew that they would not take responsibility for this.
So, with an $800 price tag for three nights, I got a condom wrapper, peanuts, damage to my car, and someone smoking in it. I will be contacting Marriott customer care repeatedly until SOMEONE takes responsibility for this. I took pictures of it all, so we will see.",11,6,2

*sorry long review, need to rant!*

When I first walked in I was consumed by the glamour of the lobby. They have these pillars with led screens continuously changing, which is pretty cool and kills time looking at while waiting in the long check-in line. 

It went downhill after that...
The first room we checked in to, we thought it was small and average. Upon examining closer, the floors were filthy. The house cleaner somehow forgot to vacum and clean the floors in the bathroom. It was soooo nasty, there was so much hair everywhere and not just hair that comes from the head if you know what I mean. 
We called and they quickly switched our room.

Next room; TV didn't work, scale didn't have batteries, and there was this huge white stain on one of the chairs, GROSS! Got the chair switched. When the technician came to fix the TV, he asked how we liked the room, we said ehhh and the first thing he said was ""housekeeping?"" If they know it's a problem then fix it! This hotel cost $15 billion to be built  and they cant afford good housecleaners?!?!

It's beautiful and in a great location, has lots of highly regarded restaurants and shops. Unfortunately I end up having a decent time only about one out of every five times that I'm there and that's in spite of the place and not because of it.

 Take tonight for example; I played at the slots for SEVEN HUNDRED points before I could get a drink. It's a friday night at peak hours, yet there wasn't a waitress to be found. Eventually I asked someone to send a waitress by and when one still didn't come I lucked out by a creepy floor guy corralling one in my direction with what I'd consider lewd behavior (I'm pretty sure he smacked her *behind*).

 Try going to the bar to get a drink instead you say? I have. I've been to the downstairs chandelier bar on almost every visit and god forbid you open a tab at the bar, because waitresses on the floor will close you out and make you reopen with them if you order from the bartender (which is often a necessity). Half the girls that I've seen are in over their head, or so it would seem from the way they charge around the floor. It's not the sort of behavior (or level of service) you would expect from a place like this. 

 I hear that they are having a hard time getting people to gamble here and I can see why. It's a place to come and eat, shop or even stay (I hear the rooms are amazing) but it's not a place to meet friends for a casual drink or gamble (at least in my experience). As a repatriated local I really wanted this place to be more welcoming,  but either my expectations were too high or this place is (as I see it) a Las Vegas stereotype; beautiful but lacking substance.",4,3,1

can't really compare any other hotels in Vegas that can treat you the same way as Cosmo do. 
As soon as you get in to a parking entrance it even has it own smell. 

Definitely should try of the greatest buffets in Vegas at Cosmo (Wicked Spoon) you have a sterling status you'll get once a month 2 for 1 deal. Brunch time is only $30. 

Slot machines aren't really giving much % of winning, so be aware of them unless you are super lucky.

Last trip we stayed in one of the smaller suites and paid extra for the view. Wow is that worth it!

The balconies have little comfy chairs on them, perfect for lounging with your morning coffee!

The suites are adorable. I love the setup of each. I definitely feel fabulous when staying in this hotel. The bathroom is so beautiful, there's windows from the shower\/bathroom into the bedroom, and there's a living room within your room. It's adorable. 

The room service breakfast option is great. It's Vegas so of course it's pricey! But if you're on vacation you've gotta celebrate and spoil yourself a bit. You can fill out a card with all you want for your morning meal, put it on your door before 2am and you get breakfast delivered at the time you choose! They bring in a table with everything and set it up wherever you want, even the balcony if you choose.

Clocks. In a casino. I thought I would never see the day. It's high-end, without being snobby, pretentious or intimidating. Upscale, but generally inclusive. THIS is the type of place The Strip needs, a place that feels like it's for everyone. 

The exterior gives you a very good, but not entirely obvious hint of what you would be getting yourself into once inside. The interior is a sight to behold. Strangely enough, this place reminded me of the Stardust (R.I.P.) to a certain extent. It has the flash and glitz of old Vegas, and yet doesn't forfeit subtlety in the process. 

I really enjoyed browsing the small shopping arcade on the second floor. Thank god they didn't just follow the almost hilariously recycled Gucci and Louis Vuitton format every other new place has used. My favorite store was Crossover, it's not a very expensive store either. 

I also loved all the artwork and statues all throughout the casino. 

I hope this place serves as a sign to all of these entrepreneurs and corporate executives desperately trying to copycat the elegance and sophistication of another place. How about trying something new? 

It will be interesting to see The Strip 20-30 years from now. I'm going to assume that this place retains it's relevancy and becomes a classic whereas the soulless cesspools known as the Wynn and Aria are considered ""old and outdated"" and put up for implosion. I would love to see that.",2,2,3

BED:  very comfy bed.  pillows squishier than I like but looked crisp & clean, which I'll take any day!  Roll away bed - mattress was soft and made squishy noise when I turned on it, not worth $40 a night to me.  I could've easily shared with my friend or slept on the sofa.

KITCHENETTE:  NO coffee maker even with a kitchen area.  Thank goodness there was a corkscrew because we forgot to pack one (I drove, while my friend flew - from different locales).  I heard if you move anything in the fridge you get charged so we worked around it with our own stash of water\/snacks. Had a microwave and stove\/oven.  No dishes, but you could probably request them if you didn't bring your own.

BATHROOMS: 2 was a big plus - I got my own!  The main bathroom had a soaker tub, huge walk in shower with a seat, separate toilet, & 2 sink vanity.  Hair dryer in that bathroom.  smaller bathroom had a pedestal sink, walk in shower and toilet.  Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion, & soaps were all peppermint lavender scented - very nice.  They also include a toothbrush, mouthwash, and a shower cap - do people still use those?

1 small trash can in each bathroom & 1 small one by the desk.   No large trash can if you did bring your own drinks\/meals\/snacks in the kitchen area.  I never understand no bag in the little trash cans as well, are they sanitized every time?  ewwww....

TERRACE: The balcony view of the Bellagio fountain show was amazing. You can see the strip from the room.  The patio furniture was very heavy, most likely so it doesn't get thrown over, but hard to move to sit closer than the 25' at each end.  And there were 2 - TWO clean ashtrays for smokers to use, however, that didn't stop someone above us from pitching their butt which landed neatly on our terrace.  At first I freaked thinking someone had been there - it could be done, but doubtful. 

ROOM SERVICE:  was expensive but the food was wonderful.  We got the yogurt parfait, oatmeal & coffee.  We could've shared the parfait, it was huge.  The oatmeal could've fed 3 people also.  Our server set everything up & was super super nice.

POOLS: We used the Boulevard Pool because it was the only one that was open.  One is open on weekends, but the other one is closed for the season?  Um its in the 80s in Las Vegas right now.  First day we find the pool & see lots of people on the lounge chairs & lots of empty lounge chairs with towels laid out on them. People must get to the pool at 9am & put towels\/magazines\/books on their lounge chairs then go off until they want to come back.  That is a big pet peeve of mine.  If you aren't in the water or in the pool area, you should not have a towel on a lounger.  But that's the game so wanted to let people know.  Don't expect to go at 11 am & find 2 or more chairs together.  Pool food & drink

RESORT FEE: If you book a package deal, remember the resort fee is separate & is $40 a day.  This includes the standard wifi which says it will cost you $20.  You can upgrade your wifi but it will be $40.  Not sure if that was daily either.  The website did not clarify anything about wifi existence or cost.  Standard wifi was slow in the mornings.

RESTAURANTS: Eggslut was ok, I wouldn't go back.  The Chandelier was amazing.  A cornflake cookie from MILK was too sweet for my friend to continue eating it.

Hotel\/Casino advertises as a chic place but the average Joe goes here.  Was happy to see that many people were in vacation mode, didn't have fancy resort clothing on, weren't models or muscle bound.  There were some buff guys at the pool which was some nice scenery but all shapes, sizes, and ages go here.",0,0,0

Amazing Views and Concerts. Really Great Staff ... except the front desk... stayed here twice now and both times I got into fights with the front desk. They're slow at checking people in and they have attitude and try to upsell you on everything. They treat everyone (well, maybe not super rich or famous people) terribly and act like they're better than you. I almost punched one once. Also, I think some of them are touched in the brain because they don't listen to you when you speak and just keep saying the same thing over and over. All the other staff is GREAT, just not the front desk. The bell desk, room service, maids, valet, concierge, nightclub workers, bar tenders, cocktail waitresses, dealers, chefs, servers, cashiers.... everyone... just not the front desk.
 Rooms (whether free or not) require $150 hold on your credit card for EACH night which is the highest I've ever seen. If your room is free, resort fee is comped, otherwise it's like $20.

We were here for a conference and decided to take advantage of our Marriott Membership (Cosmo is one of their Autograph collection) and got the upgrade to Terrace King Studio with Fountain & Strip views (66th floor) for a few nts.  

LOVES:
-central location - middle of strip
-gorgeous 24hr gyms - there are 2 gyms. full service on west and smaller gym on east tower
-sleek and elegant design 
-ginormous room with bed, living room, and full bath \/ jacuzzi and bench shower
-gorgeous views of fountains, effiel tower, and high roller
-androgynous sexy toiletries (imo!)
-terrace has a large comfy seat for viewing pleasure
-lights can be turned off ALL at once with their lighting system =)
-personal touches - front desk left us a little handwritten note =) and giving me more toiletries because i mentioned once i forgot to bring em. 
-prompt guest services (within 15 min) - they brought me eos cream!
-separate room for toliet w\/ VENT! ha.
-free access to marquee (their nightclub) for guest +1 before 11pm (plus you get to jump the line)
-they have a tennis court!! now why didn't i bring my racket 
-24 hr gym!!! -- so clean and all cardio machines have tvs. well stocked with weights 

COULD BE BETTERs:
-no stove 
-switches stay lit throughout the night ... i like to fall asleep to pitch black.
-elevators are almost too fast, so be careful not to get dizzy
-more dining perks!!! 
-resort fee is $28\/day ... access to gym, wifi , pool, club
-their blackout curtains do almost TOO good of a job ... it was 9A but felt like 5A!
-not on this stay, but we've been to many of Cosmo's dining options and none have really impressed us. too touristy.

TIPS:
-east tower is closer to the strip but not significantly
-stay above the 30th floor as the Bellagio sign blocks your view of the fountains below that
-there is a secret popsicle shop called the Neapolitan at the pool, open to guests only. secret ingredient in posicles is.. alkie. :P 
-once you give them your info, you are in their system... now i get coupons in my email harhar. 
-they have very suggestive books lying around for your  pleasure ;) 
-this room could've easily slept 4 people ... their ""couch"" is ridiculously large and wraps around the living room.

OVERALL ... pleasantly surprised. I thought this place would be too snotty for me, but their attention to detail, your wants and your overall experience truly made me a fan! We shall return. =)",14,3,7

We were celebrating a bachelorette party, and I was very excited to stay at the Cosmo! This was my 4th Vegas trip (stayed twice at the Luxor and once at MGM). 

I can't believe just how insanely expensive this place is. I know Vegas is expensive in general... but dang. No coffee pot in the room. Ok - understandable. But $20 for a pot of coffee - LARGE pot none the less - which filled exactly 4 coffee mugs. What a crock. This place needs a Starbucks. 

Staff was not helpful. Had some items stolen and was given the runaround. Sheets were ripped in the bed. My girlfriend got food poisoning and the security did not take us seriously. Took them over an hour to get a wheelchair and medical assistance to the room. Not acceptable. 

Yes - this is a beautiful, new hotel with a whole lotta swanky goin on. Great view from our room (45th floor) of the Bellagio Fountains. But the staff was awful. I stopped by my friends room to say goodbye before I was headed to the airport and ran into the maids. I said - oh, sorry just stopping in to say goodbye. Their response: ""No one here but the big mess your friends made."" SERIOUSLY? It's not like Axl Rose was staying in the room. 

They have the Marquee Dayclub\/Nightclub (Which I loved) so for convenience, yes, that was great. I just don't see myself dishing out the extra bucks to stay at this place again.",4,1,1

This hotel fell well short of our expectations.  In short, our room wasn't ready when we arrived, items in our room didn't work, the room had been and continued to be poorly cleaned during our stay, and hotel staff was in general not helpful.

Upon arrival, we were informed that they didn't have any rooms available like we reserved and that they didn't know how long it would be before one would be ready.  They tried to up-sell us to another room for $50\/night, but we declined and chose to wait for the room we requested to be cleaned and become available.  They gave us keys and informed us that they would call shortly and let us know what our room number is and that our keys would be automatically activated for that room.  After roughly a 2 hour wait, we received the call that our room was ready, but their system to activate the keys wasn't working so we needed to go back to the front desk to get new keys made.  After getting back to the front desk to get new keys made, another attempt was made by the front desk employee to up-sell us to a different room, this time for $30\/night.  Again we declined.  However, we were able to talk them into putting us in a room on a higher floor than what they had originally assigned us to (originally assigned us to a room on the 30th floor and we ended up with a room on the 61st floor).

At first glance the room was nice, but the longer we stayed there, the more issues we found.  We found an empty beer can in one of the cabinets within the first 30 seconds of entering the room, but yet the maid didn't seem to be able to find it and dispose of it in the 4 days we stayed there.  The mini bar was missing items.  We worried that this would show up on our bill when we checked out.  It did, but the front desk had no issue taking the item off our bill.  The lights in the room can all be controlled via on\/off wall switches or via dimming options through the TV.  It's kind of a neat system except it rarely worked.  After our first night, we were never able to control the lights or any of the other features in the room using the TV.  We were also never able to get the TV in the living room area to come on after the first day.  I suspect the 2 issues were related.  The jacuzzi features in the bath tub didn't work at all.  The maid seemed to come every day we were there, but yet I saw no signs that the room was ever vacuumed while we were there.  The iron in the room had a broken knob on it so you couldn't tell what setting it was on or change the setting.  My other issues with the room get pickier from there so I'll stop.  While this all sounds bad, we didn't stress out about it too much as we really didn't spend that much time in the room to begin with.

The staff at the Cosmopolitan leaves much to be desired as well.  Of the 3 people we had to deal with at the front desk, only 1 was really helpful and pleasant to talk to.  It ended up working out better for us that this didn't happen, but when the front desk called us to tell us our room was ready, they should have also called the bellhop for us to have our bags that we left with them brought up to our room.  Instead, we had to stand in line and deal with the bellhop ourselves.  We rented a car for a day from the Hertz desk inside the hotel.  Upon trying to return the car, no one was working the desk at 11am.  The couple in line in front of us at the Hertz desk waited nearly 35min while hotel staff was dumbfounded as to why someone wasn't working the desk.  We waited about 20min and a couple behind us waited about 10min.  I can't fault the hotel too much for Hertz not doing their job, but the organization and communication among the hotel staff about how to resolve the situation was pathetic.

My girlfriend had ordered a b-day cake from the hotel to be delivered to the room at a specific time and day to surprise me.  This request was confirmed multiple times and the hotel assured her that the cake would be delivered to the room at the time she request.  But, of course, the cake was in fact not delivered at the time she asked for nor anywhere close to the time she asked for.  We don't actually know when it was delivered because we had to leave to make a dinner reservation.  When we returned to the room much later that evening, the cake was sitting there in the room.  No apology or explanation was ever given as to why the cake wasn't delivered when requested.

While there wasn't any one big incident that really made us dislike our stay at the Cosmopolitan, it was the numerous little things that, at the end of our stay, made us look back and wonder if maybe we should have stayed at a different hotel.  I truly expected more from this Hotel.  Do yourself a favor and stay at another hotel.",2,0,2

First of all, its not very big so I don't ever feel lost or too far away from the strip or elevators to my rooms. The table limits are a bit less than what you would find at Bellagio so its a bit easier on the wallet. 
The restaurants in the Cosmo range from pizza slices at Secret Pizza for cheap to your fancy Steak Dinner at STK. There is a tapas place, a burger place and a wonderfully unique buffet in Wicked Spoon. 

Plenty of lounges around and some live music by The Henry (great short ribs Benedict for breakfast) on some nights.

I had the Terrace view room which overlooked city center. My time lapse video from the room here: http:\/\/youtu.be\/CyPkxtlau5E

The room was spacious clean and even had a dish washer. Also in our room was a large shower, jet tub and a huge couch that could easily be another place for someone to sleep. There was even a chair and table outside on the balcony to lounge on.  My only wish is for them to have a poker room, but being how the place is set up, I'm not sure where they could fit on in. Maybe by the Sports book which is already tiny.. but also not crowded so it makes it nice as well :) Yes.. I'm not a huge fan of crowds.",4,0,2

We had a one-bedroom suite (premium view) on the 50th floor of the East Tower.  I would have given this resort 5 stars if we had been informed that the Boulevard Pool would be closed for repairs during our visit.  Better to know ahead than be disappointed.  It was a little chilly, though, so that didn't pose a major problem.  I love the Bellagio pool area, but can't make a comparison because we couldn't even look at the pool.  The Cosmopolitan location is perfect--right between the Bellagio and City Center.  The secret pizza place has the best New York-style pizza.

Overall, loved the room. The one-bedroom suite was beautiful with wrap around walk-out balcony looking out on the strip and Bellagio fountains.  Two bathrooms with the master having a large tub, walk in shower, and two sink areas was perfect.  The furnishings and lighting were what you would expect in a well-appointed suite.  But, the power outlet at the desk did not always work leaving mobile devices and laptops out of juice when you expected them charged. The full kitchen was large enough if you wanted to cook and stay in - but no cooking equipment or dinnerware was available.  Not a big deal on this stay, but if you have a kitchen, make it useful.  Couldn't find the coffee pot, which was a big deal.

Maid service was inconsistent.  Towels weren't always taken away if put in the tub or not restocked.  Toiletries were randomly replaced.  Turn down service was inconsistent.    Trash was inconsistently emptied. (stayed for 4 days).

The room service was excellent.  Quoted 1\/2 hour and they came in 20 minutes.  I ordered something that wasn't on the menu and they easily accommodated me.  When it came, it was delicious.  They also removed the tray the next morning without me having to call down or put it in the hallway. 

Attended a conference and the service was sub-par.  They couldn't keep up with the demand.  Buffets ran out of food and drinks.  Coffee centers weren't replenished quickly.  Napkin and silverware removed when getting dessert and was told they would come back with fresh ones - never happened.  Internet bandwidth couldn't keep up in session rooms and hiccuped during keynotes.  

Tried to use the online check-in service which never worked after several attempts.  Ended up checking in at the desk where the clerk seemed to struggle a bit with the system.  I was also told about how little sleep she got the night before and why.  TMI for this level of hotel.

The Henry is a great restaurant.  The bar was perfect to watch the games and talk with friends.  Breakfast was really good - especially the hashbrowns.  Service in the dining room was a bit slow and they didn't bring butter for the toast, but overall it was a good experience.  Went to several of the restaurants in the mall area and all were excellent - good wine, good food.  But again, service was always a bit lack luster.

Wanted to go to the pool to swim, but it had too much of a dating scene feel and passed.

In general, nice hotel that has the potential to compete with the other luxury hotels on the strip.  But, if you are expecting the high level of service, it is a bit of a miss.",0,0,0

The rooms are definitely appealing. Very spacious and extra amenities than other hotels. Every room has a kitchenette besides the City Room (room with two queen beds) and almost every room has an balcony terrace with an awesome view.

Fun fact: The building (casino\/hotel) was originally constructed for condominiums, permanent residents and so forth.

Everything, including the employees looks way too pretty and the clientele seem to be extra douchey because of it.  It was obvious to me from looking around there for a few seconds that the Cosmopolitan overall values outward appearance over personal, inner character.  

I will be coming here if I'm on the strip for the secret pizza, because it is some of  the best I have ever had, but the policy of only hiring eye candy in the casino itself doesn't sit well with me.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and nothing here is my idea of beautiful.  A great place hires people of all shapes and sizes, a strong work ethic, and a good heart.  I really did not see the heart in this casino, except in the pizza restaurant, where it is obvious a lot of love goes into those heavenly pies.

I stayed in a suite with every luxury you could imagine...a fully stocked bar, beautiful  living room, full Japanese soaking bath tub, luxurious bedding with flat screen TV, awesome toiletries (don't lie, you know you care about this!), a fabulous closet, and an amazing balcony overlooking parts of the strip.

On a general note, this hotel has everything you could ever want. The decor is elegant and retro enough to make you feel truly glamorous. The staff is friendly and helpful. The casinos are wonderful, and the restaurants and shops will leave you with an array of options from casual to decadent. Btw none of their shops are the same cookie cutter ones you find in every other high end hotel in Vegas. They're actually more boutiques than large stores. There is even a new pop up wedding chapel for anyone who wants to make the most of their stay! I can't say enough about this hotel except that I will definitely be staying there again. Go! Enjoy!",5,4,3

I think the hotel had only been open a few months and was not very busy.  We had SO much fun.  The ambiance was cool and the hotel\/resort wasn't full of itself quite yet.  The people that worked there were so nice.  We decided next time around we would love to stay there.  We recently visited again for my hubby's 30th birthday.  

First - the place is SO busy... almost too busy to the point where they haven't figured out how to handle it.  It took an hour to check in ( we were at the front desk by 3pm) and then another hour until our room was ready.  

Upon check in we were asked if we wanted to upgrade our wrap around terrace suite with a view of the bellagio fountains for another $175 a night.  No thanks, no big deal.  Well, after waiting FOREVER for our room and then getting to it, we found that we were staring at a concrete wall on one whole side of our wrapround balcony and on the other side, a parking garage.  We did have an OK view of the bellagio and the palms in the far corner. Anyway, I did not pay $650 a night to stare at a concrete wall.  I called the front desk and complained and they claimed no one has ever complained about this room. WHAT? REALLY? Who builds a wraparound suite (only one level price wise down from their penthouses) that is completely blocked by a concrete wall?  On a high note, we could climb onto the roof from our balcony and actually onto the very top of the hotel.  Liability anyone?  I gave it up and had some drinks and got over it.  I was more angry that they didn't offer a dinner voucher, or something else to make me smile since we paid quite a bit for the room and weren't happy.  I may pursue a little further now that I'm home and look for some sort of refund.  The room was a good size but was nothing super special.  Was more homey & not like a trendy Vegas room.  My hubby is in the civil\/architectural engineering business and can always tell when the cheaper way out has been taken and he was constantly pointing out things that could have been done better.  The bed was really comfy.  I've stayed in cooler rooms at The Hard Rock HRH towers, the Encore & the Palazzo.  

We had a kitchen, but it had absolutely nothing in any of the cabinets.  Not a spoon or a fork to be found.  Luckily I had done grocery delivery and had some cutlery in my order.  I wanted to make cupcakes for a late night snack for my hubby's birthday and I had to use the ice bucket to mix the batter.  

What made me really angry is that there is NO iPhone\/iPod dock.  EVERY other room I've ever stayed at in Vegas has had one (complimentary).  At the cosmo, they make you pay for a special connector... seriously?  They provided Satellite music but I don't feel like listening to the same 20 songs all weekend.  I have Spotify on my phone and had made a dance playlist just for this weekend.  So lame.

The pool was cool. Good drinks, fun ambiance. It was positioned so by the late afternoon when it's the warmest in Vegas, the building completely blocked the sun and so it got pretty cold.  Probably during the summer it will be no biggie, since it's always hot.  There are pool tables and stuff by the pool and a good sized hot tub for the windy day we were there.

I thought the buffet was good, but it was only my second one in Vegas.  The guys we were with were disappointed in it and the selection.  We ate at Holsteins twice and it was yummy... the shakes were to die for.

Overall, it's a nice hotel with really good looking people.  Usually when we stay at a hotel we just kind of camp out there the whole weekend.. at the pool or casino or the clubs.  The casino was OK, the pool was fun, there was no way we were waiting in the 3 hour line to get into Marquee (or paying the 3K for bottle service to avoid the line).  This trip, we were across the street at Planet Hollywood where our friends were staying, at the Wynn\/Encore for the clubs and bars there or at the Bellagio.

I've stayed at Mandalay, theHotel, Hard Rock, Luxor, Encore, the Palazzo, Monte Carlo and now the Cosmpolitan.  I think this is the first time I didn't think I got my money's worth.  Maybe we are old or something, but next time we definitely will be staying at the Wynn or Encore.  The Cosmo is the ""IN"" place but honestly, I don't think it has the staying power.  Give it a couple of years...",2,1,0

We got a suite which cost 900 dollars on their website, but 800 on a third party website so that's where we got it.  I was very clear with their staff that we were having a party.  They came up and were incredibly rude and tried to kick the entire party out.  There was only 15 adults, professionals, over the age of 30 having a good time for a wedding party.  Not teenagers drinking behind our parents backs.  The manager argued with me.  She was rude.  They told us if they had to come back they would kick us out!  The most interested part is the selling point for me with the person on the phone her statement, ""this is the perfect place for a party like yours.  Its a younger group, everyone is partying and its perfect for a party of 20 or so.""  Wow!  All the manager kept saying was, ""if you read the find print... blah, blah, blah.""  Well, I read the fine print and it basically says they can do and say whatever they want regarding anything they want and they can change their minds, policies, etc.  whenever they want.  Don't waste your time reading the fine print.  Don't go there period!  The MGM has a beautiful suite that is much better, the loft. . . THE COSMOPOLITAN IS OVER RATED!",2,2,0

First, the good:
Our room, a one bedroom terrace suite with fountain view, was amazing. The decor was beautiful, the bed incredibly comfortable and the wet room with soaking tub fabulous. The view of the Bellagio fountain was great too. The whole hotel is stunningly decorated and a lot classier than some other places on the strip. You can control numerous items through the TV (eg lights, climate control, restaurant reservations), which is very cool. 

The bad:
Pretty much everything bar the room is extra. Wifi is expensive at $15\/day and if you also want to use the gym it's a further $13\/day. Room service is expensive at $5 delivery plus 18% service PLUS tip to the deliverer. We also struggled to sleep on the Saturday night due to noise from a nightclub (not sure if it was the one in the Cosmo or in Paris).

Overall it's a great place to stay and if we go back to Vegas we will most likely stay at the Cosmo - but do bear in mind the above downsides.",0,0,0

The only reason why this place didn't get 5 stars is because it doesn't serve mainstream alcoholic beverages at the gaming tables!! I mean, I just wanted a beer. A Bud light and they didn't even serve that! Then I asked for a shot of Patron. ""No! Sorry!"" Don Julio? ""Nope!"" I don't know, seems kinda 'wrong"" to me! 

Other than that, this is my new favorite spot in Vegas! Fun, upbeat and tons of stuff to look at! Being a local for more than 17 years, I'd say this spot is what Vegas needed! Food for every palette and shopping for all types of styles! I've eaten at just about every spot here. No complaints!

Live music is a bit annoying at times. It was very distracting to listen to while sitting at the mini-baccarat table. I almost wanted to poke my eye out with the straw in my coffee. Besides the point, the staff was very nice and made me feel welcome. 

Can we talk about the vending machine upstairs? I could get false eyelashes out of this machine!! Make-up! Pantyhose!! Can I say one word? GENIUS!

The location of the hotel, the ambiance and the decor. It's close to city center which is probably about  200ft next to the Cosmopolitan and right across the street is Planet Hollywood. 

The only thing I didn't like about the hotel, which is not the hotels fault, is that when I was there, there were teenagers running through the bar and security just looked at them and did nothing. The second thing I didn't like of course were those resort fees which include internet, paper and an array of things to which I didn't use or even know about. Those are about $22..00 if I remember correctly. So that's a waste right there. 

The thing I liked most about this hotel in comparison to most other hotel rooms on the strip is that it has an actually balcony which is very large. It fit about 7 us comfortably.

Read all of the reviews so went down to the new cosmopolitan hotel and casino. Here are my impressions for what they are worth.

The building and interior are very nice. I had drinks at the chandelier and at bond. Both nice venues with great atmosphere and beautiful settings. The Chandelier is one massive chandelier that goes up 3 levels...nice booths to chill at. Bond is cool in that you can look out onto the strip in really nice booths. Bond has an amazing light show or sorts over the bar I am sure you will see pics featured on here. The only thing I did not like at bond is when I ordered Russian standard vodka over  rocks and they sub it for some swill like stoli and then tell me its russian standard  that ain't cool.(come on guys)

The bad. Hookers working the bars(come on please), security removing three strange looking guys at the chandelier bar. No real place to purchase cigars. Friggin tourists walking through with baby strollers taking pictures as if they are at the zoo.

Oh and valet parking here is amazing: computerized and the folks are friendly...that was nice.

One for my wife and I, and another for our daughter and her friends who are here celebrating her 21st birthday.  As my wife waited to check in, I immediately went down to get a players card.  They were super helpful and let me know that I needed to let them know at check in that I had a players card and to make sure and link the room reservation to my card.  At check in the young lady that checked us in stated that, although we hadn't checked in yet, and although my wife and I have been married for 22 years and obviously share the same last name, and although the fact that we were paying with a joint Amex card, that we couldn't change the name on the reservation from  her first name to my first name and that we would need to go back and get my wife a card.  I explained that my wife doesn't gamble and that we wanted points in my name and she said she, ""sorry, I can't do that.""  When I guest jones the rationale she said, ""I don't know why, but I can't do that sir.  Hotel policy"". We checked in and went back to the players card registration.  I explained the situation and the guy was really helpful.  He said, ""no worries, we will just register your wife, combine the cards together and you'll be set. I'll give you two cards in your wife's name and when you gamble, use her card.""  I asked if that was ok and the response I got was that, ""the points are combined anyway, therefore, even though you technically advance though the levels individually, the points can be combined.""   30 minutes later I sat down at the table, got 2-3 hundred in chips and gave my wife's card.  They registered it, no issues.  At the next table I sat down, cashed in $300 and gave the pit boss my card.  He comes back and says, ""you don't look like a Laurie to me"", and flips the card onto the table.  I explain the situation to which he responds, ""I doubt they told you that"", and walked off. 

There are a lot of choices in Vegas.  We don't come here often but in the past, at the Venetian, Bellagio and Mandalay Bay, we have ALWAYS had 4\/5 star service.  Literally, never a bad experience, until now.  Overall, this isn't a huge deal.  I don't gamble THAT much.  That said, the frustration is that it all started with a ridiculous policy of not being able to change the reservation from my wife's first name to my first name?  That's a policy?  I can CERTAINLY appreciate maybe not allowing unrelated guests to swap reservations or whatever but REALLY?  To add insult to injury the players card group, who were super nice and friendly to deal with, aren't on the same page as the casino.  The pit boss was just rude, but I guess I can appreciate that he probably deals with a bunch of knuckleheads typically.  
As far as the hotel, it's nice, the rooms are clean, etc.  The only other meaningful event was my daughter ordering room service and having it never show up.  Again, not the end of the world but indicative in my mind, of a hotel that doesn't have the customer and the customer experience at the center of its value proposition.  I will say that the Cosmo IS ideally located.  Easy access to shopping, shows, etc. Having said that there are a number of better choices from a customer experience perspective.",4,1,1

I dropped her off in front of the casino and attempted to exit. The arrow for the exit points to the left but there didn't initially appear to be an exit there. It looks as though you'll drive into a wall if you continue. It's a strange set up & my car is extremely low, which sometimes effects my vantage point. Maybe I just wasn't as observant as I should have been but I made a mistake and turned back toward valet which is one way. Yikes! I caught my mistake immediately but couldn't turn around. Two male valet attendants then started shouting at me. Ok, I get that, I was driving in the wrong direction. Then they proceeded to stand in my way and berate me for my mistake in front of several people. I pointed to the arrow and told one of them that it was confusing. He then berated me further, stating the sign is fine...blah blah blah (so much for customer being right). I honestly was embarrassed and really was just looking to turn around and get out of the way. The valet driver then said ""California right?"" This was an attempt to insult many driving because locals complain about Cali drivers. Not smart for a valet attendant to shout out...wonder how many Californians were checking in at the time...area was full of people. So, as a local (not from Cali), I'll probably never patronize the cosmopolitan  again. I would NEVER valet! That incident was unnecessary. This is how easily it could have been..""ma'am, you've turned the wrong way, yes I know it can be confusing. Let me help you turn around, next time go that way...smile and wave."" There was no need to humiliated me, keep my car there longer than necessary & then attempt to insult a huge group of people (Californians) that bring tons of money to our town.

I don't think I had a bad experience with any Cosmo employee I encountered, great customer service. 

The room was gorgeous, 1 bedroom suite, in the east tower, with a large balcony. You could live in this suite full time, its so spacious and upscale, I loved it. Being right on the strip does mean you hear the strip, all. night. long., so we called down and asked if they had a standing fan to drown out some noise. They brought one up right away and boom the noise was gone and I was able to sleep. 

There's tons of restaurants inside the Cosmo, as well as Marquee day\/night club. You really don't ever have to leave the Cosmo during your stay, you'd be be perfectly satisfied, everything that you need\/want is there. They have two different pools, in addition to Marquee, the Boulevard and Bamboo pools. Boulevard is in East Tower I believe, while the Bamboo is in West. I liked both the same but if I had to pick a favorite, I'd choose Bamboo. It was a tad bit more relaxing, however, Boulevard is larger. They have these awesome, complimentary, white chairs that you can lay on in shallow water in the pool. Perfect for tanning :)

I was in town for a concert, demand was slack, and I was able to get one of the corner suites for about $300 if I recall correctly.  It was a very sizable, well appointed suite with great views of the strip from inside and especially from the wrap around deck.  The price was right, and it was fun to try it out.  

It's a nice property with lots of dining, shopping, and nightlife options  

In my opinion, it does tend to draw a crowd that skews somewhat younger and rowdier, and, frankly, douchier, than properties like Wynn, Encore, Palazzo, etc.  Whether that's a pro or a con depends on you and what you're looking for.  

Because of how the property is situated on the strip and because of the dining, shopping, and nightlife options, it tends to draw a lot of foot traffic from the strip and can get crowded at times 

In my opinion, also, it's probably not as posh of a property as plaices like Wynn, Encore, Palazzo, or Bellagio, for example.  Again, whether that's a pro or a con depends on you and what your'e looking for. 

I like the location of the Cosmopolitan.  It's relatively easy to get to from the airport or from the I-15 if you are driving, and its situated close to lots of other properties you might want to check out, such as the other City Center properties and Planet Hollywood, etc., across the street.",1,0,0

We got a hook up through a promoter we know is Los Angeles and he got use the Terrace Suite for $450 for two nights!!!  When we got to the hotel, they asked if we wanted to upgrade to the Wrap Around Suite for $75 more a night.  We did and it was so awesome!  Our room litterally wrapped around the corner of the hotel and we were on the 17th floor.  Our room looked right over the pool and Marquee's outdoor bar.  The music started at like 9pm and was super loud, but you couldn't hear a thing if the door was shut.  The room was huge, 1200 square feet.  It only has one bed, but the couch was soooooo comfortable that my husband and I opted to sleep on it the second night too!  Staying at the hotel will not get you the hook up into Marquee though, maybe just in a different line.  I loved the Chandalier Bar and if you go, get the flower drink!!  Makes your damn face tingle and feels so crazy weird! The drink itself is really sweet though, but worth the $11 just for the flower you eat!  They have some pretty crazy drinks at that bar!  I also love that they chose to decorate the entire place with the theme of shoes :)   Overall a great experience and loved our room!!",1,0,1

Hung out at the bamboo pool all day this past Saturday.  The food was pretty good.  Don't get the shrimp cocktail!  They only give you three shrimps =\/.  I got to try the cuban sandwich.  So delish!

Ordering the drinks at the bar was such a pain.  The bartender was really slow and didn't put enough tequila in my overpriced margarita  :(  Never went back to order from the bar again and ordered drinks from our server.  The grape escape was pretty good.  

The club at the hotel was pretty fun.  I liked how we didn't have to leave the hotel to party...",3,2,2

It doesn't match the quality of the room! No use for a full kitchen tho. The Casino is small. It's a pain using the key in the elevator all the time. The hotel is definitely set up to cater for long term stayers. but the price is set up for weekend warriors. I'm confused. Wait I know the rooms were meant to be sold not rented out. I guess they couldnt sell the condos so they turned into a hotel.  I still prefer MGM or Palazzo and their group,1,0,0

The entrance had grand glass doors and the staff outside was so welcoming. We were greeted by a front desk member who helped and directed us to their autograph lounge. Since we arrived in the morning we were not sure if we would be able to check in, since check in time is 3pm. The autograph lounge was very private, free beverages and the staff was nice. The man helping us somewhat hesitant to go beyond his normal customer service skills to assist us, but with some pressure from my sister he did and we were able to receive accommodations we wanted. Only one of our rooms were ready so we proceeded upstairs. The room had an amazing view of the Bellagio water show; which stinks(I mean it really smells like sewage) but was beautiful to watch at night. The room has two queen beds, which were very comfortable. The bathroom had a big soaking jet tub, very large shower area, two sinks at the vanity and a separate toilet area. The one thing we did notice is that their A\/C system in the rooms seemed to be below standard, we had our a\/c set at high at 65 degrees and still the room remained stuffy, we had to leave the terrace doors open for our whole stay. The bathroom had no ventilation and there was a set of blinds to use as a partition between the room and the bathroom where the tub was located. The mini bar had plenty of snacks and drinks. They had a small refrigerator and freezer, so we were able to keep our drinks cold. When my group was finally able to go into our room, I noticed hair in the tub and on our beds. My sister called to ask for assistance and we ended up with some comps due to the service downstairs and the long wait for our room(we didn't get out room tip after 4 when we were informed we would receive our keys within an hour of check-in and the 4 keys sent to us did not work, so we had to wait for another set of keys) but we were determined to have a great weekend. After our complaints were resolved, we set out to have fun. The decor of the hotel is so beautiful and sexy, but once again their ventilation system was lacking. The casino(I do not gamble, but others in my party did) was bogus, we went to the cromwell and they had lady luck. The Wicked Spoon buffet is a must!! The service is superb and the selection is a mix of various foods and drinks. We stayed at the buffet i believe for almost 2 hours, we had a great time trying different foods, talking and laughing. We went to the Marquee looking for the hip hop room but unfortunately was given the wrong information. The club was really nice, we enjoyed the outside where was the pool, cabanas and bar were located. Once again the water outside had a sewage smell; i smelled in it various locations of Vegas. The food from room service was delicious. My sister encountered some rude staff members when she had some requests, but once again we did not let it ruin our weekend. At the end of our trip I could not find my flip flops and security came to have me file a report and the hotel was going to reimburse me for them, i later found them in our other room and informed them, but i loved their emphasis to resolve all problems. Overall the hotel was nice and it was amazing weekend for all of us girls. OH ONE MORE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE MISSED..THE SECRET PIZZA SHOP ON THE 3RD FLOOR SO DELICIOUS AND PERFECT LATE NIGHT FOOD..and saturday night the restaurant across from the Marquee has a DJ that plays the best music..we ended our night there partying and having an amazing, fun night",0,0,0

Cosmo is like that kid who had parents who got into some money and desperately tried to be cool and fit in with the popular crowd by buying the bells and whistles, but still comes across as trying too hard. 

I don't like the art - most of it, that is. I'm not a fan of contemporary or modern art, so of course, this was for sure not to my liking. I know that they're trying to amass the largest collection of digital art, but frankly, I fail to see what they consider ""art"" to be ""art."" 

They're trying to make this place a hip and ultra sexy place for chic, rich young artists to hang out at, but seriously, those people and their lives are just some fantasy that people who buy jazz cds from Starbucks imagine their lives to be like - they're into ""independent"" art, drinking $20 dry martinis and wearing overpriced designer clothing while driving their hybrid luxury vehicle to their lake home in Martha's Vineyard. Basically, it's like what all the people described on stuffwhitepeoplelike.com want to pretend their lives are like, or will be like once their novel sells. This place caters to a subgroup of people who don't exist in reality. There's a reason they're called ""starving artists"" and that the few who make money, do so after they're dead, or about to die. 

I think the parking garage is cool because it's bright enough to actually see around, like you're driving into a room, rather than a parking garage. The fact that it's still 30*F in the winter, reminds you that you're still just in a parking garage. Oh, and you will walk your butt off trying to get to anything that you're wanting to get to, whether it's the buffet or the club. Signage could be better.

The Cosmo screams ""new money"" and it's trying so hard to be cool, it hurts.",1,4,2

My best-friend and I stayed in the Wrap-around suite 2 months back and i have to say, it was amazing!
Beautiful decor!  Very modern!  
Total sex hotel!  From the master bedroom, there are NO doors to the bathroom and who ever is showering, they are in plain view of anyone in the room.  
I took a bubble bath my last day, and it was great.  So relaxing!
There is a full kitchen that had not only a sink, but a freakin' oven and stove! I mean, I don't know who comes to vegas to cook, but damn was that impressive.  
They even had a washer and dryer...crazy.
My absolute favorite part was the BALCONY! Our view was spectacular!  I had a view of the entire strip.  On the living room side, was the City Center\/Aria then on the other side Planet Hollywood was right in front of us and so was the rest of the strip.  Best view of my life!
They also provided us with a turn-down service.  Legit.

The casino is very fancy but gets very busy since its such a new hotel. 

We didn't go clubbing but I heard that people who stay at the Cosmo get in free to Marque.  I'll be back in a couple weeks to see how that goes. =)

I did think it is actually quite small for a hotel, but if you stay in their wrap-around, you'll never want to leave your room. =)",2,1,2

It's truly a catchall for a whole lot of awesome in a city that competes mercilessly for ... awesomeness.

From the moment our taxi pulled into the hotel foyer and we saw the bright metallic letters spelling out ""COSMOPOLITAN"", we knew we were in for an experience. The check-in line was surprisingly long at 10 pm but it gave us time to appreciate the video walls which went from a seductive\/erie nude bodies (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=XR5hVPlUDaQpb9HnDzKkBw) to a quaint snow-falling-on pine-trees (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=J_p8u3M3CCBk__xicevYrA) scene. 

Our room was amazing. We reserved a studio with terrace and got upgraded to a one bedroom (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=AClkDbeYB9xOCSsDLF6JjA) and wow we got quite a bit of room. We had voyeuristic views of the strip from our terrace; directly across from Planet Hollywood and excellent views of Paris (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=xlK08NLRS3gD7r59e-OENQ) and much else on the Strip. The bed was really comfortable and the soaking tub (with views of the strip of course) served as a nice getaway from Vegas before doing it all over again. (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=Ltrv_BZDE-ec598EU6Hv6w)

The casino is nice and never got too smokey. The drink ladies were also frequently on top of their game which was nice. While I lost money here, I still had a good time... which might have been a byproduct of the drink ladies being on top of their game.  

Now on to the little kinks and they really are just minor. As great as the cosmopolitan is, it can get douchey quick. I think it's the influence of the Marquee nightclub. Seriously... prior to this trip, I thought ""Snooki"" was a Halloween costume, not a full-time look. And Express should probably open an outlet here because there was a lot of striped, big collar, action going on. 

Room service was average. Maybe it was the last day but food just didn't seem to taste good. I has an egg white fritatta and thought it was overdone - the chicken was overcooked and I had bits of the ends of asparagus that really should have been thrown out. The bloody Mary was good though. Again, minor kink because The Cosmopolitan offers up so many great dining options within its walls. 

For a different, non-themed (unless you consider Jersey Shore a theme), modern take on a Vegas getaway, The Cosmopolitan is a sophisticated alternative to the in-your-face experience found most everywhere on the strip.",2,0,0

I finally made it to my room with my heavy luggage  However, I couldn't open the door. Finally, using 2 hands and my entire body weight i barely cracked the door open. The room, however was impressive,very sleek,large, jacuzzi tub, 2flat screens, kitchen,balcony; everything I expected and more. Then my disappointed continued
A few hours later my husband opened an $8 bottle of water and drank 1\/3ofthe bottle and left the bottle on the table. The next morning the bottle disappeared, probably was removed by the housekeepers. Why? 
At night I took a bath. Upon ending, my husband noticed that the entire florin the bathroom was totally soaked so we had to use all of our towels to absorb the water. Then the water still remained in the bathtub so the water didn't drain well.
during the day Saturday I stopped by the room to get something. I asked my friend in room 2842to open the door to the room. She also barely had enough strength to open the door.
Upon entering the room there was a weird water running noise coming from the bathtub but it stopped within a minute or so.
When I returned to the room after dinner, thru up in the sink and the sink wouldn't drain. I went to take a bath. Again I got out of the tub and the floor in the bathroom was full of water. I called beck and call and the lady said she would send someone to take care of the sink. I waited 30minutes and called the front desk manager, Zack. During our conversation, the weird bathtub noise started again and last about 1-2 minutes. Finally the plumber arrived and he stated that the front door is hard to open. The following morning I woke up and went to brush my teeth and saw the remainder of my throw up in the sink. The plumber unclogged the sink but didn't run the water as to clean the sink! Unacceptable for this level of hotel! There are weird noises in the room, maybe coming from the elevator 24\/7.
 I have a verizon Iphone and the cell service in the rooms poor to terrible.  The TV across from the bed had streaks of fuzz every few minutes.
We weren't able to check out from the room and went down to the lobby to huge check in lines. Clerk said to use the kiosk. Kiosk said that we need to see the host. None of the staff knew who and where the host was! After 15 min my husband got mad and called a manager who checked us out and said that the front desk manager would respond to the email but I never rec'd anything.
Honestly, nothing was quite right. We usually stay at Venetian,Palazzo, Ritz, Four Seasons and am always amazed at the service and quality. Maybe I expected too much from Cosmopolitan.

If you didn't know Cosmo is part of the Marriott family, so I used some of my Marriott reward points for our stay.  There was a special checkin line for Marriott guests.  At checkin the guy was super friendly and was looking to find the best possibly room for my stay.  We ended up having a King Terrance Suite with the Japanese Soaking Tub facing the Bellagio fountains.  The view is definitely worth the price!

After I checked in, about an hour later, there was a knock at my door and they sent me a plate of cookies and 2 glasses of milk to welcome me!  I was impressed.

We had a decent sized patio over looking the fountains.  That was my favorite part of the trip.  We sat there for hours watching the fountains and people watching.  MUST MUST MUST!!

You can control the lights\/A\/C thru the TV.  Loved that technology.  The TVs were nice - beds were super comfortable.  Did not hear anyone from the other rooms or even outside for that matter.  

Bathrooms were amazing.  I was a bit surprised at first to see you could totally view the person in the shower from the bedroom - they do have blinds though for any self conscience people.  Our room also featured a Japanese Soaking tub.  We definitely used that each night.  It was so nice to relax in the tub and watch the fountains from the tub (window to view from the tub area!).  

Beware, the mini fridge and snacks are all electornically sensored, so if you move anything for more than 45 seconds you will be charged for it on your bill.  HOwever, if you accidently move something and get charged, hotel will easily refund it off of your bill at checkout.

Would not recommend the hotel for casino play - not a big playing area as other casinos.  I think their main focus is the hotel, restaurants, bars, and clubs.  

One big feature that we liked is that the hotel is centrally located so you could easily walk to any nearby casinos.

Checkout process was a breeze.  Definitely will be back and fully recommend.",2,1,1

We got a deal where we paid for the Suite for the first night and got the second night for only $5. The suite had a bedroom with a king bed and a pull out couch. There's two bathrooms, one really big one with a tub, a shower thats probably a quarter size of my room, and two bathroom sinks. Theres a smaller bathroom with just a toilet and a sink. 

The location of the hotel was perfect and really convenient for my group and I, because we went to Marquee for both nights of our stay, so all we had to do was go downstairs and we were there. If we were tired, we could easily go back up to our hotel. At the same time the location was local to the areas we visited, such as the Bellagio buffet and Planet Hollywood for Fat Tuesdays.

The only concern I had was that we did not get a ""do not disturb"" sign for our door. Normally we always put our ""do not disturb"" sign out but this time, since we did not have one, the maids came to clean our room and they didn't permit us to reenter the room, so we had to wait for them to finish cleaning before we could come back. Another thing is that I could hear people's foot steps from the floor below us as well as the laughter from children screaming and running. 

Overall the stay at Cosmo was lovely, I will definitely visit again during the warmer time of the year so that we can take advantage of the suite with a balcony. This was definitely a trip for the books, thank you Cosmo!",0,0,0

It's so beautiful and shiny, but so beautiful and shiny that it made me feel dirty and cheap.

In any case, this is a great escape for anyone looking to fill up on eye candy. There are so many wonderful, stunning features, to feast your eyes on, from the columns at the front desk, to the many chandeliers adorning the ceiling, to the tiny details making the elevator entrance look nicer than people's homes. 

It didn't strike me as great for gambling, unless you're a high roller and throw money at dealers and machines, which I am not. BUT, it's totally a place to shop, dine, and party. The entrance to the club there, Marquee, leads you to elevators that take you up to the fourth floor, where I'm sure the opulence continues.

My friend invited me to Comme Ca for dinner with her other girl friends and I couldn't figure out where it was. She kept telling me it's in the Cosmopolitan. In my mind, I was thinking, ""Comme Ca is in a restaurant? A restaurant in a restaurant?"" Yes, I know, I know... ditz! 

When I finally saw the hotel, that's when it all clicked to me. Hmph, the palm of my hand slapped my forehead with embarrassment. Duh! When I walked in one thing that really stuck out was the amount of diamond looking chandelier that dressed the entire hotel. It was very Beverly Hills 90210, expensive looking, classy, and I felt so out of place being there. 

Don't misunderstand, I was impressed with how beautiful everything was, but I definitely felt like it wasn't my scene. The people that roamed through the casino that night all looked like a million dollars. The girls were all made up with perfect make up and skimpy sexy dresses to impress any man with dollar signs in his pocket, and the guys were in suits, gelled hair and colgoned out to impress any woman who were willing to take their money or be pampered, wined and dined.

Overall, it's defnitely built for people who like high class status, rich, and expensive environment.  It's great to look at and sight see, but not to spend money in.",2,0,2

The Vegas strip casino for all you hipsters out there. I mean i heard this place was going for the younger, chic crowd, and they nailed it for sure. Both times I was there it seemed no one looks over 40 in this place, unless they are working there. I mean it had the young crowd of the Palms and HardRock, but without the Barbie and Ken types that make those places annoying. 

First time i was there, I went for the Black Keys show back on feb. 20th, while the venue itself, the Chelsea was just a ballroom with bars on the side, the show was great, but not rating that here though. Walked around before the show and was just amazed by design and architecture of the whole place. Got drunk at the show off Glenmorganie Scotch for $10 a drink, which is reasonable. Went home, happy times. 

On Saturday I was back to there Book and Stage bar. My buddy told me of a free show for Robert Randolph & The Family Band. Pulled into self parking, which is very cool in itself, all floors have a sign showing you the number of spots left on that floor, and have arrows pointing you to where the spots are, because sensors are above every space, knowing whether its open or closed, then all the elevators have murals by famous graffiti artists, but I digress. 

Had a great time at the Book and Stage, Robert Randolph & The Family Band put on an awesome show, but best part was the beer selection. It was amazing, I had a Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA and a Trappistes Rochefort 8  for $7 each. You can hardly find the Trappistes for under $4 in a liquor store, if they even have it. So to have it at your center bar, for $7 during a free concert, well you get 5 stars for the whole hotel just for that.",0,1,0

Out of all the hotels I've been to, Cosmopolitan is the best hotel if you're into luxury, modern design, and wanting to experience the strip in a short amount of time. The Cosmopolitan is nested between 5 other key essential hotels that you'll be able to experience about 85% of the stirp; Bellagios, Caesars, Planet Hollywood, Paris, MGM, and of course the Cosmopolitan itself. 

Pros

Room: The panoramic view at the wraparound terrace suite was stunning and I loved the freedom to roam around the spacious terrace for a breath of fresh air with a spectacular view! The design of the room is more upscale and modern compared to similar rooms at Paris, Caesars, and Bellagios. Similar to Planet Hollywood, the hotel targets a younger crowd. The wraparound rooms are indeed spacious, but smaller than what I imagined; however, big enough for a group stay and ideal for a bachelorette or bachelors stay. If you're staying at the wraparound terrace then request one that overlooks the strip and Bellagio fountain. If you don't mind the noise and appreciate party music, then consider getting the suite right in front of the day club. My only gripe about the room is that it needed a little TLC, the carpets had stains and the living room furniture was filthy. 

Bathroom: For the ladies, there is plenty of counter space for all your makeup and goods. The suites had 2 sinks and counter space for his and hers with a large shower in the middle. The bathtub was conveniently right in front of the shower but unfortunately you don't get a view unless you wanna see your partner showering. 

Convenience: Like I mentioned before, the hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of the strip. You could go to a show next door at the Bellagios and then go across the street to Vdara for some shopping and then go to CVS or Walgreens a few steps away to buy some cheap alcohol or snacks. 

Eats: As of now, there are some cheap and tasty food options that's located downstairs. You have cheap bites such as Secret Pizza and Eggslut. Secret Pizza is a tasty and super cheap option and it is located on the third floor. No signs leading to the eatery, but Secret Pizza is tucked away next to the elevator. Then you have Wicked buffet which I thought was crappy but seems like a hit with others. They also have some more upscale options such as É by Jose Andreas and unfortuantly I did not have time but will make reversations on my next visit. Very thankful The Juice Standard was downstairs for serving with mixed vegetable and fruit juices to help alleviate any grimy hangover feeling. 

Service: Overall, everyone from housekeeping to the front desk to concierge is extremely friendly and accommodating. They honestly treat you like royalty and will help you with anything that you need. Uber at this hotel is one of the best on the strip. Other hotels make you walk to intricate areas, but the Cosmopolitan has a designated area right in front of the valet and check in. Do take advantage of this when coming to the hotel and planning your stay. 

Casino: Absolutely gorgeous and it's the type of casino worth glamming up for. The style that they utilize is reminiscent of modern elegance. Simply spectacular from the modern cylinder elevators to the draping diamond curtains. Every niche and cranny of this place is filled with intricate detail. There was a lot of thought put into some of the design schemes and it really shows throughout the hotel.",7,5,9

I typically have hated Las Vegas in the past due to its less than classy atmosphere, its density of cigarette smoke, and the thin sheen of desperation over all the golden city. So, I was dreading the traditional bachelorette in Vegas. 
After an easy shuttle ride over the the hotel, I was impressed by the gorgeous silver decor with lavendar and dark wood. The hotel was obviously busy and bustling, and amusingly the cocktail girls were out even at 9AM to serve in highheels. We unfortunately couldn't check in until hours later, but they were very nice about checking our bags and giving us access to the pool while we waited. 
At check-in time, the lines seemed impossibly long, but we actually only had to wait 30 minutes to check in. The concierge helped us find rooms all together, and we were helped up to our rooms. The rooms themselves were lovely and very girly, obviously new, with pretty views. I was pretty impressed with the linen choices, the modern graphics choices, and the technology in the room. Sorry, but gadgets are my thing and the central TV that displayed our check-in name and could surf all the amenities of the hotel was pretty cool. Also, I'm VERY noise sensitive and despite the regular party crowd, I didn't hear a thing.
Since only one of us gambled, we were primarily there to see some shows, eat delicious food and dance. All of these things were easily found near the Cosmopolitan's central location. The hotel's restaurants themselves averaged about a 3.5 rating, but I did approve of their attempt to accommodate gluten free and diary free diners by printing out allergy specific menus. Also, one of the hottest night clubs was in the hotel, so we were able to simply walk downstairs, get in, and dance all night. All in all it was a great time, the staff was very tolerant of our bachelorette antics, and for a girl whose feet got very sore after dancing, it was easy to get home and pass out at 4AM. I'd definitely recommend this hotel.",0,0,0

The room we were upgraded to was fantastic....very large ""living"" area with a wet bar and mini-fridge (careful, it's an electronic mini-fridge that is stocked, so if you tip something over from its space, you will be charged!), a nice sized bedroom area, and a really cool bathroom.

The living area included a large closet with a safe, and additional amenities, such as robes and slippers.  The bathroom had a huge walk in shower, and the BEST Japanese soaking tub that overlooked the Bellagio fountain and the strip.  

And the best part was the very nice balcony, also overlooking the Bellagio fountains and the strip....very cool space.

Upon arrival, we had prompt and courteous check-in from the front desk, and we were assigned to the tower with elevators directly behind check-in.  As a Platinum Marriott member (this is an Autograph Collection property), while there was not a traditional concierge lounge, there was a small lounge with coffee and newspapers right off the lobby to which we had access.

The first night was awesome.  We had a great night's sleep.  The next night, apparently a group of young people checked in next to us.  At around 9:30, there was an outright party on the balcony next door....music blaring, dancing, singing, cigarettes and perhaps other smokables, and shots, beer and booze was flowing.  Since it was only 9:30 in the evening, even though they were annoying, it IS Vegas, and it was evening time, so no big deal.  We thought ourselves lucky when, later that night, it seemed they closed down the party and went out.  Unfortunately, at about 3:30 a.m., they apparently had left the bars, and were back in force....the music was louder, the booze smoke was thicker and they were apparently trying to ""one up"" one another in drinking.  We let it go for about an hour, then called downstairs.  Security apparently came up, because it quieted down.....for about 30 minutes....then it was back!!  After about another hour of trying to endure, we got dressed and walked downstairs to talk to the front desk.  

The young lady we talked to handled the situation with outstanding professionalism.  She got security upstairs right away, apologized, and offered us a f&b credit.  Although the music had stopped when we went back upstairs, I have to credit the stamina of those young people....they continued to sit outside and smoke and drink until 10:00 a.m.

In any case, the next day, we got a very nice call from a manager.  He again apologized for what had happened that night.  He assured us that they do not tolerate that kind of behavior and that the room had been warned that they would have to leave if any additional complaints were made.  We heard nothing else from our neighbors, and we were very pleased with how the hotel handled the situation!

During our stay we ate several meals on property, at locations including the Egg Slut, Secret Pizza, Wicked Spoon (twice!) the diner and the best - STK.  All of the meals were good to outstanding.  I will have separate reviews on those.

The casino was well organized, well staffed and very clean.  We spent a good deal of time in the Sports book bar, and enjoyed it. 

The location of the hotel is outstanding too....

My boyfriend Mike and I arrived in Las Vegas to find colder weather than we left behind in NYC (go figure), but we were warmed up right away upon entering the lobby of the hotel and being welcomed with a glass of Champagne at the check-in desk. After determining that our room wasn't quite ready for us, we were upgraded to a one-bedroom suite with a terrace on the 30th floor. Here are some pictures of the amazing room (which was probably bigger than my entire 2-bedroom apartment).

The décor of the entire hotel is amazing. I think Mike commented at one point that they must have hired the most amazing architects and designers they could find to make this place come together. From the electronic and mood-changing ""wallpaper"" in the lobby, to the three-story Chandelier Bar, to the whimsical and innovative light fixtures everywhere, it really is a sight to be seen. In walking around the hotel, you could spot the tourists who were just passing through to take it all in.

After getting settled in the room, admiring the view and calling everyone we knew to tell them about all the amazing things that had happened so far, we ventured out for a walk and to grab some dinner at the Planet Hollywood shops across the street. Riding the elevator back up, four rather large men in suits enter and then I see a tall, sort of shaggy and vaguely familiar guy walk to the back and stand next to Mike. I look at him and I look at Mike and then I realized ""oh my God, that's John Mayer!"" So that was pretty awesome.

We changed into nicer clothes and rode the elevator back downstairs for the Marquee preview party. I'm not much of a club kind of girl, so I'd only heard of those places where scantily-clad girls dance in cages and on the bars. Well this was one of those places, yet it still retained class if you could imagine. We were treated to a beer, Champagne and well-drink open bar and after grabbing our drinks, we walked around the club and just tried to absorb it all. British sensation Florence + The Machine began their set at about midnight and played an energetic and fun hour-long set. Through a coworker I had heard of them before, but after seeing a live performance, I'm hooked. YouTube them now - you won't be sorry.

We had reservations at the NYC-transplant Blue Ribbon Sushi at 7:30 and we were both very excited for whatever a gala dinner was. We were seated in the back, semi-romantic section of the restaurant, handed warm towels to wash our hands with and an extravagant menu. We decided on what we would choose and were then informed that there were no choices to be made, as we would be receiving everything. Jaws drop.

The next morning we somehow managed to wake up with enough time to make it to brunch at the Wicked Spoon. And boy am I glad we didn't miss this. You want to talk about epic? This was the most epic brunch ever. Not only was it the most innovative buffet I've ever seen, but all of the food choices were fresh, constantly replenished and often served to you by a worker from behind the counter. I ate the most amazing truffled potatoes ever and was super bowled over by the Eggs Benedict, fresh berries and butternut squash ravioli. They had a giant dessert station as well complete with a full gelato bar. Everything was so pretty and we found a resurgence of the gold flakes on numerous desserts.

I'm pretty sure this was the coolest pool area I've ever seen. With all sorts of plush seating arrangements, brightly colored blue and yellow decorations, in-pool chaise lounges, views up and down the Strip, a fully stocked bar, cozy cabanas (with plasma TVs), pool tables and TVs, this was again the place to be. We were all still stuffed from breakfast, so we didn't get to enjoy the full BBQ going on, but we did help ourselves to Veuve Clicquot, Mighty Leaf teas, creamy hot chocolate and some Bailey's and coffee to warm up with. They were also passing out warm blankets and had the heaters cranked on high.

While it's a new hotel and we did experience some kinks in service (we accidentally got charged for about 20 different things from the mini-fridge even though we didn't touch anything; the maid called us at 8 a.m. to pick up the laundry even though we never requested laundry service; the wait for a concierge was often way too long), I trust that The Cosmopolitan will work everything out because the place really sells itself. They really went all out for this Grand Opening Weekend as well, sending up gifts to the room such as Moleskine notebooks, Zagat celebration guides and Cire Treudon candles and matches. 

With a wide variety of classy, yet affordable dining options, amazing artwork everywhere and a true understanding of what a unique resort experience should be, The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas is truly a work of art and I can't wait to go back.",9,0,6

If you're an out of towner and want to die, stay here.  My gf and I stayed at the Cosmopolitan during a visit to LV for my bday and upgraded to a suite, with balcony, upon arrival.  The room was nicely decorated but dirty.  The bathroom had white stains all over the marbletopped counter and there was dust all over the paintings\/fixtures in the room.  We cleaned the dust off with towels and used lysol wipes (yeah me for packing them!!) to disinfect the bathroom before getting ready to head out.  After returning to our room around 3am, we fell out but were awakened by someone banging on our room door.  Thinking some sort of emergency situation was going on, we jumped out of bed and ran to look out the keyhole to find a BEYOND DRUNK man going to town on the door.  We called the front desk and asked that he be removed, however 15 minutes went by, STILL NO SECURITY.  Afraid and exhausted, we tried to reason with the gentleman who now had his pinky finger in his mouth and seemed to be rubbing his lower body with his other hand.  He continued banging and then had the audacity to put his eye up to the peephole, trying to see into our room.  We called the front desk again and were told that security was not on site and that we simply had to wait.  There was nothing they were able or really going to do until the offsite security got there.  After what seemed like forever, the banging stopped and the man sat down in front of our door.  We ended up not being able to leave for a 8am excursion we purchased tickets for.  When we got to the front desk, we were connected to security who confirmed that they received the complaint and that the gentleman was removed in an indecent state from our front door.  When we asked what they meant by ""indecent"" they refused to go into detail and stated that their reasoning for not contacting us to let us know it were safe to leave the room was because they did not know how to reach us.  Umm..didn't you just say you removed him from in front of our room?! We called from the phone in our room, how were you not able to knock on the door, show your badge and let us know what was going on..wtf?!  We complained to the Manager who must have had a nice big delicious mug of BITCH for breakfast.  She basically told us she did not care since the situation was over and that it really was not any of our business as to what state the man was in when they found him.  We later filed a report with security and were told that the man - ""Nick"" was naked in front of our door and had to be restrained and removed from the floor.  He was not a guest..he was a trespasser and they had NO CLUE as to how he was able to gain access to the hotel, let alone get up to our floor without having a keycard for the elevator.  

BE VERY CAREFUL LADIES.  The Cosmopolitan and their staff does not care about anything but getting your money, especially not your safety.  ""Nick"" and his naked behind could have raped and killed someone and they would have covered it up, I promise.",22,7,3

One of the patrons knocked his beer on the floor which broke in a million pieces and all over my dress. The bartender didn't even offer a napkin as she looked the other way.

Kind of annoying how you have to take a long walk about to get to the Aria. I think next time we will stay at Aria because from Aria you can take the tram to Monte Carlo or Bellagio.  

Two stars is for the STAFF.  The staff member at check in was very rude. Additionally, beyond awful was the staff at the coffee\/pastry bar outside of checkin.   They were horribly rude, even to the point of tossing a bag\/box to my friend when she asked for a bag for her croissant.  The Valet was not friendly at all.

The morning after my review, we received a phone call expressing their concern about the view and cleanliness of our room.  They offered to change our rooms free of charge.  They moved us to a fountain view room on a higher floor and they also moved us from the one bedroom terrace to the terrace suite which is much larger and has more amenities such as a dining room, full kitchen, two bathrooms, washer and dryer, and a larger bedroom.

The room itself was MUCH cleaner and more well maintained than our previous room which made us feel better about our stay.  The only issue we found was that my boyfriend got stuck in the bedroom because they have sliding doors to separate the bedroom from the living room and it was partially detached and got wedged together with the other door.  Eventually we got him out though without any assistance.

The kitchen has an oven, a stove, a dishwasher and a fridge and freezer but no utensils, no plates, no bowls, no soap, and no purpose.  Do they expect travelers to bring their own plates and forks?  I just didn't see the point.  For looks?

The rooms are not all the same, they advertise having a touch tablet phone in the room (we had two rooms and both did not have them)  We also did not have the iPod adapter as advertised either.  

We had to call for a do not disturb sign since our room did not have one and not to mention they have like seven different do not disturb signs which isn't very classy in my opinion.  The rooms are supposed to feel very unison. 

Housekeeping still needs to be better trained, they do not clean well.  There was some cereal spilt on the floor (a couple flakes)  when we first arrived and instead of it getting swept up it was swept into a pile on the floor for us to clean up.  Why do I have to clean up someone else's mess?  

The air conditioner is motion censored, so you can't cool your room off while you are out and it can only be dropped to 65 degrees.  It was kind of frustrating to not be able to come back to a nice cool room.

You are supposed to be able to control a lot of things from your TV but our remote batteries were dead so no TV for us.

All in all everything and everyone just seems to be on different pages.  There is no communication in this company.  I understand it is a huge hotel but come on I work at a company that has well over 22,000 employees and we are all one same page.,

The only other big issue we had with our new room was after returning from a fun day of activities our guest bathroom had a very strong scent of marijuana.  We were not sure why it smelled that way seeing as how we had been gone all day.  We assumed it was either house keeping being naughty or the party goers staying in the room next to ours and the scent somehow seeped in.  We called the front desk about it three times.  The first time they said they would be sending the floor manager up.  After 30 minutes there was still no knock on the door.  We were hungry and wanted to go grab food so we called once more.  They said this time they would send up housekeeping to come clean the bathroom and we didn't need to be present.  So we went and grabbed dinner.  Upon returning the restroom appeared the same. Same smell and still just as strong.  We attempted to call once more.  This time they said there wasn't much they could do except bring a machine up to suck up the scent.  So to us it felt like a big ""What do you want me to do about it?"" and ""Deal with it""  We let it go, just closed up that bathroom the best we could to keep it from seeping into the rest of the room.

Luckily when we arrived for our check in date there was a room already ready,  crappy... but ready.  Every evening after that though we saw about 30-40 people camped out in the lobby waiting for a room well past 5 pm (check in is at 3pm mind you)  It just doesn't seem acceptable to not have rooms ready by the check in time.

Overall the upgrade was really nice of them and we really appreciate it because it made our trip not as stressful and it was also a little more comfortable.  A big shout out to Joe and Nathan our bellhops who are very friendly and professional and deserve a bonus because they are so awesome.

I said it last time,  I REALLY wanted to love this hotel.  I really did.  I just can't.  Not until they retrain their staff, maintenance their rooms, and become more organized.

bunked with paretns. Yes parents who somehow got comped for their meager slot play.

Hotel: Pool eastside tower is awesome, with unique seating, pool can be and should be bigger, but the views cannot be beat. Kinda pissed they didnt allow their own hotel's restaurant food inside (holsteins) I mean shit its not like Im bringing a picnic basket from home its YOUR hotels restaurant food. Oh well.
The room itself I was disappointed. Our balcony, even plenty of room, was a shaved off smaller version so no access to go out (boooo). Shower pressure sucks, think light drizlle, no adjustments of speed, even though good size and nice toiletries.
The bed is BY FAR the worst bed I have slept in, anywhere in the world. Its like quicksand, you sink in, one side already torpedoed, just feel slipping away, away...away......yikes. And the pillows are made of crap, so soft you cannot get a good night sleep, just terrrible terrible bed overall.

GAMING: Awful, and awfuller blackjack. An unheard of on double decks, they pay       6 to 5 on BJ's. (only one I know of on the strip that doesnt pay correct 3 to 2 odds for double deck blackjacks.) Lots of slots, dont care for them. Limits on Bj start at $15.00, even on weekends, but majority are $25 and up.

Loaction and decor second to none. Shops and restaurants great, food great finds. Just a so-so room (was expecting the moon) this time.

1. We had our food and beverage comped, so we had to be charged to the room.  We were able to do this at most restaurants at cosmo. Then we had a problem at one with charging to the room. The waiter was rude,  basically said we have to call the front desk and figure it ourselves and he was very busy (I work in customer service.... normally I feel like they should have had manager call for us but whatever). so we call and the front desk says we are ""authorized to charge to our room that has our name on it, basically the waiter is dumb"" and asks to speak with the waiter. 45 minutes later, after the front desk talking to hostess and manager, we aren't able to charge to our room. we never would have eaten there if we knew that we wouldn't be able to charge to room and have our stuff comp'd. all the manager said was ""it's a cosmopolitan problem."" ok but didn't u just talk to the front desk? They just told us that we're authorized and now. ... we're not?  aren't u a part of the cosmopolitan? No apology. No explanation from anyone. ... whatever we just paid cash
2. they add fees and charges on to everything. 
3. food in our room just went missing????????? 
4. internet, TV and phone was down... they said it would only be phone.... glad I didn't have to pay for the room or internet.... I'd be very upset. 
5. machines were down due a system update and had to hand pay everything. this happened at aria the day before but they had like 20 people on the floor paying out. they only had 2 at cosmo. took over an hour to get paid after asking a very rude cashier who to ask (so rude that she almost made me cry for feeling like I was ruining her life for asking her to cash my ticket and where to find someone to pay out my sister), then a floor manager then finally found the 2 ladies and brought them over and then they paid out everyone in our area and us last....
6. room wasn't disgusting like other reviews but didn't feel or seem as clean as other places I've stayed like wynn and aria.... 

This place is horribly mismanaged. We were comp'd  roombecause we are invited guests, platinum members, so you'd think we'd be treated nicely or at least not badly. We travel to Vegas often....  but either way whether your customer is spending $10k or $15, you shouldn't be rude and make things difficult for the customer. Word gets around.  It looks like our group (who is very low maintenance) wasn't the only ones having issues with service or cleanliness.

I had heard that this is THE hotel for young, party minded people, who enjoy the scene.  Without a doubt, that sentiment rings true.  This hip hotel is constantly buzzing with partiers, young people, and lots of excitement.  Add onto that great restaurants and shopping, a terrific gaming and loyalty program, beautiful rooms and amenities, and a fantastic location on the Strip.

Pros:
-Great location on the Strip; right between City Center and The Bellagio, across from Planet Hollywood
-Drop dead gorgeous room with great bath amenities and outstanding views (we had a terrace view that faced the Bellagio fountains.  Simply incredible).
-An extremely comfortable bed
-Excellent, roomy shower
-Boulevard Pool was the perfect place to chill and lounge for the day to soak up the sun and scene
-Great array of fine and casual dining restaurants and shops, including the buffet
-Check-in and Check-out procedures were fast and easy; desk staff were attentive and eager to make my stay better
-Casino was perfectly sized; not too big, not too small, didn't overwhelm me.

Cons:
-We forgot to remove our Do Not Disturb sign before 4 the first day, called three times to have the room made up, and the room still didn't get made up.  They did compensate by at least bringing fresh towels and taking out our trash that night.
-Front desk hard to reach via in-room phone; found it easier to call the hotel from my cell or go down to the front desk myself
-Guest room hallways were kinda drab

Beautifully decorated with a modern yet elegant flair
Smaller and more  intimate compared to the much large hotels on the strip
King Terrace Suite with Bellagio View was Incredible (ask for West Tower rooms. It's a smaller tower with fewer rooms and great views. It's also closer to the restaurants and shopping)
Bathrooms are enormous with japanese soaking jacuzzi tubs, showers large enough for a party, nice living area, kitchenette, 2 flat screen t.v.s with all the update technology you could ever want (control lights, room temperature, music stations, movies, schedule wake up calls, etc.
Some great funky shops including a sneaker store with one of a kind shoes.
Great hidden pizza joint on the 3rd floor (won't see a sign. you have to ask about it)
Loved Holstein's burger and shake restaurant.
3 pools to choose from, 1 being the Marquee Day Club if you want a club vibe. Have to pay to have a place to lay\/sit, but the fee goes towards any food or drink you order. 

The Bad:
The mini kitchens in the king suites have a dishwasher, microwave, mini refrigerator, sink, lots of cabinet space. The problem is that it wasn't stocked with plates, utensils, etc. so how could you use the kitchen really? Very bad planning. Plus, no coffee maker in the room. You can't have a kitchen with no coffee maker. The refrigerator is stocked as a full mini bar with no place to put your own things. We shoved our things on top of the things they had in there and the maid took everything out. Kind of lame.

Service at the Boulevard pool was really bad 2 days in a row. And I mean REALLY bad.

Alot of the restaurants are trying to hard to be ""out of the box."" Menus are a little too unusual. I can see a couple of restaurants being very unique but not the majority of them. There is nothing wrong with taking traditional food and doing it REALLY well. Sometimes going back to basics is a good thing....

Even with the Bad I listed, I will be back. You just can't beat the rooms, views, location, Marquee Club (day and night), and the whole vibe....",0,1,0

I know others can relate when they book a room hoping for a ""view"" or something nice to see and what they actually ""view"" are dirt roads or old air conditioner boxes and so forth.  That was NOT the view I wanted.  Thank goodness the Cosmo is located in a great spot to show me a ""view"" I'd enjoy.   

Being a resident here, I tend to want to stay away from the strip, but if I was a tourist, I definitely would book a room at the Cosmo to enjoy the scenery and get a beautiful view of Vegas strip.  

Also I enjoy staying at the Cosmo because they have various places to eat for whatever your price range is, from buying a slice of pizza to fine dining in the steakhouse.

I had stayed there once before and wasn't a fan but had a much better experience this time around. Our room was beautiful. It had a balcony and a huge tub over looking a great view of Vegas. The room was very nicely decorated with a Jonathan Adler feel. 

The gym had great equipment and a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. But they did not offer bottled water, only a water machine with cups, which is not easy to drink while working out. 

There aren't that many breakfast options, which I found frustrating. The main breakfast restaurant had a long wait each morning and the grab and go food only consisted of pastries and coffees. Nothing healthy or fresh. 

The restaurant options in the hotel are quite vast for lunch and dinner. Milos is by far my favorite for lunch and dinner. We also had a nice lunch at China Poblano.

Much to the delight of all the local Cosmo regulars. :)

ROOMS: If you're considering lodging at the Cosmo. I can only give my highest recommendation. I've been in a few of the Cosmo rooms and they are nothing below 5 stars. They're modern, extra clean, with cool technology. Thinking of having a party? We had quite a few people in our room, played music and security never got called! That means sound-proofing is A OK.

DINING: Cosmo has such a unique food offering. The only cheap eat is the Secret Pizza Place. Everything else is Casual-Fine Dining. I'll be making my way around to all different restaurants, but as far as I'm concerned they're all pretty good!

SHOPPING: Off-beat stores you can't find anywhere else. Home to the only KidRobot store in Vegas. LOVE!

CLUB: Marquee. Enough Said. :) Check out my review on the best nightclub in Vegas.

My friends dad is one of the founders of the company that owns the cosmo. Yeah. I guess it's a NY thing. But anyways. 

For those of you who have not been to Vegas and are considering staying at the cosmo. I highly recommend it. First location location location...  the cosmo is centrally located on the vegas strip. You will have to still walk or take a cab. But you can walk to mostly everything because you are centrally located. The sky ridge will take you to ether aria or you can cross the bridge to planet Hollywood. The location is amazing. 

Price. Price is bit more expensive than other hotels. In Vegas the saying goes you get what you pay for. Most of the people who stay at the cosmo are younger 21-35. The hotel is very modern and sexi. They pride there selves on this theme. Very risky provocative themed. I happen to love that. If you want a more classic feel bellagio may be more your style. 

I have stayed in just about every type of room the cosmo offers. Almost every room has a terrace. Which is awesome. You will have to ask for a fountain view or city view terrace. I usually stay in the 2br with fountain view. Or the wrap around terrace suite fountain view. Their have only been two room types I have not stayed in yet. The lanai suites and the reception suite. All rooms have been clean except one time but the maid changed the pillow. 

This trip I had the opportunity to stay in one of there 3 story bungalow suites. Ok. The bungalow suites are awesome!!  It's 3 story's with 1 br and 2 bathrooms and a hot tub with a full kitchen living room and some other room. I guess a chill room. There is also a outdoor deck that looks over the bellagio fountains. On the other side there is a hot tub that overlooks marquee dayclub. You have private access to marquee dayclub. Great for having girls and guys come back to hang out. You also have a private entrance to marquee nightclub in the same hallway as your suite. You have a 24 hr security guard outside your door if you ever need him. All of this was quoted for $2,500-$5,000 a night. Weekends were $5,000-10,000. Depending on what was going on. Me and 3 friends stayed for 3 nights. It was cool private and exclusive. Our host josh was there whenever I needed him. Big shout out to josh. Thank you man. 

Food. The cosmo has a few different options. Being from Ny secret pizza is the closest thing I can find to Ny pizza in Vegas. Except gramaldies but my 2 fav places to eat are Holsteins burgers and shakes. The burgers are organic and really tasty. My fave spot is egg slut. Omg... egg slut. I want to buy one just to put in Manhattan. Literally the best egg sandwich. It's gourmet tho. Nothing beats a bacon egg and cheese in NyC. But. Egg slut is amazing for breakfast. I eat there every morning I'm at the cosmo. The lines do get really long. Like 20+ min wait for a egg sandwich. Not even joking. I like it soo much. I ordered 3 sandwiches before my flight back to NY. I brought those sandwiches through TSA. 

Overall. Not just because my friend. But I really do like staying at the cosmo. I wouldn't stay here 2 times a year if I did not like it. They treat you well. I'll be back here every time I'm in Vegas unless something else comes up. Give them a try you will not re gret it!!",10,5,6

When I arrived this time, check-in took at least 45 minutes as they were taking down credit cards on paper - their systems, which have monochrome monitors and must be 10-20 years older than the hotel itself, were down. 

My room this year was the standard one, which resolved my complaints from last year about the malfunctioning whirlpool (as It had no tub) and filthy balcony (as it had no balcony), though my coworkers all got upgraded to the terrace room. I briefly wondered if I was downgraded based on my negative Yelp review from last year but their computer systems are so ratchet I doubt that's a thing they're capable of. It was a lower floor in the westside tower - which affords a nice view of the fountains at Bellagio if you look straight out the window, but a view of a bunch of HVAC and the Bellagio parking garage if you look down. So don't look down. 

The general crowd staying here likes to party (duh) and drink (well, yeah) and one morning at like 5:30 a bunch of guys who were on their way to the exit decided to fight each other right in front of the westside tower elevators. I kinda nonchalantly walked through them figuring if they were stupid enough to bump into me and my $10 huge coffee from Va Bene they deserved the first-degree burns.

I was overcharged again this year, as a duplicate charge for my bar snacks showed up on my bill about a week after checkout. I called, but it still hasn't been removed as of this writing. Better than complaining about a phantom lube charge like last year, I guess.

I don't like that there is an oversized mini-bar on the desk and in the fridge.  I don't like that it is near impossible to find anything in the building.  I don't like the parade of partially clothed women that wander through to get to the clubs.  I don't like that EVERYTHING here is premium priced. 
I am disappointed by all the restaurants I tried during my stay. See my reviews of Comme Ca, Jaleo, and the Henry.

*Get the one bedroom terrace with the soaking tub overlooking the strip. Ask for the highest floor available. Just. Do. It. And then sit in that tub at sunset and watch the lights of Vegas come alive.
*Take time to read through the books and look at the artwork in the rooms. It's amazing.
*Take a shower with only the lights from the strip illuminating you. The tiny tiles are so beautiful in that light.
*Sleep in the bed as much as being in Vegas will allow you. It is THE MOST COMFORTABLE bed I've slept in anywhere in the world.
*EXPLORE the property. The later the better so there are less people. There are nooks and crannies everywhere with hidden beautiful surprises.
*Sit on all levels of the chandelier bar very late at night, if possible. Sometimes you'll be the only people there and it is sublime.
*Take time to look at all of the album covers covering the walls and ceiling of the pizza joint.
*Gamble. Surprisingly loose slots for such a glorious property.
*Go to the Bond bar while the girls are still dancing in the windows. Stay long enough for their 'shift changes', it's amazing to watch how it works.
*EAT at the Wicked Spoon buffet. This is NOT your ordinary amazing Vegas buffet. Go HUNGRY and try every little thing. I'm a chef by profession and this place curls my toes.
*Explore the parking garage. It is beautiful. It's ok if you don't have a car.

When the Bellagio opened up about 10-15 years ago, I thought that it was nice. The Venetian was gorgeous. But, nothing popped up that just changed the game for me....until I saw the Cosmo!

It is by far, the most gorgeous property that I've ever laid eyes on.

The casino floor is nice! The dealers at each table are friendly, know how to run a game, and show their personalities.

The restaurants are to die for. Try Holsteins, and grab some fries. Cooked in duck fat! Or an alcoholic shake!

The Marquee club is pretty nice too! They pull in some big name talent, so you know you will have a great night.

Oh....and the Chandelier! It's a bar inside a massive chandelier! 
Yeah....you heard right.

If you want to take a dip in the pool, you'll find it has some of the best views of Las Vegas. It overlooks the strip! Probably one of the best hotel pools in town!

The Cosmopolitan had the least smokey casino. Some other hotels I've visited by the time I got to my room my clothes were completely saturated with cigarette smoke and I couldn't stand to stay in the casino.  The Cosmo's restaurants are also located above the casino and are no smoking. This made it much easier to avoid that smell.  If you are a smoker there were a couple restaurants and bars in the casino where smoking was allowed.  Those however were not for me.

Seriously it's 2017, we've known for years that smoking will cause cancer, strokes, heart disease, and COPD.  Just quit.  Find a way and do it.

It was December 2010, the grand unveiling of the Cosmopolitan. It was a lifetime (and then some) ago, but my ties to the industry allowed me to take part to be amongst the first ever to step foot into the property. It had been a long 6 year wait to see this come to fruition, during a time of financial turmoil that was industry-wide as much as it was city-related. Yet, it defied the odds and at the time of its opening was as impressive as any casino resort I've ever seen.

It's been nearly 7 years and multiple casino resort openings later, and somehow they have failed the capture the magic of the Cosmo. For all intents and purposes, it has done an incredible job in staying in the upper echelon of desired Strip properties and above all, relevant. All in all, this remains one of my favorite places to stay and visit in Vegas. 

From top to bottom, the Cosmo exudes the kind of sophistication that is emblematic in its theme, one where scintillation meets luxury, with the high-end metro vibes and modern elegance. It is a fabulous resort where even the smallest room is a suite with a terrace. The rooms are comfortable yet chic, sporting a spacious layout and refined interior. 

Equally impressive is their collection of establishments, ranging from haute cuisine to casual eateries. The vibe is super NYC with places like Blue Ribbon Sushi, Beauty & Essex, Scarpetta, and even STK. There are other notable names like Eggslut, Jaleo, and Estiaorio Milos, which command a higher than average price point than most nearby spots. They have their super secret pizza as well and new establishments like MomoFuku who are on the verge of opening up. Their signature in-house buffet is the Wicked Spoon, which has gone down a few notches after a sizzling debut.

On the drink front, they've done well to create a very sexy line up of bars. The Chandelier is picturesque and a fun place to grab a cocktail before beginning the evening. Vesper works well as a lounge, but the ultimate is Rose.Rabbit.Lie. where speakeasy dreams come true. The Boulevard Pool is nothing home to write about, but their big time nightlife venue, Marquee, was the country's top grossing nightclub for the last couple years. Trust that the pretension is real and the upper tiered status of an Identity membership or prior relationship may be the only saving grace for a stellar time.

Then there is the casino, which is dark, active, yet strangely alluring. The dealers are well dressed like any other establishment, but the cocktail waitresses look good without much reveal and everyone is uber professional.  $25 and below tables are difficult to track down on the weekends and the slot inventory is plentiful. Their comp structure is similar to the Venetian, which means big ballers here only and little else. 

Through it all, there is a lot to appreciate about the Cosmo. It is very much a young and vibrant casino with a crowd that embodies the very fabric of the new Vegas. Whether or not it will wither like some of our favorite spots will take some time to tell, but with the newly secured ownership as of 2014, I sense the Cosmo will remain as one of the more popular places to stay and enjoy the Sin City life.",26,11,18

By noise I mean the street music, the Bellagio fountains, live bands in restaurants. Yes, I could hear all that from our terrace 37 floors up. At night it does calm down. Simple solution is to close the terrace doors.

When he asked me where I wanted to stay on our trip, there was no hesitation... I immediately blurted out, ""The Cosmo!!!"" 

Why? Well... The last time I went to Vegas was in 2013 for a college national championship game, and my friend and I decided to ""hotel hop"" to check out all of the other cool resorts on the strip (we weren't actually staying at the Cosmo during that vacation). But, the first step into the Cosmo and I was in LOVE. The three story chandelier bar inside just enamored me on so many levels (both literally and figuratively), and I was obsessed with the life-sized stiletto heels they had on display around the casino. Call me girly girl, call me fancy pants... I don't care. That hotel was frickin' FABULOUS and I knew I wanted to stay there the next chance I got.

Four years and a dizzying number of random trips to other places later, Vegas was back in the rotation. The Cosmo and I were FINALLY going to happen.

And boy did we LOVE it. Our trip was fantastic, and a huge part of that had to do with our choice of hotel.

Look- There's a reason why the Cosmo is the most expensive-built resort on the Las Vegas strip and one of the most expensive-built resorts in the world... Because their attention to detail was frickin' impeccable when they designed it. Every nook and cranny of that place is fancy AF. Every wall has some type of crazy cool art on it. Every  texture in the building, every floor material, every light fixture, every random column, every single chair, every digital screen, and everything else you can possibly imagine is OOZING with modern, glamorously detailed style. The restaurants are all delicious. The entertainment is top notch. The pools are the best view on the strip. The resort itself is in the best spot on the strip- I mean, you name it... Cosmo checks all of the boxes. We had such an amazing experience, our one bedroom reservation w\/ fountain view was AMAZEBALLS (DEFINITELY get a room with a fountain view!), and the only thing I'd do differently next time is request a room much higher up (we were on the 16th floor and although our view was fabulous, it could have been even better if we were higher up (but hey... first world probs, lol). We stayed in the Chelsea tower, but the Boulevard tower is the one that sits right on the strip (although I heard it was also more noisy than Chelsea). However, whichever tower you prefer... you want a fountain view and you want as high up of a room as you can get. 

Our favorite part of our actual room was the KILLER bathtub\/shower combo that connected into the bedroom. Oh and one morning we ordered room service with French toast that absolutely blew my mind. It was sooooo delicious. I'll post further reviews of all the other restaurants we checked out during our trip, but we dined at quite a few of the Cosmo ones inside the resort and they were ALL superb!!!

The Boulevard pool is also spectacular. They have three pools, but we went to the Boulevard one overlooking the strip (the resort folks told us it was a great mix between the crazy day club pool -aka Marquee- and the chill pool of the Chelsea tower). The Vegas strip view from the Boulevard pool is simply unmatched. It is perfection. 

I don't think any resort on the strip can beat the Cosmo in terms of quality, cool factor, design, and overall liveliness. If you don't know where to stay, but you want to make sure you get it right... Go to the Cosmo. There's a good reason it's always so busy. That's because it's so d*mn rad.",2,0,3

The attention to detail at this hotel makes all the difference when it comes to providing a unique, cutting edge Las Vegas experience. The rooms, the bars\/casino, the spa, the pool, the fitness center, and the restaurants were all fantastic (or at least very interesting) and are geared toward a progressive, design-minded guest. Room: our East Tower suite had a terrace with a view of the Bellagio fountains, as well as a soaking tub, and the extra $ paid for both was well worth the expense. Spent a lot of time on both the terrace and in the tub.The shower was open to the bedroom, providing the ""right amount of wrong"" the Cosmo advertises. Very modern amenities, including a central remote for the lights, air, TV, etc, which was fun to play with. 

Anyone who appreciates the visual arts will appreciate the facilities. Giant video screens featuring elaborate video art, chandeliers of all types, and classic lounges seem to mix into a super-modern experience. Just a small example: the old fashioned cigarette machines retrofitted to sell one of a kind art (just $5 will buy you an original piece the size of a pack of Camels). 

I don't have a ton of experience with this, but the the spa (men's side) had a great, huge jacuzzi with rain, sauna, steam and cool mist room. The signature massage was great as expected. The fitness center in the East tower had lots of brand new equipment, some of which looked completely unused. Went to two of the three pools, and they were multileveled, with lots of care given to making plenty of room and creating a really laid-back atmosphere. 

Ate at three of the restaurants: China Poblano, the secret Pizza place, and the Wicked Spoon buffet. China Poblano is pricey, and I'm not surprised to see many folks complain about the small size portions... however, the unusual & high quality ingredients and strong distinct flavors made it unique. The entire concept of a secret Pizza place within a hotel is genius, right down to the broken Galaga machine. Ate there twice, and the big slices were perfect at 1am. Finally, the WS buffet easily blows the Bellagio out of the water, with a good assortment of unusual thrown in with the usual... nothing earth-shatteringly amazing, but where else can you get Udon, fried pig tails, carved bacon, beet salad, spicy mac & cheese and Oreo-gellato on one plate?

I almost don't want to leave the room just for that sole purpose. I could stay on that balcony for hours just chillin hahaha. 

I've now found my alltime favorite drink at the Vesper bar. I suggest you try ""one night in Bangkok"" . Pure amazeballs!!!!

I didn't like the Chandelier much other than the fact it's pretty for pictures. They don't have much selections of specialty drinks. We ended up ordering a screw driver and a long island, which were a waste because that's what I drink while gambling ... for 10$ cheaper. 

Other than the beutiful room, what I love most about this hotel is its convenience. We walked right next door to go to the Bank nightclub at the Bellagio, you could walk across to Walgreens or Planet Hollywood for earl's sandwhich, and you definitely don't want to miss the Wicked spoon buffet. Plus Marquee is right downstairs. 

Can't wait for my next stay here!",12,6,12

I love you and I don't care what anyone thinks.  There is something so sexy about this place.  I have stayed here four times now, and tried out several different rooms, all of which were amazing.  I've dined at most of the restaurants (which are reviewed separately), but on the most recent occasion, I splurged on an amazing wraparound terrace suite for my friend's bachelorette party.  I say splurge, but really I got an amazing deal straight off of Cosmo's website.  If you can afford it, YES IT IS WORTH IT!  Just the balcony itself was out of this world and totally worth the extra $$ to upgrade the view.

There is something about the casino floor itself that I do not enjoy.  I think it is the low ceilings.  But since I am not a gambler, I am content to hang out at the Vespar bar or Chandelier both of which are ultra cool. When this place first opened in December of 2010, I knew it was only a matter of time before people grew tired of the latest offering.  Then I went here and realized that Cosmo's appeal is long-lasting.  With such unique bar and food offerings, free concerts at Book & Stage and free concerts and movies at the pool, this place is just as fun for locals as it is for out-of-towners.  I mean it.

Everything is modern and clean. Upon check in they usually give you the option to upgrade for a small fee. Do it. You'll get pretty much the equivalent of a small suite, in the sense that you'll have a couch and desk area as well as a kitchenette. You'll also get a comfy bathtub as opposed to just a shower. Back to the lobby. So pretty, with original flower arrangements that change seasonally. Make sure to check out the Chandelier bar. It's so beautiful and has great cocktails. If you don't like anything on the menu, the bartenders are good at custom making something you'll love. I recently learned that the different levels of the chandelier bar offer different drink menus. Stop by level 1.5 (yes 1.5) and ask for the drink that has a little flower kind of thing in it. I don't remember the name, but it numbs your mouth and is a fun experience.

We ordered room service around 3am and asked them to charge it to the room. They brought us our food and said we needed to pay cash because our account was flagged as ""cash only"". So my boyfriend had to dress up and go down 20 stories to the front desk at 4am to fix the issue. We wish they would have comped us for the inconvenience.

I've had a harrowing and mind-numbing experience with the Sales staff there, especially the sales person responsible for our account, Nicole Schmitz. After weeks of discussion and finalizing all the details, we received a contract for rooms and meeting space from the Cosmopolitan (roughly $400,000 worth of business for them), which clearly stated on Page 1 that everything was on hold for our group for TWO WEEKS during which time we were to review the 15 page contract and get back with any edits. 

After ONE WEEK, we sent back our comments which were minor - mostly small stuff that had been agreed to, over email discussions, but had not made it in to the contract. We were notified the following day that the Cosmopolitan could no longer honor the contract as they had given away the space to another group. We were shocked as wed spent weeks working together and finalizing details. The sales person was unapologetic and completely not bothered. I requested that she get her director and VP on the phone and that we jointly work out a solution. She said that they were in meetings and then made excuses that they'd left work early.

Worrying about what would happen to our company's event that was being planned for those dates, I emailed the CEO of the Cosmopolitan. No response from him either, for a few days, till their SVP of sales got in touch with us, after repeated follow ups from our side, and with absolutely no apology and a serious lack of concern or customer service basics, said that they'd do the contract as they sent it to us, without any of the terms and conditions that had been agreed to over email. 

At this point they'd already put me through 3 days of hell, while I had to reach out to every property on the strip and find availability for our group over the dates we wanted.

Thankfully in the 3 days that Cosmopolitan ignored us, we were able to get another venue confirmed for our conference. Got lucky.

We have an oversized vehicle and when we arrived at the hotel we were informed that if there was no parking at the hotel itself we would have to drive our vehicle to an oversize lot. There truly was no parking at the hotel our first night there  so we didn't mind driving to the oversize lot and we were shuttled back. The off site parking is a good 15 minutes away. On our second night at the hotel we were able to park at the hotel as there was a lot of available spaces for oversized vehicles. Great, right? Well on our third night we were told we had to park in the off site parking even though there was plenty of spaces available. We asked why and was told all the spaces were taken even though we were told on our first night they were filled on a first come basis.

So many people rav about this place and I've always wanted to stay here so when my birthday came around, I jumped on the Cosmo bandwagon and booked a room here for the one night I was stayin in Vegas.  Before I begin to open up a can of worms about this hotel..let's start off with the good things about this place...Honestly the only reason why the Cosmo is getting 2 star is because of STK, Wicked Spoon, and Marquee. Without those 3 places I would give this place negative stars if I could.

First off...Don't believe the HYPE!!!!! After droppin all that money for an expensive room, you would think that it would be the cleanest room you walked in to...WRONG! I walked in all excited about how sick the room and of course took a tour. In the bathroom drawers there were dirty q-tips, urine on the toliet seat, and the a couple of the white pillows had dirt marks! WTF!!!!! Two words : COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE! The only good thing about this room was the view of the strip and that I fact that I had my own personal jacuzzi\/tub!

I complained and got moved to another room that apparently had a ""better view""...and let me tell you I was fooled.  The woman at the front desk upgraded the room for the inconvenience of the dirty room and when I arrived to my new room...I couldnt believe my eyes! The tracking was coming out of the sliding door, the light in the bathroom didn't work and this amazing view was the freakin view of the pool!!!! Ummmm nobody is chillin at the pool in Nov and trying to lay out when its freakin cold outside!

When I checked out, I looked at the bill and they ended up charging me for the room that I was upgraded too! How do I get moved to a room and am not told that I was being charged...she fooled me with her alleged customer service!  The Cosmo was such a BIG DISAPPOINT and not worth the money that I spent!

The only thing is that you will pay to stay here!! They charge 3 times the amount for snacks in the room and the food is over priced compared to other Marriotts (but to be expected).  The experience started with the valet, just to drive in and see ""Cosmopolitian"" in glass was breathtaking!

Our room was sleek, comfortable, with a touch of sexy. The property itself is massive and can be confusing to navigate. I loved that I never had to walk through the casino everything I needed was on level two and up. 

If you are looking for a great pool party skip Marquee day party, and head to the Boulevard pool. You don't have to pay $500 to sit down, but get there early if you want to snag a chair. 

The Cosmo has a great variety of restaurants ranging from high end to pizza, you can satisfy any craving. We ate at Jaleo and Scarpetta, both were fabulous and completely different. 

Nightlife at the Cosmo did not disappoint! If you want to grab a cocktail there is the magnificient Chandelier bar. Bond is a little more upbeat, and the decor is awesome. If you really want to rage Marquee night club is the spot! Marquee night club is my favorite club in Vegas.

The girls were not excited about getting drinks wearing their airplane comfy clothes.

hotel seems overstaffed which is expected at the beginning but none of the staff seems to have the authority to do anything, or really know anything about what is going on around the hotel... this came to help us later on.

At least they mostly looked nice, and were friendly...

The styling and design of the place is great, room was spacious and had a great balcony overlooking the strip as well as a small sectional living room area for entertaining people. The TV has a great strip of plug ins beneath it so that you can hook up peripherals... so I thought, they don't work and the TV tech, ""needed to ask his manager"". No dice there.

When it came to the small points of service at a ""nice"" place Cosmo gets an ""epic fail"" I don't think any of the attendants actually came back after saying, ""hold on let me find out and get back to you.""

At least there were celebs at the place which was fun to run into. James Marsden asked directions to the spa and Kirsten Dunst complained about her previous night's lover on the escalator.

Because the hotel staff was so aloof we were able to talk ourselves into a preconcert celebrity invite party in one of the ballrooms where we were among more A-listers than I can currently recall as we listened to Florence + The Machine do an acoustic set...

Since my wife and I discovered it last year on our mini-moon I haven't stayed anywhere else on my trips to the city that never sleeps.  I highly recommend getting a premium view room on an upper floor.  The view of the Bellagio fountain is amazing and a completely different experience than watching it from the strip. The rooms have always been clean with all of the cool electronic room controls that guys like me LOVE!  I prefer the 1 bedroom but have stayed in the standard room and both have been comfortable and VERY modern feeling!
   Another nice thing about this property is the diversity of things to do.  Between all of the restaurants, shops, Marquee and all the pools on the property there was never a lack of things to do.  Speaking of the pool, you HAVE to try out the Neapolitan at the main pool for some booze infused ice cream.  
  The spa is a little pricey but it is very clean and has plenty of work out machines to use.  A little suggestion, I used the main gym in the West (?) Tower and had a $20 per day fee...A different time, I used the smaller gym in the East tower with no charge.  Not saying it will work for you, but it's worth a try.

I am sure that the hotel rooms are posh, but this place has HORRIBLE customer service. My friend and I signed up for the Club Identity promotion which provides new members with 100 dollars in free play if you lose 100.  Signing up was not fun because the Club Identity rep was incredibly rude and condescending. She kept cutting us off mid sentence. We each lost our hundred fairly quickly, but when we came to redeem the free play, they refused to give it to us because we has not lost enough.  We each started with 100 and played until it was gone. However, according to Club Identity, my friend only lost 95 and I only lost 80.  When we explained that we both started with 100 and lost the full amount, they said that a slot technician would need to verify the losses on each machine we played- we played quite a few. She then asked us if we understood what a net loss was.  Seriously? It's too bad that such a beautiful hotel has such terrible customer service.  I am a Noir player at MGM and was interested in checking out this casino, but I won't be back. In fact, we refused to pay a penny more to get the free play we already should have had. We have been waiting for about 30 minutes now while the slot tech checks every machine. Stick with the MGM chain or Venetian\/Palazzo.

We've never been disappointed.  Yes, there are minor issues from time to time -- just like there would be at any Vegas strip hotel -- but overall, the Cosmo is great.

This time, we stayed in a wraparound terrace suite (definitely do this if you can, because the room can't be beat).  If you go on a weekday, the prices are reasonable ... especially if you're a frequent guest who gambles there like we do.  We got a promotional offer for a free terrace studio, but when we arrived this time, they had an upgrade to a wraparound terrace suite available for $100 a night.  That's a great deal when you consider these rooms can sometimes go for $600, $700 or more on a busy weekend in season.

Check-in is always smooth.  We had one glitch with a delayed check-in when we arrived on a late Friday afternoon once, but I kind of always expect that in Vegas.  Know your surroundings.  If you're going on a holiday weekend or a late Friday, it's not going to be as easy as on a Tuesday afternoon.

The hotel skews on the younger side... 20s, 30s for sure.  And it's a goodlooking, hip crowd for the most part.  Some d-bag types, yeah.  But isn't that expected in Vegas?  One thing you don't see here:  a lot of families.  And that's good in my eyes.  This is not one of those hotels with kids everywhere or prudes from the midwest on a tight budget.

Staff has always been friendly on our multiple visits -- and again this time on our most recent trip.  Rooms are always top notch, and we've stayed in all sizes of rooms here.  Even their terrace studios are very nice and comfortable.  Bathrooms always exquisite and modern, and the decor inside is hip... even down to the wallpaper in the closet.

Wicked Spoon buffet is great.  It's not at all like a typical Vegas buffet... interesting selections, a lot in individual containers (a big plus).  It's pricey (over $40 per person for dinner), but oddly enough, it's worth it.  The desserts are little works of art.  We've tried most of the restaurants here over the last couple of years and have been disappointed in only one of them -- China Poblano, which is very overrated.  Avoid that one, but the others are all good.

We're not Marquee visitors and not the ""club"" type, per se.  But you don't have to be to stay here.  The hotel is upscale, fun & hip without being all that pretentious.  And it's one of the least smoke-filled casinos on the strip, we've found... plus all rooms are non-smoking.  For those who smoke, nearly every room has a balcony (rare in Vegas, but the views are amazing!).

I figure if you're in Vegas, treat yourself.  The Cosmopolitan is the way to go, in my mind.  We'll see if it changes now that the hotel is being sold, however.   They're undergoing a transition so hopefully it won't change too much.",8,1,13

From the moment you're dropped off into the lobby, you know that you're in for a real treat. People like Kristin, who works at the front desk, simply incredible. Accommodating, polite, and beautiful. She has helped me to get into my preferred tower, and will go above and beyond to make sure that your stay is perfect.

The rooms are nothing short of spectacular. Private balconies on the Las Vegas strip, who knew? Literally worth every penny. Fully stocked refrigerators, full kitchens, big bedrooms, and heavenly beds oh my! But nothing, nothing compares to those wraparound suites. Something like 400sqft of your own private Lanai. Nothing compares.

Having never used the Cosmo for business purposes, my trips on the elevator almost always end at either the first or second floor--for gambling, or for Wicked Spoon. The Wall Street Journal did a bit on how Wicked Spoon, a Las Vegas buffet, could be ""the best restaurant in America."" Good god, it actually might be, this place is unreal. Perfect service, perfect chefs, perfect meals, perfect ambience. The TV screens on the walls display information ranging from the definition of gnocchi to the pranks the chefs play on newcomers to the back of the house. Very fun, very good, very Cosmo.

By the time you get back downstairs to gamble, you should already be on cloud 9. But then you meet people like Maria, the blackjack dealer who works the morning shift late in the week, and your experience gets that much sweeter. Kind, thoughtful, and appreciative. Happy to have players at her table, and even happier to make sure that they're taken care of should they need anything. I took a four-month break from Vegas last year, only to return to Maria, who not only remembered me by name, but asked specifically how my business was doing, remembering intimate details from the last time I'd gambled there. Competitor casinos, are you listening? THIS is customer service.

While I've stayed at many Vegas properties, both on-strip and off, many five-star and world-class and yada yada yada properties... Nothing quite compares to the Cosmopolitan Las Vegas experience. 24-hour room service, the best nightclub in the country, incredible ambience and decor, breathtaking views... But most of all, the best people in the industry I've ever met. Keep doing your thing Cosmopolitan, and I'll keep coming back for more.",0,0,0

It is such a classy casino from the way it looks, to the way it sounds (it's not too loud or chaotic in there), and the drinks were top notch in my opinion. The people working there are extremely friendly; they don't seem to be in rush when you're talking to them like most casinos and genuinely want to have a conversation with you! 

During the time we were there my managed to lose her cell phone and luckily someone was nice enough to turn it in! Thank you to who ever you were and thank you security for having it!

When you walk in, it takes a little while to figure out the vibe of the place, but as you walk around, you sense that it's fresh, young, and stylish. They have art everywhere, and places like the lobby and lounges have different schemes and touches that set them apart from one another. Enough, so that they stick in your mind after you leave the establishment. It was opening night, so I'm assuming that's why everyone was so cheerful and friendly, but I hope it's a quality they keep. 

The only complaints I have are the elevators in the lobby that takes you between the three floors. They are not only slow, but they are extremely small! No more than 10 or 11 people can fit, and if you have a friend who is wheelchair bound like we did, that number is even less. 

Also, the music was a little weird, considering the vibe you get when you go to the hotel. It wasn't exceptionally current, or edgy... However, like I said, it could just be because it was opening and the middle of the week.

This hotel is catered to partyers, so you can expect to be surrounded by lots of smoking, loitering, noise, and boisterous folks. I'm a more subdued person, so this environment isn't necessarily for me, but I do love how nice the hotel itself is. The decor is very modern, they have a ton of good restaurants inside the hotel (which is super convenient), and the location on the strip is awesome, as the Cosmo is across from Planet Hollywood and right next to the Bellagio.

We stayed in a suite, which gave us a huge open view of the strip. The layout of the shower was pretty unique, as it was extra long, ran directly into the bathtub, and had little areas that allowed us to see the bedroom from inside the shower. The living room area was also nice and had some cool lounge furniture. There was some creepy wallpaper in the toilet area, which kind of weirded me out...but otherwise, the suite was fairly comfortable and well-decorated. 

Unfortunately, the bed itself was crazy unsanitary! Although you would assume the rooms would be super clean (considering how expensive they are), we found pubic hairs MULTIPLE times in our bed - even after we asked them to change the sheets!!! I have no idea why this kept happening, but I honestly don't WANT to know. All I can say is...ick!

Besides repeatedly finding pubes in our bed, I was a bit miffed because my sister sent us a special delivery of chocolate strawberries through the hotel. We saw the strawberries and ate them, but the hotel failed to give us the note my sister had left for us, so we were confused. They later sent us an email to apologize for failing to include the note, but I definitely think they could have paid more attention to detail, considering the supposed caliber of their hotel.

We didn't get a chance to check out the spa, but we also checked out the fitness centers. The hotel is divided into two sides, so there's a gym on either side and each one has different equipment. One of them even had a boxing ring, which I thought was pretty cool, even though I didn't use it.

You can read up on how great this place is from countless reviews. I'll just share a couple of my tips that I use on my stays. First off, when I book my room, I always put in a request for the East Tower, lowest floor and closest to the elevator. The West Tower is located in the hotel lobby and is always much busier. It can take quite awhile to get to your room on a busy night. The elevator can stop at 6 or more floors before reaching your floor. Also on the East side of property you have easier access to all of these spots - Starbucks, Sportsbook, all of the restaurants on the 3rd floor (STK and Blue Ribbon are my favorites), The Henry on the first floor (better breakfast than buffet imo), the club Marquee, Boulevard Pool, access to the bridges on 2nd floor (to Aria, Crystals Shops, Planet Hollywood, Mall Shops and Walgreens & more), and also the 2nd floor shops (Stitched and Jason of Beverly Hills are my most visited).

There are a few drawbacks, like a large portion of poolside seating blocked off for ""reservations"" when not a single reservation took place over the five hours I hung out there (maybe change your strategy for the middle of the day?), pricing at the Vesper being all over the place and the nickel and diming for internet and fitness center access.

Check-in area: The new hip and con-temp (Gothic) design of the cosmopolitan Las Vegas mesmerize me from the floors to the ceiling, when I enter the hotel. The smell, atmosphere and the theme is just like it came out from the in side of the magazine ""The Cosmo"" Every where I've walked is GOTHIC ""They kept it dark and sinful feeling, I like it"".   

The Casino\/Sport book: Small gaming area but I had a short memory in the casino. However, the sport book area is O.K. they used one of the store location and converted into a sport booking area. Small but convenience located on the East side tower.  

The ROOM:  I was so excited and can't wait to see what they offer me in my room.

Had some wine and a noodle on the balcony of the hotel. The room is nice and clean modern (new) con-temp.

Walking in from the 2nd level walkway connecting to Crystals, we immediately encounter a bikini shop called Molly Brown's.  And all I can say is WOW!  The live models posing in the skimpy bikinis was enough to gather a huge crowd.  I lost my friends from school almost immediately. Yeah, that crowded :p

Anyway, there is a lot of retail stores in Cosmopolitan.  The place is not big, but I think the square footage allocated to retail is significantly higher than most Las Vegas casinos.  The line up of restaurants are also very impressive, and the prices for dinner in most of them are pretty reasonable by mega resort standards.  Think $20ish for dinner entree, in the teens for appetizers.  The hostesses standing at the entrences of the restaurants are also especially friendly, (Comme Ca) one even approached us and escorted us inside to the balcony area overlooking LV Blvd and the big Bellagio sign.

In spite of the rumor that they mostly stocked the hotel staff with ""models"", I was a little disappointed that I didn't see all that many super attractive women working there.  There were quit a few men that look nice in the tailored suits, but unfortunately I am not into that.

The layout of the casino area also makes Cosmopolitan look especially busy.  Unlike Aria, which is spreadout over a much larger square footage space, the more consolidated arrangement really works for Cosmopolitan.

The art works in Cosmopolitan are also more approachable, in my opinion.  Guests were posing inside giant high heel shoes, which is something that would probably be shunned at in other casinos or museums. The columns of changing displays in the lobby near where I think the guest check-in is, is art, but most people will probably not think it is. Yep, Cosmopolitan has made it easier for the avergae joe to apprece and enjoy art.  Oh yeah, they also have 5 Art-o-Mats, which sells $5 mini works of art.  At first I thought it was a cigarette or cigar machine with fancy wrappers, but they are machines repurposed to sell and promote art.  Pretty cool.

Finding parking in a popular casino garage can often be a pain in the tushy, but a cool feature in the Cosmopolitan garage that will save a lot of time are the green and red lights over each parking slot, which will tell you if the space is occupied or not.  And they of course have the usual signs that tells you howmany spots are available at each parking level. 

Overall, I like it thus far.  And rating based on look and layout, I have to say it is a solid 4 stars.",9,7,6

This is a pretty nice hotel.  The bedding is fantastic.  I have been sleeping really well here.  The bathrobe is excellent, I want to bring it home but alas they charge you $125 for it.  So it shall remain in Vegas.

The casino itself is much less smoky than most of the others on the strip and this girl MUCH appreciates it.  Right across the street from the Miracle Mile, it is about as convenient as it gets.  

If you like burgers, make a stop at Holsteins which is also in the hotel - I am reviewing this one separately.  For pizza lovers, check out Secret Pizza.  It has no sign but staff can direct you to it if you don't find it on your own.  

One important tip -- if you hear a mysterious intermittent beeping in your room, it is likely the secondary phone that is cordless and sits on a charger.  Mine would not sit stable in the cradle and so never charged.  Took me a while to figure out what it was and it drove me crazy for a couple hours.  I dealt with it by taking it apart and removing the battery.  My next step was going to be to smash it to pieces.  

Also, my room did not have a coffee\/tea station and I have to say I really missed this feature.  Bring your Starbucks Via and a mug if you find this lack of caffeine unacceptable.  Otherwise a coffee via room service is $6.

I'm the type of person who likes bright lighting and space (i.e. the Bellagio).  The fact that this hotel was built as a skinny, vertical building next to the Bellagio made the hallways appear very narrow.

First, we are locals and booked a stay here to visit with my parents who came by for a farewell reunion before I leave for the middle east.  My parents are getting up in age and have mobility issues.  The one thing my mother loves is visiting the pools at a hotel, and she will base her hotel selection on the pool alone.  She researched the Cosmo and saw the bamboo pool; a nice, quite, relaxing pool area.  She then called the hotel to confirm that the pool would still be open the third week of October.  She was told specifically that ALL pools would be open until 27 Oct.  THEY LIED. When they checked in, they were told that the Bamboo pool would be closed during their stay.  The main pool that was open is oriented towards younger visitors and plays loud music, not great for an older guest.  They were also put in the opposite tower, based on the Bamboo pool being open, now the walk was too far.  I would have called my credit card, cancelled authorization and walked away from the front desk, but they are nicer than I am.  After the first day, they were moved to the east tower, so at least they could get to the open pool.  This entire sequence is UNACCEPTABLE.  If you tell guests that a facility will be open, it better be open unless something unforeseen happens (there were no issues).

Now to our stay\/room; nice room, spacious, expensive.  The shower is very quirky and difficult to set a constant temperature.  The tub was trendy, but not highly functional.  Climbing in\/out is a bit of a chore and it is not wide enough to stretch your legs.  We had an issue with cooling the room.  The bedroom thermostat went down to 65 degrees, but the bedroom never got near that temp.  We called guest services the last night and they claimed to have fixed it, but it remained the same.  The balcony was nice, but the sliding door was almost impossible to open.

I walked in and the doors were all open and the breeze was blowing and the room just took my breath away.  Everything was so modern and crisp looking.

There were 2 sinks [5 stars alone for this] and 2 bathrooms, one in the hallway...there was a freakin hallway.

The bed was HEAVENLY with so many down pillows and a down duvet. FLUFFY!!! :)

The view is just BREATHTAKING.  If it was warmer and we had more people staying in the room I would have definitely spent more time out on the balconies just chilling and hanging out with friends.

I love the fact that they have sirius XM in the room so we could enjoy music while we got ready.

Formerly a hotel-condo, the property was properly designed for various levels of entertainment.  However, what about a casino?  The casino floor is very tiny compared to many big, corporate resorts on the strip.  It does have a high limit area incorporated on the casino floor-- a handful of tables and slot machines.  The area does get lost among the rest of the casino, for obvious reasons being the size, and does not exactly seem too fancy.  The most horrible part, they took so much money opening night.  Incentives to come back?  Though the resort does entice you to look closer at the enormous Swarovski crystal chandelier, why get any closer to the tables if you exhausted your marker to the last penny.  Wrong move, Cosmo. Wrong move.  

As for the room.  I stayed on the 62nd floor in a 1200 square foot suite, with a wrap around porch.  From the full size Miele equipped kitchen, to the million thread count beddings, the suite was surely one to impress. The wrap around porch does raise some concerns for the rowdy, avid, gambler\/drinker.  One stupid move, and your stay at the Cosmopolitan could cost you more than that crystal chandelier.

We stayed in the Terrace Suite overlooking the Bellagio fountains and it was AMAZIING...we seriously were speechless when we saw the layout, décor, and view...easily the nicest room either of us had ever stayed in...they even had romantic music playing for us when we first got into the room....then, an hour or so later, there was a knock on the door and a concierge hand delivered a gift to us - totally unexpected...it was a box of fancy gourmet chocolates along with a hand written greeting card congratulating us on our engagement...such a special personal touch that just blew us away...the front desk gave us a complimentary late check out and every staff member we encountered during our stay was friendly, helpful, and sincerely happy for us when we told them our big news....5 star rating across the board for any and every category....truly a one of a kind hotel\/casino and they made our special day even that much more enjoyable!

If I'm in Vegas, I hate spending time in a room cause I want to be out & about! But damn, the room here makes me never want to leave.. Not even for buffets or clubbing!

Say bye bye to the days of walking a maze to your room... If you have the rooms facing south, the elevators to the guest rooms are right after the entrance to the hotel where the taxi drops you off (major plus for post clubbing tiredness and when you don't want to walk thru a smokey maze!)

The room itself is GORGEOUS, classy and modern. Highlights:
+ 2 flat screen TVs w your name on it 
+ easy to find light switches (either press down on the labeled buttons to turn off the lamps or do it from the room phone!)
+ Hello\/goodbye switch next to the door for turning off all the lights before you leave or turning them all on
+ control the temperature, lights, etc through the touch screen phone!!
+ Japanese soaking tub with a view
+ extremely comfy bed with more pillows than you'll ever need (I always find the sheets in hotels to be too scratchy but the ones here are actually soft!)
+ terrace overlooking the strip (girls!! Awesome pic opportunities!!) it also includes a lounging chair and ottoman so you can just chill out there.. Awesome!
+ his & her sinks (yay hate sharing sinks)
+ pretty wallpaper both in the bathroom & closet
+ dishwasher microwave and mini fridge 
+ comfy slippers and cute laundry\/shoe bags with quotes on them
+ quietness (we couldn't hear anyone above below or next to us)

The hiccups 
- remote for the tv didn't work
- touchscreen on the phone stopped being responsive
- we were supposed to get a view of the strip but our room faced the south side instead 
- seat on the balcony looked kinda dirty (tip: put a shower towel down before you relax on it)

Overall the hiccups we had werent a big deal.. We were too lazy to contact the front desk to fix the problems so I can't really dock stars off.

In addition this hotel has great pools, a buffet that rivals the Wynn and a club that is 2nd to XS... Stay here for a one stop vacation!",3,1,1

My first trip involved a 36th floor upgrade to a balcony suite overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Needless to say, I spent the evening on my furnished terrace, chugging a bottle of wine and giddy like a school girl at the prospect of a quarter of an hourly water show. 

So, when I returned this last time on a work trip, I casually mentioned to the front desk clerk how boss that suite was. ""You liked it?"" he asked. I nodded. ""Let me see what I can do for you."" And do for me he did. Except this time, he put me two floors from the top (56? 54? 52? I can't remember, but it was definitely two floors from the top), in a one bedroom suite with an even more killer view. Hooooboy, it was epic. 

Wine was had, photos were taken, every person I knew was invited over to imbibe. 

I guess I should talk about the room: the Cosmo is decorated beautifully, very modern but comfy. Very clean. The walk in shower room with Japanese soaking tub is to die for. The beds are comfy. The patio furniture is great, too.

I got a club sandwich from room service that was pretty much a delight, too.

From the moment you enter, you are entertained by its beauty and extravagance.  Checking in was an experience in itself because of the interactive columns in the lobby.  One moment you are watching flowers bloom and the next, steampunk images.  Amazing!

Be prepared to see the most amazing chandelier there is.  It is hard to articulate the size, grandeur and opulence, but it is a sight to see.

We stayed on the 55th floor with a view of the Bellagio water show, the Strip, the Paris Hotel Eiffel Tower and so much more.  And we slept with the curtains open because I wanted to be able to wake up to such a lovely scene.  The room decor was so lovely and comfortable.  The bathroom was an experience with the glass paned shower that looked out into the hotel room (fun!)  Also, the hotel staff were all very friendly and accommodating.  

I highly suggest the Wicked Spoon buffet.  It is well worth the price.  We arrived at 11 am on  Saturday and the line was not long at all.  Seven stations of delicious foods of all types and the service was excellent. We had food and drinks at Chayo Mexican Kitchen, a Mexican\/Chinese fusion spot.  Great menu and great drinks!  We didn't get a chance to eat at Egg Slut, but the food smelled incredible!

The casino was a good experience.  I signed up for Identity membership which immediately gave me free money for gambling and points on every dollar I spent in the hotel and casino.  It should be noted, several of the other ""high end"" hotels do not give you points for the money you spend with them! (We saw Diana Ross in concert at another hotel and the cost of the tickets did not earn us points on their ""rewards"" program).

Overall, this was a very good experience and well worth the money.  I will definitely stay at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas again.",0,0,0

Decided to splurge a bit and go for the Wraparound Suite.  Luckily our suite was right above the Marquee Dayclub and after coming back from Marquee, we could still chill out on the terrace and soak in the party atmosphere.  But don't worry, if the sliding doors are closed you can't hear the blaring music very much at all.  The room was very spacious and was all kinds of pimp.  I particularly liked how the temp and lights could be controlled by the tv.  Very cool.

Walking around the hotel on different floors I really appreciated the aesthetic appeal and design of everything.  This included the nice pieces of art\/decorations they had.

This hotel has more of a mall-like feel to it, rather than a casino hotel.  

That being said, I expected more from the casino floor which doesn't have nearly as much gambling space as other casinos seem to have.  Not too big of a deal to me since I don't gamble much but it was a bit disappointing.

We arrived at 1:30pm, hoping to check-in early (check-in is at 3pm) but our room wasn't ready which wasn't a big deal, as we expected as much.  They gave us our keycards and told us that we will receive a text message when the room becomes available and that it should be ready by 3pm.  We dropped off our bags at the bell desk and walked around... 3pm passes and no text, so we stop by the front desk to check up on it and they tell us that the room hasn't been cleaned yet, and that it takes about an hour to clean.  So we wait... 4pm passes and still no text.  By 4:45pm we head over to the front desk again to check up on our room, which still wasn't ready and they couldn't get an ETA on when the room would be clean.  The front desk personnel that we spoke with, Carl, was nice enough to offer us a $100 food & beverage credit as well as a line pass for our party to the Wicked Spoon buffet.  Finally, at 5pm, we receive a text and head up to the room.

We get up to this gorgeous room to find that it had only been partially cleaned!  It appeared that the towels and bed linens had been changed, but we found gum on the wall right next to the bed!!  In addition, there was garbage laying all around the room, e.g., a half empty water bottle, a cigarette butt, a burger wrapper, a half empty toothpaste tube, and other areas that were dirty.  We called down to housekeeping and they sent someone up within the hour to take care of the garbage.

I know the holidays are a very busy time in Vegas, but they should be able to anticipate the rush!  I wouldn't stay at the Cosmo again - although the hotel was beautiful, the experience didn't live up to the hype.  The dirty room was a huge disappointment and inexcusable.",8,1,1

I suggest any Las Vegas visitor who hasn't seen the Cosmopolitan to check it out. Very unique, eclectic, and targeted towards more the 20s and young 30s demographic. Their club Marquee have already established themselves as a club to be reckoned with the best in town. Their rooms have balconies. The chandelier. 

Being a foodie, I love their restaurants. They make a point to bring in quality organic produce as much as possible, you're never short of a variety of food, whether you want sushi, a great pizza from a secret location, even a restaurant that serves both dim sum and tacos at the same place.

However, if your room doesn't seem to be clean from the last guest, dust still on countertops, stains still left on carpets, it takes away from the good points about this hotel. Even stepping into the elevator a couple of times, there were water spills, perhaps from guests and their drinks. As much as I enjoy the Cosmopolitan for all they're worth, sometimes the simple act of cleaniness of a place as nice as this place could be, would be awesome to see. 

Maybe I've been spoiled staying at places like Vdara and Encore, but I've also stayed at places like the Stratosphere and Palace Station. You expect something from places who want to set themselves apart.

The hotel doesn't feel too large, which is a good thing.  The thing I did not like about it is that the 2nd and 3rd floors, where the shops and restaurants are located, are pretty much empty in between the West and East  towers.  The area is all conference rooms so it was empty.

The hotel is definitely still working out its kinks, as I experienced problems at check-in and check-out.  It took a long time, and the workers also struggled with the concept that I was staying on my company's card for one night and on my personal card for the second.  There also aren't any clear lines for when it's busy, so you could be in line forever and people who arrived after you could check-in\/out before you.

The hotel's theme I guess is modern art and whatnot.  It's not exactly my thing so I didn't love it, but some people certainly really enjoyed the random statues of shoes in the hallway.

The amenities provided in the hotel rooms are just ok and they didn't provide a new set of everything for the second day, which I thought was a bit weird.

We went to bed before midnight on Friday night. We were woken up by incredibly loud bass coming from the hotel's outdoor nightclub at 2 A.M. We were 15 stories above the nightclub, so I can only imagine a large number of other guests were also affected. I put in ear plugs and put a pillow over my head, but the music was still extremely loud. We then called the front desk to ask when the music would end. Guest services told us the music would stop at 4 A.M. Then they became very rude and condescending. They told us that the noise from the night club was common knowledge and that we should have done better research. I don't know what ""common knowledge"" means to an employee at the Cosmopolitan, but it certainly was not common knowledge to us. We ended up taking our blankets and going to sleep on the floor by the door to our room to get further away from the noise. It was uncomfortable, but we were finally able to get some sleep. 

The Cosmopolitan clearly cares far more about being cool than providing basic hospitality. They set up their hotel so loud music from the nightclub affects a large percentage of their guests. They also chose not to provide adequate soundproofing. Despite that, they are okay with blasting music until 4 A.M., and if you have a problem with that, it's your fault because you didn't do adequate research. If it were not for this incident, I would have given the hotel a much higher rating. The interior is much nicer than most other hotels. The rooms are large and the restaurants are good. I am 29, so it's not like I am not in the hotel's target demographic. If you do decide to stay at The Cosmopolitan, and would like to sleep before 4 A.M., request a room far away from the nightclub.",4,0,0

Aesthetically, all the common areas of this hotel are gorgeous from the Chandelier & Vesper bars to the lobby and restaurants. I definitely appreciated not having a casino, not having decrepit smokers on said casino slots and the overall absence of overly-skanked out visitors. There's certainly an air of sophistication here that's missing from every other higher-end hotel from the Four Seasons to the Trump and even the Bellagio. Perhaps it really was those snazzy, seductive ads. 

The first time we were here was for opening week and the service was amazing. We were upgraded to a terrace suite with an unobstructed, magnificent view of the Bellagio fountains and the Strip.

The suite is massive and clocks in at about 500-600 square feet. Modern, spacious--it's definitely a looker. Then there's the view. Simply put, incredible.

After several minutes of messing with the water contrsols I realise the tub has no hot water, an improvement over no water in the shower yes but not what i look forward to in the morning.

I call downstairs and speak to someone at the counter and let them know the water is not working. She asked to re-verify that zero water was coming out of the shower in the first place since it seems :hard to believe that absolutely zero water is coming out of the shower"". I explained that there is indeed no water and at thist ime I have established that taking a shower or bath isand making it to work on time and is not goign to happen. I go downstairs to complain and was told they would call me once they have a supervisor in to go over my stay. Its been 5 days and no call. Great customer service...guess they think im crazy, I dont expect a free room or to be made better than whole...jsut a call back apologizing would have sufficed. My boss who also satyed at the Cosmo encountereed a very similar experieince in his room...he happened to make it in the shower while it turned off though! HE will be posting a video so the Cosmo can re-verify the shower was not working during our stay.",2,3,0

Let me preface this by saying we usually stay at the Wynn. Service and quality are the most important thing to us in a Vegas stay. That being said, this was our first stay at the cosmopolitan and we had a blast! The food was amazing and the employees went above and beyond to make us feel special. 

We booked a wraparound balcony suite for two nights. The room was awesome, however you could tell that this was a party room. It just looked like there had been a party in that room every night for the last year. Other than that we had an amazing time. I listed the folks that made our stay special! 

I emailed the Cosmo concierge before our trip to see if our group could get adjoining rooms in our party. Candice Moreno from the  concierge hooked it up and was so helpful. She got our trip off to a great start even before we arrived! 

Danielle at the front desk checked us in. She was amazing super friendly and helpful.  My wife and I and our other couple asked for joining rooms on the 20th floor. Danielle couldn't promise anything, but she did everything in her power to make her trip special. We ended up with adjoining room and she started our trip off with a bang! she did a great job! Please pass along our thank you's and appreciation for him going above and beyond to make her stay awesome! 

Derek from the front desk called us and told us that our rooms are ready and got us in. He even gave us his direct line if we had any questions or need any help during our stay. Derek went above and beyond his duty making jokes with us and making sure we had a great time at the cosmopolitan! Please pass along our thank you's and appreciation for him going above and beyond to make her stay awesome! 

Jillian or Janelle (I can't remember...strong drinks at the Cosmo tables) Took our room service order for six people. She was so nice she let us special order two giant plate of nachos and she made them special just for us to accommodate our party. The customer service from the room service department was amazing! Please pass on our thanks! Jillian was so awesome and funny, I was so impressed I asked to speak with her manager to pass along our satisfaction with Jillian. The manager (I didn't catch her name) was so nice as well! She sent us a bottle of champagne to thank us for the feedback. Jillian who took our room service order the night of the 28th was amazing!   Please pass along our thank you's and appreciation for him going above and beyond to make her stay awesome!

First let me explain the 4 star rating as opposed to the 5 star... Our check-in was a little rocky. We arrived 2 minutes before the appropriated check-in time and were told that the room was not ready, but they would text us as soon as it became available. About an hour later our room was finally ready and when we opened the door to our room, the maid was still inside doing a final check so we had to wait in the hallway about 5 minutes for her to finish up. So, not a super big deal, but was a little annoying, especially since we were so anxious to check out the room!

Now, let me gush about the extraordinary accommodations at The Cosmopolitan... The room was INCREDIBLE. So spacious and the decor was sophisticated, chic, modern, classy, and full of art. The kitchen was a full, not kitchenette, which was wonderful, they even had bartending\/mixology equipment on the counter to use for mixing your own cocktails in the room! I appreciated the fact that there was a pencil holder full of colored pencils as well as several books around the room that we could read and learn about art. The bathrooms were spacious, wildly decorated in a smart way and were filled with CO Bigelow bath products (Lavender & Mint scent which smelled heavenly) and even came with several toothbrushes and a decent sized Marvis toothpaste. Best bath products I've ever had the pleasure of using in a hotel room. And if you enjoy a divine bubble bath, the Cosmo has big tubs with massagers, ahhhh bliss. The bed was so comfortable that I didn't want to even wake up, felt like a cloud. Also, having a balcony on the strip was remarkable. I loved that so much! I go to Vegas 3-7 times a year, and trust me, there is no better way to enjoy a strip view than from a balcony. 

The hotel staff even went above and beyond in helping my boyfriend arrange a surprise of champagne and a beautiful bouquet of flowers for me (which btw, the flowers lasted over a week, which included a 4.5 hour car ride back to LA). 

The hotel itself is stunning. Between the gorgeous casino, fabulous restaurants, the outrageous bars (Chandelier Lounge being the best), and P3 Art Studio, how could you ever want to leave? My favorite thing to do though is walk around the hotel, casino, and convention areas to admire the impeccably entertaining art hung all around. They also have several old cigarette machines that have been converted to Art-O-Mats, which is where you can purchase $5 pieces of art (either art on a block of wood, wearable art, magnetic art, and more). I really love the sophistication of this hotel, the details in the decor, and the abundance of art that is found throughout. 

Now that I've had the pleasure of staying here, I don't think I could ever stay anywhere else in Las Vegas. I love you Cosmopolitan, thank you for existing.",4,0,5

Billing itself as the newest hotel in Vegas, it's got the look and feel of a $15.00 per day motel. I'll elaborate in a bit, first my list of what is so wrong with the Cosmopolitan.

WRONG LIST 
Staff, every single one could use a basic course in common courtesy and essential service. From the desk clerk at check-in to the arrogant, morons answering phones for their Business Center or the ""Beck & Call"" not one person had any kind of answer to several rudimentary questions, including confirming a package delivery two days earlier. 

The Desk clerk at check-in was a douche bag, a hole that came across like we were interrupting his day.

Housekeeping Staff, 51st floor where are you? A four day stay and not once did these incompetents (if they actually exist) come to clean my room, change towels or bedding, empty trash containers or wipe down one square inch of counter space, floors, etc.

Cosmo charges for Wi-Fi on a daily basis and limits you to two devices, if you've got more; shell out another $15.00 per day. However, you'll be lucky to find either the Wi-Fi or the internet (via Ethernet connection) working. The technology services were almost nonexistent. Maybe Housekeeping manages the IT at this dump.

My room's floor to ceiling exterior glass was filthy, wash the windows.

The rooms carpet looked 20 years old, was stained, smelled and was covers with rust spots from the cheap, cheesy euro-trash furnishings. Doors were worn, painted surfaces showed primer from overuse, gouges, scratches and grim were evident everywhere.

The Samsung flat screen offered NO HD TV and the hotels satellite signal is so bad you get that scrambled digitizes rain fade signal on every channel, at any hour of the day. I expect the fix is a coat hanger and tin foil.

The sinks faucets were installed incorrectly and turn off & on contrary to what any of us would expect, that shows the lack of attention to detail that permeates ""Vegas' newest hotel"".

The casino layout is haphazard, slots of all denominations are scattered, table games are set up along circulation without any buffer for players, so hang onto your wallet or pursue. I make the latter point because Security at the Cosmo SUCKS. In four days I spoke to at least half a dozen guests that were ripped off in the casino floor, elevator and retail area by pick pockets.

The retail shops offer no national or international brands. Marginal merchandise and clerks that seemingly pumped gas before getting their store assignments.

The restaurants, with the exception of Holsteins aren't even marginal; each is too expensive and the menus need complete overhauls, including Jose Andres Mexican Asian combo concept CHINA POBLANO, it was HORRIBLE.

The decor in the common areas is dark wood, poor lighting an 80's look and feel that is depressing. Cosmo should have fired the interior designer as that person was blind and had no taste. These area's entire are filled with an acoustic attack that even a hip hop fan would find obnoxious. The sound system is poorly conceived and executed and; the musically selections have no particular theme, genre or for that matter rational thought.

The Cosmo is catering to a clientele that is very young, cheap, doesn't gamble and brings in cases of beer and vodka, orders delivery pizza and will never patronize any of its restaurants.

Getting a taxi on the side street type main entry is ""hit & miss"" at best. The bellmen are clueless and have no sense of urgency or service. When departing yesterday (Sunday, 04.15.2012) several other guest waiting in a line of 90-100 people ignored the bellman's suggested cost for a town car and negotiated with the driver directly at a far better price per person to the airport. Because there were NO taxis' and the trickle of taxis coming to the Cosmo is insufficient to provide nominally marginal service to Cosmo guests.

I will never stay at the Cosmopolitan again. No value, no fun, no food worth eating, no service, no courtesy, no ambiance and no redeemable value as a hotel, resort or casino. Save your money, sleep on the street or at Blair House, it's cleaner.

I've previously gone with the idea of the cheaper, the better, because why spend time in your room? Well, when at the Cosmo... spend lots of time in your room and on the property!

Hotel:
We booked a 1 bedroom terrace and had a wonderful view of the Las Vegas strip. Definitely spent some time out on the terrace relaxing and taking in the view. 
The soaking bath tub was really deep and had enough room for two. From our window you could see the big Britney and JLo signs from Planet Hollywood.
The bed was so soft and comfortable. And there was lots of lounging space available on the couches.
I've never spent so much time in my room in Vegas. Quality does matter!

Casino:
I spent most of my time gambling at the Cosmo at the Bond bar. Bartenders were quick and skilled with their craft. (Try the Cosmo, so good.) After your first drink, you will need to wait for a drink ticket but if you're actually gambling you will have no problem getting them.

Food:
There's no lack of quality food options in this hotel\/casino. I ate at Milos (been here before) and had the same amazing experience and they remembered me! My husband ordered room service one morning and said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had (thinks it might have been sous vide, it was so tender and juicy).",3,0,4

- Asked for our room to be cleaned multiple times one day, it never got cleaned.
- The bouncers at Marquee are rude. They do not treat hotel guests with respect and it negatively impacts the experience.

You instantly feel all of the above upon crossing through their glass doors. The decor is modern, technologically hip, aesthetically appealing, shiny, sparkly minus any, and all, intent of gaudiness. 

We stayed in their wraparound suite on the 38th floor which overlooked a pretty active part of the strip. Our balcony provided for the most stunning views at night as we were among the lights and glamour of the Paris, Bellagio, Aria, and Planet Hollywood. The use of the word 'breathtaking' would most definitely be an understatement. The rooms were not-so lavishly decorated either but just evenly so.  It sorta also makes you feel like you're in a Scarface scene and young Michelle Pfeiffer would soon walk out of the bathroom looking like her fine self while she dusted off her nose. 

Like most of the other establishments, Cosmopolitan is a one-stop shop. There's a coffee shop, a few clothing stores, lots of restaurants, a super 'wicked' buffet, the Marquee Day\/Night club, the Chandelier Bar, a secret restaurant, tables, slots, other smaller fun stores to whip through as well as a bunch of memorabilia and fancy artwork and prints to admire. My fave was the giant-sized Christian Louboutin creation: it was a red bottom with a prosthetic\/robotic heel - for lack of a better description - that will have to suffice.  It was mega-awesome *sigh*

If you don't think it can get any better, it actually does with the help of their pool; it totally tops off the hotel. It is lavish, accommodating, spacious and clean.  I don't think a pool can get any more attention than this one.

This is important because I have seen the regular rooms and they are not impressive. We were going to an event at the cosmopolitan so decided to get a room there. It was not cheap! It was a large room of about 900 ft.² and another 100 ft.² was a balcony overlooking the Bellagio fountains and the strip. Not too shabby!. Prior to taxes, the room was $940. Expensive! We walked into a very small hallway that immediately opens up into a kitchen followed by a living room with a massive view of the city and then to the left is the bedroom and turn another left and there is a large bathroom. The bedroom also has a glass window patio with an amazing view of the strip. Going back to the entrance, as soon as you walk in, the first door that you will find to your left will be another bathroom with a shower. I was confused by the extra bathroom with the shower because there is only one king bed and the sofa is not meant to be slept on. Therefore, make sure to ask for an extra bed if someone else is sleeping over and you are the only one sleeping in a king bed.
The room is very pretty and well compacted. The view of the city is absolutely spectacular. I will say that it is not cheap so be ready to pay a lot of money.
I rated this five stars but I'm really giving it 4 1\/2 stars because of how expensive it is to stay here. We paid the money because of the event we went to, where we wore very high heels and did not want to walk very far. Otherwise, we would have chosen to stay at another hotel which has large suites that are even larger than this one and the same price with an incredible view.
The location is very cool yet what is great about the cosmopolitan is the large choice of venues that you have. I cannot say that shopping is impressive so I'm not even going to go there. The restaurant choices are really good and plentiful. Their spa is pretty cool and the salon is OK.
Overall, I will stay here again but I hope to find a more affordable price.",0,0,1

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because they would not allow our photographer to come in to take a couple pictures of us in our wedding attire since we did not book our wedding with them, even though we were guest of the hotel.

There was such a disconnect between the personnel--there were other patrons who were in the same situation as us.  Everyone was complaining about how they were being sent to different places.  

Furthermore, when we ordered room service, the food did not come until more than an hour later.  MORE THAN AN HOUR!  That is ridiculous!  I know it's a popular hotel, but really... this defeats the purpose of room service. 

Sure, the look and feel of the room is important, but when one stays in such an expensive hotel, service is super important too.  I really hope they work on this or else I will not be returning.",4,2,2

Now, if it wasn't for this ONE incident, I would definitely give this place 4 (maybe 4.5) stars...  I'm a regular at the Venetian (My fav hotel in Vegas) and the Palazzo and I'm thinking, ""WOW!  the Cosmo is so bad ass!""  The drive into the valet was VERY cool looking.  The walk into the hotel was freaking cool.  The Wicked Spoon was FAB (review soon to come).  And before this ONE incident, I would have definitely tried\/wanted\/booked a weekend at the Cosmo. 

So we just finished a very cool dinner at the Wicked Spoon (The Cosmo's buffet) and was VERY happy with the over all experience.  We go down stairs to pick up our car from the valet and it takes 45 mins to get our car!  WAIT THERE IS MORE!  The reason why it took 45 mins to get our car (Dodge Charger) was that they SCRATCHED THE ROOF!  Yah, THEY SCRATCHED THE ROOF OF OUR RENTAL.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  How do you scratch the roof on a normal sized sedan??!?!  So of course they took some info and they said they would handle it with the rental car company BUT the WORST part was that they gave us a $100 gift card for our troubles.  ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?!?!?  The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas is a PREMIER hotel and all they could do after they fucked up our vacation and our night (WE ASIAN!!!  WE BELIEVE IN LUCK AND THAT FUCKED UP OUR LUCK) is give us a $100 gift card.  WOW!  I am never spending any more money at this place...  EVER!  Yah, everything is Lux...  every other service was awesome...  but you fucked up my car and give us a $100 gift card for our troubles?!??!  REALLY?  I am sure ANY other high end hotel would have given us a free week for our troubles but the Cosmo only gave us a $100 gift card.  GIFT CARD.  Anyone else ever used a gift card in Vegas?  SERIOUSLY?  I'm going to upload the picture of our scratched up car later too for those of you that want to see.  

Would I come back?  NO.  The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas is a fail.  If you enjoy a slap in the face, the Cosmo is for you.  I can't wait to stay at the Venetian again.",6,6,1

The bathroom wasn't too clean there was hair in shower. When it came to the pillows the pillows were just disgusting, the cover was slipping off and there was blood stains and the pillow itself had dark dirty spots all over. The whole thing just made me cringe. Staff is really friendly, and it's nice you get two complimentary tickets to their club, but the room was just not properly cleaned in my opinion. Vegas is dirty, but if I pay that much for a room I expect it to be clean. The hotel is nice at glance, the big disappointment for me was just the cleanliness of the room that's why I'm giving it two stars.",0,0,0

Unfortunately, I cannot give 5 stars as I did not stay there. However, everything else about the Cosmopolitan was 5 stars. They thought of everything anyone would want or need in a Vegas Hotel and Casino. 

The casino floor is Gorgeous. The Second Floor with shops and restaurants is gorgeous. The third floor with Lounges and restaurants is gorgeous and functional! The pool deck is gorgeous and amazing! 

Whoever designed the Cosmo deserves a gold star. Of course, it will be in all it's glory when it's warm out and the pool deck is fully functional, but in the mean time, you can still take advantage of the pool tables, ping pong, and sports watching lounge for free. They also had a conference and ball room area. 

The resort is very functional offering something for everyone. Both kids, adults, and in between can keep occupied there. I wanted to indulge in all they had to offer, but only got to gamble a bit and have some drinks in one of their bar lounges. Service was friendly and scantily dressed, but often slow as they had but one bar tender tasked with making many hand crafted cocktails that graced the menu. Be prepared to pay between $13 and $16 per mixed drink. 

I did peruse the whole place though and was totally impressed! 

We had a cab driver who stayed there the week they opened and said the room was phenomenal and the best room he's had in Vegas. I didn't doubt him.

I didn't think I would like this place because I hate their commercials.  I feel like swinging punches when I hear that awful club music...but anyway, this place is actually gorgeous!  Weird and gorgeous.  Class meets obnoxious, that's the best way I can explain the decor.

The moment you walk in, you are greeted with a very perfume-y aroma, it smells luxurious and clean...not like a Vegas casino. We walked by the Book and Stage bar.  It is a lounge with a Library theme, and you can count on the Cosmo to make a library look hip and cool.  The books are not real, but projections of books on glass walls and pillars.  Awesome!  

The hotel has all kinds of nooks and lounges to rest your feet, with plush seating and gorgeous, rich colors.  The Vesper bar reminds me of a bar Superman would go to.  It reminds me of his icy lair.  We've found several giant stilletos and a group of dog statues on the same floor.  So unusual and memorable!  Strangers (drunk at noon, like us) were egging me on to get in one of the giant stilletos and pose for pictures, I'm surprised I didn't fall out!!

The Chandelier bar is the heart of the hotel, it is definitely a must see when you go to Vegas.  I've also heard of the Secret Pizza lounge, but we were already too messed up from the drinks at the Wicked Spoon and at the Chandelier bar to find it.  I heard it's inside a hallway with vinyl records and that the pizza is the bomb!  Too bad we didn't find it, but we will definitely check it out next time!",16,15,16

Room was actually pretty basic. I thought Encore or Vdara had nicer rooms. No stereo or mp3 player, controller for curtains or lights (unnecessary but still cool) 
Not to mention the shower had a window to towards the beds and the curtain to close it was on the outside...
No privacy when you shower especially during a bros trip.

Earl of Sandwich and Secret Pizza are my go to drunken late night spots and it was convenient to have them like 5 mins away!

Cosmo has lots of shops and restaurants as well as Marquee day and night club. It's in the middle of the strip so the location is perfect. I think that's what I enjoyed most about the hotel. That and just it being so baller.

But too baller where a kid like me can't play a hand of blackjack for less than $25 a hand.

I'll be back. Terrace Studio looks sick since you get the balcony. I did the ol sandwich trick but too many people and conventions to upgrade. Totally worth slipping a dub to potentially get a room that's like 40% more than the basic one. Agent was nice enough to offer my money back, but I appreciated the effort to look up upgrades.

We were on the 56th floor overlooking the fountains, Eiffel Tower, high roller etc. Basically we had an amazing view of the whole strip! The view by itself deserves 5 stars, but let me also say that the Cosmopolitan is the first and only place I've EVER won money when playing slots so that was awesome. The hotel has some really good restaurants as well oh and if you don't want to go out to eat, room service is pretty good and quick but yes, expensive.

Just returned from a 3 night stay over 4th of July weekend 2011.  I have stayed at all of the high end resort\/casino hotels in Las Vegas (Bellagio, Wynn, Aria, Trump, etc....).  I consider my self well versed in these hotels and their offerings.  

The Cosmo is definitely new and 'hip'.  Here are my impressions of just some of the basics:

LAYOUT
takes on a multi-level approach which works well, as restaurants are grouped together and the night club is on a different floor from the casino floor...this prevents foot traffic problems especially for the non-club people.  The casino is on the smaller side, but offers all the games and the cocktail service is quick.  

Check In\/Out
Went smoothly, although the front desk personnel didn't seem happy to be there.  While standing in line, you could tell by their body language and lack of smiles that it wasn't a very 'welcome to the cosmo' vibe.  I did see lots of guests standing in line with packs of beer and alcohol along with their luggage.  For a higher priced hotel, this is not a very good sign, but this is the crowd the Cosmo is trying to attract.  
 
POOLS
The pools were just average and I didn't care for their layouts.  There are 3 of them: 

The Bamboo pool is their 'chill' pool, with mellow lounge music and mostly couples.  The daybeds were arranged around the pool and many of them had semi private locations, which was nice as you didn't have to lay shoulder to shoulder with a smoker while trying to relax.  As stated before, the same people standing in line with their cases of beer, also are to be found roaming the pool areas.  Lots of chain smoking, tattooed, foul mouthed, drunk, people at the pools.  Many of them wearing long basketball shorts pulled down, exposing their underwear.  You know the type.....  again, for a higher end hotel this is unacceptable.  However, the major problem with the bamboo pool is the children.  You will find yourself getting pool water splashed into your $15 mojito when near the edge of the pool.  The life guard on duty seemed to ignore the kids diving and doing flips off of their dad's shoulders, as he was busy talking to a waitress for his entire shift.  It was a definite bummer.  

The Marquis 'dayclub' pool, is exactly that, a day club.  The d-bag factor is through the roof as it would be hard to find a sober person inside.  The music is loud and the people are obnoxious.  Hotel guests get to go in for free, just show your key, but unless you paid hundreds of dollars for a 'table' you will have no where to sit.  

The biggest pool is the Boulevard.  It is best described as a communal area, with some table games like foos-ball, ping pong, etc... daybeds, day chairs and small area for watching sports, similar to a sports book but with day chairs.  The music is also loud, mostly hip-hop and the food service is slow... slowest I have encountered in any Vegas hotel (approx 45 min wait for any food ordered pool-side).  
the view from the boulevard pool is of the strip, you are surrounded by buildings and it's a surreal and pretty nice place to layout and tan.  


ROOMS:
spacious and well designed.  bathrooms are on the smaller side, as they used most of the bathroom space for their shower\/tub area, leaving little room for the sinks.  beds were comfortable, sheets clean.  most of the rooms have kitchenettes with microwave and extra space in the mini bar for any left over food.  all but the most basic rooms have balconies, this is a nice touch but here in lies the BIGGEST problem with the cosmopolitan hotel.  the balconies are large with some nice lounge chairs and small table.  the views are quite nice as well, ours was directly overlooking the bellagio's lake, we could hear and see the show and it was beautiful.  the neighboring balconies are separated by a thick piece of glass, but the glass is attached to the wall in a way that leaves a 2 inch gap between the wall and the glass.  the PROBLEM is that even with the balcony door closed, you can hear every word uttered by your neighbors while on their balcony!  The rooms are all designed where the sliding door leading out to the balcony is in the bedroom just in front of the bed.  So, at nights, when your neighbors come home from partying and drinking and decide to go out onto their balcony and talk and laugh, you are going to wake up.  also, if you leave your balcony door open then expect to be overwhelmed with cigarette smoke since just about every smoker likes to go out on their balconies and do their thing.  

the cosmo is a newer hotel, but it wants to cater to the younger 'hip' crowd with their style.  unfortunately is raises the d-bag factor to a high level and therefore your will be annoyed by young tattoo ridden parents and their ill behaved offspring at the pools, and foul mouthed drunkards on the balconies disturbing your sleep.  

there is nothing intrinsically wrong with the hotel, it is just the people it attracts can annoy you at every venue.",2,1,0
2290776,nLd5i0QXYu1_KP1bdPGs2Q,7dDXpLdVBQ4c3JyJl-KJXQ,5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw,5,2013-05-24,"Okay, I'm a Vegas junkie, and have stayed at quite a few properties on The Strip over the years, but The Cosmo is, by far, my favorite!

I just adore the decor!  It's sexy, sleek, and a bit playful.  Modern, but plush.  Naughty, but nice. The rooms are fabulous, and it's the only hotel on The Strip with actual balconies (so The Hangover is no longer accurate! Ha!).

There is a phenomenal selection of restaurants and bars (Milos is not to miss, and their 24 hour restaurant, The Henry, is fantastic...shortrib eggs Benedict with caviar, need I say more?).

I really appreciate The Cosmo as a wheelchair user - unlike most other popular hotels on The Strip, the entrance to the casino is literally right on the sidewalk...you don't have to travel up a long driveway\/entranceway to get to the front door.  Once you enter, it's a straight walk through the casino (on non-carpeted flooring) to get to the room elevators.  Additionally, The Cosmo doesn't have a huge crowd drawer (such as a conservatory, dancing fountains, talking Greek gods, a shopping mall or a resident show of painted acrobats) to create extra chaos for those of us navigating through the casino in a chair, which is a nice change after dodging tourists, Elvis impersonators and people handing out call girl flyers all day.

I really love that their bathroom goodies (shampoo, bath gel, etc) are C.G. Bigalow - and they have a pretty full collection of Bigalow products in their gift shop, including their famous and fabulous lip glosses and balms, which I am addicted to.

The rooms are great and very accessible - however, my ONE complaint is about the bathroom.  The tile in the bathroom is not slip-resistant.  Kind of silly.  Even if the floor is totally dry, you could easily slide around just wearing socks, which my mom did several times.  Once it is wet, it's a disaster waiting to happen.  Particularly for people with mobility challenges who are able to walk\/stand, you need to be extra cautious.

I've yet to try Wicked Spoon, but I've heard it's a fantastic buffet (even from folks who aren't the biggest buffet fans, which I am not), and hope to go when I visit next time.",3,2,2

I travel a lot for work and have racked up a ton of points and Platinum Elite status, so we decided to stay at the Cosmopolitan (it's a Marriott property).  I'll be honest, I have wanted to stay here since it opened but was not willing to fork over $400\/night. 

THE GOOD:
The property is simply stunning.  The decor is very modern and trendy and the Cosmopolitan also attracts that same kind of clientele.  The people (guests and visitors) who frequented the casino, bars, restaurants, and of course the Marquee were all younger folks who are super dressed up and there to party (as opposed to just gamble like in other casinos).  So if you are looking to stay at where it's ""happening,"" this is the place to be.  Sidenote: the Marquee was the only club in Vegas that was truly happening.  It was kind of sad to see the other hotels desperately trying to get you to go to their clubs (partly a product of the poor economy, Vegas definitely did not have as many visitors as even 2 years ago).  Anyway, a perk for being a guest is that there is a seperate Hotel Guest line for the Marquee.

Check-in lines are very short if you are Platinum Elite with Marriott ( Gold status may have the same access, I'm not sure though).  There is a special line for ""Invited Guests,"" and wait time is probably 5 minutes max. Also, you get free breakfast for you and a guest at the Wicked Spoon buffet.  There is also a VIP line for Platinum Elite allowing you to go in and get seated while everyone else has to wait in line -- definitely a nice perk.  

We stayed at a Terrace Studio and the view was amazing.  We had a perfect view of the strip and were directly over the Bellagio fountain.  The bed, pillows, and sheets were so soft and comfortable I didn't want to get out of bed.  The bathroom is one of the larger ones that I have seen in Vegas hotels.  There is a soaking bathtub with massage jets and a seperate glass shower.  The toilet is enclosed in its own litlte room inside the bathroom.  There are dual sinks, which are super nice\/handy.



THE BAD: Room service\/housekeeping is S-L-O-W.  I called down for extra toiletries, slippers, robes, and toothpaste and it took about an hour for it to finally come.  This is after I called down again about 45 minutes in.  When the person finally came, they forgot some items like the slippers and toothpaste so I had to call down again and it took another 30 minutes for those items to be delivered.  Maybe I should not expect that much from a Vegas hotel but in my experience at other Marriott properties, room service\/housekeeping usually arrives super fast.  (The platinum elite arrival gift also took about an hour to arrive).

Wicked spoon was great since it was free, but not worth the money otherwise.  Bellagio and other buffets on the strip have a way better selection and costs about the same or less.  Don't get me wrong, there was some good food, but not worth the ~$30 cost.


THE UGLY:
The room was clean (pillowcases, sheets, comforter, etc.) and I never felt like it was unsanitary (I'm a germophobe).  However, I did notice that the room was somewhat untidy --the floors had some stains on it, the inside wall of the bathroom had dirty fingerprints on the wall (just one set, probably left by someone fixing something..I hope?).  The glass door to the terrace also had one set of prints.  The terrace had a cigarette butt hanging out.  I know I am being super picky here and it isn't a big deal, but I guess I expected a little more from such an extravagant hotel.  

This hotel is relatively new so I think they are still figuring things out but they need to work on some organization issues.  The platinum elite line for check-in, for example, was not clear.  It simply stated ""Invited Guests"" and the sign wasn't that obvious (although I guess there were velvet ropes, but I didn't really notice).  If it weren't for the Platinum Elite representative calling me ahead of time to let me know that there was a special check-in line, I wouldn't have known.  Also, when we were in line for the Wicked Spoon, my sister asked one of the staff members there who was selling\/serving coffee, if there was a VIP\/Marriott line.  She said there was only one line.  However, as we got closer to the front of the line we saw that there was a seperate line for ""Invited Guests"" which are for VIP\/Platinum Elite and we didn't have to wait at all.  The representative there indicated that there is still confusion within the hotel staff about who belongs where.  Anyway, this isn't a huge deal, but I expect more for such an expensive hotel.

The hotel gets 4 stars because, well, it was amazing to stay at.  It is truly a luxurious hotel with top amenities and great restaurants\/shopping\/clubbing, all within the hotel.  However, it could be cleaner and the staff is not as organized as it could be.",1,1,0

Let me quickly say that if and when you all stay here, you MUST eat breakfast and\/or lunch at Wicked Spoon.  It's nothing short of spectacular (shocking for a buffet).  From the freshest fruit you will ever eat, to your standard (but awesome) breakfast choices (omelette station, pancakes, french toast, cereal, honey yogurt granola, etc), to the pasta station, meat carvers (pork, chicken, shortribs, beef), to the amazing desserts!  I mean, they have a do it yourself strawberry shortcake station!  All the food I listed is really just the beginning, the place is ginormous.

Okay moving on.  The casino is pretty standard.  Lots of scantily-clad women (and prostitutes).  It wasn't as packed as I'd like it to be but I had fun playing craps at 3am (rolled like a rockstar)!  Again, the best part of the casino is the Chandelier Bar.  It's STUNNING, and the cocktail waitresses there were sweet as pie.

The rooms are gorgeous!  I'm not going to lie, I think the best hotel rooms in Vegas are at the Venetian,  but the Cosmo is an insanely close second.  We stayed in the Terrace Studio where you have your own private terrace.  Take that Venetian! We had a great view overlooking the 14th floor pool.  The bathroom is HUGE, you have your own little living room, and the bedding is plush as can be.

And finally, the most important part.  The pools.  Now we went to Encore Beach Club (Wynn) Friday so I'm not sure how their ""Day Club Pool"" is.  On Saturday we spent the whole day nursing our hangovers at the Bamboo pool on the 14th floor.  This is the ""zen"" pool, which is for the adults that just want to relax and lay out.  Before we headed back to our rooms, we checked out the Boulevard Pool which is the ""fun pool"".  It was PACKED so we only stayed for about 5 minutes.  You have to get to that pool at 8am on the DOT if you want to get a spot.

I, and many other angry customers, was ushered into the concierge check in area, presumably so as not to disrupt other customers (one poor couple was scheduled to get married and the bride-to-be had no place to get dressed).
By 6pm we still had no room. I had a car load of food and beverages and friends arriving.  I spoke with the check in manager. After a brief exchange of unpleasantries she finally offered that the reason they were so far behind was they had 80 housekeeping personnel call in that day. ""So you can't manage your own personnel, but you expect me to be confident that you can meet my needs as a guest?"" I asked.
By 6:30 we were finally in a room. It was a wraparound suite, but not overlooking the fountains. Whatever, the whole mood was ruined by then anyway. Oh yeah, and I'm Marriott Gold, but apparently that doesn't matter either. 
Btw, my first clues that this establishment was far from a class act should have been:
1) the punk who dropped his beer bottle down the side of the escalator, nearly hitting a girl in the lounge below (the smirk on his face led me to think it was not an accident), and
2) the drunk girl sitting on a bench outside the elevators and throwing up all over herself and the lobby floor.

Stayed here for one night, but let me tell you we had the most beautiful view and a great room to boot. The City View Room is the only one with a double bed and it has a see-through shower (with shades of course). 

There was a mini fridge in the room but my friend thinks she locked it because after she open and closed it, it wouldn't open. 

The beds are really comfortable. Once I saw the bed I did the ""plop"" test and let me tell you, so comfy! The bathroom is really nice too! There was a vanity mirror in there as well. The only thing I thought that was odd was there was a closet next to the vanity mirror and right across from that was the toilet (seperated by the door). The robs are really comfy too. The Cosmo also uses good toiletry. The brand (I forgot) is a good brand and not a cheap-o-brand, but still it's good if you forget your shower necessities. 

The front desk people are so helpful and nice! One of the best services I've ever had staying at a hotel on the strip. The security people are great too, because when house keeping wouldn't find us a wine opener, security did! They brought it to our room when house keeping actually said ""we are out, you can buy one downstairs in the gift shop."" 

This place is also in the heart of the strip and didn't have to drive anywhere! Well except maybe to China Town, but getting to all the other hotels and clubs was easy and didn't spend a dime on taxi's or anything.

Ran into a bit of a down side while here thought but I would still go back.

The Vegas Cosmo is probably the ""nicest hotel"" most reviewers have ever stayed at on this reviewer thread but the actual value they're getting, for the exorbitant fee paid, is not anywhere equal to what gets financially shoveled into this pile of crap.

Story 1. My Story: 
A. I'm here for a celebration. It's what ""Lost Wages"" is for, no? After hearing horror stories of the last two friends who stayed here this past week, I was really sad to be locked into the hotel's ridiculous 72-hour cancellation policy. I wanted out of staying somewhere guards listen through your room door, & where security cameras are pointed into your room, via the balcony. After leaving real actual quality luxury at the Mandarin, I reluctantly walked into the Cosmo's room &, while I wasn't as disappointed as I was about a lack of quality in my friend's other Cosmo rooms, I just knew the same quality of service I just paid less for at the Mandarin, could never be had at the Cosmopolitan. 

B. Then there's the all hour concerts. So loud they manage to shake 61 stories of concrete & rattle tight metal & glass window fixtures to the core. You will not get much peace in this shit hole.

C. Done to my reservation, & 3 of my other friend's separate reservations all week. 
- We call asking, ""Can we have a room with a view?"" 
- The lady on the phone says no problem. How about the 47th or 55th floor ect ... 
- When we check in the front desk is like - Hey yea, here's your key for your 17th floor room...
- & when we're like, ""But reservations specified we could have a room with a view "" 
- The front desk doesn't care & isn't interested in providing a solution.
- It then takes 5 extra hours to check in while you go in circles with what they originally had offered. 

D. Another complaint is if I am locked into a hotel via a cancellation policy, then the hotel should be locked into providing me everything they're charging me for. Tit for tat.

The most important feature of this hotel is the Bamboo Pool. Of the Cosmo's 3 pools, this is the pool that is a haven from the rest of the d-bag mecca that is the Cosmo... & it's closed for a while apparently. SOooooo I could've been at the Mandarin's unique & peaceful poolside right now, instead of getting all worked up & writing a poor review for the Cosmo - had I known better, ahead of time. I got a $50 refund off my ""resort fee"" since I haven't been able to use anything ""resorty"" but I'd just rather not be here at all... but let me REALLY explain why...

Story 2. My Friend's Suite: 
When you rent $800+ room suite that has a full bar & kitchen, in Vegas - what do you intend to do with that room? My friend had a release party for a piece of equipment he made. There were no more than 15 people in a huge corner suit. The group of folks are not the average dirt bag bro scum club people that would be rowdy. These people were old farts, with kids at home, who were in town to look at geek crap for their businesses. The room was not being loud or rowdy but when I opened the front door to grab some ice there were two security guards just hanging out, outside our door - trying to listen in. They asked me how many people were in the room & I said no more than 15, they said we had 20-minutes to kick people out because a fully equipped suit, with a bar, kitchen, & giant seating room, that has a capacity of 30 people, was only allowed to have 4-people in it at all times. 

Story 3. My other friend's suite: 
This is one of those ""iffy call"" stories. Still makes you wonder... Anyway - another friend rented a $500 room. Invited 8 of us over the come take pictures with him of the beautiful Vegas sunset. There were maybe 10 people in a suite that was designed for double that. There were about 10 people standing on the room's giant balcony taking pictures of a beautiful sunset when security knocked & forced themselves in the room. For 3 hours the Cosmo security argued with my friend about the cameras. The first question anyone wants to know is, how does Cosmo know what's going on in our room? Answer - we figured out there are ""security cameras"" on the outside of the building, looking at private patios & potentially in rooms. The eventual end of the argument went like this, ""Cosmo security will either personally confiscate every camera in the room - OR my friend gets evicted."" It's definitely messy - what occurred, but the biggest question is where & when did the hotel room tenant's privacy become compromised?

Story 4. Head of Security BLABS: 
The head of Cosmo security was at a party for another equipment manufacturer - a fairly large party where everyone who got messed with by Cosmo security were in attendance. Head of security was overheard telling one of the hotel tenant's clients that they were trouble earlier that week. 
1. A conflict of interest &
2. Shady & unprofessional.

Bottom Line: 
Cosmo = Bad business",5,1,0

I went on a weekend trip to Vegas with my girlfriends in February. I booked the hotel in advance with Expedia, so everything was fully paid besides the resort fee. What I should've done was book with my husband's host, but decided not to since Expedia had a great deal. 

First of all, our sink drains did not work the first night we were there. It was so disgusting. How can our drains NOT WORK?! Turns out the maids locked it and had to have maintenance come in and fix it the next day.
That was the least of our problems.
As soon as we check in, the check-in guy ran my cc for a deposit, which blocked my cc\/ then used my friend's cc\/ blocked her cc- we both had to deal with fraud from our banks, and that is very unusual since AMEX never, rarely ever gets blocked.

Then we ordered room service, and found an alive WORM in our fruit salad. My friend even took a video of it moving around in the bowl. That is just flat out disgusting. They need to check their kitchen for some other disturbing insects... if there is ONE that shows, that means there are A LOT more crawling around. That is absolutely unacceptable.
We got a refund for our food, obviously since we did not eat that disgusting meal. I'm surprised their quality control is below average. 
Being so disgusted, I spoke with the resort manager, Milcia Elez. I was surprised that the tone of voice she had while she was speaking to me as if she was trying to get into a fight with me when my friends and I requested for some amenities due to our trip being spoiled with 1) broken sink drains 2) disgusting worm crawling on our food.
She was so rude and disrespectful. I understand that the room was prepaid through Expedia, and would not be able to get partial refund, but at least she could have offered us a complimentary spa day or meal just to show some respect. Instead, she said she would compt the resort fee which is only $50. I mean, I didn't know that my girlfriends and I were worth $50? Its not even about the money, it was the WAY how she was talking to me. I asked her if they had ever found an alive worm in anyones food before- she said she never saw one until now but that accidents do happen. What happened to quality control? That is DISGUSTING. 
Finally I had to just shut her up and say that she is not in the position of talking back to me in that tone of voice. I am the customer and as a manager she should be feeling ashamed and embarrassed of her staff's lack of standards. I told her that she would be hearing from my host.
Its a shame since this was our first time staying at the Cosmopolitan, and will definitely be our last. 
As of hotels in Vegas, Wynn\/Encore is still and always be the best.

A well-designed ventilation system keeps it from smelling of car exhaust.  A nice touch, since after a 5-hour drive, the last thing you want is a headache caused by fumes.

Once inside the hotel, we were amazed by how pristine it was.  I know it's less than 5 years old, but they really did a great job of designing it.  Marble floors, columns with live displays; everything sparkles.  The multitude of chandeliers also adds to the elegance.

The front desk staff is second to none.  They are helpful, friendly, and accommodating.  Mayra checked us in, and we found an immediate kinship with her as fellow musicians.  We arrived fairly late at night, and the type of room we had reserved was unavailable, so Mayra got us upgraded (I mean, WAY upgraded) to a 1200 sq. foot wrap-around suite on the 24th floor of the west tower.  The view from there was spectacular!

Our first night was plagued by loud music, which we thought was from a night club, but turned out to be from an unoccupied private bungalow between the two towers.  Somehow, the sound system in the bungalow had gotten activated and was at full volume.  It cost us one night's sleep, but thankfully, the next day, an extremely pleasant manager named Valerie tracked down the problem and got it resolved for us.  Our remaining nights were noise-free.

WARNING: Don't move anything from the mini-bar, even just to look at it and put it right back.  The sensors will think you took it and will charge you for it.  When we went to check out using the TV, we saw charges from the mini-bar.  However, a quick phone call to the front desk took care of that.  When we went to finish the ""online"" checkout, we kept getting an error message, so I called back to the front desk again.  They completed the checkout for us, and even credited us back for one of the movies we had rented for our ""troubles"".

Oh and walking with a backpack full of valuables into a Michelin-rated restaurant because you have no place to lock them up?  Classy.

Fan of: the pools, the terraces, the shower, the sitting area in the one-bedroom suite, the techie details of the room, the abundance of mid-range (for Vegas) dining in a certain area, and the Chandelier bar for ambiance and killer cocktails.

Not a fan of: check-in kerfuffles (obv), the black walls with silver accents (claustrophobic and oppressive in trying to be luxe), the occasional attitude from otherwise helpful staff, and hearing Pitbull 6 times and Black Eyed Peas 3 times in 20 minutes from the same bar.

The area I wanted to call out that the property does very well is the attention to interior design and the visitor's experience.  The Rockwell Group designed the spaces and their idea was to encapsulate and define the total experience of Las Vegas from the time you arrive, to eating, sleeping and use of the leisure facilities.

You can see evidence of this by looking at the prominent features of the public spaces: The West and East Lobbies, The Chandelier bar, Marquee nightclub and the Jaleo restaurant.  There are so many details to be found in the arrangement and design of the spaces.  You can only appreciate it best when you are there to notice them (so go plan a trip!)

One thing I really appreciate is the self-parking assistance lights and signs that show how many spaces are available and green\/red LED lights mark spaces that are free or open.  It's not perfect but it is better than a regular parking garage.",3,1,3

The woman at the front desk was friendly and told us the room was not ready, which was fine since check-in time is technically 3pm. So we went to the buffet to eat first. (buffet is good)

Came back to the front desk at 3:45pm, and different woman at the front desk told us our room was not ready. Now I'm concerned b\/c check-in time is supposed to be 3pm. The woman told us check-in is between 3-5pm, which is crazy b\/c no hotel does that, and that's not what it says on the website. B\/c we were upset, she started getting attitude and told us the room was not ready (no explanation), that they would call us when it was ready and that there were other people waiting ahead of us for rooms. She said she had no idea when the room would be ready and was completely unconcerned that we would have to sit around the hotel and wait until god knows when for a room to be ""ready.""

We sat around the hotel and waited until about 5:20pm, since we were told 5pm and were waiting for them to call. We were tired and tried to take naps on the couches near one of the lounges, since we had nothing else to do. Went back to the front desk around 6pm to check, b\/c no one called us, and a different woman at the front desk told us our room was still not ready! She said the rooms just hadn't been cleaned yet. This one was more accommodating and understanding, so eventually she found us a room that was clean and it was an upgrade from the room we reserved. We were just grateful and giddy to finally be getting a room so we could put our things down. Especially since were only staying one night, and check-out is supposed to be 11am - I was worried we'd be sitting around all night waiting and then have to go to sleep and check out the whole rest of the trip!

The room was beautiful, huge, w\/ a fantastic view. Loved it, but we just didn't have any time or energy to really enjoy it. We got into the room around 6:30pm and put our stuff down. We were so tired from the ordeal that we didn't gamble or try a restaurant like we planned. We just stumbled out to find food real quick, walk around a bit, and went to sleep. Then we had to check out at 11a the next morning. Oh, and the 3\/4 bathroom had not been cleaned - there was a sucked out lime in the sink and beverages on the counter. But we were fine with that; we just didn't use that bathroom.

It's such a huge disappointment b\/c I love everything about the atmosphere, decor, and location of the Cosmo, and I really thought it was going to be my favorite place in Vegas now (I come about once a month). Now I'm very cautious and reluctant to try going there again, and I'll caution everyone I know about staying there. I understand it's new and might need some time to adjust, but it's really unacceptable that people can't get into a room until 7pm. And we weren't the only ones waiting - the lobby was full of unhappy and angry people, some of whom had been waiting since 10 or 11am for a room and still didn't have one by 6:30p. When check-out is 11a and check-in is 3p, there's 4 hrs to clean rooms, and every reserved room should be clean and available by 3pm. It was a Sunday night, and not a busy weekend. I shudder to think what's going to happen next week when Chinese New Year, a UFC fight, and the Superbowl converges on Vegas! I've traveled a LOT in the past 10 yrs, and all over the world, and I've never experienced anything like this. I'm afraid to think what the service would've been like at the pool, nightclub, restaurants, spa, and gym, if I'd had the chance to utilize any of those things.

I'd like to give the Cosmo another chance, maybe in a few months, and hope things improve considerably. If they do, then it'd probably be my new favorite hotel on the strip. If not, then I just can't ever go back again, no matter how nice the rooms are. Please work on it!!",1,0,0

- have a drink at one of the many levels of The Chandelier Bar. Each level has a different drink menu.
- Go to concerts at The Blvd Pool. Very laid back and everyone there to enjoy the music. It's a different venue to hold a concert, sometimes the empty the pool, sometimes they don't. The best part of the pool is the Neapolitan - adult ice cream place that catches up to you quickly!
- Great restaurants like: Comme Ca, Holsteins, STK, Secret Pizza. 
- The rooms are great and the penthouse suite is phenomenal! With the penthouse, you can't beat having your entire room controlled by a tablet. Need a butler? just push a button. Yes - they do come to just take photos for you of you and your friends.

Then I updated my ranking of the Cosmo to 3 stars after they read my review and reached out to me, noting that they use reviews to improve their services and asking to make things right by us. I now have to update my review again, to a 5-star ranking, as my hubby and I did return to Vegas for a short stay, and our stay here was everything most other reviewers have written: luxurious, indulgent, posh. It was everything we expected from the Cosmo from the get-go. This time, they did not disappoint.

We got to the hotel around 10 or 11am, well before the 3pm check-in time. Joey at the front desk got us a room that was available at that time, so we didn't have to wait until 3pm. And wow, stunning, stunning room. (Well, I always said, even in my first review, that the hotel is gorgeous and the rooms well-appointed). What a beautiful room, with a large balcony and a bathroom that was as big as our living room and kitchen combined back home. We felt like royalty. (This was on my birthday and our anniversary, too, so it was a special trip for us. Our first, without the kids, too. Wow!). I just loved to death the bathroom: sunken hot tub overlooking the Strip and shower, with towel rack and shelving in the middle. A huge, tiled room. And as before, they had the loveliest lotions and potions (shower gels, shampoo, conditioners, soaps, in lavender and peppermint scents. Not to masculine, not too feminine. Just right for anyone. Refreshing. Nice formulations, too). The area with the double sinks had a luxe magnifying mirror for make-up applications, Q-tips and cotton balls, mouthwash and more. There were plush terry robes and slippers for our use. Great hairblower. Like before, we got a kick out of the wallpaper in the separate toilet room (you can see different...images, the closer you look. So look close! Then again, maybe it's just us...... Haha!). 

The bed and pillows were so comfy and hubby read some of the cool table books in the room, presumably left as décor but hey, good reads! The closet was huge and we liked how there was an upholstered, large bench by the closets containing extra bed linens and pillows if needed. 

At the front of the room was a living area with a large, plush sofa, chairs and coffee table, and a nearby microwave, fridge and freezer, dishwasher and cupboards. Across the way was a desk with all the work tools one might need to work. 

There was contemporary artwork throughout. And the room was pristine clean throughout.

All I can say is: WOW.

Unlike at our last visit, we didn't see any room service trays in the hallways. Not a one. 

The hallways were totally quiet at night. No yelling, no loud talking, nada, not in the hall outside our room, or in adjacent rooms, or on other balconies. 

The hotel and casino were swanky, as they were before. It really is one of the prettiest and ""hippest"" casino-hotels on the Strip. And again, the location is prime: situated smack dab in the middle of the Strip, with connecting bridges on the second floor to the Miracle Mile shops and Planet Hollywood or to the Crystals shops\/Aria hotel. Can't get more central than that!

I wanted to give a shout-out to Dora who initially reached out to me after our first visit here, and to Joey at the front desk who was so incredible in getting us an available room early, and to Emily to called us to make sure everything was ok, and to the guy at the front counter when we checked out (darn it, I don't have his name, but he made the whole check-out process quick and smooth). Not a glitch throughout the whole stay here. It was an A-class place, as we expected it to be from the start. We are now Cosmo converts for life!",1,0,3

The room was gorgeous, loved the modern decor and incredible views of the Bellagio fountain {ask for a fountain view when you check-in!}. The room was SUPER clean and not dated. The only bummer was that they do not have coffee makers in the rooms. Even super cheap hotels have these! I was so confused, but I guess that is Vegas for ya! They have a great variety of restaurants and shopping in the hotel - one of the highlights was Egg Slut! We spent a great deal of time playing the slots downstairs and the cocktail waitresses were always attentive! Their mimosas were on point. I've been to other casinos where you have to hunt them down but not here! The location is perfect and right in the center of everything. We laid by their pool one day and it was fun, but extremely pricey drinks! For 4 drinks it was $80 with tip. They were delicious though! That is the norm in Vegas, I suppose. Our pool server was the sweetest and made the experience a great one. I would absolutely stay at The Cosmo when coming to Vegas again!",7,2,5

When I was checking in on 3\/26\/13 I did not have the same credit card that I used to prepay on 1\/7\/13 and the Cosmo made me pay again.  To say I was annoyed would be an understatement, especially since I had stayed in the Encore by Wynn ,the night before and the manager said it was OK to use another card because I had paid for the room in January!  Why was I not informed of this policy when I made my reservation by phone?  What if the card had been lost, stolen or in my case, it had a new number.  I contacted Marriott because this is one of their boutique hotels and I received an answer that was not an answer.  I am a Marriott member and I had already booked about 17 nights before this incident.  Now I am  wavering.  I contacted Chase and they had never heard of such a policy and wondered why the Cosmo didn't call them.

In the future when I am in Las Vegas I plan to stay at the Encore, which is a fabulous hotel in beauty as well as customer service.

4\/13\/13 Oh yeah, the Cosmo refunded my first payment to my credit card.  Thank God it was not the credit card that I had closed.  What would have happened to my money?  Anyway, since I had no balance on that card I had to call Chase and have them to send me the refund so that I could pay the other credit card. The check arrived in the mail yesterday, everything is finally completed.  What an experience.",4,1,1

Just from passing through Cosmo on my previous trips to Vegas, I've been pretty fond of the place.  Their location is fantastic (between the Bellagio and Aria\/City Center, and across the street from PH and Paris), and the design and décor are pretty awesome (particularly the ""changing art"" in the elevators and lobby).  And while they aren't as large as other hotels on the strip, they have a ton to offer - the latest hot spot in Vegas (Marquee), restaurants galore (Holsteins!), a three level bar (The Chandelier), late night eats (Secret Pizza), shops (Kid Robot!) and my favorite buffet (Wicked Spoon!).  Despite all that though, it was my stay at Cosmo that impressed me the most.

While my friends and I have always wanted to try out the Cosmopolitan, their room rates have always pushed us towards cheaper alternatives.  As fate would have it though, a couple of my friends were able to find a great deal online for the weekend we were going - only $140 a night!  However, with suites going for just $20 more a night, I decided to upgrade myself.  Yes, you read that right - a suite just for myself...and it was the BEST.  DECISION.  EVER.  The suite was ridiculously nice - king size bed (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=q5V5Gp8j2gKI67Tsn1CU5w), separate ""living room"" area (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=3LtdG6s3yKaRruPsy1sqbA), kitchenette (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=eUnijzgD54vUz7BhZANnJw), walkout balcony (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=3n1FgIqv2yDFrDpYLob72w), two flat screen TV's, separate tub and shower (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=svlV_W_Z81nArE3oubllCg), dual sinks(http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=5lxiFXsbbJxtzeZ63l9a0w)...way more than I actually need from a hotel room.  And it was awesome! 

Even though my stay was great, their service made it that much better - every worker I talked to (front desk, maids, dealers, pit bosses, Beck and Call guys, bell hops) was super nice and friendly.  Cosmo offers so much to love and so little to dislike, I could only come up with one bad thing about them - now that I've spoiled myself with one of their suites, I don't know how I'm going to be able to go back to a regular room.

Crud.

**Quick notes:
- On Friday nights, guys staying at Cosmo can get into Marquee free until 11:00pm, provided they have a 1:1 ratio.
- There are two towers - East is closer to the main part of the casino while West is closer to the front desk\/Wicked Spoon.  My friend had the same suite as I did in the East Tower, but his room seemed smaller.  Not sure if that's the case for every room or not though.",9,8,8

Their rooms don't have a usb cable for your IPOD, the concierges solution?  Go buy one across the walkway at the giftshop (and points). Pool staff seemed annoyed to be working today.

We checked into a one bedroom suite for 3 nights, and upon check-in, we knew something was off kilter with the service.  It was very clear the girl at the desk has never worked in a hotel before (""you're staying for 4 nights right?  What?  Oh, only 3 nights?  Oh.  Ok.  Whatever.""), but we got to our room which was actually quite nice.  By 10pm and after a long day of traveling and sight seeing, we were looking forward to a good night's sleep.  WRONG.  We walked into our room and everything was vibrating.  There was a pool party going on at Marquis, a nightclub inside the hotel, and there was thumping house music blaring SO loud, everything in the bedroom was vibrating.  We looked out the balcony and sure enough, from the 29th floor, we could hear EVERYTHING.  We looked into the hotel book and it said that weekend pool parties end at 11pm, and we thought we'd be safe.  By 11h30pm, it was louder.  I kept my composure and called the concierge desk and they said ""Oh it's going to go till 4am tonight and tomorrow night"".  When I asked what they can do about this, they offered ear plugs.  Just so everyone knows, when music is THAT loud, ear plugs don't do anything.  When I asked to speak to the general manager to switch to a quieter room, he said ""the hotel is fully booked, so we can't switch your room"".  This was TOTAL BS, as Vegas hotels do NOT fill up easily, and when I went online to book a sample room for that night, there was plenty of availability in the hotel.  I told him he could give us a cheaper room, that a DOWNGRADE as long as it's QUIET, was totally ok with us.  With many phone calls back and forth with all levels of management, they were extremely abrupt and all responded with ""You're only getting earplugs"".  This was totally unacceptable.  We called our credit card company and thankfully, they re-booked us at another hotel for that night.  
There are good reasons why locals hate this hotel.  Between the bad service, the noise, and the hoardes of fist-pumping 20-somethings falling over drunk in the lobby and casino every night, the only extravagance in this hotel is tackiness.

The good: Private balcony, some (and I mean some, definitely not all) very nice, friendly and very helpful staff... quick repairs, nice view. Spacious bathroom w\/separate jacuzzi tub (I paid for this though).  Good central location.

The BAD:
1) COCKROACH(!!!) WALKING ON TOILET..a cockroach is never a friend you want to see anywhere, let alone a bathroom (especially if you were just sitting on said toilet).  Need I say more?

2)Rude checkout person.  I was made to feel as if I was looking for a freebie when I let her know what I experienced.  Barely got an 'I'm sorry'.  Felt brushed off.

3) BROKEN SHOWER 
Cold and\/or scalding hot showers are not fun.  This issue was fixed quickly after two of us had horrible ice cold\/scalding hot showers and complained (one of us got sick afterwards after shivering from the cold water, she's still sick to this day!!).  The repairs, although prompt,  made me late for an important event since I wasn't able to get in the shower when I needed to.

4) BROKEN MINI FRIDGE
This issue took a while for us to determine that it was actually broken, after many tries of lowering the temp with no result we finally called.  They sent a replacement, but the replacement was all beat up and ugly, we placed it on the desk (ourselves) and then couldn't change the TV with the remote due to the fridge being in the way haha..  (Filet mignon leftovers- ruined.)

5) COULDN'T REACH CONCIERGE DESK
I tried calling the concierge to find out about some nightclubs.  After explaining what I was calling about I got cut off.  And again it happened, then I was put on hold for what seemed like forever.  Finally called guest services and even he couldn't get through!  So he gave us a $100 food credit to use in one of the hotel restaurants.  We used the credit for breakfast, which was nice, but at checkout I was told that my $15 tip was not included in that credit and was added to my bill.  Not a big deal at all, just would've been nice to know this prior to dining!

6) NOT ENOUGH ROBES
I booked the room for 3 people, only got 2 robes, and one of my guests couldn't fit into the robe.  This was a female guest who was not obese at all!

7) EXPECTED HIGHER QUALITY 
When I travel, I prefer to pay more and stay in 5 star hotels.  I was very underwhelmed with the Cosmo.  It's a hotel that wants to be 5 star, but it's really a 3-4 star in my opinion.  Especially the walk from the elevator to the room, it definitely felt like a cheaper hotel.  I'm sorry now that I made this choice.

NOTE: After I experienced the cold checkout person, I called from the lobby to speak to a manager.  Was put on hold for about ten mins, and then told I'd receive a call back in ten minutes.  I NEVER got any call back, but finally I did receive a brief email once I was back home saying we are sorry for your inconveniences.",4,1,0

Visited Vegas for the first time last weekend and decided to stay at the Cosmopolitan.  Was there with a friend from Friday night to Monday morning.  I loved it!!  We were given a ""City View"" room with 2 Queen beds and the guy at the desk gave us options for which floor.  The room had a great view of part of the Strip to the left and mountains to the right (and the airport too).  It was perfectly large with super comfy beds and lots of pillows.  The bathroom is the nicest hotel bathroom I've ever used.  The stall-type shower is huge with a glass door on one side and a floor-to-ceiling window on the other side.  That window looked into the sleeping area but had blinds so you could decide if you were feeling voyeuristic or not...or if you just wanted to watch tv while you showered I guess.  The vanity section had double sinks and there was a separate toilet area...for those who care about that sort of thing.  I'm normally a frequenter of hotels in the Days Inn price range so this room was a real step up for me...but if you're going to go to Vegas, you might as well splurge a little and do it right!  It will be tough to go back to the economy hotels now.  

This place is beautiful and trendy.  It is modern but with a classic, throwback twist.  The decor is sleek but the details are old-school:  40s & 50s influences in some of the decor are in lots of places in the hotel.  From retro phones and sofas in the lobby to framed photos of pin-ups in the hallways, there is definitely a sexy, vintage vibe overlaying the sleek modernity of the place.  The lobby features ever changing video columns that correspond to videos in the elevators.  The Vesper bar in the lobby is glittery and classy.  The Chandelier bar is a 3-story bar inside a crystal chandelier - yes, inside.  Each of the 3 levels has different signature drinks so you can have a different experience at each level if you wish.  My friend & I tried a couple of the drinks on 2 of the levels and all were very tasty and well made.  

We knew we wanted to see a couple of shows while we were in Vegas so we opted to have the concierge take care of the tickets for us.  During the weekend, we spoke to 2 different concierges and both were incredibly nice and helpful.  They got us exactly what we wanted and we even got a great discount for one of the shows we saw.  The hotel has so many great restaurants, it would be easy just to do all your dining on site.  We had breakfast twice at The Henry which is by the casino downstairs at the entrance to the Strip.  The food was fantastic and hearty and the staff was attentive (but not too much) and wonderful.  We had dinner at Holstein's on our first night there (exhausted from traveling & very hungry) and weren't disappointed. I'm going to save my detailed comments about those places for my actual reviews of them rather than waste time here.

I'm not going to say much about the casino here because that wasn't my main reason for choosing this hotel.  It seemed to me to be a pretty standard casino.  However, it does have a section in which girls dance on the bars during the course of the evening.  I didn't see that in other casinos so if that's your thing, there ya go.  There are shops in one of the towers (same tower as the restaurants and casino) and the building connects via covered walkway over the street to The Aria next door.  From there you can walk via another over street walkway to The Mandarin or you can take a tram to a couple of the other nearby hotels which is convenient.

Generally speaking, I loved this place.  It is not a family-friendly place, in my opinion (which I'm good with since I don't have kids).  It seems to cater more toward the young professional through to the slightly less young professional (that'd be my age group).  I liked the details and the staff were incredibly friendly, helpful, and genuine.  The only negatives I can really comment on were the less than clean hallway carpet and the apparent length of time it takes to come pick up room service trays\/carts.  There were a couple of times I saw trays\/carts outside of rooms on my hallway and they would sit there for hours and hours...overnight in one case.  I would say it is pricey, but I knew what I was getting into so that is a non-issue.  Oh, and random fact:  the bedside table didn't contain a Bible, but had a book of erotic Japanese art instead.

And, clearly I didn't succeed in being brief.",2,4,1

The first time I visited this hotel & casino over the weekend I really liked it. From the club music and loud thumping bass pumped up at the entrance to the lovely scent of refreshingly random female perfume to the scantily clad employees working the cocktail lounge and card tables, this casino seemed like paradise. But paradise like this comes at a price.
First of all this place had some sort of attitude. You could feel the vibe. You could feel it through interactions. The employees seemed like they had better places to be or things to do. The patrons seemed souless or quite possibly fake. Pretentiousness was in the air.
Am I in a casino? What is this place?

It's definitely glitzy, glamorous and posh. You could tell this casino was designed and furnished by a female or group of females. It has a feminine touch, character, and style.

DO:
- Go to secret pizza ($5.00\/slice) open till 4am
- Visit the entrance on the right side of the building
- Smile at the table dealers

DON'T:
- Waste your money at the restaurants. Nothing here really impressed me in the culinary department.
- Gamble at the slots. Didn't see many winners here.
- Eat at the buffet. The desserts looked amazing, but everything else looked like cheap quality.",1,1,0

What I have not liked is how they have treated me since my stay. Prior to my stay we had a price set (it's in my confirmation email) of $1017 and with tax figured it would be about $1100ish. It was for the Wraparound Terrace Suite (which was really nice). When I was checking out of their hotel, I tried to do so on the TV until I noticed a charge of about $3300 (3x agreed amount). I called down and explained what I had in my confirmation email and they said stuff about upgrading twice (only did once), so I figured it'd be best to go down and explain.  

I came down and spoke to the cashier and he brought up these two upgrade fees (again bogus) and other fees totaling the $3300, in which case I showed him the confirmation email I had received. I told him that this is what I had agreed to pay for the room and wouldn't have booked it if it was going to be that much. I was not going to pay more than what I had agreed to. He spoke to the head cashier who was behind him and then went and talked to someone hire up behind the scenes. 

While the original cashier was speaking to someone in the back, the head cashier was nice and said we would get it taken care of.  The original guy came back about 10 minutes later stating that they (the Cosmo) had messed up and they were going to remove all the charges that had been added on and I was just going to have to pay a little over $800 (I had put a deposit of $320 a couple months earlier) for the remaining balance.  I'm looking at the receipt as I type up this review. Everything seemed fine and we were on our way back to NYC. 

Now, a couple weeks later, I'm looking at my bank statement to find a charge for just under $3300 from the Cosmopolitan. I called to speak to them but they are saying in a phone call that I agreed to this amount.  I had got cut off in my original phone call and had to call back when booking and that's when I agreed to the price in which they sent me in my confirmation email ($1100 roughly). I have the email and the receipt from when I left the hotel and never authorized this ridiculous charge but they are yet to refund me the approximate $2500 they overcharged me. This cannot be legal and I now have my bank looking into it. They really have put a damper into the vacation experience there. Well, back to Encore we go.",13,1,0

1.  Check-ins:
The gentleman who checked us in at the front-desk was really nice.  We didn't ask for any upgrades, he was nice enough to upgrade our room to a strip view with Bellagio Water Fountains without extra charge.  This is one of the top reasons I'm giving two stars instead of one.  

2.  Bed Bugs
I know it is hard to believe, but yes, you heard me right - we found bed bugs in the room!!!  My five-year old first found a moving object in the bed and she thought it was ""an ant"".  My husband took a look and found it's not an ant, but a bed bug!!!  We could not believe what we saw (this is a FIVE-STAR hotel and is very NEW!!!) and did a thorough check.  We found two more! We called the front-desk immediately and asked to switch to a different room.  Front-desk was VERY unfriendly AND impatient, put us on hold many times and cut us off without even let us finish talking.  Then they gave us a room without the view and said ""you should not have been given that room (the original room with view) to begin with"".  So we had to pack everything again and move to another room at 10:30pm - after a three-hour walk on the strip downstairs.

3.  No Room Service
We did NOT get a room service!  We made sure not putting ""Do Not Disturb"" sign out because we really need it - with a five-year old, you know we really need that.  I'm hoping it was just a mistake, maybe caused by us switching rooms?  No matter what, it is NOT acceptable.

During checkout, we talked to a manager and told him what we have just experienced.  He was nice and friendly.  He was surprised and said they will investigate.  He offered free breakfast as an apology for what happened to us however we could not take it as we need to go.  He said we should have told the security once we found bed bugs.  However, how do we know that?  And why didn't the front-desk tell us that when we called them?

when we went outside there was a bunch of used up cigarettes on The table and some left over garbage. ( and I don't smoke) but Went back inside and the extra blanket they gave us for our pull out bed had a stain on it. So we called down to the front and told them about this, they only came with a new blanket and had someone make the bed. But completely forgot about the used cigarettes and garbage on the balcony, but we just let it go. Than we noticed that half the of the lights all over our room was burnt out !!!! And some weren't turning off completely. So once again we call downstairs and they send someone to come and fixes it and he does and than he leaves. But that's not even the worst part. On Saturday before we went to a day party I had left my
Purse on the bed with my wallet that had 500$ in it. I know this because I counted it right before we left for the pool party we came back later and The 1st thing j noticed is the fresh towels in the bathroom and they also had made and my bed and my purse was off to the side of the bed a little. Not thinking anything of it I grab my purse and tell my friends I am hungry and that I am gonna go get some food. So walked till a found a place I could buy a water bottle, asked the clerk how much It was and he said 5.80$ so I reached into my wallet and noticed that I had no cash inside of it at all. So went back to hotel and called downstairs they said they would send security and they did but the security guard they sent it was her 1st case which didn't help me feel any better but basically she took a photo of my purse and the bed and asked me a few questions and said I should fill out a police report. So I did and I asked to speak to the manager and they all basically said they couldn't do shit for me and I should fill out a police report!! I mean come on they didn't even offer to give us a free meal considering the maids stole money that was suppose to spent on food and etc. I checked out the next day and I got an email saying they couldn't find my cash !! Well of course you couldn't find my cash The maids either hid it or spent it. What they should have done is watch the tapes of who cleaned my room and figured it out but they sat back and did nothing. Considering another friend who is a professional makeup artist who had stayed here also her makeup bag with makeup worth over 800$ and they didn't do shit for that either leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

The room was great overall but the lighting fixtures had minds of their own switching on and off. The top floors of the hotel only has a bank of 6 elevators for floors 47-61. This was a bad move when they built this property
I never have had to wait sooo long for the elevators.

It took me all of 5 minutes to come across The Cosmopolitan and I knew right away that this is where I wanted to stay. I read through countless reviews first and was worried it would be considerably out of our price range...but it wasn't! It was actually only $60 more than we were going to spend at the other hotel. I showed my husband the pictures and reviews and we booked a room that night. 

We arrived on Sunday October 18th- Valet is quick and friendly; it's a major step up from any other valet we've ever used,  which is many. 
Check in: We were up to the counter within 30 seconds of walking up. Check in was very fast and the staff is really friendly. We were offered an upgraded room for $30 more which we quickly said yes to; which turned out to be a very wise choice. 

Our room was INCREDIBLE. Very clean (which is SUPER important to me). It was nice and quiet throughout the hallways; no loud patrons, parties, etc.
We walked into our room to a nice seating area (living room). The room had a stocked mini fridge and a basket of goodies (not free I'll add). There's also cabinet space, sink and microwave. There's a cute 'office' area with a desk, desk lamp, television and phone. Then you enter the ""changing"" area\/closet and full length mirrors. There's even a cute ottoman in the middle of the room which we used to set our luggage on. The bathroom vanity has double sinks and a lighted makeup mirror that can be sectioned off by a sliding door. The toilet is separated behind its own door. The shower is stunning with a tub at the other end as you walk through; you can soak in the tub with a nice view of the strip as you look out the window. The bedroom is a bedroom. Bed, nightstands, television and phone. The bed was super comfortable. Too bad you can fold it up and take it home with you lol. The shower has a clear glass door and window on the opposite side that faces the bedroom, the tub has an opening (no window) that also faces the bedroom..need some privacy? They have blinds that can be pulled down :) The entire room is equipped with light dimmers which can make for a calm and even romantic evening. 

We had a private balcony with a little loveseat & ottomon with a table and ashtray  (there's no smoking IN the room). We had the BEST view of the strip. We spent much of our time sitting\/standing on the terrace just taking in the view. We were lucky enough to experience thunder\/lightning and some heavy rain and we were able to enjoy it out on the terrace :)

The casino is really nice. A nice selection of games. We didn't hit it big lol. Its what you expect when you go to gamble; you hope to win but you expect to lose. Luckily we didn't lose our entire gambling budget but that may be because we didn't gamble a while lot. We found other things to do in Vegas. Walk the strip, go to the show, visit the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop, check out the Clark County Museum...

Money- After all was said and done and with a dinner room service charge for two people, one night, our bill came to $400. We don't go to Vegas all the time, actually, this was my first time in Vegas, EVER. So in my opinion it was worth it. I have amazing photos and wonderful memories. You can't put a price on that :)

I highly recommend this hotel\/casino and we'll definitely be back. As a matter of fact, the room\/view in itself made me want to stay in Vegas forever, no kidding.",0,0,0

Several problems, for several people in my party, during the check in process, room designation and stay. Minor issues for myself.

Wicked Spoon was mediocre.

The casino itself is a lot of fun. However, the slots and tables are tight. I finished up, close to a few hundred; but a buddy and his goon squad, left about $2k on the table.

Yes, they attract a younger crowd, yes there's a chance you'll hear\/see someone having sex on their next door balcony as I did last night, and no it's not going to make you forget the attention to detail of the Wynn; but it' a great place to stay.  

Rooms are very nicely appointed, he balcony is obviously a very nice touch, especially if you are facing the Bellagio fountains.  Property is very easy to navigate for the most part.   Sports book is hard to find, or take seriously, given the size, location and ... well it's pretty small.  

The chandelier bar is very impressive, I guess no televisions was a conscious choice and probably the right one as everyone seemed to enjoy people watching, chandalier watching and their cocktails.

Glitch during the say was the aforementioned televisions, the ones in the room.  For reasons still unexplained all of the guests in the entire property were unable to watch television because it was ""out"".  Now ... I know what you are thinking, ""it's Vegas, who goes to watch television in their room??""

I stayed here twice within the first few months that the hotel was open and did encounter a few issues, but I will chalk them up to working out the kinks of a new hotel.  The very first time I stayed there I had a faulty room door, someone else's food still in my mini-bar fridge and the TV system went down one night (which is a particular issue here because most of the systems-- TV, phone, lights, etc.-- are all interconnected).

The second time I checked in early and there were no rooms, which is to be expected.  When I finally did get to check in, I went to my room and someone else's things were in there-- AGH! Scary stuff.  Thank goodness it was only someone's stuff and not someone, but still.

The Marquee is also conveniently downstairs and free to hotel guests before midnight! The wicked spoon buffet is also right downstairs and some promotions will give dining money you can use here.

I am proud to say that I have a new ""HOME"" (sorry guys, you were great it's now time to move on to better things)

The Cosmo is bananas, great service, phenomenal rooms with very modern decor AND some of the BEST views of the strip that I have ever witnessed... I know this sounds like a commercial, but it is all true..

I stayed here in late march and was actually @ the Palazzo when my buddy and his wife decided to ""go the other way"" and check in to the Cosmo, upon him checking in, he immediately  called me and told me to come check out his room... I was sold.. We actually called the Cosmo and they gave us a helluva rate after they learned we were leaving another hotel just to stay with them.. Alex (won't give out his last name) at the front desk was nothing less than professional and he even upgraded us to a  wraparound  terrace suite with a balcony that was literally  50 feet long on the 65th floor overlooking the world...

(our view was over overlooking the strip more..and MUCH higher)

Two FULL bathrooms, free WiFi, full size washer and dryer (really??) full kitchen with dishwasher, Sub Zero Fridge and a wine cooler?? Don't forget the fully automated lighting system that controls the entire suite from your TV remote or other locations strategically placed by every door... Crazy..

Now you will have to pay for this pizazz somewhere, and the restaurants and bars on site are of course a little more pricey than most places on the strip, but the cool factor and service is great, I suggest getting an ""Identity Membership"" from right outside the lobby entrance, EVERYTHING you buy NOT just gambling goes towards your rating, so you can rack up points fast for future perks...

There was ONE not so cool thing I couldn't quite grip is the fact that this hotel charges you to drink the coffee supplied in the rooms. I don't think I have ever stayed at a hotel that EVER made me pay for a cup of Joe...

Overall, I'll still give it a 5...

The terrace balcony was unlike anything I had experienced in Vegas, the view was unreal. The glass wall was a little dirty, but only on the outside. Looking at the hotel, I could only imagine how difficult it would be to clean that glass from the outside.... It would probably be very costly considering it would require window washers at extreme heights.

The Lobby\/Casino: The lobby and casino were a lot darker than I had imagined, but they were well ventilated, and the walkway through the casino was a nice, straight shot to the Strip. No mazes or confusing paths to get out, I really liked that. The casino floor, while smaller than most, was thoughtfully planned out, and the Chandelier bar in the center was a beautiful meeting spot. The casino staff were hit or miss, some were very friendly, while a couple of staff I encountered had poor attitudes. But again, I didn't know their names because they weren't wearing name tags.

Bamboo: This is the quieter, more serene pool with gentle music. The pool itself if beautiful, but small by Vegas standards. I t did have a large shallow area for sitting, which was nice to be able to cool off without submerging oneself. The drawback of this pool is that it is so small, that there really aren't nearly enough loungers to meet the needs of their guests. By 11:00, you would be very hard pressed to find one, much less two.
Boulevard: While it isn't the Marquee pool, on a Saturday afternoon, you could easily mistake it for it. Although it isn't advertised as a Party Pool, it should probably be classified as such. By 2:00 on Saturday, there were nearly 150+ people in the actual pool, wall to wall bodies drinking, playing with beach balls and lots of socializing\/wild behavior. Warning: THIS ISN'T A POOL FOR CHILDREN!! I saw one woman walk in with a toddler, and immediately walk out realizing that this was not a good fit. At several points I smelled pot being smoked. I would say 95% of the pool goers at Boulevard were between the ages of 19-35, lots of good looking people. However, finding a lounge chair at Boulevard after 10:00 on weekend is like finding the Holy Grail, you have to chair-stalk people if you arrive too late. The staff will help you find one if you ask, but people were really territorial and claimed that their friends were sitting on spots, even though they hadn't touched the chairs in hours. Needless to say, this pool is also way too small for a hotel of this size.

Nightlife: This hotel comes alive after 10:00, people pour in from all over the strip. They are dressed up and ready to go out. You won't see people in UFC attire or middle aged women with fanny packs. You really don't need to actually go to Marquee to experience this hotel's nightlife, the bars and casino floor are packed with people who have come out to party. 

Proximity\/Location: I would say that Cosmo is probably one of the best values in terms of location on the strip. It is considered center, but another advantage it has is that the strip is very easy to access, from various points in the building. We liked that the hotel had a catwalk to Miracle Mile, which has a brand new, jumbo size 24-hour Walgreens attached. We stocked up on food, beer and all the toiletries we'd forgotten. Also, there is a McDonald's and a variety of other bargain food options nearby. 

Overall, considering the price we paid, I would definitely stay at Cosmo again if we got the same room for the same rate.",5,0,2

They had everything from Mac and Cheese, mini hot dog weiners, to Hibachi (seafood only), grilled chicken, beef, and omg the gelato. I left the buffet feeling as though I had a food child inside of me. It was pricey ($44.00\/per person) but it was so worth it.

My two favorite parts of the Cosmo are the lobby area & the grand chandelier. Definitely explore the hotel & check out all the details in their design. They have cool art to take pictures with like their giant Louboutin shoes.

Another reviewer stated that it's as if Sex in the City were a hotel.  I couldn't agree more :)  We're from Seattle and were looking for a fun place to celebrate my 40th.  I'm a frequent business traveler and Marriott Platinum member, so we stayed on points.  Overall we were very impressed with the design, artwork, food, and restaurant staff, but this hotel has problems with its front-of-house staff and housekeeping.

(1) Concierge screwed up our airport shuttle reservation.  After waiting over an hour past our reservation time at the airport and multiple phone calls, gave up and hailed a $20 cab

(2) Check-in clerk was rude and uncaring, even after explaining our airport wait.  No apology.  Not even a mention or a thank you for being a Marriott Platinum member.

(3) Before departing for our first morning out on the strip, my wife hangs a ""Clean Please"" sign on the door.  When we return in the afternoon, we get a slip under the door saying they skipped our room per our request.  Seems housekeeping didn't even read the sign and just assumed it was a ""Do Not Disturb"".  Prior to heading out for our show, we call and ask for a cleaning.  When we return later that night, the room had visibly been cleaned, but no replacement washcloths or hand-towels.  Baffling.

The Good:

- Stunning hotel, beautiful artwork throughout
- Outstanding rooms and tech - control lighting\/climate through the TV! 
- Great restaurants and top-notch servers (found out later they were unaffiliated with the hotel)
- Great bartenders in the Chandelier Bar - extremely friendly, know their booze, and were just plain fun to talk to

The Bad:

-  Wi-Fi almost useless in our room (2606).  Only got connected once the entire stay.
- Loud at night - thumping bass until early in the AM coming from their night-time spot, The Marquee Club.
- This hotel seems to be for the Paris Hilton or Jersey Shore wannabee crowd - lots of young kids doing what young kids do - getting hammered and yelling at the tops of their lungs in the hallways at 5am (no kidding).  If you're in this age range, perhaps this is a positive?
- EXPENSIVE!  Don't stay here if you're on a tight budget.  Thankfully we stayed on points and could afford to spend the extra $$$.
- Our room was in the West Tower, overlooking the City Center and Crystal shopping center - horrible view.  As other reviewers have pointed out, be sure to ask for an East Tower room overlooking the Bellagio fountains.

In summary, I think this hotel is still trying to figure out the hotel business.  They have all the ingredients to be the best on the strip - brilliant location, awe-inspiring design, classy restaurants with friendly servers\/bartenders - but the first person you meet is the check-in staff and that alone nearly ruined our entire experience, along with incompetence and lack of followup from the concierge desk.  It wasn't until we interacted with the rest of the folks onsite that we really began to have a good time.  I wouldn't mind checking them out again in a year or two to see if they've matured, but if I end up going back to Vegas prior to that, I'll likely stay at a comparable property, like the Bellagio or Wynn's.",2,1,0

When we go to Vegas we usually stay at the Bellagio, but this time my fiancé let me pick the hotel. So I picked the cosmopolitan, because I thought the balcony would be nice.  That was a mistake. The carpet was gross, the tub had hair in it, the shower leaked thru the glass and got the carpet wet, the cushions on the balcony had cigarette burns and stains all over, I had to request turn down service, because the first night no one came to our room to do it when we were gone. The food was NOTHING to write home about. It was flavorless.  I expect for the price that we paid for the room and the room service, to have a clean room and great food. OH!!! and the SLOWEST elevators EVER! And so so many young people yelling up and down the hall and slamming doors. 
One thing I do have to say and the reason I gave them 2stars was the staff was very friendly, room service (even if it wasn't good) was fast and when they did deliver the food they pointed out that the tip was already included (which doesn't happen that often) plus they always asked if they could do anything else for me before they left. Very pleasant staff.

My girlfriend always wanted to stay here but the prices per night were always too high. Luckily we saw they had a black friday deal where each night was 50% off. We booked the terrace one bedroom. We checked into the hotel around 9am. Check in is not till 3pm but for $50 you can check in early at 11am. We were going to do that since we were exhausted from our flight but the hotel clerk informed us we could upgrade us to a terrace suite for $50 and the room was available right now. So we chose the upgrade since it was the same price. I definitely recommend getting the terrace suite. We were not disappointed at all. We had two full bathrooms to get ready in, a kitchen with a upgraded fridge. the average fridges have a mini bar which are sensored and a small freezer you can use. Our fridge had the same mini bar but also an empty shelf above it and empty door shelves along with 2 freezers. It also had a microwave, oven and dishwasher. The dishwasher was locked but there aren't any dishes in the room so it didn't matter. We got a fountain view with a balcony that can be accessed from the living room or bedroom. They have automatic dimming light switches so when you get into your room hit the ""welcome"" button and all the lights turn on. When you leave hit the ""goodbye"" and they all turn off. We stayed in the west tower which is a further walk to the strip but it really isn't an issue. Get off at floor 1 and walk through the casino or floor 2 if you want to walk across the street to planet hollywood. Everything in the hotel is very upscaled and chic.

A couple things I didnt like:

*HORRIBLE SERVICE - The best service came from their valet\/bell boys.  Seriously, these guys were friendly and on top of their stuff.  The front desk needs to be put in check.  We had people that got checked in to rooms that already had other guests in there, we asked for adjoining rooms and were switched rooms multiple times because they could not figure this out and we were delivered an incorrect room service order which they would not credit until they physically came to our room to investigate it.  This was at 2am ... and we had to stay up and wait for someone to come to the room because they couldnt credit a sandwich.

*HORRIBLE SIGNAGE - I guess this place was intended to be used for residential condos but you can never figure out where you're going.  There are multiple pools and there's no way to figure most of them out without asking someone.  The pool we were trying to get to was on a floor shared by the conference center, had no signs pointing you in the right direction when you got out of the elevators and you had to go out a set of doors that looked like an emergency exit to another set of doors that didnt mark that a pool was there.

The Strip's competitors at her price point, like the Wynn and the Venetian, tend to attract an older crowd from my experience. I've stayed here on several occasions, most recently for bachelor party. The hotel has a few positives going for it that make it a reliably good choice:

1) Da Club: each hotel room typically comes with two tickets to their night club - Marquis - which is pretty good, even with over-priced drinks. Two club tickets per hotel room can be a godsend if you are with an army of Y-chromosomes trying to get into a roaring club sans the friendship of a promoter.
2) Food: The Cosmo has the best buffet in Vegas - the Wicked Spoon - located inside. Just go downstairs and eat until you hate yourself. 
3) Nice rooms: Many of which have great views of the strip. That being said, I think some other hotels in Vegas have more beautiful and creatively designed rooms, like the SLS (see my review of that place for a pic of a room there). 
4) Good location: The Cosmo is right smack in the middle of the most happening part of the Strip, so you won't have to take a shuttle or shlep a mile in oppressive desert heat.

The Terrance suites at 40 floors with view of the strip! Awesome!!! The hot tube in the room with view of the strip!!! Unbelievable and relax! Nice n clean room and big!!

While the newest on the Strip, it definitely is over done, gone way overboard on the public area decorating and broke the bank on the decorating.  Well it's Vegas so I guess that is what is expected.

I just attended the conference here, did not stay in the rooms.  I hear the rooms are great but you need a 14 year old that is skilled in electronic operations to run the room.

The Chandelier bar was literally a 3 story chandelier bar.  It looked tacky.  Imagine beaded (fake) crystal strands of rope that is designed to look like a hanging lamp?

The lobby was cool.  Columns with LED panels that would change graphics every 10 minutes or so.  A matching panel behind the front desk.  Leaves falling, library shelves\/books and light bulbs.  Very cool.

Conference area was well appointed and fairly high tech.  Interactive touch screen panels that included an interface to the hotels functions of the day and a map to point you in the right direction.  Bathrooms seemed on short supply.  

I was lucky enough to be there for a catering conference.  We had a back of house tour.  Amazing what little bit of space is in the back of the house to produce for 150,000 square feet of banquet space.  All well thought out.

rooms are nice too! contemporary furniture, lots of mirrors, and pretty big bathrooms. if you want a view of the bellagio fountains, you wanna request the east tower but the west tower is closer to valet and lobby. if you are coming with a group, you DEF need to request the same tower because it's SUPER confusing to go from tower to tower!

They also have rooms overlooking Bellagio and you are able to see the water show from the balcony.

Walking through the lobby and going up multiple escalators to Scarpetta for dinner is a high energy, dazzling experience, at least on this Saturday night.

Whereas most casinos follow up Wynn's concept of ""sprawling smaller buildings and shops in front with a panoramic taller structure in the back for rooms"" plan, you have The Cosmopolitan, a union property of vintage and sleek modern.  While not the most elegant of atmospheres, it offers a fun, funky, and sophisticated space that rather than overwhelm you with various large establishments, gives you samples of small bars and restaurants.  You can explore the space, finding a little something around this corner and a little bar around there and it's honestly brilliant.  There's nothing like that on the strip right now and it's simply fun just to walk around the establishment and see what it has to offer.  No shops offering budget-breaking items that you would hope one day to afford but shops that shockingly sell -affordable- items.  

The Chandelier Bar is near iconic.  It goes and goes, with a never ending mass of crystals that just devour the space.  The signature cocktails are something and it gives you a wonderful view to people watch.

-The Bond bar?  Great.  
-Henry's 24-hour steakhouse?  Very good.  Being able to sit and watch people stroll by through the glass?  Neat!

The kicker?  The old-school pizza joint on the third floor that pulls me back to a corner in North Jersey.  It made me so nostalgic for home that I couldn't help but grin.  The vintage record player, art pieces, pool tables, and everything else on that third floor space is so unique to the strip, with the low ceiling and vintage stained glass.

Combine all this with some excellent restaurants such as Comme Ca and Blue Ribbon Sushi and you've got yourself a property that doesn't seek to reinvent the wheel but take everything that makes it fun and repackage it.  And I love it.  

Currently my favorite property to sit and people watch with a cocktail.  You're a breath of fresh air, Cosmo.  You're the hot property on the strip to be seen at and I'm a fan.",2,0,1

The valet system, where we could scan our ticket and only had to wait minutes for our vehicle was a very nice touch -- not to mention there were two bottles of water in the cup holder of our rental car.

He is an awful miserable person that seems to get off on the power trip of being a manager and getting to tell people ""no"".
Like I said...I was on my HONEYMOON, and this man literally made me cry and showed ZERO compassion or tact in dealing with me--a perfectly reasonable customer who really did nothing wrong. 
Basically, the room was a generous wedding gift from my Uncles...and the reservations department dropped the ball and failed to inform my uncles that if we didn't just happen to carry around his credit card (who does that??) that they would need to send in an additional authorization form before check in....I was informed by the first person I talked to that this could quickly be emailed by my uncles to the hotel, so we got that going, then she brought over her manager--John Dodds, and this is where it all went down hill...
He came out and sternly told me that authorization forms actually take 2-10 days to process and they're not going to be able to check me in, so I would have to pay for the room out of pocket...I calmly explained to him that I was on my honeymoon and the room was a gift--that I didn't really have it like that and couldn't pay for the room myself (not to mention I shouldn't have to since this had been set up months in advance as a gift and confirmed the week before and no mention of this had been made)....and I said since the reservations department messed up and didn't get this going on the several occasions they'd been in contact with my uncle they must have some way of making an exception and expediting the authorization process..
He told me that was not his problem, that I would just have to pay for it or not stay with them...

My husband took off and started looking for flights home....Tears filled my eyes and I said look we just got married last night, we had kind of a rough night and morning and we are only here for 2 days and we are really looking to turn this around and have a nice honeymoon and this is really putting a wrench in things and starting to ruin our honeymoon too...and he said ""I'm not ruining your honeymoon, you're ruining your own honeymoon!"" He also told me it was a ""potential loss of revenue"" to help us, and he would rather we leave and forfeit the $1300 booking we had there. Are you kidding me?!?! 
THIS GUY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK TO GUESTS....if I had to base my review of the Cosmopolitan solely on this guy I would seriously give a 1 star review and wish I could give 0...I work in customer service and I know how hard it can be but I would NEVER DREAM of speaking to a crying customer on her honeymoon like that. Most horrendous customer service I've ever received! Hands down.

HOWEVER...after we were turned away and I talked my husband into staying and making the best of our honeymoon (even though he REALLY didn't want to give this place any money after that interaction) 
I went back in and asked the check in attendant to speak to someone with some compassion and tact and maybe a little bit of training in managerial skills and conflict resolution, and she brought Kendahl to us. GOOD LORD, THANK YOU FOR KENDAHL! He immediately apologized for our experience on behalf of the hotel, spoke to my uncles and expedited the authorization process, and we were checked in within the hour. He also upgraded our room and gave us a late checkout since we'd spent half our first day in the lobby, me in tears, my husband ready to scrap our whole trip...and he completely turned it around for us. The room was beautiful, view was gorgeous, the restaurants were top notch---tried Scarpetta, Wicked Spoon and Momofuku\/Milk and all of them were incredible. 

So in conclusion:
0 stars to John Dodds the worst resort manager of all time who yall should really consider firing to save the reputation of your beautiful hotel and all future guests experiences.

5000 Stars to Kendahl, seriously, whatever you're paying him isn't enough. Only reason this review isn't 1 star. Saved our honeymoon! s\/o to you Kendahl!

Ok, fine, problem solved even though the lady said they charged me twice, but that she will fix it so that I will be charged only once.

Fast forward, went to COSMO, room was ok although for that price, the shower shouldn't have nasty water and scum stains...had fun,but just checked my cc, and they charged me again for the same charge on my checkout date. Wtf?!! So, somehow I'm assuming my payment didn't show up prepaid?! Fine! So, to fix THEIR MISTAKE, I waste MY time calling them to get my money back, and get transferred twice, talked to lady about overcharge, then she said she'll look up my account, put me on hold while they look it up. As I'm on hold, I hear the music.. music.. then clicks like someone picked up (no music), then music, then click, then ringing, then all of a sudden, ""you have reached the accounting department, and blah blah blah, CLOSE! Please leave a message.. Blah blah blah...' 

Ok... Thought they may have pressed the wrong button, so hung up and called them again, and got this RUDE A$$ LADY WITH MUCHO ATTITUDE. I'm trying to explain that there was a lady helping me and put me on hold, so please transfer me back. She starts going off telling me that it's an accounting problem, they're closed, nothing they can do, probably why the girl forwarded my call to voicemail, yadda yadda yadda.

However, it still manages to remain a warm atmosphere with extremely friendly staff. There are private and semi-private bars tucked away at the ends of winding staircases throughout 3 transparent floors in the middle of the building, that top out with a shopping floor with some fantastic shops. Everywhere you turn there is something interesting to look at, whether it is a piece of modern art, crystal sculpture, or the fully-automated gaming tables that are lit from within.

I was here for one night to participate in a friend's bachelor's party. We stayed in the Wraparound Terrace Suite.  The glass doors open to an expansive, wraparound private terrace allowing fresh air and sunlight to pour into suite's spacious interior. With panoramic views of the Vegas skyline, the suite has a sleek, modern kitchen with a Sub-Zero minibar, microwave, oven, stove and dishwater. An in-suite washer\/dryer is also included. Three majestic sliding glass doors leading to a private terrace, separate dining area, stocked bar, and Samsung plasma-screen TVs. 

The hotel is situated across from the Miracle Mile shopping area, the Bellagio, and the Paris, in a prime location. If you want a new and spectacular Vegas experience, you can't go wrong with the Cosmopolitan in my opinion.",7,3,5

Had friends visit Vegas couple times and stayed at the rooms. A defo must! Either a city view or fountain view - still a great view! Even the room decor and furniture are eye candy. Seriously, where can I buy those art works?!

Man, this place did not disappoint.  I've read some other reviews about customer service and issues with room keys, housekeeping, etc and for the most part, I would say our experience was a lot different than the negative ones seen in other reviews.

Our room was beautiful and clean.  We somehow scored a room on the 51st floor overlooking the strip.  Our terrace view was epic.  The terrace was the biggest selling point for us.  The bathroom was huge and contained a large walk-in shower and a soaking tub with a window that overlooked the strip.  The sleeping area was nice and the bed was super comfortable.  The sitting area was huge and had a couch, desk, minibar, sink, big screen TV and dishwasher, which we found random.  The closet area was huge and the iron worked well.  Safe worked well too.  There are random books placed throughout the room, which were pointless to us, but a neat way of being different.  I love the lighting features of the room.  By pushing a button on the phone or by the entry door you can control all of the lights in the room.  Great way of just laying down, hitting a button and going to sleep.

The hotel as a whole is beautiful.  Completely geared to 30 to 40 year olds with a lot of modern flare and chic details.  The check-in area is fun with huge LED columns that change constantly.  There are lots of restaurant options.  We've eaten at Henri and Comme Ca, which were both great.  Bond bar is fun late at night with interesting drinks and go-go dancers shakin' it above the crowd.  Light system in Bond is great!  We didn't make it to Marquee, but from what we heard and saw, it's THE place to be in Vegas right now.

We only went to the Boulevard pool, but it had a neat vibe.  You can play pool, Foosball and PS3.  Drinks at the bar are pricey, but that's pretty much anywhere you go in Vegas these days.  Get there early for a lounge chair, otherwise, there really are not many places to sit unless you want to spend the coin on a cabana or daybed.  Have Tyler make his ginger mojito.  Fantastic!  Music could have been a little louder, but it was nice.

Now, here are a couple of the challenges we ran into.  When we checked in, the original room faced the mountains.  We waited a couple hours for a different room and like I said somehow got that great view on floor 51.  The problem we ran into was, they had given us our keys and said they would be activated when the room was ready.  Upon receiving the phone call for our room we entered the elevator, put our key in to access the floor and the key did not work.  Someone else had activated floor 51 for us.  When we got to our room, the key didn't work.  We had to go all the way back down to the front desk to get new keys.  They fixed it for us right away and the key worked fine.  The card readers in the elevators are a little goofy, but you'll get the hang of it.

I think the biggest downfall to the Cosmo was the housekeeping.  Yes, our bed was made every day and the bathroom was cleaned as well.  The garbage, however, was not emptied daily, and I do not believe the ice container was cleaned out.  The mini-bar was not replenished during our entire stay, but that wasn't a big deal since we didn't use it much at all.  Also, when we first arrived in our room there was a large wet spot on the carpet just outside of the soaking tub.  My guess is that it was used shortly before we checked in and the room was cleaned.  The terraces are also not cleaned daily.  I used a glass for cigarette buts and it wasn't touched the entire stay.  Also, found a used condom on the terrace, which was thrown from above I'm sure.  That wasn't cleaned after we returned back to our room.  Otherwise, everything was very upscale.  I think people need to remember this is Las Vegas, so crazy stuff is bound to be found and happen.

We had a light burn out in the toilet area of the bathroom.  I called to have it replaced and when we returned to our room it was done.  Overall customer service was good.

Shower could have had more water pressure.  I think that was my only real complaint.  

The good of this hotel far outweighs the bad.  If you stay there, get an Identity membership.  Its good for all your gambling, food and shopping purchases, as well as your hotel stay.  By the time we left after three and a half days, people knew our name and we are by no means heavy gamblers or big spenders, so that felt nice.

This is my new favorite place to stay in Vegas and probably one of the best hotel rooms I've ever been in.",1,0,0

I had a 55th floor room overlooking the Bellagio fountain.  Great view overall!  There are also rooms with a balcony (single king) and suites.  The bathrooms are chic, the decor is modern, the amenities are upscale, and every bit of service I received was simply top notch.

The casino here may not be as big as some of the other Vegas big names, but you can find everything from slots to blackjack to war, so there is plenty of diversity.  The restaurant selection is great, and both pools are wonderful.  I didn't get a chance to check out Marquee, but it seems like everyone has a great time there.

Pros: 
This hotel is BEAUTIFUL! After walking into the lobby of a few other hotels, I was extremely happy with my choice! The swanky details used were so fun, and did not have the cheesy factor that some of the others displayed. The location is unbeatable! It is located in the middle of everything (including the walk overs). Our room had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. The three pools had magnificent views, and the restaurants had amazing food! 

Cons: 
I was told by a staff member that despite being open for only 6 months, they were on their 3rd director of housekeeping, and it showed! Our room was not cleaned the first day, and we had to call 4 times to get towels up to the room. We also found a roach crawling around. 
Another misleading factor was Marquee, the night club\/day club in the hotel. They claim they are NOT associated with the Cosmopolitan. If you go expecting to be treated like a guest of the hotel, don't bother.",2,0,0

The rooms are nice which is an obvious. Location is good too since it is across from planet and it is where marquee is located so if you want day or night club action, you can just pregame and head back up after clubbing to your room. Who wants to cab it everywhere? Marquee is also one of the hotter clubs so it's perfect. I know it has a hip hop floor that I haven't experienced yet but score. There is food in Cosmo on the third floor like secret pizza which is ok and Milos which is bomb. However, aside from those, not much food I would prefer if I don't want to step outside my hotel. I actually like the selection at planet with earls, fat Tuesday, and burgr. Solid place to stay if you got the money.

You know what they say don't judge a book by it's cover, well this is one of those books that look so interesting and the preface has you clinging to the edge of the seat waiting to see what happens next, but then when you open the book it's blank and on the second page it's a huge picture of a middle finger. 

Yeah I hope you guys got the visual of that, because that's how I felt staying at this hotel. I don't want to bore you with the fine details of the weekend but I'll give you the a cliff notes version. I promise there will be no giant middle fingers pointed at you only to the cosmopolitan. 

Now for the climax juicy part of the story.. So when I used the shower I noticed that the water pressure was sporadic it would go high pressure to no pressure cold then hot. I was thinking damn everyone is taking a shower at the same exact time... (I know that was dumb)  Anyways, I've never experienced that in any of the other hotels I've stayed at. I've stayed at quite a few with a whole entourage of people in one room. This time it was just me and two other people. So that's one water incident that had me scratching my head. The other was when my friend turned on the water for the soaking tub. She informed me that the water that was coming out of the faucet was brown and clear. I was like no way you're lying so I tested it myself and there it was brown water. I should've taken a picture or video so I could have posted it as proof but wasn't thinking about that. (I was pretty liquored up) I should've have called the front desk but my friend said to just deal with it in the morning when we checked out. So that's what I did... 

Future note if you have any problems in your hotel room during your stay make sure to call them and make sure they know about it. 

SO it's check out time, I was still pretty hungover from the night before checked my camera and had some pretty funny pictures from the night before great times with friends... Almost forgot about the whole brown water incident. So we get to the front desk to get in line for check out. As were waiting the two reps in behind the counter finish with the guest they are helping and they just stand there begin to converse about their weekend and about what some lady was saying to her. Yes they were talking loud enough to where I can hear them. about 2 mins go by and finally this which looked like a manager or supervisor comes out of his cave and requests those two to help the guest and looks over at me and instructs me to go to the desk and apologizes for the inconvenience. So I told the Rep her name is M@&*&. M@$*& I would like to check out and also I have some concerns about my room this past weekend. She replied oh okay I can check you out what's your room number? She then tells me okay let me get my manager... I was like okay cool you can't do anything so instead of all the run around talk to the one on top. When this guy comes out I begin to tell him about the incidents in the room and he just looked at me like he could give a fuck what happened. He showed no sympathy or care. All he said was I'm sorry but I don't see any records of you calling to inform us of this incident. There is really nothing I can do. I was like wow... FFW a little bit so we get a comp meal to anywhere in the hotel.. (per the manager and confirmed by REP) we order food at Comme C we inform the waiter that the meal is comp by the hotel and he calls to confirm and tells me that the front desk is saying no record of comp meal and there is no one named M@&*& that works down there. 

SO This is where I'm just really pissed and go back down and give them a piece of my mind. Also remember to get names when people promise you things. So I talk to the manager and get his name (we'll call him B. Asshat) and he tells me that oh sorry but your comp is only good for wicked spoon or one of the other cheap cafe's. Gee thanks for telling us! Maria confirmed that it would be good for any place in the hotel and to just bill it to the room. He then says look I'm taking time out to help you with this situation so what can I do to help you. I was like do your m*&%*$&%*#(# job I didn't know you clocked out to help us B. Asshat! 

SO I told him that I don't care about the food I don't care about anything he was gonna give me I was done. I asked him for a card and he gave me someone elses card and said I don't have any cards. Really okay that's fine I'll just write a letter to the card he gave me and make sure she knows of what happened. 

Well I wrote that letter and no response from her at all.

2. Get a text at 3:50Pm that room is available.

5. 5:30Pm no keys delivered, and had to walk yo the front desk to finally get a working set of keys.

The room downstairs had guys calling out ""puma"" over and over. Another neighboring room had cheers of ""whoop! Whoop!"" Two girls in pajamas were desperately banging on a door. When I asked, if they got locked out, they smirked happily.

As soon as you step into the public areas of the casino, there are hot girls in the most amazing outfits everywhere. The Marquee club is mind blowing. This is the place to party. Sleep whenever. Get up whenever. If it's daylight, party at the pool. If the sun's down, party at the club. Anytime, hangout in the chandelier bar or casino area and have a good time with people.

About the room specifically, it was a little disappointing compared to the other top notch Vegas hotels. They usually have super special bathrooms. The Cosmo didn't have a tub, so sad. The shower pressure was weakish. However, the shower had a floor to ceiling window to the bed room with adjustable drapes. Now, how kinky is that!

If you are young, social, and want a good time, then this place rocks. If my parents were going to Vegas, I'd send them to Encore or Wynn.

The Lobby = Talk about uber chic, very nicely done, i specifically liked the digital art that wrapped the pillars in the lobby - it's somehow hypnotic, entertaining and fascinating. The walls of the lobby are pretty cool as well - I assume it's vinyl made to look like leather...very butch! ha ha (kidding) actually look pretty classy.

The lobby is not that extravagant nor that big but who sits around and lingers for a long time in the lobby???...Hello, you're in Vegas - can't sit around and watch  the bubbles pop in that hypnotic digital art.

The rooms - Very nice, it's the kind of bed you'd wanna sleep all day but then again you're in vegas that bed was really meant to be slept in during the day time because you party all night :D

It's the kind of bed tha'll make you curse and cuz the next time you stay at a motel 6 - there's just no comparison :)

This review is for the room only.

I had the opportunity to stay in a Terrace One Bedroom and it was simply a breathtaking room, more like an awesome studio apartment. The room did not feel like the typical ""Las Vegas"" hotel room.. It felt homely and comfortable in a modern chic kinda way.

The King size bed is very comfy. It comes with plenty of pillows & a nice thick down comforter and no cheesy brown yucky blanket like the other vegas hotel rooms. 

The Shower\/Tub area is pretty awesome..it has plenty of windows..with views to the outside city lights and also views into the Bedroom (there are privacy blinds, if necessary) However, my only gripe about this is that, I wished it had a soaking tub instead of a Japanese style soaking tub.. It would be nice if someone that is taller than 5ft can stretch out their legs after a long day shopping and\/or gambling. There are complimentary Robes & Slippers along with C.G.Bigelow Products. 

There is also balcony where you can actually go outside and hangout. Its somewhat private where people cannot see you, however I'm sure if the person at the hotel across the way had binoculars, they can see everything. The furniture cannot be moved, its like glue to the ground.

Another thing I truly thought was awesome about the this room, unlike other vegas hotels was the remote can control lights and temperature). Its nice to be able to do all that without getting out of bed!

I had to deduct a star, because I opened the fridge and found something old (god knows how long its been in there) and that is extremely nasty which grossed me out....

Overall, I would totally stay at this hotel again. Its also, kinda in the middle of the strip, so its very accessible to everywhere.",4,1,2

3. Kae at the Cosmo pool - Very accommodating and friendly. That place turns baking in the desert into an art form. 

Overall, hope I can come back sooner rather than later and love the place! I even found out about that secret drink at the front bar. AMAZING.",0,0,1

As soon as we pulled into the self parking, we noticed red and green lights lining the parking stalls. we quikly figured red stood for unavailable and green stood for available. this made it finding a space sooo much easier! no driving around slowly scanning for a space nor slowed by cars in front of us! A+++ great thinking on the hotel's part! as soon as we got to the lobby we where oowed and awwed by the decor. very glitzy and glammy. love it! eye candy on every floor, even the bathrooms where really nice! all staff that we encountered were friendly. our room was on the 35th floor east tower premium terrace studio. very very very nice!! there's a soak tub with separate shower dual sinks. there's complimentary  soap shampoo conditioner shower gel cotton balls and q-tips. from the bathroom there's an opening that looks out into the living room n bed. don't worry there's a blind that u can close for privacy. in the living area there's a L-shape couch desk flat screen t.v kitchenette with fridge  sink n dishwasher! awesome! in the sleeping area there's another tv n very comfy bed! there's a seating area on the terrace which was nice to just sit relax n enjoy the view. our view was of bellagio n strip. gorgeous view day and night! we ordered room service buffalo wings and shrimp & crab cocktail. i was expecting it to be blah like most hotels room service. but it was yummy! i would most def stay here again n recommend it to others!",0,0,0

When we checked in, Yosef seemed very nice. I mentioned that we have been frequent guests and he said that he would give us a great room. For the first time ever, we were put in the East Tower, which seemed like a good idea... why not try something new?!?

Boy was that a mistake. We were on the 30th floor facing the nightclub. I understand that this is Vegas and it's not going to be quiet, but it was LOUD - painfully loud. Thanks a lot for putting us in the loud tower in a crappy room!!! My boyfriend was so annoyed that he called and asked to change rooms. We were on our way to a dinner reservation that night, so he asked if we could quickly swap rooms. Patrick, the man he spoke with, said he couldn't figure out how to switch the keys that fast. WHAT?!?! He said we had to be back by 10 pm or else we'd lose the second room.

We had to rush back from our dinner at the Venetian, which frankly made us both really annoyed, to get the new room. As we were packing up, someone was banging on the door and trying to get into our room! Then we received a call from the front desk saying we needed to get out because they needed the room for someone else. This is NOT the way frequent guests should be treated!

We moved to the same room on the 67th floor, which was still loud, but bearable. I didn't get much sleep at all during my stay. Why on earth does the music have to be THAT loud...? And, why can't they put in better windows that don't suck?!!?

Both rooms were definitely not very clean and not up to the standard that the Cosmo used to have in the past. Sadly and needless to say, we are done with this hotel and will never stay here again.",3,6,0

Pros: 
- young party crowd
- pretty chandelier bar
- marquee dayclub and nightclub

Cons:
- AWFUL service. just awful. staff is incredibly rude everywhere within the hotel. 
- Weird layout for the casino
- no shopping in the hotel. none.
- only one restaurant (STK) other than small burger and pizza joints. How can a   vegas hotel have no restaurants. what??
- overall just small in size

The waitress at the buffet pulled a chair out from under my friends bottom (literally) and told her she couldn't sit there. Our waiter at STK told us we couldn't order a drink after we closed the food tab and that we had to leave our table. Housekeeping had hour long waits for towels. yes, towels to bathe with. Room service woman on the phone had a major attitude and literally mocked us on the phone - slowly explaining to us the meaning of ""cancelled"" as if we were a 3 year old. Our room was missing the tv remote and our room phone was broke. no fun.",1,1,0

I spend a lot of time in Vegas, and the one common thing that brings me back to places ranging from Bally's to Encore to Golden Gate is genuine service from people who are talented and truly care.  

Cosmopolitan combines all the best of modern, fancy, techy Vegas with the old school feel and personal service of the pre-corporate era.

Only one place in Vegas has ever given me $25 3\/2 double deck blackjack, competitive video poker odds, a balcony overlooking Bellagio fountains, a great Filet Mignon, central location, awesome buffet, hip vibe, fantastic cocktail service from hot chicks, friendly dealers and pit bosses, easy access to the strip, easy to earn and use comps AND a host actually emails me back the same day!

About me, I am a long time platinum Marriott rewards member (15 years), but that doesn't matter as the hotel seems to be unsure if they are a Marriott hotel, affiliated member, or just something new.  We were on a trip to visit friends in Summerlin and decided to stay at the Cosmopolitan given the points, etc... To me, the Cosmo is an Autograph Marriott hotel and with that, high expectations are set.  If you are an ""invited"" guest, the check-in area is in the Autograph lounge that is tucked away in the corner.  It was not clear to us that was the place to check-in.  The staff did not seem prepared for our check-in as there was no acknowledgement of platinum status.  The 1st room was nice, 62nd floor in the East tower, right above Marquee day and night club.  Sounds great, but the music was pounding all day and all night, our kids could not nap or sleep.  The hotel does not offer charging stations either for the eco-minded drivers.  We asked to change rooms due to the noise and were informed that all the rooms were sold out and should stick it out for at least one day.  We were advised that the Marquee night club closes on Sunday so there would be no music, but still there was music throughout the day club.  After the first night and a second call down to request a room change, we were able to move to the 56th floor in the West tower.  Of course our room is right next door to the housekeeping staff door.  We informed the staff of the dirtiness of the room and they had housekeeping get on it right away, so fast that none of them knocked, they just walked into the room, a couple of them apologized as they did not know we were there.  Complete lack of any hospitality.  Ack, I'm so frustrated having to relive these moments so here is a bullet point list of all that went wrong:
-No acknowledgement of Platinum
-1st room near the club, too loud
-2nd room near housekeeping staff door, too loud
-Milano cookies in room were expired, never changed even after we informed the hotel
-The parking lot has green and red lights to let you know what is available.  We found a premium spot next to the elevator on B3.  The next morning, hotel staff put a pole right behind my car.  I needed to do a 50 point turn to get my car out.
-The rooms here are DIRTY.  Broken ""press on nails"" wedged in the bed, hair in drawers, ice bucket tray was sticky, and vomit stains on the floor near the balcony.
-Worst of all - housekeeping!  When a ""DO NOT DISTURB"" sign is on the door, don't knock on the door.  If the door is dead bolted and hinge locked don't try 3 times to get in.  If I'm sleeping and yell, ""I'm still here, go away"" then don't try to come in, and lastly, if it is our last night here and we are checking out, don't swing by at 9 am and try to get in - Gill was his name.
-Housekeeping left cleanser in our room right where the kids grabbed it and were spraying it everywhere... at least they use diversey crew - non-acid disinfectant cleaner.
-Housekeeping management told me the door is sound proof but let's be realistic... they are not, or at least the walls are not.
-According to the rules for Boulevard pool, you are not allowed to bring in glass bottles.  We tried to bring in bottled formula and we were told to take it back to the room. After speaking with Nicole and Joey for pool management they stated that it was okay given that it was baby food.  Just the hassle of having to go to another layer of staff was ridiculous.
-Be weary of Wicked Spoons disgruntled staff.  When you charge the food to your room, there is no opportunity to add tip.  After we were seated, you could see it on the waiter's face that it looked like we left no tip... throughout the entire meal he was ""unpleasant"".  He was the kind of guy that if you tickled him, he wouldn't laugh.
-Lastly, and most importantly, the gaming.  If you want to gamble throughout the night, don't play here.  The Cosmo does not have enough staff to cover one full gaming area.  I was a frequent Pai-Gow and Ultimate Texas Hold-em player and I was told each night that the games were closing due to the lack of staff.

Thank you for reading my comments.  There were no bright spots to the stay other than knowing that we will never stay here again.  We expected a lot more from this place given the Marriott Autograph name and price.

Next month we are staying at SLS - A Hilton property (former Sahara).

Good luck!",6,9,3

She booked 2 rooms side by side each other for 5pm. Ok, so come the day off the wedding shower; the Cosmo told her one of the other rooms wasn't ready @ 5pm and they couldn't give it to her cause a high roller decided to stay in that other room. To apologize, they moved all of us (the bride and groom's entire family) to a penthouse suite. 1hr later, Cosmo security knocked on the door and told her we were all getting kicked out because of underage drinking. None of the minors in that room drank. Cosmo security made all of us (the bride and grooms families; including grandmas and grandpas) to leave immediately. No one from the Cosmo came to help move any of our luggage. They also informed my cousin that she would be charged with both nights for the rooms she booked even though they kicked us out.

The hotel main floors are beautiful, but when I walked out of the elevator and onto the room floor, the first thing I noticed was dingy carpeting that looked like it had not been vacuumed in days!     The carpeting was also so thick it was extremely difficult to drag a rolling bag down the hallway.  I went to open the door to my room and the room key didn't even work.  Per directions upon check in I called up the ""guest services"" number and was on hold for over ten minutes.  While standing outside of my room on hold, a hotel employee was coming down the hallway so I tried to flag him down and ask the question.  Without even pausing or stopping he bluntly said, ""call security"".  Zero percent on the hospitality score.  After finally getting security upstairs I was let into my room and informed new room cards would be delivered immediately.  Two hours later, still no new room key which meant I couldn't even leave my room because I would be locked out!!  I called up the dreaded guest services number once again and waiting on hold for about 8 minutes.  Finally, we were delivered new room keys.

Everyone at the hotel was very attentive and friendly.  At the identity counter, the woman working there apologized profusely for letting me stand there for a minute.  No big deal, but it was nice that she cared.

We got a King Guest Room, which is the biggest I've ever seen of such a room. It's very well laid out and the TV screens in the Living Area and the Bedroom are both Samsung big screens. It's so convenient that there is a master switch to turn lights on when you enter and even better is that you can switch off everything when you leave with just one switch too! 

I like it that you have a choice on pools - a social one and a quieter one - one on each tower. I took advantage of the quieter pool on the opposite tower and it was great to just float around without being bothered by the party-scene!

I couldn't rate this place a five though because from our 23rd floor bedroom, you could hear the noise from the social pool even with the glass door shut! The ottoman on the balcony was upside down and when I righted it, there was a stain from what looked like a cigar burn or something... And the other negative was despite there being two towers, there was only one Concierge and one Members only area where you could get free coffee... and we happened to be in the opposite tower :( To their credit, though, the free coffee was good Starbucks coffee :)

Rooms
- Amazing! You can see straight through the shower and bathtub from the bedroom with just a piece of glass in between the areas. The bathtub is on the left side, then your flat screen TV on a regular wall in the middle, then the shower on the right side. There are shades for the bath and shower on the bedroom side if you want privacy, but if you don't trust your roommates, I wouldn't recommend this hotel because anyone could pull up the shades on you. :) Otherwise, it's absolutely amazing!
- All of the rooms look like suites. They all have a huge living room, wet bar, and it's like a condo.
- The bathtub was HUGE! It was as big and deep as a hot tub with a couple of seats in it. Perfect for soaking and relaxing. The shower could fit half a dozen people in it too- huge! 
- Modern and classy
- White feather down bed- so comfortable!
- Large outdoor balcony with cushion wicker patio furniture to hang out

Casino
- Lots of machines and tables- was fun to play!

Bars
- The chandelier bar is literally inside of a huge chandelier than spans three stories in the hotel. It's gorgeous and a must-try!
- There are a few bars on the first floor that are fun to hang out at as well!

Food
- This is by far the best hotel food I've ever had, and I travel a lot for work!

Club
- The Cosmo has the best and hottest nightclub in Vegas right now, the Marquee Club. It opens at 9:30pm, and you better be in line then or you'll wait forever to get (if you even get in!). I heard the entry fee is $50, but we got right in since our company spent so much money with the hotel. CeeLo Green was there the night I went. It has several dance rooms and spans outside by the amazing pool, cabana, and hot tubs areas. It's huge and a blast. There is a techno room and a hip hop room- you can't go wrong! 

People
- The only thing I didn't like about this place was the people. This is definitely THE party hotel, so everyone is super skinny, wears little clothing, and you feel like you're filming for MTV Spring Break 24\/7. It's a fast paced, nonstop, packed hotel, so it can get overwhelming after awhile. We had to wait 45 minutes to check-in on a Thursday morning, it was that packed! I couldn't walk through the casino without a drunk guy approaching me on multiple occasions. I stayed at the Palazzo the last night, and it was much classier and relaxed regarding the people.

This is young Las Vegas...simply put. 

This is the cool, hip, sleek style of the Rat Pack's Las Vegas but translated into the cool, hip, sleek style that is today's Las Vegas. We run this town. 

The decor is not cheesy, it is simple and fantastic at the same time. As you walk into the elevators from the garage to the main levels of the casino you're greeted with a flat screen and koi fishes. Then you get blown away by the chandeliers, as if you're inside one yourself. On the lower level of the casino, near the entrance off of Harmon you'll find large columns of art displayed on large screens (my guess lcd?) A 360 of screens on 8 or so columns. Just simply breathtaking and amazing. I think it is the most novel idea I've ever seen inside of a building. In passing, I thought they were just painted columns. But about an hour later, I come through the same foyer and bam a new piece of art is rotating on the screens. I'm blown away from the idea. The images are so crisp and clean, I want these in my home...hah.  

I also love the acoustics in the casino. Music plays from a DJ booth by the bar. The bar serves their House Cosmopolitan, I thought, what a cheesy idea, drinking a Cosmo at the Cosmopolitan but my friend insisted. It was delicious. Pink with a berry or three in the middle. Tart and strong. Far more different from your ordinary Cosmo. Nothing girly about it at all *wink*. But I say definitely give it a try as cheesy as it sounds.

The customer service was amazing all around. From the Cocktail servers, to the front desk, to the buffet cashier. Everyone was amazingly friendly. And not in the corporate 'forced-smile-thank-you-for-coming' kind of way. 

Decor is a huge bonus. Most hotels feel like they're designed for kids, or for your parents. This one just feels 'adult'. Just remember thats part of what you're paying for. If you just want a place to crash after getting drunk, you should save your money. If you appreciate beautiful design, and are willing to pay for it, the Cosmopolitan is great.

For years, i've sworn off vegas as being a hot crowded hassle that wasn't worth the trip, and my stay at the Cosmopolitan makes me want to go back.",1,0,0

I loved the tub and soaking in it at night while taking in the view of the fountain show at the bellagio!  Staff at check in and check out were every friendly to me. The Identity rewards people were also very kind and informative about stuff. Lots of restaurants and shopping places here too. Only down fall for me was the lack of craps tables. There always seemed to be only one table open when I would walk by and it was always full... but they have three other tables that were closed, so that was weird. But I really can't be upset about that as the room was just so awesome and I enjoyed every night I was there very much.  Thank you so much cosmopolitan staff for everything !

I stayed here this January for my birthday the view was beautiful both during the day and night time. I like that you can have a chill lounge nightlife or a club scene atmosphere and you don't even have to leave the hotel. Their selections are great for going out at night.

This will now be our choice hotel to book while in Vegas.  And did I mention they have an actual balcony?! Unheard of... it's so rare to actually get fresh air while staying in a hotel room - this was so nice to have the window open while lying in bed listening to the buzz of the city.

Or driving out of the car dealership in a brand spanking new Benz and sniffing the leather.  It's all about the small little things that matter.  And this hotel didn't miss one detail.  Everything was impeccable, down to the wallpaper, amenities, service, decor, rooms, staff.  No detail was left unworked.  Even the crystals in all the lights in the hallways made me smile as they twinkled.

The bars and shops inside this hotel were beautiful, except everything was honking expensive so I didn't really buy anything except drinks.  The pools are beautiful, the spa offers deliciously decadent services and massages.  I have no idea if they have a gym because I didn't go looking for one because I'm on vacay!

The room was like a mini apartment, careful for the mini bar though because if you move the bottles they'll try and charge you!  Make sure to check!

The bed was super comfy, the tv that controlled everything in the room was really cool, the balcony view overlooking the strip was stunning.

However, on the weekends it turns into a giant party and stuff gets trashed. My stay here during the week was fabulous and fun and I received impeccable service. My stay here last weekend was just short of insanity.

The lines to get into the Marquee club were out of control and the pools were so packed you couldn't even find a spot on the ground to lay a towel. Every time we went to our room there were bags of both dirty and clean towels lining the hallway as if someone just dumped the housekeeping cart. Then there was checkout... a complete nightmare as only 2 of the 6 elevators were running in our tower and we waited 30-40 minutes to cram on one (going up, mind you) just so we could stop at every floor on the way up and down to tell people we couldn't fit any more. Once in the lobby the angry crowd at the valet made us incredibly thankful for having self-parked.

In summary, I will stay here again as long as they keep sending me promotional deals.

Cosmo is one of those places.   It's got a silicone bounce to it however.  Looks damn good, but just don't feel right.  There's always a level of fakeness with these trendy upscale joints.

I might as well be playing with machines though with the amount of technology at the tables.  The roulette tables light up all the winning bet combinations.  The pai gow tables have LCD displays that can tell you what hand you have before you even look at the cards!  Like, WTF?  We're still trying to figure that one out.  The only conclusion was that Skynet is watching and we are all doomed.

I would like that they improve their HVAC system though.  Around the pit area I was at, the vents were blowing directly onto the tables.  Money was literally flying everywhere when trying to change out and it was freezing.

The sticky solution on the nightstand was a good touch for when your phone rings when you're sleeping. If you're from the east coast, you're bound to get a call early in the morning while you're asleep. This will help you not knock your phone off the table when reaching for it. 

Another nice touch was a note from a woman telling me to enjoy my bachelor weekend. She got my name wrong and I wasn't there for a bachelor weekend, but a nice gesture.

What was supposed to be a ""pop by"" turned into a three hour gambling extravaganza.

The casino itself is beautiful with the Chandelier Bar and Bond Bar. Crystals grace the ceiling from the first floor to the second floor and I haven't seen any other hotel  like it. Bond Bar would be cool to preparty or just chill and people watch on the strip. There's also Vesper Bar located at the lobby entrance and it is also very nice.

Wicked Spoon is the buffet and it is delicious. I think of it as a fine-dining buffet, because their entrees are unique from other buffets. Their dessert selection is phenomenal, so be sure to leave room for that! It is pricey though, I believe $25 for lunch and $40 for dinner.

There are plenty of other restaurants on the 3rd floor, all which seem pretty upscale and $$$$. There is also the Secret Pizza place with $5 pizza and it is delicious! I would totally go here after Marquee.

The hotel rooms are sexy. The decoration gives me that naughty vibe...lol. From the soft beds to the bath tubs and the light system. I think they are built for couples because the showers are glass with no type of shade for privacy (if you're staying with a big group). Another thing, I dont think this hotel is the best place for big groups to stay at, unless you're okay with sleeping on the floor. 

The swimming pools are nice and have lovely views of the strip!!  I would come here just for the view. However it doesn't get much sunshine because there are tall buildings blocking the sun. [I recommend going to Aria pools next door, hehe].

Marquee is the nightclub, and it is probably the most popular one in Vegas at the moment!! Being a hotel guest lets you have free admission, but only with equal male:female ratio, which I think is excessive to ask for. There is also a separate line for hotel guests, but it moves extremely slow and there's no advantage except the fact that there's free admission. We waited in line for 1.5 hours and it was barely moving. This was unfortunate, especially because we stayed here to take advantage of the free admission at Marquee. 

All in all, it is very expensive to stay here, even on a Monday night!! But you are paying for an exquisite hotel with a luxurious environment, being in the middle of the strip, getting access to the pools, free admission to Marquee, etc...  I would probably stay here again.",1,0,0

For as small as the pool is, its actually the place you want to be if you're people watching or want to be at a pool where you just want to lounge around in 2 feet of water and not submerge yourself the whole way through. 

There's two decks, the first one with the main pool and the cabanas on the East end overlooking The Strip below, and the DJ booth plus additional chairs on the second. You would have to get out there *very* early in order to snag a chair because they only have a certain amount, and most of them are by poolside. Their cabanas are super fancy, with TVs, coolers, couches, and even curtains to close it off from the rest of the pool to make it very private. 

On the west end there's foozeball tables (I know, right?!), pool tables, and even a pinball machine just in case you get a little restless.

We had to wait in line each time we checked too. I guess lines are a fact of life at the hotel. Each morning we had to wait in a line, after prepaying at the cashier, to be seated at the Wicked Spoon buffet. Food was good but it's a buffet!  Why the line?

So not a great service experience from a purported high-end hotel.",1,1,0

Great for people watching. Lots of beautiful people and short dresses to ogle.
Love Book and Stage bar and the new up and coming bands that they book to play, and you can watch them for free. I always get the ""Run for the Roses"" drink, kind of their take on a Mint Julep.
The restaurants vary and will satisfy every taste. Cool, interesting shops, some a bit pricey but its fun to window shop.
Love the art that is scattered through out the casino. Don't waste your $5 on the ""art cigarette"" machine, I haven't heard of anything good coming out of them. 
The roof top Boulevard Pool is really nice. They do movies there on Monday nights and hold concerts there also.
Parking can be a pain, those fancy lights above the parking places aren't always accurate. But I love the fact I can avoid the strip and get it around back.

For as much as my group was paying for staying in multiple rooms, we expected a lot better. I have never stayed in a room that required so much maintenance and additional service because a lot of stuff was missing.  There were so many problems ranging from clogged sinks to broken refrigerator handles to no kitchen utensils to missing seat cushions.  Even when the hotel solved all these problems, they would half ass certain aspects of the service (not cleaning up the sinks, replacing only one of two the seat cushions, etc).  The service was disorganized and there seamed to be a disconnect with the hotel staff.  For a hotel as new as Cosmo, there should not have been as many problems as we encountered.

At the very least, we had a great view from the balcony, the room decor was nice, and the casino\/bars were nice.  Marquee is also very enjoyable.  If it was not for everything outside of the room, this review would be worse.

Cosmo is nice to go through or party at, but definitely do not stay there.",3,2,0

Me and my boyfriend sat at a virtually empty sports bar and watched as the bartenders chit chatted with a few other patrons for nearly 10 minutes without acknowledging us.  We got up without being served and chalked it up to a rude server and tried to move on with our evening.  We checked out the nightclub upstairs and we're met with a large mob of people with little semblance of a line or organization.  We quickly realized that there was no point to patiently waiting as people were cutting under the barriers and jumping large chunks of the line to skip ahead.  No security or moderation in sight.  We decided to give this place one last chance and headed down to the lobby bar.  We asked if they had anything on special this evening and the pretentious fellow working the tap rolled his eyes and scoffed at us as if we'd just asked for a comped cuisine!  After informing us there were no specials and that a bud light would run us nearly $9 each we politely declined due to his attitude and headed home for the evening completely empty handed.

The layout is dazzling and the restaurants, varied and inviting.  But in its rush to join the City Center panoply of hotel offerings, the attention paid to quality assurance and customer service was relegated to the trash heap.  First, I was directed to the wrong hotel tower by the front desk, but this was nicely corrected by a promise for a room credit of $25.  Hey, I thought, a few opening season kinks easily overcome!  The room was fantastic, and I wanted to love it!  A 1-br terrace with balcony and view of the strip.  But the bathroom trash had not been emptied, a pair of eyebrow tweezers were left behind in a bathroom drawer (yuck!), no slippers in the closet, and a single bathrobe, obviously soiled, hanging droopily in the closet.  Hello??  Still, all nicely fixed after a call to housekeeping to remedy the situation.  I thought, hmmm, well not spectacular, but still no fatal flaws.  Then I ordered a drink via room service (bluecoat gin with a bottle of tonic and limes), and after an hour of waiting, a can of 'code-blue' energy drink with a lime slice was delivered.  Ugh!! Really??  I waited another hour for the luggage to finally arrive at 5 PM (checked in at 3 PM), when I was resigned to the fact these events were no opening night jitters.  Spent 3 nights without having the carpet vacuumed (yes, croissant flakes from morning #1 were still available for a little snack on morning #3), table tops were not wiped down, nor dusty velours cleaned.  Such a shame that a spectacular setting was not wedded to more careful attention to the details.......but, what the heck, who needs a clean room or sleep in VEGAS!!!!  Right?  It's all about the party!  (Marquee Nite Club assaults the eardrums until 4 AM Sunday morning, my friends)

Word of advice - at least have your front-desk inquire about your stay when you check out - I would have liked to share.  PS - the promised $25 credit over the wrong tower directions never appeared on the statement.  Classic!  To those who care about customer service like me, Vdara at City Center is a superior option to the Cosmo.",6,2,1

The terrace with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountain with Paris and the strip in the background... It was amazing!!! I could sit in my Japanese soaking tub, look out the window and watch the fountain show. I could take a sexy shower with open see-through view from the bed. I had a full living room and kitchenette and the closets were plentiful for all of our nice clothes. Everything was clean and we had regular maid service. It was great! 

A little pricey but you can't get something half as nice here on Oahu where I live for the price we paid. The cost is fair and definitely worth it for the suite!!!

The central location can't be beat. Walking distance to all the best hotels and casinos. Excellent dining choices on site. 

But the pools... Meh. This hotel caters to a younger crowd and I just felt like it was too dirty and crowded to go in. I sat on a lounge seat and drank a cocktail. 

The decor is beautiful. I mean that Chandelier is just so impressive and pretty. The shoe sculptures! The classic Hollywood! Wow. This hotel makes me think if Carrie Bradshaw was a hotel- she would be The Cosmopolitan.

It is mid-strip, next to Bellagio and across from Paris. We choose a Terrace Suite, with a separate living area from the bedroom and two full baths. The Cosmo is the only hotel in Vegas with balconies -- many of them overlook the Bellagio Fountains and have a great view of the Strip.

This year was special, as we were celebrating our 20 year wedding anniversary, and after we checked in we were surprised with a little gift from the hotel -- a box of chocolates, designed like a set of books, very cute and clever, just the kind of thing you would expect from the Cosmo, with their eclectic style and décor.

The new owners have made some nice changes while keeping the fun and eclectic vibe of the property. Although we miss the Q Bar, Clique is very nice, with fun cocktails and comfy couches. The new Sports Book is a welcome change for Hubby. It's obvious that they are making an investment in the property and it shows.

In years' past, housekeeping was sketchy, but there has been a big improvement, there is now a consistency to how the rooms are cleaned that was missing before. But I really wish they would put gratuity envelopes in the rooms, as several times the gratuity we left for housekeeping was not taken and we had to hunt them down to give them the gratuity - we want to be sure that good work is recognized! With gratuity envelopes there would be no doubt of what it's for.

The Spa is fabulous, large and relaxing, with great treatments - the Balance & Harmony massage is a favorite, combining Swedish & hot stones, ahhhhhh.....

My one complaint is with the pool area, specifically the Chelsea Pool - while the space is great and the pool bars are comfy with wonderful bartenders, the lounge chairs are hideously uncomfortable, more like what you would find at a Holiday Inn, not a high-end Vegas hotel. Before, all the chairs had nice thick padding, I wish they would go back to the nice padding...

Being as it was cold, we were able to walk through the pool area without any problems. The pool is one of those horizon drop off pools where is just flow from each side without any noticeable ending. It was a cool touch to the pool. The chairs all around the pool are either located on the edges of it or overlooking the strip.

I stayed with my sister for her 25th birthday and arranged to have balloons scattered in our room when we arrived. The organization with the concierge was flawless; I had the balloons delivered from an outside vendor then really they took care of the rest. The only tidbit I would say is when we checked in there was a little confusion on my part with whether the room was ready.

Our room was beautiful, just standard not a suite, but amazing none the less. Our view overlooked the Bellagio and a portion of the strip. We could see the Bellagio fountains going off too!! Our ice machine was out on our floor, but anytime we called some was delivered. 

We visited both pools during our stay, but opted for a daybed at the Boulevard pool on a Thursday. Not as busy as a weekend day but a little less expensive. The service was flawless and we had a great location just off the water but not out of the way. The pool was a little chilly because it was slightly overcast.

So chic, so sexy, so.. Free of children. Well, mostly. 
The Cosmo targets well-to-do young people which translates to very few children. Thumbs up.
Rooms-
The rooms are nicer than most and the insightful architecture allows the majority of the rooms to have extraordinary views. I love the option to check out and review the bill from your room TV. 
Casino-
The casino feels small but it has a ton of good energy. I don't gamble much but I always have a great time in the Cosmo casino. 
Pools-
The bamboo pool is our favorite because it plays good music but is still chill enough to relax. The in-pool lounge chairs are a nice touch if you can get one.
Restaurants- 
We tried Rose, Rabbit, Lie. It has a really unique atmosphere. Sort of Alice in wonderland with a jazz band. Pretty cool. The food was really good and decently priced. The cocktails were pretty interesting.

Pleasantly impressed during my return visit this yr. after deciding to give Cosmo another try following an unimpressive experience last May. 

ROOMS
Best-in-class room technology. Everything is centrally controlled from the phone console - lighting, climate, TV\/sound, concierge and other services. All lighting is fully dimmable (Lutron) - phenomenal feature.

Bathrooms are beautifully done, featuring top-line Kallista fixtures, Kohler sink, Kohler lav. There are bathroom blinds into the room. Bathroom and closet shared a space-efficient sliding door with full-length mirror. Toiletries are C.O. Bigelow. Plenty of floor-length mirrors in the room - a nice-to-have in Vegas.

Decor is tastefully modern without being minimalist, great furniture.

Beds are very comfortable.

Had a terrace room facing away from the Strip (quieter) during my first visit, the balcony is a nice feature. Had a Strip-facing room this visit overlooking the Bellagio fountains - excellent view.

SERVICE
Front desk is professional and helpful, minus the attitude I experienced last yr., which was consistent with Cosmo's initial reviews. Accommodated my request for high floor\/quiet room wonderfully - was assigned Bellagio-facing room on the 59th floor. Zero noise on the floor. Replaced my keys swiftly no questions.
Beck & call (phone concierge) was fully functional and responsive - could hardly ever get through to concierge during my previous visit.

Room service pre-orders are available to schedule in increments of 20 minutes (ie: 8-8:20 am), and Heather was right on time both mornings, considerate (could tell I was barely awake) and courteous.

Cleaning service could use more attention to detail - day 1 I was stranded without a bath rug, which the concierge eventually assisted with, and staff also forgot to replenish certain amenities upon arrival.

Taxi stand - never had to wait, very efficiently run. Taxi staff is extremely professional.

DECOR
Pure eye candy - no expenses spared on premise. The Chandelier (most impressive lighting fixture in Vegas), Vesper Bar, BOND (entrance bar facing the Strip), and even the hotel lobby feature incredible crystal lighting, fantastic use of color and LED columns with changing imagery - the visual effects are unparalleled. Best execution of art + technology.

DINING
Wicked Spoon (4-star, favorite buffet in Vegas), Blue Ribbon (3.5 star). Have heard STK is fantastic but DOCG (Italian) is just ok. 

LOCATION
Connected to City Center which houses plenty of couture boutiques, next door to Bellagio Fountains, across the street from Miracle Mile Shops (more accessible shopping)",3,0,2

The room needed to be updated. It was big but dark with no central light control. The bedside lamp had a short so kept going on and off unless you jiggled the lampshade.

I walked into my room last night and was floored by how large my room was. The soaking tub and walk-in shower were completely unexpected, and I had a great view of the Las Vegas Strip.

Unfortunately, I spent the entire night awake because of a grinding noise in my room. It literally sounded like a toy train was circling in my walls every 5 minutes. Despite the beautiful accommodations, my night was anything but relaxing. 

I went downstairs to let them know about the noise, and they apologized and moved me to another room. This room is at the other end of the resort. They didn't offer any assistance with moving my luggage, and no promises to look into the issue (I later saw that my room was next to the electrical machinery room, which I think may have been the issue.) I had to go back up 48 stories, grab my bags, and move them across the resort to the new room, while also trying to race to my conference.

The hotel is gorgeous. Sleek and modern with shiny crystal accents and art everywhere. We explored the property and were wowed by little bits of art here and there. Even the car entrance to the parking garage\/valet is unexpectedly glam with shiny, coated concrete that gleams as you drive in.

Our room was amazing. We used the upgrade option when we booked and, since it was available when we checked in, were able to get our chosen upgrade to a wrap-around terrace suite with a fountain view (East Tower) for less than if we'd booked it directly. That balcony view of the Bellagio fountain and north side of the Strip was worth every extra penny. We spent so much time on the balcony just enjoying the sights and sounds, and it was a pleasure returning to the hotel after every outing to enjoy the room and view. The suite itself was so roomy with separate living room, two bathrooms, and a handy kitchen with fridge. The fridge was stocked with the normal up-charged hotel beverages, but the top shelf was available for personal use.

This hotel is one of the best laid out hotels on the Strip, IMO. The garage is underground so no cars in the sun and no walking half a mile to get to the lobby. The lighting system helps you easily see if any spots are available in the parking rows. Two sets of elevators take you easily to the Strip side of the hotel (East elevators) or the lobby\/check-in side (West elevators). Once in the hotel you can get around easily from one tower to the next via hallways on the lower two floors. If you want to avoid walking through the 1st floor casino, you can do so by walking through the property on the 2nd floor. The 2nd floor also has direct access to the walkways across to either Planet Hollywood or Crystals\/Aria.

Great location on Strip, smack dab in the middle of the most popular resorts. Easy walking to most of them.

Boulevard pool was great. Morning was a great time to go with young kids. We got there when it opened at 8am, and it was pretty empty. Our kids had their fun in an hour and were ready leave soon after 9am. By then, the pool was staring to fill up and music was playing.

Great restaurants and coffee shop. Va Bene Caffe on 2nd floor near East Tower elevators was our go-to for morning coffee. My kids got the biggest kick out of the hidden pizzeria. They just loved the idea of eating ""secret pizza"" and trying to keep the entrance a secret. They also enjoyed pinball for the first time while waiting for our pizza to cook.

Now for the dings:

During check-in they told us that, due to their system being upgraded that day, they had to charge us up-front for the entire stay plus the deposit fee of $150 per night. Never had this happen before. Frankly, the desk person working with us swiped our card BEFORE explaining this to us and that we'd be charged $450 more than expected, which I thought was poor service. Fortunately, we could handle this unexpected payment up front. I felt bad for some who could not easily handle this, as I was witness to several people having issues with this at the desk, even a few people who were paying in cash. I believe this is a temporary issue and will be resolved once their system upgrade is completed.

One other ding was minor regarding housekeeping. For the most part all was great, but one day we returned to the hotel to find the dining table and a small side table not wiped down and that housekeeping had left a wet cleaning rag out in one of the bathrooms. I chalk this up to just one off day for housekeeping. All other days were great.

Overall, a wonderful stay. Other reviews suggested not bringing kids, but we never felt that ours were unwelcome. (I will note that we stayed mid-week and not over a weekend.) This hotel really exceeded our expectations. We'll be back.",1,0,1

Cons:
This place has bad customer service. We were told that we could check in early if we arrived before noon. We arrived at 11:30am and ended up having to wait for 4 hrs. The receptionist convinced us to pay an additional $100 for a room with a pull out bed, which we never received. We were handed our room key and then the receptionist walked away without telling us how to get to our room. We ended up going to the wrong tower until someone directed us in the right way. We arrived in our room and found a used condom inside. The bathroom didn't seem clean. We called management and it took another 2 hrs to change our room. When we got in the new room, we realized it was a different room than what we paid for. Housecleaning sucked. Our second room we found candy in the floor. Place seems dirty. We spoke to the manager and asked for them to take off the extra $100 fee since we got the wrong room. Also, we requested a $50 room service comp, which doesn't justify the bad service and dirtiness of this place.

Also, we brought food considering our room came with a microwave and dishwasher. We even called and asked the day before if we could bring a cooler in to carry our food. We started walking into our hotel a very rude security guard got really close to my face and said they don't allow outside food. Why the hell do they have a microwave, dishwasher in the room then! It makes no sense to me at all. Our food all ended up going bad, what a waste!

The crowd is the ""Jersey shore"" type and kind of trashy. It doesn't seem to be catering to the high-end luxurious crowd. A lot of bachelor and bachelorette parties with 10+ ppl in their rooms, which is how they can afford to stay here. In the room next to us, they had 15 ppl in their room.

They lie about the # of floors. You will notice floors in the 40s are missing and you will jump from the 4th floor to the 15th to the 30th. The bamboo pool is supposedly on the 14th floor, but it's more on the 6th. Place is just a bunch of lies and deceiving jokes.

Pros:
The bamboo pool was nice. Marquee is a cool club when it's not overly crowded and doesn't have creepy guys breathing down your neck. 

The design was cool, but not as cool as some other hotels I have seen. 

Next time I will go to the Wynn or Venetian.",12,6,6

The self-park garage has awesome green and red LEDs so you can see what spaces are empty or occupied from a distance.

Front desk staff was enormously helpful (Thank you Sarah and Jonathan!) very nicely explained the layout of the hotel and provided maps and information to make the trip awesome.

The lay out of the hotel\/casino.restaurant is less confusing and maze-like than other properties, I love that it has windows that open to the strip in the casino.

The rooms were beautiful and well appointed - go for the wraparound suite, you won't be sorry. Housekeeping was excellent (as a tip: if you call when you are leaving your room for a bit and they are right on top of it)

Pools: The Bamboo pool was chill, the Boulevard pool was rockin with awesome views of the strip and the Marquee Pool (free before 2pm) was bumpin.

This was hands down the worst experience ever. We checked in by a sweet girl however I payed for an upgraded room and they said it was unavailable, and would refund me in 7 to 10 business days. Then I pulled out my cc to pay the remaining balance and had a different cc, she then said well this is not the same card and we will need to charge this new card for the entire amount. Very irritating considering I already paid for one night and then I was over charged because they upgrade was unavailable. So anyway then On top of it I was charged 500$ for a room fee that would be refunded when I left, which still has not and that was a week ago! So to the room fine, clean but very loud! Maid knocked in the door at 6:40 a! ouch.....so loud...All around us, never stayed in rooms in Vegas that were that loud. You litterly could hear people pee next door! 
Then its ok if you're 18 years old this place is fine, not a hotel for anyone over 30.... drunken rude 21 year olds everywhere... unfortunately I will never be back! highly disappointed for 340$ a night I can find much better accommodations",0,0,0

Pros:

-Great Decor, a sort of ""old school, new rules"" type of vibe
-Great Hotel bars.  This is one of the only places in Vegas that you can legitimately bar hop in without having to pay for a wristband of some type.
-Great selection of restaurants (including a clutch late night pizza spot).  It's also connected to Aria through the Crystal shop which has an awesome English pub.
-Consistently hip and fund crowd, good dealers, and good drink service on the gambling floor

Cons:
-Price.  Like the other hot hotels on the strip, pretty much everything is pretty expensive here, from the table limits right down to the late night pizza.  You get what you pay for though, and hey, it's Vegas",0,0,0

Cosmopolitan is a fancy and luxurious hotel to stay in. We were there for their nye celebration as well as the jayz\/coldplay\/kanyewest\/beyonce concert. We were impressed by the facility. Chic hotel room with a terrace. Design is unique, which we definitely enjoyed. Spacious room with retro furniture and detailed finishing touches. Friendly, cute staff everywhere. Very quality mini bar selections. Love their Bigelow bathroom products. However, there're bounds to be couple of bumps and misses when they are new. I believe it is not because the staff is not concern, they just do not know what to do and where to go for assistance when things do not go as smoothly as their training had taught them. It takes some patience with the staff around this hotel. 

We enjoyed the chandelier bars, book\/stage bars, the restaurants, especially STK, pizza place and the Wicked Spoon buffet. The art pieces around the hotel were spectacular and nice to look at. It actually looks bigger in the inside especially when you're walking on 2nd\/3rd\/4th floor. The change images at the lobby is amazing. The pools were amazing especially the Boulevard pool facing the strip. You should definitely check out the Sahra Spa and schedule a massage. You will be taken to a whole new relaxing experience at this spa.

*Water temperature in the showers varies 15 degrees at LEAST a dozen times during a 10 minute shower, NOT okay
*$25 resort fee has appeared now, includes gym and WIFI
*Gym doesn't have filtered water bottles, which is standard at LV hotels.  The lukewarm tap water and waxed cups don't cut it for me, there was WAX floating in my water.  Disgusting.
*Housekeeping was pretty horrendous: dirty glass etched with lipstick, 1\/2 empty fridge and they don't clean the kitchen, they left our dirty dishes for TWO days.  WTF?!? 
*Didn't notice last time, but I requested a humidifier, they don't provide.  Thumbs down. 
*Pools were crazy packed 
*Still not a fan of the clientele or the casino

Liked the lip balm in the room and they give you a toothbrush!  Nice little details.  Their drugstore has healthy options and the room service continues to have solid food, though I found a suspect squiggly hair in my salad one day.  Skip the guacamole, one of the worst I have had.

I came with my senior citizen parents and my sister who was attending a medical conference. The studio was great in looks, but found out 5 of our lights didn't work!!! WTH?! 5?!!! We had someone come in and change them, but they said the reading lights above each of the beds weren't going to work throughout our stay, because well, they don't have any in stock. I have a feeling they don't plan on ever changing those suckers out and they're broken for good. We got comped $100 food credit for that, but really, if you're paying for the studio and you're there for a conference, I know it's vegas, but both reading lights above the bed?!!! those were the only lights that were above the bed. I've stayed at the Aria and the Trump and come to vegas almost yearly. This was a first. We were on the west end and it looks like this the more quiet tower and definitely the one that gets less love in terms of upkeep. The carpet outside of the 41st floor elevators looks like its buckling up and already in bad shape. Not good- the Aria is an older hotel and it doesn't look like this. The elevator video screen was perpetually broken and had handprints on it all day long. however when we used the east tower elevators, they were clean and videos working fine. 

We also used the pools- it was great. But if you're looking for a real pool experience where you swim in water taller than 4 feet, book yourself at the Aria where there are three real pools where people can actually swim in. The pools here were more for drinking and walking in and mingling. It's definitely a more party, youthful vibe, although it was all ages at the hotel and pool. My dad and I were the only ones swimming in the pool. hahaha. 

Parking experience here is much better than at the aria though. That was very helpful. You just get in an elevator from parking and you're already in the casino. Not true with aria or Trump (trump has the worst parking situation- only valet with no true parking lot connected to it). 

I would stay here again for convenience (parking and location). But don't plan on being wowed with your actual room (maybe bathroom) and don't be surprised if the carpet in the hallways looks yucky or if your lighting isn't working.",3,0,0

The Chandelier Bar is one of the most iconic bars right now and Marquee is holding its own title and reputation right now too. The rooms were good, but I think they were overly priced based on some of the other hotels in their competition level. I also went to a concert in the Chelsea room and i have to say, their sound system was really amazing. What I wasn't too cool with is the fact that they didn't let us in with our own water, then sold us a TINY TINY 6 oz. bottle of water for about $7. It wasn't even chilled and they took away our caps. I'm sure there's a reason for it, but not providing people water for free, in a heated environment like that, doesn't seem safe. Wish they priced the product with the inconvenience in mind. All in all, as an ex Marriott employee, I am proud of this venue. I can honestly say that it's their best product on the strip and their other hotels have a lot to do to be able to catch up to them.

At check in my room wasn't ready so not only was I immediately accommodated with another room but I was upgraded for free to a suite. How amazing is that. The room was over 1000 sqft and had multiple views from each of its windows. Lovely considering it was 34° that night and we were able to see the water show happening at the hotel below.

The suite was on the 25th floor in the west tower and was decorated beautifully. As you walked in the room there was a light switch to the left that had two buttons a hello button a day a goodbye both of which controlled all of the lights within. So you didn't have to turn off each light individually as you were entering or leaving (love the convenience) .

Next upon turning on the TV a good morning\/good afternoon\/good evening message was displayed with my name making me feel appreciated and noticed. (It's always the little things in life that mean the most). The main screen also offered a checkout option which helped and was very convent for those who don't like to wait in lines especially during busy times in the month. 

And lastly for me what did it was the comfy bed. I slept like a baby. The pillows and mattress were perfect not too solf and not too firm just right.

Price paid $159 + $25 resort fee (covers internet charge and access to gym, does NOT cover access to spa amenities).

The ROOM:  5 Stars
Well, let's just say it beat my expectations.  Most rooms in Vegas nowadays are pretty fancy and competition leads to some pretty decent prices, especially the lull time in early January pre-CES, but this was truly amazing at the price point.  I had about 400 sq ft with an open bathroom (set up similar to the Executive King rooms at the St. Regis SF with the bathtub open in the middle with pull-down privacy screen to the rest of the room), full wrap-around couch, office desk,  kitchen area with microwave, and comfortable king-size bed.  Everything is technology enabled, with full control of everything in room via your tv and remote....impressive!

The hotel Vibe:  4 Stars
So, this is definitely the ""it"" hotel in Vegas right now.  It is crowded, has many high-end restaurants (STK and E, good luck getting a res at E), and Marquee nightclub.  It is centrally located, which is great for reducing the time and cost of cab rides to other hotels on the strip, and Aria\/Bellagio\/MGM\/Mandarin Oriental\/Paris are all walk-able.  Unfortunately, there is still a bit of an ""Ed Hardy"" vibe going here with some of the crowd, which I thought had been consigned over to the Hard Rock, but not fully yet.  But if you avoid the casino, you'll avoid that...

The Service:  4 Stars
Being there for only one night, I didn't get a chance to make any obscure requests, but they delivered a WSJ to me in the morning and let me check out in the Platinum line to avoid the long check-in lines (I have no status with Cosmo).
NOTE:  If you have Marriott points, you may redeem them for Cosmo rooms, but you can't earn Marriott points by staying at Cosmo.

The Amenities:  4 Stars
I did not have room service, the internet was plenty speedy (make sure to say upfront that you'd like the resort fee if you plan to use both the internet and the gym, which will save you $10), the gym was pretty decent (had a boxing ring for those inclined...), and the toiletries in the bathroom are good.

Bottom Line:  If you are staying by yourself, the rooms are a huge value!  If you plan on going out here or nearby, the location is great.  If you are here for gambling primarily, I wouldn't recommend (stay at Encore).",3,0,3

Immediately you are transported into the Cosmopolitan universe as you reach the lobby and stand there in awe of what they pulled off. It's like nothing else you have ever seen.

Pros: 

location, our view of the bellagio fountains and down the strip were amazing. The convenience of being right in the heart of it all is awesome. 

Posh atmosphere: the beauty of the entire hotel is breathtaking. Everywhere you turn mod elements greet you. The rooms are beautiful and extremely comfortable. Every hotel in Vegas has a smell. If you've been in a casino you know what I mean. As soon as you walk into one it smacks you in the face. (Think coconut infused embalming fluid) thankfully the cosmopolitan has a pleasant fresh smell and isn't like many of the other casinos. 

Restaurants: from an awesome buffet -""wicked spoon"", Mexican\/Chinese fusion -""chinapoblano"", burgers and shakes- ""Holsteins"", a secret pizza place on the 3rd floor and many more places I didn't have time to try. Everything was really tasty and very easy to access. 

Easy maneuvering: unlike other casinos the cosmopolitan is so easy to find your way around. While still large, everything is very straight forward. The valet entrance, the front entrance, the elevators and the shops and walkway bridge. We were so thankful we didn't feel like we were all turned around and lost. This also seems to keep the traffic flowing smoothly keeping the crowds from clogging up pathways. 

Cons: I don't have any that I can think of. Everything was wonderful.",0,0,0

Service was good, room cleaning was great, restrooms were clean, I didn't smell cigarettes so heavily by the machines and tables, and I couldn't smell it all on the 2nd floor and on up so they have good air circulation and filtration.  

Our room was fine for our party of 4, and we had a beautiful view of the Strip and the Bellagio waterworks.  I don't ge the see-through shower and the open air 'no privacy' restroom.  I did like the double sinks and plenty of counter space, toiletries and towels though.  The dull lighting makes it a little challenging to get ready and put on make-up, but that could be dealt with.  

Taxis are easy to get at the hotel front.  The Wicked Spoon was decent for dinner and breakfast (you can get buffet to go too!), China Pablano was a hit with us, we had a blast at Marquee and thoroughly enjoyed the spa - awww!  :)  There is a little cafe on the 1st floor that serves decent cafe and there is a convenience store too where you can pick up water, etc. Overall, a good, fun hotel and with everything you need under one roof!

I have been a Vegas traveler since I was a kid. Yes, we stayed at Circus Circus, but hey, that hotel was the BEST back in the early 90s! :) Anyway, I have stayed at a LOT of nicer hotels since then: Luxor, Tropicana, Vdara, Aria, Excalibur, Planet Hollywood, Paris, and the Palazzo.  

For this brief Vegas trip (one night), I was shocked at how good of a deal the Cosmo was having for the day after Christmas.  I booked a regular room with two double beds and it was $153 with tax and the resort fee, which, for Vegas and staying in the City Center, is pretty darn good.

Anyway, we arrived super late around 5pm, and the lady saw my boyfriend and I and asked if we still wanted the double bed room.  I told her that if there was a room with a king bed and a free upgrade, that would be great, as my fiancé had never been to Vegas before. I was shocked by what happened next. She said she would upgrade us to the Terrace Suite room at no charge. If we wanted to face the city, she said it would be extra, but we were totally happy with the Terrace Suite (Who wouldn't be?!)

When we got up to the room, it really was a beautiful room.  The best thing about the Cosmo is that they are the only hotel on the Strip right now that actually has rooms with balconies (terraces).  No other hotel on the Strip has this, yet, and it really makes a difference.  We had a beautiful view of the Aria and the rest of the City Center as well as some view of the mountains.  In addition, the decor is VERY chic. You really feel like you are in a different world when you step into the room.  

The free WiFi with the resort fee worked great and we were really happy to have had that as we were able to use our laptops from the comfort of our room.  As for the work out facility (you better believe I was going to take FULL advantage of this after paying $25 for the resort fee!), it was very nice.  They will give headphones if you need them for free (not the highest quality but still a nice touch).  They had a separate area to do mat work, a boxing area (which was hilarious because people were boxing), tennis courts outside, machines for lifting, free weights, and, of course, tread mills and other running machines.   This facility was open for most of the day but they have another one in the East Tower that is open 24 hours a day.  I didn't check this one out because we stayed in the West Tower, but I can only imagine what that facility had in store for its guests!

The pools were being cleaned because they are outside and are closed for the winter months, but I went outside to view them and they seemed pretty nice as well.  Lots of space to sit outside, so I bet it is packed in the summer months.

Overall, definitely worth it to stay here.  The casino does not smell like smoke, as some of the older casinos seem to do so.  If you're into the going out scene, Marquee is here as well and, though we did not go this time, it is pretty chic and you can easily get in if you find a promoter around the Cosmo or online.",1,0,0

Without saying, the interior of the place is awesome.  The feel and the vibe is definitely unique and has it's own, trendy young vibe to it.  The first thing you see when you walk into the place are pillars with screens that change images.  Walk a little further in, a bar with a stage playing live music and then table games mixed into the floor.

As far as bars and clubs go, this has to be one of the best hotels hands down.  Every experience I have in Vegas is completely different here.  Drink at every bar, go to club, talk to every random girl in the place , drink too much, lose friends (not intentionally), end up in other casinos, and some how wake up where I am supposed to be the next day.

I pay to stay in 5-star hotels, because there is a level of consistency in how the rooms are kept. This one? I went to heat up my coffee, and there was a dirty paper towel with crumbs in it. I stood back and looked, and the outside of the microwave wasn't wiped down, either. I had noticed a blonde hair on the bathroom counter (my girlfriend and I don't have blonde hair) and water rings on the counter, but I was able to overlook that.

Once we opened the blinds to let the morning light in, we THEN saw the bathroom mirror was not cleaned. And the balcony glass? Hand prints ALL OVER it, low on the door (like a child has been trying to open it with greasy fingers).

I phoned the front desk and spoke to Rebecca, who I understood to supervise housekeeping. I shared these issues (also that there was only 1 robe in the room), and she assured me that they were going to thoroughly inspect our room and have it cleaned. I thanked her, but it was premature.

This morning, I went to heat up my coffee...THERE WERE STILL THE FOOD CRUMBS IN IT FROM A PREVIOUS GUEST. Seriously? So much for 'thorough' cleaning. They didn't even address the very ISSUE I reached out about..This reminds me of the kind of hotel you have to be concerned that they will clean the glasses with the same dirty towel they wipe the counters down with.

Whereas I thought this Rebecca was writing down the concerns, I now feel like she thinks I called to simply get something for free (which I even clarified I wasn't looking for anything) and didn't address any of it.

The inside is beautiful. And I work for a sustainable architecture firm so when I heard that the building was sustainable, I was even more excited about the space! 

The different floors were all beautiful in their own way and the different places we stopped for drinks\/food were delicious and the service was friendly. 

So the inside of the concert hall (The Chelsea) it was beautiful with chandeliers and great screens for the seated crowd. However the seats we were in were bleachers and not designed very well. The seats are so close to one another that the men next to us were well in our space. 

It also felt like it took forever to get out of the concert area when the show was over, despite all of the open spaces that they herded the crowd through to get out.

I've  been to the nightclub Marquee twice before and tried Wicked Spoon but never have stayed at the hotel. Luckily for me, I got a really good deal and stayed here over my bday weekend. I would have to say that this hotel hands down was the highlight of my weekend.

Being that the Cosmo hotel is catered toward women with it's sexy deep red colors, pristine (non-smoky smelling) hotel lobby and casino, it was already a win for me. However, what put it over the top was the phenomenal customer service from the check in process to room service. I definitely felt like the staff went above and beyond with their friendly attitudes and positive vibes. The room itself was outstanding - a class above the Encore & Wynne.

My room overlooked the Bellagio fountain and I had a perfect view of the strip. At night, it was breathtaking to see the city with all the lights and colors. The room itself was very spacious and the L shaped couch was almost as comfy as the one at home (which is saying a LOT!) I loved how there were 2 TVs in the suite (one facing the bed and one in in the ""living room."" The bed was insanely comfortable and the pillows felt like clouds. I haven't slept in a hotel bed this comfy since my stay at the Maui Ritz Carlton. The bathroom was gigantic with a jacuzzi tub, shower with a bench and dual sinks. I really liked how the toilet was lower to the ground (I have shorter legs, yo!). I never heard one peep from my neighbors to the side or above me which means that the rooms are very well insulated.

However, there was a major change in my viewpoint  as there was a huge shift in stars.

The place is nuts in the bars and clubs so I am a fan now. 

Champagne Bar is really slick and is a big time meet and greet for singles place. Its the biggest bar in the place outside, of the clubs but very cool and broken up into different areas for chilling with friends or a date. Its not too meat marketish that women fear going in alone, but more fun and a great place to hang.

The other bars scattered around the casino are also great places to just chill and have a drink. Meeting people from everywhere and the young hipsters are more than interesting to watch. I seriously enjoy just sitting at the bar meeting and greeting people coming and going.

As for the shops and such, its top notch. Stitch is really slick and the owners there are very cool. its not for the faint of heart suit pretty much starts at $1,500 but its really a cool place to check out.

We both have never had an experience that was so nice, luxurious and amazing like we have at the Cosmopoiltan. For our honeymoon they upgraded us for no extra charge to the Terrace Suite with a view of the Bellagio fountain just outside our terrace. The room was clean, very roomy with nice furniture, a huge open shower, a Japanese Soaking Tub (which you can look out through the terrace and see the Bellagio fountains from!), a big comfy bed and two big flat screens (one in the living room and one in the bedroom) You can control the climate, lighting of each room, make appointments, check out and do so much more-all with the TV and the remote! Room service was quick! We had a light bulb out in the bathroom and it was fixed in less than 5 minutes from the time I called! The terrace was comfortable with a small couch and an awesome never-before seen (to us) aerial view of the fountains.

The overall look inside the entire hotel is very new and modern with flat screens everywhere, built in to columns, inside the elevators with unique art shows playing on them. There are pieces of art all over as well and the attention to detail is extremely high. The Casino doesn't reek of cigarette smoke as do the other casinos that we have been through. You can't miss the extravagant Chandelier Bar that is just something you have to see for yourself. The restaurants (at least all the ones we have dined at) are all top-notch with the highest quality and creativity that is worth the reasonably high prices that you pay. 

The service from all the employees from the front desk, bell desk, room service, valet to the bartenders are all best that you can expect from such a nice, upscale hotel. The service always seems personalized to us. It really gives you a feeling of luxury.

We've used two of the three pools (The Boulevard and the Bamboo,) and both were relaxing and quiet - it wasn't all Spring Break up in there, which suits our laid back personalities best. 

My wife treated us both to a couples massage in the Sahra Spa and it was a luxurious experience all by itself. The staff made it very personalized just for us. We both got massages that custom to what our needs were at the moment and my wife got the prenatal massage and I got one that focused on what I needed work on. It was very relaxing and was very nice to be in the same room together.

On our stay for our anniversary, we checke!d in around 3pm and our room wasn't going to be ready for another 2 hours! It was Sunday and everyone was leaving so we were just going to wait. They then offered us an upgrade to the Wrap-Around Terrace Suite for a generous price since we had to wait so long. We decided to go along and try it out. The room has all the amenities and features that our room the year before had and then some! First of all, the room is HUGE inside with a laundry room,a full kitchen with a stove, two seperate bathrooms and showers, a big bath tub. When you step out onto the terrace, the amount of area that you can see is just breathtaking! The room was bigger than we could have utilized but it was our honeymoon and it was worth upgrading!

The hotel is ultra modern, beautiful, comfortable, and probably the best food I've had in a hotel in a long time.  I'd say this is more of an adult hotel, doesn't seem to cater to kids in any way, especially since the majority of their rooms types have king beds only (some sofa beds).  I really didn't see many kids at all during my 3 day visit.

ROOMS:  I stayed in a City Room the first night.  Very comfortable bed.  There is a window that goes from the shower to the bedroom area, but don't fret, there is a shade on the side of the bedroom that you can pull down.  That was my concern as I was staying with friends.  In the picture on the website you can't see that shade!  I moved to a Fountain View Terrace Room the second night and was even more impressed.  NOTE:  the only rooms on the website showing 2 beds are the basic City Rooms.  They DO have Terrace Rooms with 2 beds, you have to call to make the reservation and ask for them.  They do not advertise them on the site at all.  So if you're bringing friends, you must make your reservation that way.  The layout for the FVTerrace Double is a bit different than they show on the site with the King since it has 2 beds instead of one.  The beds are not by the window and there is no dividing wall.  The couch is a small couch, not an L-shaped couch (in case you're thinking of being able to sleep 6, this won't happen).  The Fountain View Terrace room had a beautiful view, could see the entire Bellagio fountain water show and a beautiful view of the strip, mountains and all the way to Rio and the Palms.  The shower is huge, nice jacuzzi tub, dishwasher (you must ask the front desk for dishes, I'm guessing at an additional cost), mini bar fridge is full and a freezer that's empty, and a microwave.  There are hookups for just about everything on the tv, including iPad. The terrace is a perfect size.  I also viewed the other rooms.  Warning on the one bedroom, if you're traveling with friends, there is no shade on the window in the shower and Soaking Tub.  So unless you like your friends watching you shower, only reserve this room if you are a couple.  Some of these rooms have sofabeds, some only have a couch.  Ask when you reserve. All rooms have lighting controlled on the tv as well as manually which is a really nice touch.  I toured the other rooms that were larger, not a bad thing to say.  They were all beautiful.     

RESTAURANTS:  We ate at Holstein's, Wicked Spoon, Milos, and STK.  All were phenomenal!  The lobster mac and cheese at Holsteins melted in my mouth, the freshely prepared fish at Milos was to die for (this is a family style restaurant) and the atmosphere and food at STK were both hip and delicious.  The Wicked Spoon has a great buffet, a bit on the pricey side but since I'm a Marriott Platinum member I got 2 for free.  They pump current music through the restaurant at STK which I loved.  If you're looking for a quiet romantic dinner, this might not be the place for you unless you go really early.  Find the Secret Pizza Place...everyone raves about it.  I know where it is but we never made it there.  3rd level, long hallway in between Jaleo and Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar.  It's not on the map nor does it have an actual name.  Though I'm guesing some day they'll put it on the map and call it just that.  It's open till 4 am, great for late night munchies after a night out of drinking.  

CLUB:  We went to Marquee.  Very impressive.  While I'm not into the extremely crowded scene, this club was huge.  Many levels, outdoor area at the pool.  Modern house music.  My only complaint was that it was too crowded and we could barely walk through the club, let alone dance on the dance floor, but I expected this on a Saturday night.  If you don't mind the crowds and love house music, this is the place to go.  

LOCATION:  This is the place to be.  It's smack dab in the middle of the strip.  Everything in walking distance (Cabo Wabo across the street...awesome food), shopping, food....the only time we cabbed it was to check out Freemont Street since I hadn't been there in years.  That cab ride was about $25\/way.

Overall, I can't imagine staying at another hotel in Vegas after this visit!",2,0,1

We got comped two nights in a wrap around terrace suite and we didn't want to leave! The service was excellent and the employees genuinely seemed to want feedback on our stay.  Other than the really crowded casino floor it was a really nice experience.  As other reviews have already said this place is gorgeous.  
The wrap around terrace suite was the BEST hotel room I've ever stayed in. Everything seemed to work perfectly - room service was prompt, bell service also speedy, and again really friendly staff.  The terrace was the best part.  Yes everything is hi tech and contrary to some reviews, everything worked well. 
We didn't have a chance to try the restaurants here - but room service food was excellent and the ""secret"" pizza place was delicious.  We actually went there twice.  Will definitely go back to the Cosmopolitan again, even if not comped.",0,0,0

The room: we booked a terrace view room on hotels.com and were in the west tower, floor 30. we had an awesome view of the strip but it was a bit more the backside of the Bellagio fountain and decent bit of their parking lot. Our bed faced the Bellagio hotel which was a bummer, if it was faced the opposite way we would have faced the strip. it was quiet and a beautiful room. Pros: well decorated, nice size, nice balcony and the bathroom was good. Cons: the panel for the TV didn't work with our laptops\/iphones and we had all the proper cords. we are techy so we wanted to have our music or videos playing and we couldn't. the lights either were all on or all off and if you wanted moody lighting you had to go to each light and dim them or turn them off. so the ambiance wasn't great. no coffee pot but it had a microwave, dishwasher and fridge, but no place to put your own stuff. all mini bar stuff. hate that. had to go from floor 30 to the 14th floor for ice. that was annoying. bathroom didn't have a ton of space to put our toiletries but it was glamorous.

Service: very speedy and helpful, but when we spilled a cocktail we made on the duvet, they brought just the duvet, not the cover sheets that it has, which was a little dumb. 

Room service: food was adequate, the quesadilla was great, spare rib buns were blah and breakfast was all right. boyfriend said the breakfast sandwich was dry, my pancakes were fine, nothing special but I wanted the basics so I was cool with that. Cocktails had to be off menu (but they had a few listed for breakfast hours?) and were very expensive. we bought our own tequila and mixers and had to get ice 16 floors down. oh well.

Casino: it was fine, did a decent job handling smoke.

Restaurants: good selection! I want to try STK next time, Milos was really pricey but as expected, decent but not my favorite. Holsteins Shakes and Buns was fun and great for late night. Wanted to try the new Enoteca but we arrived just after the last seating.

Pool: see my review for the Boulevard pool! had a great experience with the cabana.

Likely will return, but may try the Aria, boyfriend likes the Palazzo, so not sure.",0,0,0

The Cosmo had previously been my favorite property in Las Vegas and my preferred place to stay and play due to its solid service, beautiful facilities, comfortable rooms, outstanding cocktail lounges, and impressive restaurants.  However, after a disappointing stay on my last trip due to what I believed to be promises not kept, I vowed never to return.  Shortly after I got home and posted my review of the Cosmopolitan http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-cosmopolitan-of-las-vegas-las-vegas#hrid:B7vdaIN-AbD7RuPo3U7xCQ\/src:self, I started receiving offers in the mail and email enticing me with a couple of comped nights to return.  Seeing as how the gf and I had been planning a Vegas vacation, we decided to take them up on the offer.  

Upon our arrival, the Cosmo made a great first impression by having its customer service reps out in the lobby guiding guests to various front desk representatives to expedite check ins\/check outs.  Although the front desk was crowded with guests engaged with most of the desk reps trying to check out, the lobby rep directed us to an open counter, which made our check in a snap.  More importantly, our room, a Terrace Studio (1886) http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-cosmopolitan-of-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=UM9CxbN2qVkSa-usgHLDGA#UM9CxbN2qVkSa-usgHLDGA,  was ready and waiting for us.  There's nothing like being able to go immediately up to your room after a long, early morning flight into Vegas!  Throughout our stay, the Cosmopolitan continued to show why it had been my favorite place in Vegas and why it had earned another chance with me.  Its strengths such as offering one of the best lineups for restaurants (Milos is outstanding for lunch) and definitely serving up the best selection of cocktails from its bars, specifically Vesper and Chandelier, of any Vegas property had not diminished.  The housekeeping staff was ""invisible"" to us during our stay.  We left each day with our room in need of housekeeping and came back in the evening (or early morning) with it reset. Cocktail service by the comely cocktail waitresses while at the gaming tables or machines was prompt and friendly.  The only critique item I have from our stay were the pillows on our otherwise comfortable bed.  The pillows were seemingly worn down, providing little support, and needed to be replaced.  Thankfully, I spent very little time in the room sleeping while there.

The Cosmopolitan has returned to my good graces and I'll most likely stay there on my next trip to Vegas, especially if they continue to offer me comped stays.",4,2,3

The room was great as always but starting to show some age. The hotel is going on 5 years old now and had a burn in the carpet, a loose shower handle and when we arrived there was some gunk inside the fridge - the staff cleaned the fridge as soon as we notified them. No worries!

The balcony is the primary reason we stay here. Fresh air and standing outside watching the sunrise (or sunset depending on where your room is located) or taking a quick nap in the patio furniture.

The bad-- no late check-out. Really? After gambling a shitload all weekend I can't get an extra hour. So you get everyone to leave at the same time with only a couple elevators working!!!  Smart!  The elevators were a NIGHTMARE!!! People were slammed in and missing flights having to wait 45-60min. Bell desk, don't even think about it. Over 50 people in line, one or two people working. We walked to the Aria and had a bell hop come up to us within 30 seconds to check our bags... They had bell hops everywhere. 

Buffet was good, really not as great as everyone is making it out to be. Went for brunch and couldn't even get an omelet without waiting 30 minutes.  Again, understaffed.

There weren't any Independence day decorations going on which I thought was strange but regardless of their lack of patriotism, the Cosmopolitan is pretty much heaven for the hip, young, and fabulous. They have restaurants galore, a complete casino, and one of the best clubs in Vegas. 

The terrace view rooms are great. They have voyeuristic bathrooms with Japanese soaking tubs and shower. The rooms are huge and they have huge balconies. Egyptian cotton linens are rare in the hotel world but they have them. Nothing is better than sleeping in a bed with linens almost as good as home. Everything is available through the television in your room. Throughout the hotel they have humongous touchscreen tvs that are used as directories for the hotel. There are screens everywhere in the lobby and the elevators displaying changeble art by different contemporary artists. There is art everywhere in this hotel.

Wicked Spoon - cheap buffet with amazing desserts

We have stayed at a lot of five star resorts & hotels, and this one is right up there with the best.  For such a massive hotel (close to 3,000 rooms I believe), they do an amazing job.  Breakdown:
Common areas - the lobby is simply amazing.  They spent a fortune on this area and it shows in terms of the quality and design.
Rooms - the rooms are very large and include small balcony's.  Be sure to get a room overlooking the Bellagio water fountain if you can.  The rooms will either have a kitchenette (frig, microwave, sink) or some have a full kitchen.  This place was originally going to be high-end condo's but the previous owner defaulted on the loan \/ DB took over and turned it into a high-end hotel.
Casino - I'm not a gambler, but they did have a nice casino floor in my opinion.  One BIG plus was the ventilation - while this is a smoking area, you really didn't smell it that much like other casinos.  Big plus for us non-smokers.
Service - Service from every single staff member was top notch - from the VIP check-in, wait staff at any of the restaurants, and anyone from the staff who you might run into in the hallways or common areas.

Yes, this is an expensive hotel, especially by Vegas standards, but the quality is there in my opinion to warrant the rates they charge.  Others must agree because the Cosmo is commonly sold out.",0,0,0

Another plus about this hotel is the customer service. The staff is amazing and the dealers at the tables are awesome! I love gambling here because the dealers are super talkative and always help me out on my basic strategy at the black jack tables.

Well, I'm only doing it because of how much I absolutely love this place.  It is gorgeous, intriguing, fun, funny...remarkable...amazing! Not enough adjectives in the world.   The underground parking garage is great, you walk in and literally every little crack and crevise was intricately planned with not one detail left out.   

The decor is incredible, thoughtful and unique.  It's like an art gallery set up as a luxurious casino.   The furnishings, the artwork, the frickin' vending machines that sell art! Yes art in a vending machine! Amazing.   You could wander this place for days and find something intriguing in every corner, nook or cranny.

The Chandelier bar is beautiful, comfortable and classy.  The drinks are pricey, service is great, you feel like a celebrity just sitting there.   It's three levels high, and ample seating with an more than ample-selection of cocktails and liquors.  

The pools are beautiful, unique and well designed.  I didn't get to enjoy them though, as the weekend we stayed the wind was crazy and the pools were more like whirlpools!  Oh well, I want to come back and do some maxin' and relaxin' by the pool(s) another time.  I'd love to see one of the concerts they put on by the large pool one day too....they always seem to get the greatest artists to play their venue.

The semi-secret pizza place hidden down the narrow hallway near where all the fancy restaurants are is a great suprise too.  Nothin beats some freshly made slices after a few drinks in Vegas.   I'll eat at STK or something when I'm sober.... but I'm in Vegas so not sure that will happen!

OK, now the best part, the actual hotel room!  It is amazing...like a posh Manhattan apartment!  The huge whirlpool tub with a separate shower for two (three or four) in the beautiful well designed and fully stocked with C.O. Bigelow products bathroom is fantastic.  It looks out on to the suite-style room with luxury linens and flat screen t.v.'s and awesome uniquely stocked (and expensive) mini-bar with a bunch of things you want to buy but realize you don't want to spend the money on!   There are art books on the side and coffee tables that you can peruse and buy from hotel services if you are so inclined (In fact, I think you are able to buy just about anything from the room, new of course, from the hotel if you desire).   BUT , the absolute best part is the large balcony that is off of every room in the hotel.  This is not a common thing in Vegas, but at the Cosmo it is standard.  We got a room facing the fountains on the strip and got to watch the water\/light show from our balcony all evening.  I honestly could live in this hotel and not really need to leave the room.  This is the kind of hotel you stay at because you want to enjoy the room, not one of those places to rest your drunken' head for a few hours and quickly leave to go party some more.

Prior to the trip to call about early check in and the front desk confirmed the one bedroom would be ready by 11am with the suite being ready shortly after, and we could use the autograph lounge for VIP check in. 

When we arrived the valet gave us grief over having a large number of bags..... we drove from LA so of course we took advantage of bringing snacks , drinks , decor. The valet said he may have to talk to his manager and had a cold attitude. Shrugging this off when we went into the VIP lounge it had a funky smell and was pretty mediocre. During check in they determined neither room was ready, and ignored my upgrade request. We decided to settle at the chandelier bar and waited 2 hours until we were told our suite was ready. At check in since they had given us both room keys we opened the adjoining door to the one bedroom king to find it trashed, as it was 2pm we decided to wait until 3 before calling reception. 

As more girls in our party arrived and it was 3pm I called the front desk and they confirmed house keeping was en rouTe and the prior guests had a lat check out. You would think they wouldn't allow late checkout for rooms eligible for early check in......

We went down to gamble and came back around 5pm the room still wasn't clean and the front desk was giving me excuses and finally sent someone to clean. If we didn't have the suite available and had to sit around the lobby, maybe they would have been more accommodating..\/\/

Around 9pm hotel security came to our room to say a guest had made a noise compliant. This is where I was officially over with the Cosmo management. We had music on at elevator level noise and were at the very end of the hallway with no chance of a guest walking by. I found the experience very disappointing and found it clear this was not a place for young adults looking to celebrate. Additionally they reservation staff asked if we were celebrating any special occasion, which we said bachelorette party they said they made a note. ZERO efforts were made by cosmo to acknowledge the fact. 

Lastly we went to marquee day club and a girl in our party wore her bikini and a skirt cover up and the security said she couldn't enter without a top cover up....this is a pool party!!! Girls had one piece swimsuits on with half of their tops hanging out.

Who by the way, could not communicate for her life. She assumed my brother and I were married (same last name I get it), but she did not ask what kind of room we wanted and gave us a king size bed. After we asked for a roll away  bed, she still didn't figure it out and ordered the bed for us. I realized her confusion later and went to a different person who corrected this. And was then informed she never ordered the roll away bed either.

The Cabana host, Jaime, at the BLVD pool was a total jerk. If you have to work for tips, do the work, then you get the money. I'm not gonna throw bills your way when you give me attitude to do your job! WTF! Unfortunately, I didn't catch our server's name, but she was awesome.

I like:

1. The very central location of the hotel. It feel like you're in the epicenter of Vegas where all the action is.
2. Nice, modern, well appointed rooms, complete with hipster art books.
3. Full view of the shower and tub from the bedroom is great for voyeurs and kinks.
4. The terrace balcony to the Strip is great for flashers.
5. Young, nubile females roaming all over.
6. Marquee Night\/Day Club

I dislike:
1. The shower was scalding hot and it was stuck on that setting. I ended up taking a shower in the spa tub.
2. The dealers cleaned me out at every table. It's unfair to hold this against them but I will cause it's my review. Went on the worst losing streak ever here. Very un-Bond-like.
3. The buffet gave me food poisoning.
4. People are dressed better than I am here, nothing is worst than feeling average.

The final score is 6-4 in favor of Cosmopolitan so I guess I'll stay here again. I'm already on the reservations page as I'm completing this review. I hope they give me some food voucher or a table at Marquee for the poisoning incident. Yacking and diarrhea almost ruined my trip, good thing I'm a party stallion.",4,14,4

Thinking that this would be comparable was the wrong thing to think. Aria staff from top to bottom is friendly and nice. Cosmo, not so much. Hotel is just ok, and restaurants are over rated and over priced. Nice view of the bellagio, but that's it.
Examples of poor performance. Blow drier died. Called desk and asked for another. Did not get it that night. Called the next day and asked that it be sent up. Two hours later it showed up. Walgreens must have been busy. Maid forgot to do our room. Called the desk, hung up on by the desk three times. Fourth times a charm. Every thirty minutes a maid showed up to clean the room. The first one had it. Two tv's, one is not working. I did not dare call about that. At the Aria, hotel guest are treated like kings and queens. Everyone says hello and have a good day. At the Cosmo it is the Home Depot service as all of the employees don't acknowledge you. They also do not take care of the drunk and unruly. 0700 in the casino a patron is harassing every woman that walks by. The hotel ""security"" does not care or take care of this. He was allowed to continue on with his bad behavior. On the balcony, which was nice, was not cleaned. Stains on the chairs and beer bottles left from the last guest. The day we did have maid service, the maid elected to not provide any new shampoo, conditioner or bath soap. She did put the caps back on the empty ones and placed them back on the counter in the shower. Note to self, check the bottles before taking a shower. The Aria has security at the elevators to protect the guest. The Cosmo does not. They have all the security guarding the pool entrance, but not the guest at the pool from the drunk guest. Great to have a dishwasher in the room, but there are no dishes. Too bad there is no coffee pot or coffee cups. The dishwasher is lonely.
Last, the master light switch is at the front door. Not much of a big deal until you turn all lights off. It is a very dark room and getting from one side to the other is no easy task. At the Aria, the master switch is at the bed. Push the button and the drapes close, and lights turn off.

From the shuttle ride in, we approach COSMOPOLITAN, in big shiny letters, across the wall of the main entrance outside the hotel lobby. When we get out, we are approached by bellmen inquiring if we need help with our bags, we decline and continue in. Take a breath, we are inside The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. OMG. Ever changing displays on the pillars of the hotel lobby. What a way to welcome guests such as ourselves. 

Checking in was a breeze. Barely a wait, could be because it was during off season, but it was fine by me. The deal I booked apparently came with $75. resort credit and by coincidence, we were offered the Eastside Tower upgrade for additional $25. a night. Yes please, I already knew what the Eastside was about. And it basically paid for itself with the resort credit. Wonderful. So far oh so good. 

Since the hotel lobby is in the very back of the hotel, we walked to the front or strip side to the Eastside Tower elevators. Pass The Chandelier bar and all that hanging string of shininess. Love the decor, stylish ceiling tiles, interesting artwork and upholstered elevator walls. Mirrors everywhere so you can check yourself and make sure you are looking just as good as this hotel. Secured access to the rooms as you need to insert your room key in order to push your floor button. 50 was our lucky number. 

We look at each other, know its the right moment. Wow. This is really happening. Door opens, he hears nothing but OMG, OMG, OMG as I walk through our terrace studio, admiring every inch of this place. Full length mirror adorned on the sliding bathroom door. Big jetted tub, perfect for my nightly bubble baths. Oh and its normal for the jets to turn on by itself after use. Huge shower for two or maybe four. My fav, dual vanity sinks. Comfy living area with interesting books on the table. Cool, the would be area rug is like a built in. Interesting wallpaper everywhere. Desk with leather drawers. Kitchenette with a freezer that actually works and a microwave. King size bed with down pillows and a cute storage chest in front of it. Closet with two luggage stands, no need to flip a coin. And censored so in case you leave the door open, the lights automatically turn off within a few minutes and back on if you move near it. Cute desk and mini chair, perfect for my purse and miscellaneous belongings. Flat screen TV's in the bed and living area, and you can control room settings from it too. And a touch screen phone. 

The main reason I was so excited, the balcony. Now I know people think, ""why would anyone need a balcony if they're not gonna stay in the room for much of the day"". Well, its just nice to have one. And if yours happens to face the Bellagio fountains and the rest of the strip, you will understand. Believe me, this was by far the best view from any hotel I've ever stayed at in Vegas. There is also a little sitting area and table, perfect for late night cocktails or early morning breakfast. If it wasn't so cold, we'd have eaten our room service breakfast on the balcony. Yes, there's that much space out there.

Convenience. This hotel was just so convenient. If you do stay in the Eastside Tower, it is so conveniently located near the doors exiting onto the strip. Perfect for those long walks from the Wynn back to our home we called Cosmopolitan for 4 days. Food options everywhere. 

Do I need to say more? If you're not convinced that this is the place to stay, I don't know what more to say. This is my new favorite hotel on the strip and I can't wait to go back. I feel the same about you Cosmopolitan, I am me after all.",6,1,2

My friend and I stayed at Planet Hollywood towers for 2 nights, and thought we'd check out The Cosmopolitan for our 3rd. Big mistake. Big. Huge.

We arrived at 4 pm on Sunday. We waited in line to check in for no less than 30 minutes. We watched as a few people in front of us argued with the front desk, and wondered what was the matter. We finally made it to the front and were told that there were no rooms available. We had a reservation, but they were out of rooms. We were then told by the very nice young man (I know it's not his fault), that it would be 3-5 minutes until a room would be ready, and we'd get a call on our cell.

We decided to get a drink at the bar while we waited 3-5 minutes. After waiting 20 minutes at the bar while 6 bartenders walked around and ignored us, we finally got a drink, but no phone call. After 30 minutes we went back to the front desk to ask about our room. The line was still absurdly long, so we went to the concierge. She was also very nice and went to get the front desk manager for us. We explained the situation and he told us that our room would be complimentary and that they would put a rush on cleaning our room. I'm not sure what they were doing for all the other people waiting in line who didn't complain, but I couldn't start a revolution.

The room was fine, whatever, but it clearly had not ever been occupied. The refigerator was unplugged with wires hanging inside (it was stocked, with warm drinks), a piece of the freezer was sitting on the counter, and the living room lamp was still wrapped in plastic.

Classy.

Two more notes about the Vesper Bar in the lobby: 1) they ran out of Jameson. Yes, Vegas ran out of booze. 2) there is a bartender with a fauxhawk who needs to be taken down a few notches. Or just taken down in general.

The hotel itself is probably fine, but the service is terrible and the fact that they don't have rooms is just unbelievable.

The Cosmopolitan is trying to convince us all that they're really glamorous yet SO underground and different because even though you're sitting on elaborate velvet chairs, there's a lamp next to you that's neon orange and made out of a milk carton; fashionably contradictory and therefore hip. [Insert infinite amount of eye rolls here] 

This whole place is just a douchebag. It only looks busy all the time because it's a high-rise building and therefore each floor is pretty small. It's noisy and chaotic because it's just one big traffic jam of hipsters in vests and fedoras trying to figure out where Marquee is.

Wth, we then missed our afternoon plans... got to our room, wow what a great room until you look a little closer, very poorly cleaned. If you lifted a glass there was a ring of dust, all of the snacks had dust. My neighbor opened her drawer and found condom packages. Our bathroom was half stocked, we had to call for toilet paper and they never brought it. Asked for towels, never came. Now the Bed however seemed very clean (good they focused on that) very comfortable. The elevators designed poorly each time we used it took about 20 min or so because every time it came it was FULL. OMG and the pool, wth, I never thought that prior to booking I should ask what the prices are, turns out they have very little free\/first come seating, it is all reserved, meaning you have to pay a min. $600 in food and beverage to reserve a simple lounge chair, not even  a cabana, rarely anyone could afford this which means more than half was empty and nowhere to hangout.

If you have the money to get the expensive rooms then you ""should"" be good.  We upgraded our room to a wrap around terrace suite and the room is bigger than most people condo's.  it have every amenity you can imagine, but we had a few problems.  The main shower wouldn't drain.  It had inches of standing water and would take all day to drain.  The other problem was the TV kept cutting out saying HDMI disconnected.  When you pay $15 a movie and it cuts out multiple times making you rewind, or watching regular TV and have it happen and can't rewind...it sucks!

When I informed the front desk, they said they would take care of it, never did, and didn't even offer as much as a buffet comp. This is a very expensive room for an average person like myself, and to have these problems, not have them addressed, an not even get a ""Sorry"" from the hotel staff is inexcusable.  Now I'm not greedy, but some type of comp for messing up my showers and movies would have been a nice gesture. Probably going to look at a suite somewhere else next time.  Although...if the hotel had fixed the problem right away, comped me a meal or something for my bad experience with one of their premier suites, I might have said something like, ""A few little problems, but they were fixed, we got taken care of, and I'll be back"".

In recent times, I've come to Vegas for work. We decided to stay at the Cosmopolitan for the first time since it seemed chill. Artistically, this casino and the hotel is goregous, chic and trendy. 

We stayed at a a one bedroom suite with a Japanese soaking tub. Room had attention to detail with temperature and lighting controls on the smart tv and at your bedside table. With anything electronic there's something bound not to work which there were a few light here and there that didn't. The only thing I didn't like about the room was that there were traces of dust here and there. 

Probably one of the most comfy rooms I've stayed at. The room came with a large  balcony with a sofa to relax.

The shower is an open shower that opens to the soaking tub with window views from the bedroom and balcony. 

The casino itself isn't that large but does have some nice restaurants and a central signature chandelier bar which is on a few tiers. 

The pools on the otherhand weren't anything spectacular. If you're looking for some sun in the afternoon, the other buildings block the rays from the pool area. 

Other than that, this is the place to stay. Ranks up there with the Wynn.",9,5,8

True, there are MANY great bars, restaurants, and nightclubs, all for the taking at all hours of the day and night. Luckily for you, almost none of them are affiliated with the hotel directly. This is definitely the place to come and party, see and be seen - and that's about it. Staying here as a registered guest is another VERY different story. 

From a hospitality standpoint, the Cosmopolitan is hoteling for beginners. It was very disappointing, especially given the price tag associated with staying here. Asking to have the room cleaned shouldn't seem like an unusual request, but here it apparently is too daunting a task for this staff. Need some additional towels or a late check out? Go Scratch! From a design perspective, too much can be MORE than enough, and unfortunately, there's something to be said about ""blowing off all the fireworks in the box"" at once. Any attempt at trying to piece together the various design elements here is a struggle.

We reserved a $2500 for a cabana for the day at one of the higher end pools. A little steep, but it always pays to have your own space at the pool and enjoy more personalized service. Unfortunately, we didn't receive either. The pool was cramped and the service was poor. I've also never been to a casino where they were in such a hurry to close down gaming tables and get the night over with. The casino was a beautiful ghost town, but again, I've never heard of casinos turning away money. 

The slick marketing team behind the hotel promises Hermes and Louboutin, when in actuality it delivers Coach and Forever 21. Let's remember kids, you are staying in a Marriott after all, and it shows. Stop by for a cocktail or dinner, but promptly take your coins elsewhere. If you are accustomed to a high level of service, look elsewhere.",3,3,5

As a Marriott status holder, I was able to check in at the Autograph lounge, but never received a text when my room was ready. The other members of our party received texts way before 3pm but no matter, we went back after 3pm and manually retrieved our room. Not the end of the world, but not really Autograph level service. Fine.

The rooms are adorned with kitschy decor which I appreciated. While our view of Planet Hollywood on the 66th floor was less than ideal, we were happy to be on such a high floor. That was pretty much where the positives ended though.

A few comments:

1) Despite being on the 66th floor, the noise from Marquee or wherever it originated from did not spare us 64 floors down. This happened starting mid-afternoon, so forget about relaxing or napping in your room during the day! 

2) The bathroom door is strangely, overly heavy and slams upon closure. Not sure what the designer was thinking when he made this choice; it is a nuisance and worth mentioning because everything else in the room is otherwise smartly and deliberately designed. 

3) The concierge service takes forever to connect. You'd think a massive hotel (of this caliber and price point) would employ massive amounts of (well-trained, qualified) staff, but I was placed on hold for 20 minutes before anyone picked up - who are you, my cable company?
Thereafter, I was assured that my toiletry items could indeed be brought up, only to be told after waiting another 20 minutes that they weren't available. Next time, check your stock room and tell me over the phone so I can run to Walgreens across the bridge and pick these things up myself instead of wasting an hour waiting around.

4) Room service is a joke. I needed a spoon and was told the spoon wouldn't cost me anything, but there would be a $15 delivery charge. My room was $500 a night, and you can't deliver a spoon to my room...makes a ton of sense.

5) My shopping bags with items I bought *STILL INSIDE A BOX* were removed from my room. Since when is it appropriate for housekeeping to remove a huge box and shopping bag from a guest's room? I was not able to retrieve these items unfortunately so housekeeping made out with a nice little gift from Barney's that day. 

6) Another service issue: our party of 7 went down to The Henry for breakfast around 9am on Sunday and was told the wait time was 10 minutes. All were present and we ended up waiting 30+ minutes. No apology, just frazzled hostesses. Meanwhile, the restaurant was empty. One can only guess it was a staffing issue. How is this possible...you're the only sit-down breakfast restaurant in the hotel, you should know better. 

All in all, very disappointed with the service at Cosmopolitan. I have visited Vegas multiple times a year for nearly 10 years in a row now and have stayed at many hotels across the spectrum. This was by far the most disappointing experience I've had, not because of any major transgressions, but because of the sloppy service and lack of attention to detail that a 5 star hotel should be held to.",1,0,0

We went to the registration desk to check-in and found out our room was not ready because they thought we were a no show.  To compensate they immediately gave us a $50 food and beverage credit.  The lady checking us in then gave us a room with a view of the Bellagio water show which we thought was pretty cool.  On our way up they called us back and told us they upgraded us to a balcony studio room\/suite on the 58th floor. This room was AMAZING and the view was even better than the first room!  Saturday morning we came back from Vanity and ordered room service, we were able to get a huge pizza for only $26. That is awesome for room service, considering that the following night my friend ordered a $40 hamburger HA!  Overall, we got a fantastic deal and paid about a third of what those rooms are going for now!  

* There were two things that I disliked, one was the TV would not shut off and was blaring all night long. My friend did not want to bother engineering and ended up eventually unplugging it. 

* And the other was there was always a long wait time when calling room service and concierge.

Also, when I checked in, I found 2 toe nails on the sofa, which was really disgusting. I did not want to complain about this until the overall experience really pissed me off. 

 This is a busy weekend, and their staff was not ready for it at all.  They only care about booking out all the rooms to make as much money as they can, and dont care about their customers at all. From my point of view, they shouldn't book out that many rooms when they are not prepared.

This is the 5th or 6th time I stay here, and every time their service gets worse and worse.

This is a big hotel, and they get enough guests, so they do not care about what an individual thinks or says. There is nothing we can do, but to avoid staying here and let them learn the lesson.

The details are really what make this place shine. From the get-go, I was lulled by easy parking, beautiful murals in the parking garage, sleek elevator screens, and the most gorgeous lobbies you'll ever see. A good example of a small detail that makes a big difference was the fast and attentive check-in. Rather than stand behind the desk and wave you over-- totally expected & okay, but don't you always feel a little like sheep being herded?-- the attendants actually come over to where you're waiting in line and walk you back, welcome and chatty. They're genuinely friendly, wear these smart grey tailored suits, and set you on your way. Captures my whole stay!

The layout of the room was just as well thought-out and delightful, from the funny\/inspirational\/kinky books laid out around the room, to the 'Hello'\/'Goodbye' buttons by the door that turn on\/off all the lights, to the TV where you can play music, explore amenities, and check out when your stay is done. The bathroom and the ""Japanese soaking tub"" in my room was gorgeous... have you ever sat in a gleaming tub with a drink in your hand, looking at Strip lights from the 58th floor? It'll happen here. Fluffy down comforter and pillows, delightful robes, plenty of space... I think there was a dishwasher? All the amenities except a coffee machine, but there's a Starbucks in every casino.

I could go on, but I'd love for you to discover more details on your own. The hotel is stunning with a young, modern aesthetic that I found invigorating, especially after the excessive theming of most of the Vegas casino resorts. It's definitely high-end, but still feels welcoming. I would love to return, maybe order breakfast to have on the terrace, or check out the clubs and shops in the hotel. Great location in the heart of the Strip, a stone's throw away from the Bellagio, Caesars, the mall at Miracle Mile, and more.

P.S. I would highly recommend 'Secret Pizza' on the third floor for your late-night cravings; delicious, greasy New York slices with just the right amount of exclusivity to keep all you Yelpers feeling special. :P",3,0,1

Love the chandelier bar, love that you can bet on the card game ""War"" here, and love the occasional musicals they play for free on stage at the bar! 
Also, love the Marquee club here! Both day beach club and night club. Still my top 3 clubs in Vegas to go to!

It was my consotrium's national meeting which is held in a different location each fall. I truely believe they did an awesome job by picking the Cosmopolitan.

I work in the travel industry so I am quite picky about where I will stay. I love love loved this hotel. The food was a bit on the pricey side, but eh, it is Vegas after all. I stayed in a normal double suite, and I wasn't lucky enough to over look the strip, but I did have a wonderful view of the Aria Hotel and of the pool deck at Cosmo. The beds were comfortable, the pillows abundant, and they room stewards kept the room sparkling clean. There was a nice size flat screen on the wall. The bathroom had a large walk in shower, no tub. You could probably fit 8 people in the shower. There was a large rain shower head. There was also a window from the shower to the room.

The mini bar is well stocked with everything you could want from red bull, coke, water, nuts, and candy to condoms and lube.

Some of my other travel friends were upgraded to a two bedroom suite that was absolutely amazing. I would definately stay here again.",1,0,0

We had a handicap room so the shower just had a curtain and fold up seat. The water got all over the bathroom floor because there's no divider. Our room was above the pool so didn't have the great view of the Bellagio fountains. It's a huge place and there's a lot of wasted space it feels like walking through banquet hall areas to get to the other side of the hotel. The pools are nice just get there before 9:00am if you want two chairs together. Decent restaurants, one place for coffee and breakfast items. It would be nice if they had more fast food type places instead of all sit down. Oh, the elevators require a room key and it is so tricky to get them to work.

Overall Hotel - ritzy looking everywhere...lots of black and white - Millennial Hot Spot- this is where the cool crowd stays, so expect to see awards handed out for every slutty tattoo on otherwise nicely dressed young ladies and guys.  Great check in experience with really helpful staff.

Rooms - We had the two bed fountain facing WEST side tower.  Decent size room, comfy bed, TV didn't have a sleep button - always annoying if you want to leave it on to fall asleep to drown out the noise from the thin walls in the rooms next door.  Nice staff that cleans the room.

Bathroom - voyeuristic shower that allows you to watch who's in the shower and other areas...you can close it, but not necessarily my thing.  It was dark in there as well, but maybe we all look better in that dark lighting.  The trampy wallpaper in the toilet reminded me of those Playboy mudflaps you see on 18 wheelers...

Pool - we did a cabana at the Bamboo Pool as it was 105 degrees that day.  Nice to have the shade option as it was blazing hot.  We had Cabana #1 - not the best location and in the sun a good part of the day.  Terrific food out there and the drinks were outstanding.  You need 6 people to make this cabana food minimum work, but the two of us did a nice dent.  Pool was a little cold for 105 degrees, but it felt good to cool off a bit.  Water was overloaded with Hawaiian Tropic lotion.

Restaurants - We ate twice at Eggslut, it was that good.  Get there early and not too bad of a line.  Loved the Fairfax sandwich.  Also ate at Holsteins for a milkshake and late night snack.  Shake was good, had the Coffee and Donuts...coffee was there, but donuts...not so much.
The buffet looked great as we strolled through to see what they had, but didn't get to eat there this trip...maybe next time.  Stopped by the Pizza place - that looked a little out of place to the rest of the joint...kind of an afterthought...but lots of the hip kids were there getting there pizza on.

Long line for cab on the great exodus on Sunday.  Also lots of people all check out at the same time.  Expect to wait.  We didn't find out until we got to the front of the line that as Marriott Gold Card members, we could have checkout out in the lounge.   Next trip.

If I have events on this part of town - like the TMobile Center - this is where I'd stay again.  Easy to get to and central location.  Not quite the same experience as the Encore, but it was fun.",2,0,0

Now with my new project of connecting major brand hotels with local restaurants in the works and seeing how awesome the hotel industry can be.... I've decided to write many future reviews on my experiences with all the hotels I've patroned in the past in LV.... I will call it, the Henry Hotel Collection...... So without further adieu, I'd like to introduce my first Las Vegas Hotel.... The Cosmopolitan!

My reviews on the hotel series will be consist of the following 5 areas....
1)  Location
2)  Decor and Room Styles
3)  Service and general Staff interaction
4)  Environment of crowd
5)  Price

-Location:  
Situated in the heart of the new Las Vegas South lies the beautifully created Cosmopolitan...  Squeezed in between the famed Ballagio and the newly hip City Center Cosmopolitan is primely located where all the new hot actions are all at!  Easy access to PH, Paris, Bellagio, Caesars, Aria, etc. makes this hotel a very desireable lodging decision.

-Decor and Room Style:  
Opulent + Hip & Stylish is what I would call the Cosmopolitan...  With giant crystal chandliers hanging in the middle of the hotel travelling all the way up at least 3 floors brings the opulence of the hotel while all the trendy stitched faux leather (or maybe real?) covering the walls truly brings the excitement out of this casino...  At the check in you will find ever changing columns where you will see anything from flowers, patterns, to michaelangelo famed paintings constantly rotating... just wait till you see the bookshelf image... pretty cool!  
The rooms are absolutely beautiful with a large bathroom, 2 sinks, whirlpool tub, standing shower, separated toilet away from the shower area, and the peek-a-boo divider curtain makes the rooms super cool!  Rooms can be operated via central control located on the phones in the room and there are 2 - 40"" LCD TVs with a microwave for your enjoyment...  Be sure to try to get the terrace suite... you have an awesome balcony where you can lounge in a day chair\/ ottoman and take in the awesome view of Vegas!  (Get the higher floors if you can)

-Service and Staff interaction:  
Check ins can be a bit slow, but overall the staff at the Cosmo is wonderful and accomodating...

-Environment of Crowd:  
Young, hip, wannabe rich, obnoxious, rude young douchebags....  This is what really turned me off at the Cosmo... yes... there are many people like this in Vegas... generally at the clubs when they are drunk.... however, it seems that all of them no matter if they were drunk or not, all congregated at the Cosmo.... too many rude and in appropriate comments made to the beautiful ladies at the hotel is super annoying... guys... keep your mouth shut and maybe you will look better in front of these girls that you are trying to pick up......

-Price:  
Uber expensive!   Upcoming weekend at the Cosmo has the rooms going for $600!!!  Really?  That's like 7 rooms at Imperial Palace!!!  Little too much for my blood but I was fortunate enough to enjoy the wonderful rooms via comp.....  But again.. the location, the new hip place to be making Cosmo one of the high end expensive Las Vegas Hotels....

Would I return... yes for the rooms and the hotel, no for the scene there via douchebags...

More exciting reviews for the Henry's Hotel Collection coming soon.....",7,7,7

I like how the elevators to guest rooms are right in the lobby next to reception so you don't have to walk thru the smoky casino to get to your room, my only complaint is there are no lounge area in the lobby for families with little ones. 

Rooms were nice and clean, very upscale and the view from our terrace was awesome. We did have to pay extra for the fountain view, but worth every penny. Also make sure to Chk your balance before checking out, there were tons of Sh!t billed to our room that we weren't aware of, but one call to the front desk cleared it up. If not for the unexpected charges, and getting kicked out of the bar area with my 4 yr old, I'd give this place 5 stars.",0,0,0

The boulevard pool is lavish and sure to be the it spot for summers to come. The casino area is over cramped with multiple games which gives off the feeling of a downtown casino. Restaurants are posh, but I think the cosmo sets itself apart with the lounge like bars. A good use of space and distances itself from other casino lounges. Music is resonating throughout the casino but quiets down upstairs for people watching and restaurant areas.",2,0,0

During my most recent trip to Vegas, I was super excited to stay at the Cosmo. I had been to the hotel to eat and gamble and loved the decor and ambiance. 

After we checked in and got to our room, I was underwhelmed. The room wasn't very large, the window was tiny, and there wasn't a lot of natural light. The carpet also looked pretty worn down for a hotel that has only been around since 2010. The room also had terrible sound insulation and we could hear anyone walking down the hall as if they were standing right next to us. 

The next morning, we noticed that the safe was already locked. We picked up the phone to call downstairs, but the phone was broken. We ended up calling from a cell phone, and reception said that they would send someone to open the safe in about 15 minutes. We wait 25 minutes and call again, the front desk tells us they are on the way to our room. 10 minutes later, someone comes in and fixes the phone. We wait another 15 minutes and call again, and the front desk says they will be at our room in about 10 minutes, since a security guard needs to be present when opening a safe. Another 15 minutes and another call, apparently they are already on the way to our room. 

Meanwhile, the technician that fixed our phone comes by to tell us that he contacted the technician who opens the safe and that he's on an emergency and won't be free for at least 30 more minutes. 

Wtf?

I am outraged since I already wasted over an hour waiting, the issue is not anywhere near resolved, and I'm late to meet my friends for lunch. I go downstairs to the front desk and ask for the manager on duty, and she apologizes with no explanation and says that if we know what time we'll be back, they can prioritize our work order in front of others. 

It seems like this could have been easily avoided if someone had done their job properly and checked that the phone was functional and the safe was open. Instead, we were left wasting our time on what seemed like a wild goose chase. Why was it that no one at the front desk knew what was going on? Why tell us that someone is on their way to our room when clearly there was no one available? Why wouldn't you give a more accurate estimate of the amount of time that a guest has to wait?

I gave up and had no functional safe during the remainder of my stay. 

We also requested late checkout and were denied without any sort of explanation. 

3 stars overall, minus 1 star for the horrendous service. I would not stay here again given that there are a ton of better choices in Vegas.",5,1,0

The rooms are very nice and did I mention I love the cute stilletos you run into? The Chandlier and the Bond have a very nice ambiance and vibe. I'd say I ran into Mike Tyson here at least twice already.

The Chandelier Bar has got to be my favorite part of the hotel, so gorgeous!!  I've only been to Wicked Spoon, Holsteins, and Marquee but I finally had the chance to stay here this past weekend and I was blown away.  The room had a half kitchen, a huge bathroom, 2 beds, a couch, and a patio.  I fell in love with the patio.  We had a view overlooking the water show at the Bellagio and it was the best view of the strip, hands down (see pic: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=WFcEfqUr7J-k7fCMYJty_A).

I know it's strange to say but the room I stayed in (suite) *smelled* good.  Not the bleach or cleaning materials the cleaning staff used.  It smelled like fresh sheets and cotton.  My view wasn't that great (got to see the Aria and the highways) but I could look below me and see the hotel pool.  The amenities are courtesy of C.O. Bigelow, the same company you see in Bath and Body Works.  The towels were soft and my soaking tub was put to very good use.

Every restaurant I went to here was great (see my recent reviews).  The staff were very quick to respond to small requests.  Having drinks at The Chandelier Bar made me feel like a I was an actress on set.

I didn't even used the darn pool or spa. I just don't get the logic of inviting guest for a free room then charged him a resort fee on the back end. $33 per night is nothing compared to how much I play. It's just the fact that other hotels doesn't do that. Like Mandalay Bay or Palazzo for instance, they don't charge you extra or resort fee when they comp you.
Anyways, I requested a king room and Eric put me in a 2 queen room. My wife and I were disappointed when we got to the room. It's just a hassle going back down and request for a change of room when the line was long.

Parking is easy and spacious, the conference is in the west tower, the little drive to the parking garage isn't well marked, but if you are heading south on the strip, when you see the Cosmopolitan building, turn right into what looks like an alley. The ramp down to the garage is on your left.

They conveniently tell you how many spaces are open on each level, and each space has a red\/green\/blue light (blue for handicap) above it to let you know if it is available or not.

The food is well above average for the conference, the muffins and pastries seem like they are made fresh (I know, when do you ever get that?!?)

Where was I going with this??

Anyway back to the Wrap around Suite..

That suite was the bizznazz. It was definitely some playa pimp type stuff right there! I'm  surprised that some rooms actually have a balcony to go out on. We didn't just have a normal balcony either. Not just one sliding door to go out to a little area. We had a whole wrap around!! Excited much about the balcony?!? uhh yea!!

Now that's what you get for waking up in Vegas! \/cue Katy Perry

But really, every morning I would wake up to the city. The sun. The MUSIC!! I think that had to be the first time ever fist pumping as I woke up!

Did I mention our balcony looked right over the Marquee Club and Pool area!??
SCORE!!

https:\/\/s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com\/photo\/aLQAmFBVpikvbu6P8BHOEQ\/l.jpg

That meant a birds eye view of the pool, the ladies, the bikinis, the ladies, the pool and more bikinis!! Oh and the DJ and his music. 

Ok enough  about the balcony. That was a highlight of the room though.

Other great features of the suite:

WASHER & DRYER: Did we use the washer? Nope. But we did use the dryer to dry my wet draws! Oh and to get wrinkles out of my shirt when I was to lazy to iron!

FULL KITCHEN: This definitely came in handy. We saved a lot of money by actually using the kitchen. We made breakfast every morning. It was like our own bachelor pad for this trip.

LIVING ROOM AREA:We did a lot in this area: Drank. Danced. Did push ups. drank some more. Flexed. and more push ups.

I had to take away one star because we couldn't hook up the karaoke to the TV. Yes, we take our Magic Mic to Vegas. (not to be confused with Magic Mike) it's a lot of fun when you are drunk and try to sing.

The main bedroom had a king bed. A bath tub. A shower. An exit right to the wrap around balcony.  Nothing fancy.

 The hotel also has one of the more popular clubs here: MARQUEE. We went to the pool party here. Kascade was spinning great music, drinks were flowing, and everyone was acting a fool in the pool! I believe other things were flowing in the pool too! 

The casino portion of the hotel was ok. Seemed small. They had some pretty loose slots though. (yes, I said loose slots not  loose sluts, but I'm sure you can find the other roaming the streets!!) I like  to play the Wheel of Fortune Slots. I won a couple hundred the first day I got in!! Yeaaa buddy.

Overall I would definitely stay here again. Wrap arounds are fun. So are the wrap around balconies! teehee",5,12,4

It's chic and stylish. They have restaurants you want to eat at and shows to see. Drinks to drink! That's my favorite thing!! I LOVE their award winning food and beverage department! Their drink creations are amazing. I've not stayed in a room but I've been in them and they are ah-maz-ing! No wonder they cost a pretty shiny penny. I love the details in the decor. I love that they have resturants that you want to go to and are worth going to. I love Cosmo's trendy ways.
 

Recently we saw Chelsea Handler. Well the tickets said she was playing in the 'whatever' theatre (I forget the name) so we are all over the place trying to find a place that doesn't exist. Only to find out it's the Chelsea theatre. so we take the long walk there, and we want to get drinks and the line is sooo long. Luckily we said forget it and there were more bars ahead! Don't get sucked into the first bars you see! So we get drinks and we get stopped by an usher who directs us to the usher at the door, that usher directs us to another usher that was behind us and that usher directed us to the wrong seats! Which really wouldn't have mattered because the back of the theatre wasn't full but you know how people are. The theatre itself isn't that impressive for the Cosmo really the seats weren't terrible, I mean we did get pretty much the average priced tickets but they were ok. Not what I expected for the Cosmo. Anyway, glad you're in my city Cosmo!",2,2,1

I would recommend going to The Cosmopolitan, even if your not staying there.  It's so beautiful, and everyone can appreciate the work put into the design and decor.

My favorite place is the The Chandelier bar.  We like to party inside this giant chandelier. The bar is 3 stories tall, and has it's encased in an enormously audacious chandelier that is said to be strung with 2 million beaded Swarovski crystals.

I told them that I wanted to pay cash for both of my rooms for my bachelorette party. I did not want the Cosmopolitan to charge my room twice ( only because they hold the amount and process the amount both at the same time) The idiot asked me 5 times if I wanted to charge my card for the rooms. REALLY?!!? Then he said they would be holding a 300$ deposit for my rooms, did NOT mention that it was for each room. I was shocked to find 600$ charged on my card. They fail to tell you the small details to make your trip smooth. For example, we were not aware room credits did not include gratuity. When we called the concierge on a SATURDAY NIGHT, she said that the buffet would be "" $22.99"" She did not ask if it was for tonight, breakfast, weekday, or give us other prices because on weekends, the prices are higher for their buffet. 

The rooms were very nice. Other than that my stay was NOT memorable at all. I came as an excited customer and left dissatisfied and annoyed with the hotel and almost every hotel employee 

Almost everything needs to be improved. It took over an hour to get toilet paper to a room with 10 girls getting ready. It also took over an hour for bath towels. The concierge lacked customer service. Your employees at the front desk\/check in needs to learn the definition of customer service 
perhaps give them a dictionary and book mark ""customer service"" for them. Our doors did not work the whole weekend, yes we were comped but we were locked outside of our room for hours. None of our key cards worked did not have a coffee maker. The concierge, customer service knew nothing about the hotel. Gave us all the wrong information. Extremely misleading.

After the past few days of traveling and sleeping in our moving truck the night before, we were looking forward to arriving at a hotel so we could get some real rest. Traveling took a little longer than planned and we originally had a reso for June 1st using my boyfriend's Marriot points. We called on Sunday asking if it would be possible to switch our reservation to Monday, June 2nd. They were able to accommodate us and gave us our confirmation number. When we arrived Myra looked us up and said we were in for yesterday and were put as a no show so our points were used. She tried several confirmation numbers but found nothing. She went to talk to her managers Alfonso and Nate I believe their names were and came back telling us since they were fully booked they're not even suppose to be booking right now but they can give us a complimentary upgrade for $250 which is a great deal since their rates are sky high right now. So, you're telling me.. You used our points and you're fully booked and cannot book anymore rooms but you can give us a complimentary upgrade for $250. Oh my god what a deal!! So this means there is a room available. At this point my boyfriend was pretty upset and said that we definitely have a reservation for today and we have a confirmation number. No manager has come to assist at this point and Myra is pretty fed up with dealing with us. We called Marriot and they told us we definitely still have an active reservation and even gave us a Marriot confirmation number. This whole time Myra was saying, those numbers are too long that wouldn't be our confirmation number but we'll try it anyway- not in the best tone of voice. Instead of thinking, hey maybe someone should call their reservations manager or Marriot she decided to conveniently go on lunch when my boyfriend had a Marriot employee about to speak with her. She handed us off to Kevin who took it upon himself to call guest services was told that our reservation for today was canceled. He then decided to call Marriot and spoke with someone himself who told him that we in fact had a reservation today and it's still active. There was a mix up with guest services and the new reservation was never put in. We get that mistakes happen but this was over an hour of us trying to check in when it should've taken a few minutes. Kevin was seriously amazing. We appreciated his effort to resolve the issue. Cosmo needs more employees like Kevin. He got us an upgrade, $50 room credit, and a late check out which was nice since it took us over an hour just to check in. As a front desk agent, you're the first face guests see and you're usually the first person someone goes to with issues. Kevin was great and should definitely look into a managerial position because all their manager did was come over to the computer to ok the upgrade. Not even an apology for the inconvenience. I get the Cosmo is a massive hotel and managers are super busy, but instead of asking how are you (when you know we are NOT good), an apology for the mix up and inconvenience would've been nice. Thanks again Kevin! You made our stay at The Cosmo awesome!",2,0,0

I would suggest getting a Terrace suite at the least because they come with a balcony.  The even more expensive suites were made for parties, since they come with full kitchens and huge refrigerators to stock with your own alcohol and food.  I also love the fact that you get into Marquee for FREE on Thurs, Fri, or Sun if you stay at the Cosmo.

We were upgraded, but it sounds like everyone and their mother gets upgraded, which makes me question that actual value of the rooms.  We were in the wraparound terrace suite for two nights, and it was very nice and spacious, lots of hanging out areas, although I'm pretty low maintenance when it comes to hotels, so I'm not the harshest judge.  Balcony was really nice to hang out on; apparently, most hotels in Las Vegas do not have balconies.  While the view of the Bellagio fountains is nice, the fountain show every half an hour gets a bit annoying.  Luckily, the sliding doors were pretty sound proof (not entirely, but good enough).  We had a kitchen, which was a welcome touch, but there aren't any plates or pans, so you can't really cook anything.  We just used it to chill champagne and store leftovers.  I loved the layout and openness of the bathroom and bedroom suite.  I usually find hotel bathrooms claustrophobic and awkward, but the huge separate tub and shower and two sink areas was great.  There is another full bathroom in the hallway, so the lack of privacy isn't a big deal if you have guests over.

Since it's one of the new kids on the block, it obviously appears tasteful and modern.

Highly recommended and with great reviews, Cosmopolitan had one essential feature I wanted for our Vegas honeymoon destination; a great pool. In fact, it has three including one that bills itself as ""toptional"". Cosmopolitan's and more specifically Marquee's concept of this differs widely from mine, by the way, but this does not cancel out the fact that everything is absolutely gorgeous!

Located mid strip, close to the shops at crystals, and across from miracle mile, it's super convenient for shopping. Several great restaurants are on the premises, and although we got to experience only a few, I feel confident in saying the food is EXCELLENT!

Staff or Co-stars as they call them, are all very courteous and accommodating!   From allowing a very early check-in to having our room cleaned outside the schedule, valets, and room service, everyone we met was great.

I now absolutely believe all the reviews when other patrons of the hotel complain about pickpockets.  I was at secret pizza and a man was eyeballing me when I was waiting for our food with my son.  He managed to slide right behind me\/next to me even though I was leaning against a wall and super close to a arcade game.

It's now Tuesday night right before mid night and the D-bag next to our room decided to play his music on full blast absolutely inconsiderate of anyone else on the floor.  I tried to be a good neighbor and called the room but no answer so we called the front desk and they sent security up to the D-bags room (took them 10-15 min to send someone) They lowered the music and I heard him say they were leaving soon anyways so I guess it's ok to be a prick for about 1 hour before you leave and party with your D-bags friends who started to arrive and bang on doors and letting the door slam behind them while coming and going.  So we called the front desk again and now it's quite but guess what everyone is wide awake include our 4 year old son.

My previous stand-by hotel was The Hotel at Mandalay Bay, but the Cosmo blows the doors off of The Hotel -- with insane opulence, a sext younger vibe, and attention to design details.

However, that said... here are the negatives from my last (first) stay at the Cosmo (I had an upgraded 1BR suite):

My room was on the 34th floor facing the pool area and the thumping house music was so loud from the club that I could make out every word from every song (and I like House music). Ear plugs didn't even help because I could FEEL the bass from every song. This went on until 5am! 

When I registered for the room, I asked for a QUIET room... maybe ""quiet"" is some sort of hip Cosmo slang for ""loud""?

Other missteps:

- Living room TV didn't work
- Environmental system controls in BR TV didn't work
- No Movies -- menu item didn't work
- Maid didn't leave wash clothes after cleaning the room (!!)
- Cigarette butts and ashes from previous occupant on balcony (nasty)
- Fingernails (yuck) on floor... maid didn't vacuum after previous guest? (double-nasty)
- Room service took over 1 hour to bring up a $25 burger. Should've ordered Dominoes
- Though the desk area in the room has all kinds of media hook-ups, strangely there was no way to charge my iPhone anywhere in the room. Even cheap hotels these days have docks.
- Coffee maker was broken
- No soap for the tub\/shower (glad I brought my own body wash)

At check in we had been assign the bedroom with a king bed we asked if it could be changed to a bedroom with two beds since there were two of us and they change that immediately. We stayed on the 52nd floor not a great view not a bad view the beds were like clouds, Way too many light fixtures if you asked me... and one of the lamps wouldn't turn off. They provide you with robes and nice slippers, plenty of towels and toiletries. Now to the best part in my opinion that bathroom that bathroom is everything!!!! shower with a shower head that had five different settings, a Jacuzzi tub, two sinks, and the toilet that is in a separate cubicle inside the bathroom. the Hotel at its core is very artsy and young, as a matter of fact the hotel main clientele are young people in their 20s and maybe in the early 30s who still act like they're in their 20s.

The Cosmopolitan is beautiful and looks like the top supermodel on the Vegas strip to beat.

The lighting is placed flawlessly and with precision to set the right mood to make you feel good.    Not too dark to be too somber, but simultaneously not too bright and flashy to strain your eyes.    The elegant,  crystal chandeliers that are strewn throughout are absolute eye candy. 

I went at nighttime so nobody was at the pool lounge because it was so cold, but I can tell this is going to be 'buzz' when the weather warms up a bit.    Pool tables, foosball tables and posh cabanas are scattered throughout to create a cheerful atmosphere of a party.  

Cosmopolitan is a hotel part of the Marriot conglomerate so it appears that they are shunning the typical Vegas look and embracing the old school Vegas Rat Pack fused with a fresh neo-modern look.

I filed a complaint on her. YAY GO ME! Now off to the room, yes room was very nice however the iron was broken, AC was broken as well as 2 lamps needed their bulbs replaced.

Dammit I need more words. Fine.

Have stayed at the Cosmo when it first opened, and it was fine. Reaction was neutral - not anything I'd write a review on. My main complaint this time around stems from the interaction with the check-in agent. Initially he was affable, engaging in friendly banter as he tried to up-sell us to a larger suite. However, after we declined several times, he completely shut down. Gone were the smile, personality and willingness to use his breath and facial muscles to form additional words to communicate. His attitude degraded to that of a side-of-the-interstate, $40\/night motel clerk, barely surviving his soul-sucking graveyard shift as he angrily ponders the terrible choices he made in life. I wasn't looking for much more than a happy, ""have a great stay!"" but that was simply too much for him to muster.

While we tried to look past the front desk experience, it became clear that the attitude carried through in the overall mediocrity of our stay. While I had hoped to be wowed by the amenities and accommodations, I was disappointingly underwhelmed, adding further to my dismay. Rooms were ok (run-down and old looking). Wicked Spoon was ok, definitely nothing compared to Bacchanal at Caesars. Did not see the ""unique and different"" vibe this hotel has been marketing.

its probably going to sound like a cliche but i am completely in love with this hotel-everything about it-especially the room!

if someone video taped me when i walked into my terrace studio (4435 room \/ west towers)..i just dropped my jaw and i said to my bf ""OMFG!"" i left my bags at the door and ran through the room like a lil kid ""oooohhh-ing"" & ""ahhh-ing""  haha.

the terrace studio is just purely amazing. esp my room\/location of my room was amazingly big and had a great view of the bellagio water show. i was def. beyond impress w\/the cleaniness and spacious bathrooms (2 baths!) ..if i could i would live here esp for the master bathroom. we took advantage of the kitchette and brought our own beer, food\/frozen food of course and save $$ on wasting it on food on the strip.

my only gripe about the hotel was that i got to cosmo around 1:40ish PM to check in and they told me i was too early and they didnt have a room open yet till 3PM-6:30PM..and i read this on yelp before how people had problems with waiting forever for them to call you when the room was ready, ppl having problems when they never called at all and etc. i never had a problem w\/any hotel ive stayed at in vegas so this was new to me.  I was NOT about to wait till 6:30PM to have my room ready nor wait forever  for them to ""call me"" or accidently forget. so my bf and i just gambled at cosmo till 3pm..i physically went back to the lobby and check myself and he said it was ready!

*so note for you guys, dont wait till 6:30PM  or for them to call you for your room to be ready..check it yourself..physically!

i love their parking structure haha is that weird? love the art on the walls, very modernized parking structure...showing how many spaces are left and little lights showing you a occupied space or not haha

the room.... OMG. SEXY.
its unfortunate they only had one bed...so my friend slept on the couch. he said it was very comfortable and you could sleep like 3 people on it easily. They had a modern kitchenette (stovetop, microwave) and TWO HUGE HDTV s on each side of the room.

once you step out on the terrace, its even more breathtaking than the room. I could see the front entrance of Planet Hollywood right in front of me and the rest of Las Vegas's glitter and lights. You could even look down at the swimming pool.  #amazing view

the casino is huge and the dealers are very friendly. just don't expect $5 dollar tables.

Great venues to lounge out, a modern casino with a great vibe, delicious dining options from the high-end STK to the dirt cheap Secret Pizza , and not to mention beautiful rooms that make you realize just how poorly you've decorated your home and how uncomfortable your furniture is. 

I made some of the best memories of my life at The Cosmopolitan. 
I rang in New Years Eve with Stevie Wonder in 2012, threw up in a private bathroom and blacked out for 4 hours the same night, came back and got married exactly one year later, and watched several members of my immediate family get alcohol poisoning. 

The staff here is 5* the whole way around. The bartenders, security, front desk agents, and restaurant employees all treat you like regulars that have been coming for years. Every trip to Vegas I see Cosmo staff seeking out people to make even the smallest things in a trip be more enjoyable for their guests. For example, this past 4th of July weekend I saw what I assume was a manager on the 2nd floor near Holsteins step in when he saw a group of tourists taking pictures in front of the Chandelier Bar to snap a few shots so all of the group could be in them. It seems like a small gesture, but when they are multiplied by 100 every trip and all over the resort, it's hard not to love the place.

As far as gambling goes, for someone in their mid 20's the only place that comes close to having such a great vibe is Planet Hollywood, but I prefer Cosmo's music selection which features tons of Stevie Wonder and Charlie Wilson when it comes to gambling environment.

They will play games with your mind and When I complained and asked to speak to a manager this was the response via txt msg

 Thanks buddy no one made any threat I just didn't feel I was getting the customer service I deserved wow what a response! Very nice customer service!!

 I won't be staying there ever again and in my opinion their players club is a complete scam!!! I could have paid 10x over for my room bill with what was wagered but it's ok I like Aria and Mandalay much better.

 Will go back there.  Marquee is the only reason to go to Cosmo but do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else their rooms are very small and so is the casino.

Beware that you will not get what you booked and beware that you will be overcharged for what you will not get.

Of the many hotels my wife and I have stayed in in Las Vegas, the Cosmopolitan is, hands down, the worst hotel anyone could ever choose to stay in. There is no frontage to the hotel. You walk right in from the sidewalk and there is no lobby. People sit in the second floor ""lobby"" eating pizzas by hand, dripping food all over. The driveway has three lanes, two to enter and one to exit for all cars to valet park, self-park, or drop off someone. This is for a hotel with 2995 rooms; thus, the drive way is a nightmare.

I'm not crazy about camping & I don't claim to be an expert camper, but I do love to go glamping! If your idea of roughing it is deciding which hotel offers the most amenities, best casino & best restaurants, rooms, etc. & you can't decide which Hotel to stay at in Vegas, keep reading...

My recent stay at The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, NV was a gemriffic, 5-gem experience & is the perfect place for all you glampers, young professionals & hip older people. 

The Cosmo has all the 4 Cs needed for a glam stay in Vegas:
1) Courteous, professional customer service
2) Cutting-edge restaurants, bars, casino, cool pools & shops
3) Centrally located on the Strip (walking distance to major attractions, shopping (The Forum Shops & Crystal Shops) & other big hotels\/casinos on the Strip) 
4) Classy, cosmopolitan rooms & ambience

There are 14 different restaurants on site at The Cosmo to choose from including a secret pizza joint, a wicked buffet, an upscale Greek place, a casual burger & shake joint, an Italian coffee\/bakery, sushi bar, Italian restaurant, French cuisine, steaks & everything in between. My fave was the huge pizza slices at Secret Pizza and the coffee & gelato at Va Bene Caffe. Also, the fresh fish at Milos is pricey but gemtastic, and the dessert & gelato station at the Wicked Spoon Buffet is wicked good! 

The Cosmo also offers 3 different pools to get your tan & swim on; 6 different bars to get your drink & A game on; a salon to make you look pretty for a night in Sin City; a day spa for chillaxin'; 2 fitness centers to get your sweat on; a business center to do your biznass & a variety of posh shops to score some sweet souvenirs, clothing, shoes, accessories, etc.! Oh yeah, did I mention there is a really killer casino to test your skills & win some mega bills?!

There are varying degrees of rooms to choose from at The Cosmo. I stayed in a Terrace Suite located on the 36th floor & highly recommend it. It was swanky, spacious & had lots of amenities. The Terrace Suite is a 910 sq ft suite that includes a plush king bed; 2 flat-screen TVs; 3 closets; a safe; a 160 ft private terrace\/balcony with a sitting area & a sick, panoramic view of the Sin City skyline; a master-suite bathroom with an array of toiletries & guest robes, a separate toilet room, double-sinks\/vanities, whirlpool tub, walk-in, rain-head shower with seating; a modern kitchenette complete with a sink, stocked mini-bar, refrigerator & microwave; and a separate living room with a wrap-around couch, sitting chair, 2 ottomans, flat-screen TV & a modern office desk. The decor is contemporary, modern-sheik. I loved this suite, it was very comfortable, clean & quiet, 5-gems! 

FYI: Va Bene Caffe has a monopoly on the coffee biz at The Cosmo. It's the only place to buy a coffee in The Cosmo, no Starbucks or other coffee shops on site like there are at some other hotels\/casinos in Vegas :-(

Also, there are no coffee makers in the rooms or suites. So if you are too lazy to make the long hike to the 1st or 2nd Floor to Va Bene Caffe to buy a coffee in the morning (aka roughin' it) & opt to have room service deliver a karaffe of coffee to your room, it will only cost you a cool $25! Lookin' back, man I wish I woulda taken the elevator down those 2 days, coulda bought a lotta cups o'coffee for fifty bucks! P.S. This is The Cosmo not the Holiday Inn, coffee not included lol!

However, every worker I encountered was super friendly, professional & accommodating, 5 gems for customer service! BTW, The Cosmo is a ginormous property split into East & West towers so bring some comfy shoes if you plan on walking around much or get lost easily like the directionally-challenged aka yours truly!


So the next time you wanna go glampin' in Las Vegas, I highly recommend stayin' & playin' at The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino. It's the total, cosmo package & win, lose or draw, I guarantee you will be a happy glamper!!",57,38,46

I've played roulette at the Cosmopolitan a few times in the past but only had the pleasure to stay here twice. I was comped a free room this week so decided to enjoy a semi overdue Vegas trip which ended up being very enjoyable once again.

Out of all of the hotels that I stayed at in Vegas, Cosmopolitan stands out the most (in a good way of course) in my opinion. Rooms are super clean, offers a great japanese-style bath which you can enjoy the view of the strip while totally relaxed, balcony area which you can open up your favorite drink and just enjoy the view of the strip, and good quality amenities. Outside of the room, the hotel offers a huge selection of excellent restaurants, pool, and casino. Tables aren't as filled with players compared to some of the other casinos (probably due to the higher table minimum), but nonetheless offers a gambling experience for people who can stomach higher bets.

Thanks again for making my Vegas travel memorable and hope to stay at your hotel again very soon!",2,0,1

This would be a norm in a smaller hotel in some other town, but in a hotel where there are constantly a million people playing games, attending conferences, and generally hanging out, I don't think it's enough. I was there when several conferences were happening at the same time, and the coffee line was always a mile long. The guy at the bar confirmed that there is in fact no other place to get coffee... People in Vegas need their coffee for those hung over mornings when we still have to get up and work!! Service was so slow that I never got my coffee, so my morning was crap, to say the least.",3,1,1

A lot of people know that you need a credit card authorization form to pay for rooms of a guest when your not the guest at the hotel. Due to scheduling my executives rooms were booked last minute and TCH is telling me that I can't add my corporate card for the room charges without  10 day prior approval. 

There was not 10 days between my call and the check in date, so how could I do this? They said it was due to fraud that they limit this action. As an executive assistant I book a lot rooms in many different hotels for many different people and I have never encountered this scenario. This rule that the cosmopolitan has is needless and is not conducive to the business needs of their guests. 

I received no help in resolving the issue and needless to say I am not happy with this rule nor the customer service received.",1,4,0

And I REALLY REALLY wanted to like it here, but the Cosmo left MUCH to be desired.  We booked the wrap around terrace suite with hopes of booking the attached room.  We did this several months ahead and a week before our trip got an email that we canceled the reservation (which we didn't).  Customer service was unapologetic and offered us no comps.  The bf checks in early into the suite and I am hurriedly trying to forget i have an 8-5 day and catch a later flight.  They wont check us into the attaching room without my credit card as the extra room is on my card.  (Yet they are so quick to cancel our reservations when it wasn't us who did it).  As I cab in, there are several people picketing in front of the hotel and I starting to understand why.  

One gem (one star) is the the ONE guy that treated us like human beings Mr. Joe Castro.  He was amazing!  Made several recommendations and welcomed us warmly.

The suite itself was beautiful.  Our room, though unattached, was across the hall.  The balcony alone gets (one star).

My beautiful sister wanted to pamper me and called in to schedule me a pedicure at their spa and they were quite rude to her.  (the theme here is that the venue is beautiful but service sucks).  The pedicurist was nice but didn't bother telling me that my sister had already tipped her and gladly took a double tip from me.

We tried to get bottle service at Marquee and thought they would accomodate us since we stayed there and didn't get a response till the day of and then told it would be $2500 for 3 people.  Of course we didn't do that but the club itself was fun.

My people bought me a beautiful $80 cake which the concierge recommended.  We also got pizzas from the secret pizza place.  All which was thrown away, barely touched, but housekeeping the night we went to Marquee. The front desk was also unapologetic about this.

All in all, Cosmo is like a pretty girl who promises she's going to give you the night of her life, but ends up just jerkin' you off, leaving you unsatisfied and wanting more.",11,10,3

I was with 11 other girls and am still fighting about a remaining invoice balance after we verified again and again while checking out that our account was paid in full before I left ( I did this to avoid any issues, whatsoever.) The celebrations team you have to book through is separate than the front desk check in, and there is zero communication between the two. They booked 16 rooms instead of 4; they switched contacts on us without transferring any of the knowledge of our plans or prior emails; and there were billing issues from day 1 when we got there, including charging us in full ahead of time for a suite rather than just the deposit like they had previously told us. They said prior to arrival we'd have a master account created so all girls could split the total evenly, then when I asked about t at the hotel, it wasn't created and they said now that that caused confusion since they didn't know we wanted that. In that suite(for $900), there was a bloody towel in the bathroom, we called immediately and they said ""oh I'm sorry I'll send someone up"" and all I got was housekeeping with a few clean towels. One girl's card was charged 4 times but only says once on the invoice. They said that might be incidental charges waiting to be refunded but the amounts are totally different than the $150 incidental charge. Sorry excuse for party planning. You'd think they'd want 12 girls to celebrate there but unless you want to be scammed, I'd go elsewhere.

Smells good and very modern.  The casino does not have a good payout, so I don't suggest gambling here.  We only ate at the Wicked Spoon for breakfast\/brunch.  It was ok.  Nothing spectacular to me.  Good variety of food.  ($22\/person, $12\/child)  

Customer service was good except for one girl at the desk who I felt was so preoccupied.  I had asked her for extra towels.  She said Ok, I'll get you extra towels.  A second later, she said...yes, extra pillows.  And then I said, no, extra towels.  She looked at me said...let me write this down..extra...?  pillows?  I said, no, towels.  It was like a foreign language to her.  But towels were delivered even without us in the room.  Housekeeping even called to leave a message to ask if we had received them yet.  But they never cleaned our room.  No biggie though, we were only there for two nights.

The room was nice and pretty basic for a Las Vegas hotel.  Decor was nice and beds were great!  Felt like sleeping on a cloud!  There was a mini bar and a mini fridge.  The one strange thing about the room, there was a full length window of the shower stall to the bedroom.  Luckily there were blinds to close it up.  Not so good for a family with a young child.  My child kept asking me what the window was for.  :x  We didn't have any issues with noise in the hallways or neighbors.  Just a few drunk young adults during the daytime, but that's to be expected.  

My missing star is for the wifi.  Although there was free wifi, it wasn't accessible.  I couldn't even make any calls with my cell phone.  We were on the 29th floor.  Even in the lobby, I could barely use the wifi.  Overall, I would stay here again.",0,0,0

This was my third time staying at this property and will likely be my last.  The hotel is nice, rooms are spacious, well designed and have great views and China Poblano was an excellent casual restaurant.  

The reason for this review is the casino, on our second evening in Vegas, my girlfriend and I decided to enjoy the property and play blackjack.  She was wearing a dress with no pockets so I had her ID and our cash in my wallet.  I handed the dealer $200 for chips on a $15 table and gave her half anticipating each of us playing for a while.  The dealer (Andy) told me that the bet was $25 at this $15 table because I controlled both hands.  I was clear when handing the cash that we were each playing and split the chips evenly.  She is an experienced player and capable of controlling her own hand.  Andy's view was it was from one 'bankroll' (not true).  I was holding both of our cash on this evening.

Andy would not budge so I asked to talk to the pit boss who informed me that Andy was correct but he could make a one time exception.  I disagreed, left, cashed the chips in and asked to speak with a hotel manager and the casino manager (Jim).  Neither was helpful, they did not ask my room number and despite acknowledging a need to improve training, did not give me the feeling that this would not happen again and they obviously did not circle back with me during my stay.

We did have a great visit to Vegas and will continue to enjoy the entertainment in future stays.  The challenges at our base hotel casino allowed us to sample several other casinos (we would have anyway) both on the strip and downtown.  The Cosmo was the only resort that had an issue with me handing over the cash, most dealers asked if it was for both of us and had no issue when I confirmed it was.  

My advise is to stay at one of the resorts linked to larger casino groups with better customer service training.  It would have improved our experience.",0,0,0

Okay then what happened to the money if it wasn't taken by the staff? Did it walk out of the room on its own??

I liked the fact that their fridge had a freezer space so I was able to quickly cool down my hot water bottles! :) the room is very spacious and the jacuzzi tub is awesome.  I have stayed at Aria, Encore and Bellagio, but I thought this was better then any of them.

If I were to return to Las Vegas I would not stay at Cosmopolitan. My boyfriend and I stayed there during early July for a work convention. We arrived at the hotel at 11 am. While the policy states that check in time is at 3pm, the hotel personnel allowed us to check in early with no problem. However, when we got to our room. I was majorly disappointed. First of all, the bathroom has no bathtub. Secondly, the make-up mirror is cracked. As we stayed over several nights, we became more discontent with the hotel. The maid does not toss out the  melted ice in the ice box from yesterday. The lamps do not turn on. The room is hot like the outside temperature. The hair dryer CRACKLES like it's about to explode. The TV shows sucks and the stores in the hotel is extremely limited. 

Everywhere I go, people say that Cosmopolitan is an beautiful hotel. I agree with them that the declaration is very modern and chic, but it's all a facade. If people really spend time in the hotel, they will realized how they didn't get their money's worth. I rather stay at Bellagio, where I stayed at with my gf last year. At least Bellagio's decoration is more comfy. Their rooms are grand with a big bathroom with bathtubs and spacious sleeping area.

When i just arrived they took 3 hours to find my east tower studio terrace room because they were ""sold out"". After i requested to speak to general floor supervisor the room magically appeared available that moment. Second day being in a hotel my room was never cleaned. I called 5 times to cleaning extension i had to be on hold for 15 minutes each time before they picked up the phone. I requested to speak to a manager and  told him my room wasn't cleaned for whole day. Still cleaning lady never arrived that day so i had to reuse wet towels and sleep on unmade bed. Next day at 4 pm she finally arrived and did her job.
They charge you $25 resort fee that includes internet wifi. On third day wifi did not work for maybe 7 hours. To go in to one of their pools i had to pay money, plus they send me upstairs 2 times to get my ID and change to a proper shirt. As if tank top would not fit in pool environment.
Staff is rude, service is poor. Will never come back there again!",3,1,1

During our first stay in Vegas we stayed at the Cosmopolitan and after visiting almost every other hotel on the strip, I don't think I would have traded it for anything. We chose to stay here because am a Platinum Marriott member from all my work travel but that being said, you'd never be able to tell this hotel is part of the Marriott brand. The hotel is filled with stunning art and digital art, great restaurants, and beautifully decorated bars and casino, oh and the Marquee nightclub. Every detail of this hotel has been meticulously designed and as an added bonus, the hotel is perfectly located centrally on the strip. 

The room itself was gorgeous too. We stayed in a wrap around terrace suite that had a stunning view of the Bellagio fountains and the Paris Eiffel Tower. Again, decoratively, every detail of this hotel room, if you can call it that, was beautifully designed. Additionally, the entire suite could be controlled by a touch screen phone or through the tv which made it easy to shut off the billion lamps at the end of the night or set the temp.",3,0,1

I LOVED this hotel. LOVE LOVE LOVED. It's so pretty and kitschy and I'm sure some people who are used to the finer things aren't impressed, but I totally was. I'm used to dingy ass, smoke-filled casinos full of old people, so this hotel made me feel like a slack-jawed yokel in a big city. Everyone there was so attractive. I'm super not-gay, but my gosh, the chicks walking around were total babes. The Cosmopolitan makes me want to spend all my money on my appearance so I can mix into that crowd with ease (funny, the magazine of the same name has also made me wish for this).

I never actually saw the casino, unlike most other Strip hotels where you have to trudge through a stinky haze of blue smoke past the slots to get to the elevators, Cosmo's elevators are right next to the Reception up front.

My room (junior suite?) was on the 23rd floor in the west tower and I had a magnificent view of the Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel Tower. The room itself is decked out with modern furniture, artsy coffee table books and hipster paintings. Also had a sweet balcony with a couch and ottoman (though admittedly the couch wasn't the most comfortable, but it was like 106 degrees outside so I didn't spend much time on the balcony). Huge bathroom features wonderful Bigelow soaps and products. If I could move in to this place, I would. 

Had dinner at Blue Pearl with some friends and everything was excellent, especially the octopus appetizer! Afterwards we took the party to Chandelier, and much like the rest of the hotel the vibe was well dressed, affluent 30-40somethings out to have a great time. Great selection of 'mixologist' type cocktails. Just so much fun.

Later other hotel staff we encountered throughout the casino, restaurants, stores, and shuttle were much more pleasant. The hotel has a great ambiance and is beautifully decorated even down to the sexy see-through showers...very clean and well ventilated as well (non-smokers really do appreciate). After arriving in our room we found our tv didn't work and had to wait a while for repairs (over 1hr) as well as with the safe the next morning. Again not a big deal but time costly. Lastly there was an extra charge for incidentals which I had to dispute. No problem except the customer service rep seemed a little hesitant to refund and assured me they would have to investigate with service staff before refunding. It wasn't until I sort of explained our overall experience that she refunded me. Which honestly by this time was pretty off-putting after all of the other little mishaps. We had a great experience because we made the best of our time. We made it a great time. Not sure if I would book again though, especially for the price- I expected more!",0,0,0

We were in Vegas for a bachelorette over the weekend and several flights got delayed out of NYC due to bad weather. We're all exhausted and the individual who's name the reservation is under is on a very delayed flight - scheduled to get in at 1AM PST (4PM our local time). She had called earlier to add our name to the reservation, but was told she needed to call Orbitz to do so and they wouldn't allow it. 

We get to the hotel and are not allowed to check in. I ask for options to get comfortable (so many hotels offer showers for travelers who can't check in right away) and I'm told my only option is to book another room for the night. Seriously?! You want me to pay for another room because you won't let me check into the one we already booked?!

What would have happened if the reservation booker's flight got cancelled or rebooked for later in the weekend (which happened to some members of our party)? Their policy would have left us homeless. For being in the hospitality business, the individuals at the Cosmo are the least helpful\/hospitable hotel workers I've met. 

On top of that, the maid of honor spent time linking our rooms and requested we be on the same floor. Individuals who arrived earlier even confirmed they'd be guaranteed despite the late check in. The rooms we received were on 3 separate, floors, 2 different elevator banks. 

Our check in fiasco was probably the only scar on an otherwise fun\/pleasant weekend, but it's something I won't forget soon. The room was comfortable and we had a nice view, but frankly, you can find that anywhere. Go somewhere else where they value customer service a bit more.

TLDR: Book a different hotel. Seriously. It'll save you time\/headache and I'm sure the front desk individuals will be much more accommodating.",2,1,2

I think they opened it up early because it was well behind the original construction schedule and they needed to make money quickly. Phone and TV didn't work in several rooms--we had to switch. Service is questionable. And all of the IT systems are dysfunctional.

Now, there are also a lot of pros as well, if you aren't spending a lot of time in the room. The casino is great. Great design, very personal, excellent dealers. Also, the casino is a lot cleaner compared to MGM, NY NY, Monte Carlo, etc. The sports lounge (not the sports book) is the best place I have seen in Vegas to watch games. Great waitresses.

If you are into nightlife, the clubs are rocking, but probably takes some work to get in.  Clearly, it's THE place to be. Basically, if you are 25 - 35 years old I could see a lot of appeal in staying here--less particular about the rooms and more into the scene.

My recommendation is to stay elsewhere until these guys get it together. I'm guessing that a year from now they will sort it out. You could do worse in Vegas, but this place should be better.

The Chandelier bar is a must-stop. It is a multi-tier bar that is set inside of a giant chandelier in the middle of the casino. Perfect for people watching and a drink to start or end the night.

The restaurants on the mezzanine level are incredible. One of my favorite chefs, Scott Conant, has one of his Scarpetta restaurants here. The food is over the top amazing and the view of the strip is a must see. Try to reserve a table near one of the windows.

The spa is very relaxing and was a perfect way to relax after a few nights on the town. I highly recommend getting addons to your massage. The body buffer increases circulation to your body and gets you ready for another night of dancing!

Marquee, the day\/night club, is one of the hottest spots in Vegas. On any given night, there is a top DJ\/producer at this club. For example, Armin van Buuren, Avicii, AND Kaskade played there during our stay. This is a must! Make reservations early because it sells out fast.

If you've stayed here, you know that the shower is visible from the living area, separated by just glass with blinds for privacy. When we arrived, the shower blinds were missing. I immediately called front desk and waited around for about 2 hours (which I thought was plenty of time) then called again to be sure they hadn't forgotten. She tells me they're extremely busy and it would take about 45 minutes for someone to come by. I then reminded her this is my second attempt from 2 hours prior to which she had nothing to say but repeat her previous statement. So again we wait in our road trip funk. An hour passes by and we decide to succumb to our hunger pangs. I came back fully expecting the blinds but they were STILL missing. I call again this time a little annoyed and within 10 mins a service person came up to the room with a ladder but had no idea what the request was. I showed him the missing blinds and he stood there dumbfounded. He makes a couple phone calls, leaves, comes back and resorts to putting up a sheet. This works as an interim but is a huge eyesore for the high premium we paid for staying at a... what is it? A 5-star hotel? It would be fine if it was a Motel 6 (or even Ballys) but we did not pay ~$600 nightly for a make-do. A friend came to our room and jokingly picked up a sensored package of cookies and when we called to make sure we won't be charged, a person arrived within 5 minutes to make sure. Nice.

So, I was going to take off a point as its not really an ideal place to go with little kids, but then again, if you are taking kids to Vegas anyway, I can't imagine many better options.  
We paid for a room upgrade and then got upgraded even further as platinum Marriott members and the room was gorgeous. There was a large living room with a small kitchen area and then a large central dressing room that led into the huge bathroom and master bedroom that could be separated by a sliding door so we could be up after the kids went to sleep. We had a large balcony with a beautiful view of Paris and The Bellagio and we all enjoyed watching the fountain show at different times during the afternoon and evening from our bedroom, balcony, and even shower and separate soaking tub.  
The 14th floor pool was our favorite but the views at the 4th floor pool were amazing too.  Both pools had great soaking platforms with ample loungers were the water was maybe a foot deep.  The pool was lightly heated which was nice as it was refreshing in the sun but warmer than the air when the sun was setting and the wind was blowing. 
Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Casino was much classier and more elegant than even the Bellagio or Paris.

The room we had had an AWESOME view of the strip, es pecially the Bellagio fountains! We probably saw the water show 10 times! We played our own music :) The room is super nice and spacious! The beds were so comfy and fluffy!! I love the compemporary decor and the bathroom was nice and huge, fit for many girls. The only WEIRD part was there is a blind for the shower window OUTSIDE of the room so everyone can see you showering if you don't close it. I mean, I know it's Vegas but...that's just weird if you're with friends. I would have shoved my foot up someone's butt if they opened it. Asking for new towels and all was easy and efficient too.

We also visited the pool area which was beautiful! There were pool and fooz ball tables, tons of chairs, and a beautiful pool area, shallow and deep. Towels available.

We also tested out WICKED SPOON. 1 star for that. We went for a $40 brunch and the food was cold and pretty flavorless. That'll be my next review...

The suite was near mega loud music. The bass was so loud, the bed vibrated (no need to insert quarters). 

I requested a change of room and they gave me one that was also noisy. I called to the front desk and they said I had already switched twice. I explained I hadn't switched twice, I switched once, and wanted to switch again. 

Then they said they didn't have anything because check in was 3-5 PM (2 hours later). I said I'd wait. Then they went back to I couldn't switch rooms because I already switched twice. 

I ask for a maintenance person to repair the noise. Nobody shows up. I called again 2 hours later and they say they only have 1 maintenance worker for each tower and someone will be up soon. After another 2 hours I call again, and they have no record of my request. I tell the person how angry I am, and they laugh at me. 

I go down to the front desk and explained why I am so frustrated and unhappy. They give me a smaller room without a deck (a downgrade), and a $50 food certificate. 

That's suppose to make me happy? 

The Cosmo is the new kid on the block, accompanied with a teenager's attitude. The aesthetics and glamor will carry it for awhile, but their customer service is atrocious.",1,2,0

When I arrived, the lines to check-in were crazy long. But they had a lot of people working the desks, so they were able to get through the lines pretty quickly. There are separate elevators depending on what floor your room is on, so this speeds up the process of getting up to your floor. 

My room had a great view overlooking the pool. Not too many complaints about the room - you can't hear your neighbors, but you can hear what's going on out in the hallway. Privacy in the bathroom is a little limited, but you can use the closet door to block off the bathroom entrance too. 

I went in November and during that time (Fall\/Winter), the pool and hot tub are only open until 5 pm. Pretty disappointing when I'm in a conference all day and can't go relax in the hot tub afterward.

The conference rooms can vary greatly in temperature, so dress in layers if you'll be in them. We had breakfast and lunch provided by the hotel for three days. Each day was different and had various options for both meat eaters and vegetarians. 

If you're willing to spend the money, The Cosmopolitan is in a great location on the strip. You can easily walk to a ton of different attractions, stores, and a tram stop. It also has access to the pedestrian bridge to cross the street. The interior of the hotel itself is gorgeous too - you'll definitely want to spend some time in the sparkly chandelier bar. 

Check out was a breeze - you can do it through the TV in the room and get your itemized bill via email. Taxis are abundant and even if the queue for them looks long, it moves really quickly.",6,2,5

And then I'd want to wake up at dawn (like the freak that I am) the next morning and watch the sunrise between the buildings and over the Bellagio lake.

I loved the room, I loved the restaurants (gonna have to review that separately because I could gush on that), I loved the decor (checkout the wallpaper in the bathroom!)

Our room overlooked the Bellagio fountains and the strip. It was crazy! This hotel also has Marquee which in my opinion is the best club in Las Vegas. It is also a Day club and pool party venue which is absolutely insane. You ever see hundreds of people in the pool going nuts to house music? Its quite a site. I used to think the Wynn\/Encore was the coolest thing going but after this weekend I would have to change my vote entirely to Cosmo. I cant wait to stay here again and get the same room!

I first stayed here 2 years ago for my birthday celebration for a 3-night stay. I booked with Hotels.com since not only did their low rates beat those of booking directly with the Cosmo, but it earned me a free night. The view was amazing, the room was lovely (with an in room tub overlooking the city) and everything was great. And YES, if you book through a 3rd party, you will still get Identity points for your entire stay! I did for my stay after booking with Hotels.com! (:

Anyways, my most recent stay fell short of my expectations - by a lot. (Incidentally, I hear the Cosmo is under new ownership.) During my 2nd stay, I actually booked directly through the Cosmo. I booked a Studio Suite after getting an offer for being an Identity member (Identity is Cosmos' reward membership). Before the day of my stay, I called MANY times, mostly to ask questions and confirm my reservation. I even called twice to let them know I would be getting there late. I told them I expected to be there no later than 10 p.m. but most likely would be arriving at 5 p.m., though they insisted on putting me down for 10 just to be safe, told me not to worry, that as long as I arrived before 2 a.m. it was okay, but after 2 a.m. they could give my room away.

By the time I got to the hotel's check in line, it was about 6 p.m. The guy that helped me took a very inconveniently long time. I suspected something was wrong, he was acting a bit weird. Eventually, he told us everything was okay and sent us to our room. When I got there I immediately noticed it had no balcony - the studio suite has a terrace balcony! I called the front desk and I asked what type of room I was in. It was then that I found out I was in the much cheaper City Room. HORRIBLE, DECEITFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE! The associate who checked me in even said ""terrace studio"" when he was reading my reservation and NEVER EVER mentioned having to downgrade or make any changes to my reservation!

More than the actual room change, I was very upset at the very unprofessional attitude of the associate who checked me in and knowingly sent me into a different room without telling me, hoping I wouldn't find out! An insult to my intelligence and set a bad tone for my birthday trip. Over the phone, I complained to the front desk about this. The associate I spoke with gave me a $50 credit for room service. I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but room service had its own issues so that in no way made it up to me!

The Mediocre Room Service - We only ordered room service because we had the credit and we were tired from our long trip and wanted to make the most of our romantic getaway. The food took long to get there, yet oddly the fries were very cold. The cheeseburgers tasted just okay, not worthy of even half the menu price. The waiter was quick to receive his generous 25% cash tip but failed to tell me gratuity was already included. To be fair, it probably stated in the bill that gratuity was included, but again, I called after being very tired not only of the trip but of having to report the horrible and deceitful service I received upon check in, so honestly I did not pay much attention to anything but the food (I was also very hungry). I believe the gratuity included was 20%, but the reason I had even thought to tip in cash was because although I wanted to pay for the room itself, we had used my boyfriend's card for the incidental charges and I did not want him to have to pay for anything in that hotel, although inevitably he was paying for the service fee and the remaining bill balance. Because of that particular reason, I called the hotel restaurant and told them I had tipped the waiter in cash so if they could please remove the gratuity fee off my bill. To my surprise they refused. I have never ever asked someone to remove gratuity off my bill, even when I made the mistake of double tipping, but like I said, I did not want my boyfriend to pay for it because the hotel was supposed to be my treat. Treating your significant other is something special. Anyway, from what I understood, as a customer and a former waitress, although restaurants can add gratuity, it is not really mandatory (like tipping is not mandatory) and you should be able to have it removed from your bill if you request to do so.

The funny thing is that with Identity, you should be eligible for free room upgrades. I book directly with the hotel and I get downgraded, without anyone having the decency or respect for me as a customer to even inform me of this! What a lack of valuing me as a returning client. They give me a small credit to overpriced food with mediocre taste and poor service. Plus having to move rooms in the middle of our stay took away the romance and dampened our plans.",3,2,0

Parking can be a little tough because it's separated into East and West. Park at West and check-in and then if you have an East Tower room, then just move your car to that side.

Check-in could be chaotic. Some people made their own line after seeing 3 distinct lines. Probably ruins the flow of the people who have been in line already.

Got to our room and it was nice and spacious. There was a pull-out couch as well. Very clean and well-laid out. Careful with the stocked mini-fridge. Move anything and you'll probably get charged. But there was a microwave too.

The shower situation was very intimate. Glassdoor and there's a window that looks into it from the bedroom. There's blinds to keep your privacy though. Also another window that looks into the tub area from the bedroom. Again, blinds helps that situation. Also another window looking into the tub and shower from the balcony outside. Again, blinds.

Balcony was nice. Overlooked the regular hotel pool and Marquee Dayclub. Each room has 2 complimentary entrance tickets to Marquee Dayclub. Except we found out you had to be there by 11AM. It was super empty at 11AM. People didn't pack in until maybe a little after 12PM. But perhaps you can claim a spot if first if you're a guest at The Cosmo.

Lots of food options. Eggslut is there. Momofuku is opening soon. And Secret Pizza! 

Location is nice. You can walk to the Aria and the City Center. You can walk to Planet Hollywood or Bellagio. Quite central. And I'll end on that note.",2,0,0

ARRIVAL: 
Wife and I arrived at the Cosmo around 9:30am on a Saturday. Our room was not ready, but the lady at registration gave us our keys and told us that she would send us a text message when the room was ready. We received the text around 11:30am. 

ROOM: 
The room they gave us, a City Room (I know, I know, not a terrace) was in the West Tower with a view to the North. We could see the Bellagio fountains as well as the actual Bellagio towers, Paris, Bally's, Flamingo, and the Linq High Roller and Venetian in the distance. View was great! We were extremely happy! For this being the cheapest type of room, I was pleasantly surprised overall with the view we had. The room was clean. There was some dust, yes, but it was clean in regards to the sheets, pillowcases, bathrooms, and fresh towels.

Beds were so very comfortable! Pillows were nice and soft. There were (4) pillows per bed. We slept really well during our stay. Some mornings, we didn't want to get up because they were so comfortable!

Hallways were not noisy at all. We didn't experience anyone running around or causing a commotion. You could just hear the slamming of doors. But this is because the doors are so darned heavy! But this is a great thing. At least you KNOW your door is closed and locked. 

Wanted to have some food in the room but there's a smallish table just enough to only hold cocktails. A bigger table would have been nice. But again, this was no big deal. 

Room smelled great and fresh. No traces of smoke or a smoky smell (as it shouldn't because they're all non-smoking rooms). 

They have CO Bigelow bath products which is higher end. So my wife tells me. 

We found that housekeeping was friendly & room was serviced every day. Fresh towels were given and bed was made every day. 

The room had ample plugs to charge our phones and devices, which is a plus for us. I've had my share of rooms with little to no plugs. 

TV offered great HD channels and the picture was excellent. We never had a problem finding something to watch on TV. 

Shower was great. Adequate water pressure and water was hot (for the sinks as well) 

We really liked the two sinks to get ready. 

ROOM CONS: 
We didn't like the room illumination, however. It felt dim & dark. I would have liked to see better lighting (types of bulbs or more fixtures).

There were some stains on the carpet. This was by the sitting area. Understandable as they probably spilled their drinks because the table is too small. 

Our room was not vacuumed the entire stay there. We could tell, as there was big pieces of lint from my jacket. It was in the same place everyday. It was a huge piece that's not hard to miss. But we didn't feel that this was a concern.

The elevator lobby on our floor had a trash can that was overflowing with trash and had not been emptied for at least 3-days during our 6-day stay.

CASINO\/HOTEL CONS: 
Casino was smoky. This surprised me. I had expected excellent ventilation being a new hotel\/casino. 

The clientele varies depending on the day\/week, etc. Found out that the weekends tend to attract the younger crowd and it's very busy on Friday until Sunday evening. Weekdays are a different story. More mellow and a lot less ""clowns"" and commotion.

We did feel a bit out of place, being that we're almost 40. We didn't fit well among the 30's and under crowd. Not really into the party scene. 

CASINO\/HOTEL PROS:
Wife said Secret Pizza was delicious. We never ate at any other hotel restaurants. 

We got to see the ice rink, which is only there during the winter season. This was really neat!

Checkout was a breeze via the TV. Checked out at 10:45am and was on our way. 

No thefts from the maid or anything.

Bill was accurate. Nothing additional was added to the bill. 

We appreciated that there were separate elevator banks. We waited no longer than 1-minute for an elevator to the room. Average was about 10-seconds to get an elevator from the time the button was pushed (no kidding, its fast!) the same with the parking garage elevators. 

We also liked that there's two pedestrian bridges. One to planet Hollywood and the other to Crystals. Got to check out Crystals, Aria, Monte Carlo and Bellagio as they were easily accessible by foot or tram. 

Parking was the best. Could always find a stall no matter what time of day or night. Liked the Christmas tree lights that indicate open stalls. Exiting on Harmon is a breeze as well.

Bad Check In
Came about 9:30 am. Room not ready, which I certainly felt was reasonable, but they would text me. Never received a text. Never. Came back to registration at 5 pm. Stood in line again. They had sent the text to the wrong number. Ugh. 

Filthy
Okay. Got to my room. An ugly room service breakfast tray was right by my front door. How long could it have been there?  Checkout was at 11:00.  The next day the tray was STILL THERE. Housekeeping had cleaned my room TWICE since it had been left. Are they only picked up every few DAYS?  Disgusting. Ugh. 

Horrible response
After two emails, tray was finally picked up.  I got an email back from someone who said they had tried to call me at the number on file.  Really? Part of the issue I mentioned was that they had THE WRONG PHONE NUMBER on file (off by a digit) which is why I did not receive the initial text. So attempts to call the cell phone on file which they KNOW IS WRONG I find hilarious.  Did they even read my comments?  Probably just a canned response as it was addressed to The {my last name} Party rather than my name, which they had.  How impersonal can you get?

Filthy
On the plus side, the food dropped in the elevator lobby on the 29th floor that was there on Monday when I checked in, had now been trampled enough to be hardly noticeable two days later. How often do you vacuum?  How often does housekeeping inspect?  This is a high traffic area. How could it be missed?  Pig sty. 

Whore Friendly
Also, good to know that the hotel is whore friendly.  There was no security at the elevators to check people going to rooms as is the case in some of the other hotels.  My friend, a timid woman in her thirties was on an elevator with a man accompanied by a prostitute.  How could she be sure she wasn't just a tacky dressing trophy wife?  As they went to their room, the man asked the woman what her name was.",0,1,0

I hate their parking entrance.  It's always congested.  Even if you cab it, it takes FOREVER because there is only one lane.  The parking can be a maze but I go there so often, I'm use to it.  They have those fancy lights that light up green if a parking space is available, red if occupied.  Be careful though because they aren't always accurate.  Be careful of bad drivers, I've had many near-death experiences because of people speeding the narrow parking lot or making sharp turns.  There's usually plenty of parking on the lower levels B4 and B5.

This is a new hotel and you can tell. they had a nice coffee maker but you had to pay for the coffee which I understand but they could afford to give you at least one cup of coffee. 

The toiletries were higher quality then most. 

Oh and because it is the new hotel to be at on the strip the hookers were out in force. it was almost comical. They were not trying to hide anything and they were even in the lobby and came up to one of my coworkers and offered her services.

The Good:  I love the environment.  The rooms are great and most of the staff are helpful.  There are plenty of food choices and good shopping.  If you are looking for a great place to sleep this will do.

The Bad:  It deals with doing events at The Cosmopolitan.  On two occasions, events were done here and both went less than stellar.  The main problem was invited guest's rooms should have been posted to a master bill, however half of them had their personal cards charged.  It took days to fix this issue.  Equipment that had been sent to the hotel took hours to get to the meeting room, while we waited to set up.  While, like I had said most of the staff was accommodating, one of the front desk managers was extremely rude.  While I would have been okay with it being me that she was rude to, it was one of the guests we had invited.  She may have been having a bad day as part of the issue had something to do with their computers.  The agreed upon price for rooms were also wrong.

Key Points
1. service is pretty flawless. it's almost like being waited on by management consultants because they are constantly coming up with solutions to best serve you or answer a question. not the usual robotic, yes\/no responses. oh and when you hit ""beck and call"" on the phone, a smart, polite, amicable person picks up within 1 ring.

2. the restaurants on the 3rd floor are all super expensive. all of them. i mean like $36\/dish expensive. but pretty stunning selection.

3. billing and estimation is HORRENDOUS. although I booked through ""a third party"" (priceline) i got 4 or 5 different interpretations of my bill.  some people said there would be 12% on top, others said not. we got so many mini bar charges that were reversed. i'm pretty sure they do that just to smoke & mirror you. oh and it's been a week since i got back and i STILL haven't gotten the bill emailed to me. 

4. Location could be better. a couple ppl commented that it's not as central as Bellagio and Caesar's.

5. Decor is gorgeous. It's more of a fashion experiment in art-deco, glam, accessory-mania, glitterati kaleidescop-ism. an oasis from the disney-themed or italian\/roman-themed casinos LV is beating the crap out of.

6. i have to comment on the music in the elevator, downstairs lobby, and Holsteins. whoever chose that music is my lover. and my savior amidst the mind-numbing euro-trash club techno. DEPECHE MODE? JUNIOR BOYS? SPOON? NEW ORDER? i wanted to curl up in that psychedelic elevator the whole trip and be mind-massaged by all the music i love. CALL ME. WE WILL MAKE BEAUTIFUL MUSICAL BABIES TOGETHER.

But being simply elegant can be eternally beautiful. Unfortunately, the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas is of the middle. We stayed here for our best friend's bachelor party. Upon entering the lobby, you are greeted with tall pillars of flat screen TV that boasts different wallpaper designs thought the day. Okay, that is pretty cool. Upon entering our City Room, the 'chicness' abound every facet of the room. The flat screen TV is surrounded by a circular raised panel, odd wall paper designs, a peeping tom shower, and so on...

Okay first things first: one of the sink is clogged, and both bedside lamps aren't working. Not too good for a fairly new hotel. Also the hi-tech switches stopped when you get to the loo where you get a tradition light switch. For me that shouts aloud for being discontinuous. 

Being chic is that main theme of Cosmo. But in my humble opinion, their chicness is very convoluted and disjointed. Their theme may be hip to most in 2014 but would it still fly in 2024? I would think they would have to continually renovate to keep up with the latest trends. Whereas Bellagio, Encore, or Palazzo for example, are simply elegant.  All they have to do is continue upkeep and they will remain beautiful, as aforementioned.

Got a good deal tagging along with pals on a conference, and got upgraded for free to the one bedroom (vs studio) rooms. Quality of the furnishings and decor is what you expect for the price, which is to say very nice. I'd rank the Cosmo a step above the places in Vegas that I've liked (Sig@MGM, THEhotel). All the rooms come with microwaves\/microfridges, and private terraces. 

The pluses: Free wifi throughout the resort, with ethernet cables in the rooms. They don't skimp on the bandwidth either, got 15+ Mbps both down *and* up - very nice, especially for those who might need to do remote access\/vpn stuff for work. 15 Mbps symmetrical! Just saying.
Second plus, location, location, location. Mid-strip, can't beat it. Third plus, a pool deck that overlooks the strip; definitely seen-and-be-seen territory.
Fourth plus, yes, I too love the garage info screens\/lights.

Now the minuses: relatively small casino floor for you gambling types. Pool area, while the new hot thing, is more for lounging that actual swimming, and also is relatively small. Finally, if you are those rare Vegas birds that like to sleep, the music from the clubs is clearly audible even up at the 20th floor rooms. Request the highest floor possible in the West Tower if that pertains to you.

The hotel itself caters to a younger crowd and reminds me of the LA\/New York scene which I love. They are also the only hotel on the strip to have balconies in the rooms which offer guests magnificent views! The marketing department is also great and also reminds me of Hollywood because they are doing a great job in regards to their P.R. On the 15th they had Brandon Flowers of the Killers fame perform a private performance in the pool area. But, nothing can top NYE at the Cosmopolitan. I was one of the lucky guests that was able to enjoy the private Coldplay\/Jay-Z concert that they threw in the hotel to ring in the New Year. This was an invite only event and tons of celebrities were in attendance. Not only that, but there were also impromptu performances by Beyonce and Kanye West!! Rihanna also showed up to the VIP room inside Marquee later on in the night (the newest nightclub in Vegas located inside the Cosmopolitan) and performed ""What's My Name.""

I needed to get away just before all the holiday madness and when I started getting travel alerts for Vegas, I knew this would be the hotel for me! I was last in Vegas maybe 10yrs ago, and the strip has changed a LOT. The Cosmopolitan is very new (to my eyes) and located centrally. It's about a $20 cab ride from the airport.

The lobby area is incredible, with these large tv pillars. Everything is black and swanky\/sexy. I had read about the long waits for check in, but since we arrived at 10am, it was just an off-time. We were quickly directed to the next available front desk person, she checked me in and offered an upgrade for about +~$35\/day (which I declined, only because the room was not available NOW, I was tired, you see. Hehe). We happened to be here during a huge rodeo conference, so all the rooms were booked. She gave me my keycards and said they would text me when the room was available (and let me know what room it was when I got the text).

Then we stepped over to the bellhop area, to drop off our luggage and that took a few minutes longer, but it wasn't bad at all. We went straight back out and easily had a cab waved to us to go for brunch.

It was about an hour later when I received a text that the room was ready. Nice and early! We did some stuff, and a few hours after that, we came back and tried out the room.

Their smallest room option is a 2 queen bed. It was perfect for two of us. I had considered asking a couple others to join us, but I think 4 would have been a tight fit (and we would have likely upgraded to the terrace room if we had 4). Anyway, we were on the side of the building, so looking out, we immediately saw giant fans(?) and a tennis court below, but if we looked over, there was a nice view of the strip and in particular, the Bellagio fountains. The windows were thick pane so you couldn't really hear anything, this is especially important due to the number of fountain shows the Bellagio hosts. 

The bathroom is weird, the sliding door also served as the door to the closet. So if you close the bathroom door, the closet is open and vice versa. This is only mentioned since I used their in-room safe, and if the safe door was open and the bathroom door comes rolling back, there will be a bit of a jam. Further, the shower had a window looking into the sleeping area, so we just pulled that blind shut the whole time. The toiletries were C.O. Bigelow, which were excellent. Although having the bathroom fixtures be black only made more apparent the water spots, which really cannot be helped. But it did slightly detract from the glamorousness of the room. The shower water pressure was a bit intense. I had scoffed at a shower that was TOO much pressure, but now I understand. The hot water was consistent and they gave us bathrobes to wear!

Anyway, there's a flat screen tv that plays music or tv, and their wifi was available at a good connection speed.

For a huge hotel it was almost rare to have to share the elevator with another group and wait for one to arrive too. It felt very private for being a large hotel that was at capacity.

The lower level has all the gambling, a bar, a coffee stand, those types of things. We gambled a couple times..at the Showgirls and Wonder Woman slots, and we used the coffee stand twice daily. The smoke on these floors wasn't too bad.

On the 2nd floor were the restaurants, of which we ate at the paella one (review shortly). We wandered along much of the public spaces of the Cosmo, they have lots of conference rooms and decorations (giant high heel shoes) for picture-taking.

Each morning we splurged on room service for breakfast. Their pricing was reasonable, the taste was good, and the portions were large. The folks bringing the meals pointed out that the tip was already included in the bill when I wrote in an additional tip, and I appreciated that. Housekeeping did a good job with replenishing our toiletries. 

When it came time to check out, I used the check out option on the tv which was super easy. It was a bit more challenging to secure a cab to the airport (long lines and no cabs to be seen), the attendant was quick to find people willing to travel together to share a towncar and that went pretty well (towncar for 4 people was $70).

This was one of the nicer places I have stayed, they made it so easy to do just about anything. I would happily stay here again.",6,3,3

We've been there numerous times, enjoying drinks at The Chandelier, eating at various places, watching music at Book and Stage, etc. But, with an offer of a free room, we finally booked a weekend.  The shortest version of our impression of the place: Inconsistent.  Some things are awesome (the music played throughout the casino, the cool vibe, terraces overlooking the city, certain employees were super friendly and helpful, and the aforementioned places) whereas other things were so mediocre\/bad that I don't think they'll get any of my hotel or gambling $ in the future. With free rooms available to us at The Palazzo (which has better service and more gambling options), why would I spend hundreds on a room to receive unacceptable service?  This is part of an email I sent to The Cosmopolitan, letting them know about the good & bad parts of our stay:

-Housekeeping needs a bit of work. We didn't have all our towels replaced, nor did the housekeeper take out all our trash; glasses were left behind after the room was 'cleaned.'  
-We also received mediocre service from most of the cocktail servers, and flat-out terrible service from 2 in particular; I wish I had their names.  Both instances occurred Saturday night (Feb 18th); the first a little earlier in the evening (6ish) and the second later in the night (around 10ish). The 1st server had darker hair that got lighter at the bottom (ombre-style) and had a piercing on her face.  She was generally unpleasant to start, but I ordered a Ketel Soda with Lime and asked for a bottle of water. She returned with the drink and no water. After tipping her $2, I received an indifferent response. After she walked away I tasted my drink and it was unfortunately incorrect. I realize that isn't necessarily her mistake; I flag her down & let her know that instead of vodka with soda water, it's vodka with sprite. She gives me a dirty look and says, ""It is?"" like I'm making it up or something. No apology, no 'let me fix that for you,' nothing. So I say ""yes, it is. May I have one that is correct please? And, can I get a water?"" She finally returns and says, with a smirk on her face, ""Do you want to taste that?"" Of course I do. It was fine, but the 15 minute process, full of her poor attitude put a damper on the festive environment going on downstairs; it is not conducive to gambling!  The 2nd instance was worse! Later in the evening, my husband & I are gambling and an auburn\/reddish haired server came over and asked if we needed drinks. He orders his & I order a cosmopolitan and a bottle of water. I am nothing, if not consistent =)  She returns a while later (it was busy, to be fair to her) with the drinks, and no water. We hand her $5 & I ask her about the water. She'll grab one, she says.  About 10 or so minutes later, she happens to come by to see if we needed more drinks (seeming to forget she never brought me the water), which we didn't, but I did ask her for a bottle of water. She returns a while later with the water and I say ""thank you.""  She just stands there for a second & asks if we need anything else, to which I respond ""no, we're good."" So she just stands there & then says, ""Should I wait?"" At this point I realize she's essentially asking for a tip, for the water I asked her 3 times for, & after she already got $5 for not bringing what we asked for originally.  So I say, ""No, we're good."" She honestly gave me the dirtiest look that I have ever received from someone I'm giving money to & says ""ooooookay"" with the bitchiest tone.  Honestly, if my husband wasn't winning on that machine & was going to want more drinks, she would have gotten an earful from me about her attitude; it is unacceptable to treat any customers like that. I am still angry about it now. With that kind of service, what is the point of spending money in your casino? I do love the ambience there, I love Book and Stage, I love the pizza place, etc., but I don't need to gamble there to enjoy those things.  Someone needs to handle servers like these so they stop driving customers away. When I'm spending good money & my night is ruined by terrible service, no amount of cool music or chic decor can make up for that.  Your cocktail servers need an attitude adjustment, or perhaps to not work with people.

I felt someone needed to know so that you have a chance to make things right and preserve your customer base.

So we receive a response from Carlo Chavez, a Resort Manager. His message thanks us, apologizes, & tells us he'd like to make things right. I contact him and his offer to 'make things right' consisted of ""helping us make a reservation"" & a room upgrade (for a room we're expected to pay full price for). No thank you, sir! Back to The Palazzo we go.  Beware of inconsistencies at The Cosmopolitan; they think they're too cool to be classy with service.",15,6,7

This hotel has got it goin on! Not only are the rooms beautiful and the hotel super clean with a fabulous atmosphere ... The staff ... Everyone from the bell guys to the dealers to the bartenders .... Are absolutely world class in the service industry. 

They're not just helpful. They go out of their way. 
If you ask where a restaurant is ... They don't just point and give directions ... They walk you there! It's above and beyond and it absolutely makes a difference. 

Food an drinks have also been awesome in every restaurant we've tried.

They have eateries that are perfect for all occasions and places that will please everyone in your party, even picky eaters! They have gorgeous rooms and the ambiance is very chic\/young. You don't feel like you're getting lung cancer when you walk through the casino, so I feel like they do a good job of keeping it ventilated. The Chandelier Bar is amazing and one of my favorite spots to enjoy a drink before going out with friends. A few weekends ago, a bunch of friends and I came here. Jeff, at the front desk, recognized me and saw how often I have been there so he let me know that the Penthouse was available that weekend and upgraded us to the Penthouse! :) It's hard to find places that will do that for you, let alone recognize you! I guess I spend too much time in Vegas, but that's besides the point. I'm returning next weekend for my friend's bachelorette party and look forward to another 5 star stay!",15,11,16

So don't get too excited about thinking you got a close spot or you'll get motid like me.  

As for the casino floor itself, simply modern, sleek, and beautiful.  In the center of this casino is their infamous Chandelier.  During the day, this casino is tame.  But during the night, all the black outfits come out.  The casino floor level is about drinks and gaming. The 2nd level is where the night life action is going on.  During a Friday and Saturday night, the 2nd floor is packed.  Also, don't be surprised to see a celebrity or two while visiting this place.",5,4,4

When I called, the manager explained that it took 3 hours to clean up the room. This is quite hard to believe being that I had gathered all my garbage in plastic bags and placed them in a paper bag so they could just take that bag out to discard. I also had rinsed off all the drinks in the cups. It seems like the only way I would not be charged for this fee is if I had emptied out all the trash myself and left empty bins for the house keeper. No stains\/damages were done either. 
Aside from this ridiculous charge, I was not provided the 5-star hotel equivalent service. 
When I arrived at this hotel on thursday, my sink had weird black residues left on the walls; this residue probably clogged the sink being that my sink wasn't draining properly. I could have made a complaint, but instead I cleaned the sink up myself since it was a busy weekend and I did not want to bother housekeeping, and just called for someone to come up to help drain the sink. The ice bucket was never emptied out\/replaced with new bag for the 3 night stay either, but again, given that it was a busy weekend, my friend and I did not complain. 

Also on my 3rd day, I had gotten an extra pending charge of $53 and change. I had asked the front desk and the guy said they needed extra verification, but he said to not worry and that charge will be taken off. He stated that I'll be charged $100.80 for resort fee plus additional $300. When I asked what the extra $300 was for, he looked at the computer and said ""wait, what is going on?"" and stated he adjusted the prices and assured me that I will only be charged for the resort fee of $100.80. If I had not checked my bank statement that day, I probably would have ended up with additional unreasonable charges.

Really -- absolutely everything about my 3-night stay here was pitch-perfect!

Even before I got out of my car, I was greeted by the blingiest parking lot in town, with Shepard Fairey artwork covering the walls and convenient red and green lights directing me toward available spaces in the sprawling underground garage.

Check-in was painless.  The Cosmo front desk is well staffed, and they even gave me a free water bottle while I waited.  I also had some excellent help from Joseph C. at the concierge desk -- please give that boy a promotion!

My hotel room was lovely.  It was a ""terrace studio"" high up in the west tower, with an impressive view of the Strip.  It had all the usual trappings of a contemporary hotel, with a chic bathroom, oodles of C.O. Bigelow bath products, separate walk-in shower and soaking tub, cozy living room, sumptuous bedding, multiple flat-panel TVs, a pressure-sensitive ""tray of temptation"" and mini-fridge full of overpriced goodies -- but what really sets the Cosmo apart are the terraces.  Nothing beats having your own private little balcony on which to sip a cocktail and watch the craziness of the Strip unfold below you.  (Also, if you look carefully, you can spot all kinds of inappropriate shenanigans happening on the terraces of the opposite tower.)  

Also of note are the pool facilities.  I tried two of the pools -- the Boulevard pool and the Marquee dayclub pool.  The Boulevard was easily my favorite, with a fun and social vibe but without the drunken messes who inhabit the Marquee pool.  There's also a third pool, the Bamboo pool, which is quieter and more secluded than the other two.  All the pools fill up by mid-morning, so arrive early if you want a place to lie down.

I can't forget to mention that the Cosmo is, simply put, drop-dead gorgeous.  I adore how they decorated every square inch of this hotel, from the massive chandeliers, to the giant stiletto statues, to the mirrored walls, to the animated columns, to the strands of crystals.

The restaurant and nightlife selection at the Cosmo is probably the best in Vegas.  To date, I've enjoyed dining at Secret Pizza, Holstein's, Estiatorio Milos, and Scarpetta.  (I wish I had more time to try some of the others, such as Jaleo, China Poblano, Comme Ça, STK, and the Wicked Spoon Buffet.  I guess those will have to wait 'til next time.)  If you like to dance all night, there's Marquee (of course) and Bond.  For me, though, the Cosmopolitan is all about the Chandelier.  It's easily the best cocktail lounge in Vegas -- and one of the best on the west coast -- and no trip to Vegas is complete without stopping there.

Location-wise, you can't do better.  The Cosmo is in the heart of the Strip, steps from the Aria, Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, and Paris.  Everything else is a short walk or cab ride away.

Look, folks -- because of the recession, there probably won't be any new megaresorts opening in Vegas for some time.  In the meantime, swoon over the Cosmo.",19,6,9

What i like most is the hotel is located in the middle part of the strip this means so easy to get to other major hotels by cab fairly cheap.  It has good combination of restaurants (like both pizza & burger plceas, please see seperated reviews).  The room is over 600 sq. ft, the most spacious one we have ever stayed in Vegas.

What really so so part is service.  1. the front desk staff isn't familar with the discount they offer such as MS Prime Card. 2. check in is very slow 3. the hotel offers Match Play however the dealer doesn't know about it at all 4. the housekeeping service doesn't exist.  No one clean our room until the early evening before we check out.  Obviously they are very understaffed.  5. the room isn't clean enough for a 4-5 stars hotel standard, we saw coffee stain on the mini bar menu card, the glasses are not sparkling clean, the bar soap was in a damaged box 6. room maintenance is lacking, we had chipped furniture and broken drawers in our room, this is quick shocking considering how new this hotel is.",2,0,1

* Conveniently located in the middle of the Vegas strip.

* Hands down, the leading modern\/contemporary Hotel\/ Casino of its caliber in Vegas.

Polished steel accents, shreds of light and glass move above you as you walk in.

Elements of sexy appear from the first step in through the lobby and follow into the casino floors. Fascinating design from furniture, art pieces, and installations run consistently through The Cosmo create a modern-contemporary feel. Similar to what would be seen in a GQ magazine spread.

AVANT-GARDE - ALLURING - STATE OF THE ART

* When it comes to young and hip ambiance I'd say Encore comes close, but The Cosmo is far more ahead in position. 

Exceptionally nice and helpful dealers on the casino floors were a plus :) 

* Club Marquee (the largest club I've ever been to) and shops on the second floor. 

Cool, upbeat and fun people usually hang here. (especially around the weekend & monday nights.)

I wish I could live in the Cosmopolitan. By far, the best hotel in Vegas in terms of ambiance, room amenities, food, location, everything!

Food- Plenty of restaurants located in the hotel, including Jaleo (Tapas Restaurant) and Va Bene (A great cafe with amazing pastries).

Room- I wanted to take that blanket home with me soooo bad. You feel like you're floating on a cloud. It's fluffy and dreamy and.. okay okay I'll stop. Bathroom toiletries are Co Bigelow products, a definite plus :)

it was friday @ about 9 pm when we arrived. 2 people in line front of us waiting in line to check in and 2 at the counter being helped.  There were literally 7 employees @ the check in counter walking around or on the computer. only 2 were checking ppl in.  10 min passed.  15 min passed.  20 min passed.  now there was 4 more ppl behind us in line. no employee says to the line ""we'll be right with you, or thank you for waiting."" no one bothers to look up at us, or even open at least antother check-in lane.  a ghetto lady in a wheelchair already at the counter, wants to get a room in the front for free and she does this pity party screaming and yelling and kicking and pretending to fall off her chair and is crying (i just COULDNT blieve she was handicapped, the moves she was doin), THE front desk girl (young and immature) ROLLS HER EYES at the lady and walks away to the back. then ladies and gentleman, wheelchair lady's so pissed, she walks up off her wheelchair and realizing what she did, she walks back to her wheelchair and then pretends to fall down.  The lady at the counter never comes back and we are waiting.  ok, they are dealing w\/ a crappy customer, but give me a break, customer service was FUCKED UP making us wait half hour to get checked in.  everyone waiting in line was DISGUSTED.

our room wasnt ready (wth. 9pm). we had to wait 45 min.  UNREAL on the chandaliers and whole casino floor. feel like im in mariahcarey's nitemare. BLING bling... BLING.  

fine. gave them benefit of the doubt as theyd just opened and probably still figuring out their shit.  

check in. first thing i wanted to do was take a shower. 2 steps into the bathroom, i see black medium length hairs (i counted 10) on the bahtorom tile floors. SICK. Then I see one in the sink.  I got a tissue and wiped them all up and threw it away.  I step into the shower and i see a couple more hairs on the seat section in the back of the shower!!! UGHHHHHHHHH. nassssttty. i throw those out.  whatever. didnt think anything of it, probably forgot to swweep the bathroom. or the maid was shedding.

We go out, do our thing that nite, and i come back to sleep. Throw back the covers, and I SEE 3 black medium length hairs again (one under the pillow). OMG KILL ME.  but i was so tired i couldnt even call to complain. i picked up that shit w\/ tissues.

i could barely sleep, so at 8am, my man still sleepin, i go to the front desk and i nicely (i swear, i was nice - the girl looked nice) tell this girl about these medium length hairs everywhere in the bathroom from under the covers.  but of course, this bitch had the nerve to look up at my head and say ""ARE YOU SURE IT WASNT YOURS?""  oh mother -  i had to restrain myself from crawling across the counter and beat her face in.  I say "" look at my HAIR its down to my waist, I hAVE THE HAIRS FROM MY ROOM SAVED, ILL GO DIG IN THE TRASH AND GIVE IT TO YOU, WOULD YOU LIKE THAT?""  she says ""no i dont need it"" and gives a dirty face.  i say ""YOUR HOTEL IS SO UNSANITARY AND YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE AT CHECK-IN YESTERDAY WAS SO UNBLIEVABLY UNPROFESSIONAL, AND WE ARE PAYIN FOR YOU SUITE AND YOU'RE ACCUSING ME OF LYING"" she says ""well, do you want me to send a maid up to clean your place then?""  i say ""is that what ur offering me? to clean up? after we paid all this money to stay at your DIRTY HOTEL, I want LAST NIGHT comped "" she goes ""we cant do that. we can give you 50$ food credit""  i said ""get me your manager"" she comes back and says ""he says we cant comp your room"" omg i had to leave before i was about to rip her eyes out. ""give me $300 food credit."" i can do 150$. ""get ur manager"". She dissappears n says, $275. I took it n left. What the... Mgr can't address guests face to face? Too trivial for u?  F-u Cosmo.

we spent it all on their tacos. @ their restaurant called china poblano? The tacos were Amazing DELICIOUS (the hi-light of the hotel... as well as marquee.. and cosmo doesnt own marquee :) - both i give 5 stars, not reflected in this rating)

i love allsaints. they have one in there. sad. ppl r gonna be wearing that stuff who shouldnt be. Majority of cosmos clientele  trading in their affliction\/ed hardy's for allsaints. yuck.

wicked spoon was what id been waiting and dying for.  sooooooo disssapointeddddd. bone marrow was steamed looking instead of roasted (gag). mac n cheez was good. thier ribs were nasty tasting and altho presentation was really nice on everything, they lacked TASTY FOOD.  i mean... i really dont know how to put it. they had good quality foods, but the chefs really missed the mark on flavor.

While not as large is its neighbor to the South, Cosmo is still huge compared to many along The Strip.  Not being a club guy I cannot comment on those however there are plenty of lounge areas in this gem to grab a drink.  However on a weekend night, don't expect to find much seating especially if you're with a larger group.

One of the noticeable things is the fact that they did not spare costs on the details.  Everything in this place speaks money.  The Chandelier Bar is impressive mainly due to the chandelier itself.  The fixture is massive and quite impressive to see.  It is also a good place to sit back and people watch.

The tables in this casino are as you'd expect......HIGH!!  However, it is no different that what you'd find elsewhere on The Strip.

The place had a continuous buzz to it and although extremely busy, it was impressively clean and maintained.  Another thing I like about Cosmo is that didn't have that stale smoke smell even though there was plenty of smoking going on around us.

The staff here is part of what makes it stand out.  Each venue was like the last....helpful and friendly.  The never once made it feel like a chore to be helping out the customer.

Cosmo is a work of art in its being! 

Every detail carved, dangling, shaped, measured, you name it, was done in meticulous carefulness in order to bring nothing less of a glamorous experience. One of my girlfriends pointed out the physics involved in making even light reflections point to the right angles, casting beautiful shadows and colors on just the right areas. 

We had a nice time relaxing on the sofas outside the Chandelier bar when our feet started to hurt. We further progressed into the artsy areas with the giant black stiletto shoe, cold-staring doggie statues and other fun stuff, all of which were a blast to take pictures with. 

Did I also mention that this hotel smelled, well, lavish? Perhaps that's because it's new, or they're just great at keeping the cigarette scents away. Third floor up, they even have a pool table for the guys (and occasional girls?) and other fun stuff for the family. Kids won't be bored and mothers have a lot of choices on where to sit! 

There's artwork in just about every glance, deep meanings embedded behind so art enthusiasts will not be disappointed. Nice change in atmosphere and great place to enjoy yourselves without even spending a buck.",5,5,5

I always loved the decor of the retail and lobby areas and the hotel's location in the center of the action is unbeatable. Cosmo may have the best curated restaurant selection out of all of the major hotels on the Strip: Egg Slut is an LA favorite; Jose Andres always delivers excellent flavors; Momofuku just opened a few weeks ago. Marquee is a guaranteed good time (except for the scary stairs on the way out).

Last weekend was the first time I've stayed at Cosmo and boy was it a let down. We had a City Room and it was tiny compared to other standard rooms in Vegas. The bathroom vanity was a single sink and it was short. The shower was just big enough for one and there was no separate bathtub. The toilet did not have a separate door. Also, lighting in the bathroom was dark and made it hard to do makeup. Basically, the room felt like any other 4* hotel room in the country. However, Vegas hotels rooms tend to be bigger, grander, and just nicer. Considering how new Cosmo is compared to some other hotels on the strip and the premium price, I definitely expected it to be better.

I've stayed at Encore during most of my Vegas trips and for about the same price, Encore's rooms are 50% bigger and have higher end furnishings and finishes than Cosmo.

There is a nice pool with a mixture of sun and shady spots, though the pina colada I ordered poolside tasted oddly fishy and my friends cosmopolitan was simply not good.

I check in late on Monday afternoon (4\/13\/2015). The reason I decided to stay here was, the Cosmopolitan is a Marriott affiliated hotel, and I have a little status with Marriott Rewards. So I was expecting a good experience. But sadly that was not the case. 

1. The front desk and a few of the girls in Autograph lounge were not very friendly, I requested wake up calls, and never got them. 

There was a guy named Devin, who was helpful. 

2. My biggest complaint and it's a big one, and I would hope that the health department comes and inspects all the rooms, that the shower had a lot of black mold. (Eventually they cleaned it) See picture attached.  (Housekeeping left a box of chocolates, but I can't eat the chocolate.)

3. I'm disputing this, but was charged an additional $286, and still trying to figure out why. 

Generally, I didn't have a very good experience, and for the amount of money I spent that's a shame.


I could have stayed at one the other hotels and had a better experience, and I'm sure that the showers wouldn't have any mold

. 
The room itself is okay, and I was on the 54th floor so I had a semi-decent view.

I know my review won't mean much, because people will continue to stay there. 

If someone does read this, I hope that the very least, if you do stay there you get a clean room, and don't have any mold and that your room is well kept and clean.

Yes after hours if can be ""doucey"" but I would rather be surrounded by that...then the alternative.

The hotel rooms with their large soaking tubs and their patios are fun! They are fun just for a short stayva! 

I have been to a few shows out in the pool area and they (although the line getting in was long and horrible) were set up and organized great!

My suggestion as far as the restaurants...go early! like 5:30pm early, grab a reservation on OpenTable, and enjoy the great service. 

With the cocktail bars....go early also....anytime after 8-9pm you will be stuck in a messy crowd of people waving money for drinks. 

Bond is great for watching the hot mess of LVB walkers and people stumbling in (from LVB to go to The Chandelier or Secret Pizza). If you are there earlier you can grab a gaming machine up at the actual bar. Those bartenders are very nice.

I love the Cosmopolitan! This hotel succeeds in being beautiful, elegant, and fancy, without feeling stuffy and snooty. We walked around the hotel prior to dinner at Holsteins, and what I enjoyed most was the lack of overbearing cigarette smoke.

I visit Las Vegas pretty frequently, and I'm a huge fan of the Venetian. That being said, I felt like I had not experienced enough of the other end of the strip. So I decided to switch things up on this last trip and stay at the Cosmopolitan. All in All -- It's good. 

If you stay there, you will have a nice stay.


The rooms are a decent size, they are beautifully furnished, modern.. but a little traditional. They have balconies and (for like 20 dollars more) a beautifulllll view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip (Really pretty and cool at night). It's also nice and refreshing just to be able to have some fresh air from your hotel room. Maybe just to spend a little more time outside on your trip than you normally would. 

Everything in the room is a crazy price.. but that's to be expected. 
like a can of beer is like 16 dollars or something. 

OK.. so the room is nice, the balcony is great, awesome view. 

So, let's get to why I do not think that the Cosmopolitan is worth what they charge. Starting with the hotel itself.. The hotel is hardly a Vegas casino hotel.. its like a hotel in vegas that happens to have some slot machines and tables. You don't get the feeling of Vegas at all. There is no excitement, no energy... nothing. It's dead, lifeless, and cold outside of your room. The service is great... but it's like you don't feel that presence there. It's very dark.

I never really got a feel for when the housekeeping goes around... it felt like they would come at very strange times, and not consistently close to the same time. That just slightly inconvenienced me, because like a lot of people I kind of expect them to be there not early morning, but before noon. You kind of plan your morning so that you can be gone and it will be put back together when you come back. You don't want to have to keep calling and figuring it out, you're on vacation and spending a lot of money to stay there. 

The one major complaint I had was that several days the hot water would take like 20 minutes to kick in in the shower (and it was like half the water pressure until it would kick in). Also semi annoying for the price they charge. 

A plus, is that they allow smoking on the balcony, but not in the rooms. However the casino was like foggy with stale smoke. They need better ventilation in there. 

They do have little kitchenettes that I guess could be useful if you wanted to make something. I think they had plates and silverware in the cabinets and they had a miniature dishwasher, refrigerator sink and microwave. You're in Vegas, so chances are you're going out to eat, but I guess for someone on a business trip or something. 

There was never a long line to get a cab, which was nice. Sometimes at the Venetian you end up waiting for a few minutes. 

Location -- this is a big one. I thought that it was in the perfect location, however, aside from Aria, Planet Hollywood and Bellagio... everything seemed sooooo far away. I'm not lazy by any means, I like to walk, especially in the dry heat there.. but it seemed like walking to the neighboring hotels from the venetian wasn't ever that far, and from cosmo, they all look so close, but you end up taking a cab everywhere. (I guess also because Aria and Planet Hollywood are kind of boring hotels too... so you just don't have the same caliber hotels within walking distance)


All in all -- I think the Cosmo is a fine hotel, they have great service, and nice rooms... They're just over-priced and lack the atmosphere and convenience that the Venetian (who has very nice rooms as well) offers for about half the price.",3,0,0

2) Cleanliness
3) Spacious
4) View of the Strip
5) Pricing 

Five shooting stars goes to the Cosmo. I've stayed here twice. And every time I book with another hotel, I miss the amenities in the Cosmo. The first time I stayed at most standard room, rooms were average, what stood out are the bathrooms. The toilet had its own door, this makes it much easier when someone is using the bathroom while someone needs to brush their teeth or shower. The entrance to the hotel is breathtaking, the chandeliers, the polish on the granite floors, I cannot describe a more beautiful hotel\/casino\/resort. 

The second time, I stayed at a terrace suite. Check-in was very smooth and I stayed in the east tower closer to all the casino slots. I was glad that I was somewhat close to the elevator. I walked in was welcomed by a modern living room, a small kitchenette décor-ed with creative centerpieces.  As I walked further in, there are two large floor the ceiling mirrors that have closets (I loved how there was a ottoman in between. It was great spot to put on make-up or just a spot for your friends to sit when they are visiting. I have a random pet peeve about people sitting on beds with dirty clothes on or not pjs. I loved the bathroom. Omygoodnes... I would love my master bathroom to look like this but with double the sinks. The toilet has its own door and room, the sink has a full length mirror not an odd oval mirror that some hotels have. And now my favorite part.... the shower. I felt like I was at the most expensive report with a shower that a sparse shoulder head but the acceleration was powerful enough so that you feel like you are getting a good clean. I hate it when the power of the shower heads are like a splash or a sprinkle where you feel like you been in the shower for ages. If you skip along t the shower there is a very contempary\/modern tub that looks like a Jacuzzi. You even have the view of the strip since there is a small window. I am in love. 
The king size bed was spacious and fluffy. I also had my own balcony.. facing the beautiful strip. The only thing is that room service took a little long, maybe 40 minutes. I enjoyed my stay a lot.

FIRST THE BAD - Since we had the biggest room out of our friends we decided to first hang out here. Within an hour of us checking in we got a knock on our door which claimed to be security. 

He said that this was a one time warning and that if he had to come back then we would get kicked out of our room with no refund. We hadn't even played music yet. It was 5:00pm with the sun still bright and out and we were just talking and laughing. Apparently we could get a noise complaint during the day but the way we were approached was very unprofessional and rude. 

I immediately called the front desk which they apologized for the way the security guard spoke to us. Since the front desk was nice I didn't give 1 star. But the security guard basically set a bad tone and left a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the weekend. We didn't want to get kicked out without a refund so we didn't play music the whole weekend. 

Other than that incident the stay was okay. 

Room service took anywhere between an hour to two hours for things such as towels, toilet paper, utensils, etc.

You may give yourself whiplash when you first get here, but within a couple hours you should be completely desensitized to the extremely attractive members of the opposite gender walking around.

All of the restaurants I have been to at Cosmo I have thoroughly enjoyed.  Didn't go to the Wicked Spoon Buffet this time, but have been there before and it was awesome.  Two rather affordable options are Secret Pizza and Holstein's.  Secret Pizza has authentic New York pies for five dollars a slice.  Holstein's has great burgers in the ten to twenty dollar range.  Also, you have to try the W.W.E.D? ice cream drink at the Neopolitan by the pool.  It is heaven in a glass.

Probably stay somewhere cheaper in Vegas next time I go, but life is short and you gotta treat yourself once in awhile.",3,4,3

If you stay here often you should start racking your points for a free room. And it's easy to book the room with your points. 

I have stayed in suites each time I have stayed at this hotel and I love the spacious open layout of the rooms. 

I believe they are very generous with upgrades. This is because the one time I booked a standard room, I was upgraded. It was when my girlfriends and I booked a 2 kings size bed room we were upgraded to a suite. The upgrade was quick and happened at the front desk while I was checking in. It was a fun surprise. 

The bar area in the rooms have a modern open layout. The bar is fully stocked. Their bathrooms are open and modern. The view is awesome. It's right in front of the water show so no need to head out to see that. Their balcony connects to the bedroom and the living area, so it's definitely more romantic. 

It's always easy to catch a cab right in front of the hotel. The hotel offers great services. Secret pizza, cafes, shopping, casino, clubbing is all offered in the hotel. The hotel itself has an edge and playful flare. 

They have a well laid out emergency route for any 911 emergencies. The staff seemed very competent and professional in the emergency evacuation when we called an ambulance on one of the nights.",2,2,2

It encompasses everything I look for when I go to Vegas. The location is the best because you can literally be on the strip within a few minutes from your room. You don't have to walk through a maze of people and slot machines. It's big but not too big. Service is always good. Parking is easy. Check in is always smooth.

The hotel itself is gorgeous. Dark tones and modern, if that's your thing. Rooms are nicely sized and and beds are really comfortable. Showers and bathroom are very nice, although they could use a little more light. If you can afford it, definitely get a room with a balcony. It makes all the difference and is one of the few hotels on the strip where you can get that kind of view on a balcony. The rooms facing the Bellagio water fountains are the best. I've stayed in the basic city room to the wrap around terrace and they are all good.

The amenities on the property are pretty good, although I wish there were more food choices. Even though what they do have is good, the late night options are lacking. All you have is the not-so-secret pizza place which on weekends, can have a 45 minutes wait, and small snack stand, so if you're really hungry at 5am, you don't have many options in the hotel for that drunken binge.  Aside from that, most of the food places I've been to are good. Buffet is  average, and decent for the price and wait time, which is usually pretty short.

Chandelier Bar in is a nice place to get a drink.  You can usually find a place to sit on one of the three floors, although it's really annoying that all three floors have completely different drink menus, so if you have to find a booth or seat on a different level than the one from which you ordered a specialty drink, you can't have the waitress or bartender on that level make it.  

The casino is pretty small, and you can walk from one end to the other in a few minutes.  I've been gambling here and in Vegas for a long time and I have to say Cosmo has the most generous comps in terms my win\/loss ratio. Even when I spend\/lose more at Mlife or Total rewards properties, I still get almost nothing. I'm not a huge gambler, but even with my level of play, which by vegas standards, is probably pretty low, Cosmo is generous with comps. So when I lose here, it doesn't feel as bad.

The pools are nice and multi level. It makes for great people watching especially if you can find a chair at the higher levels. People seemed generally well behaved, but you always get the obnoxious drunken frat guy or bachelorette party that can't handle their alcohol and ruin it for everyone around them. But I saw security make quick work of removing those people the one time I saw a problem. Having gone to Marquee day club a couple times, it was pretty fun. Felt a little small but that's a good thing sometimes if when you don't feel like partying with 1000 people in murky pool water. They also have and adults only pool, but the time I went to that one, there was no food or beverage service so I never went back to that one. I'm not sure if that's changed by now.

The one and only time I had a problem staying at this hotel, where I had a fradulent charge on my account, management promptly took care of it and followed up to make sure everything was remedied. Communication with all the team members was seamless and I was really happy with the way even upper management was involved in making sure everything was right, so you can tell that their operations and training are awesome from the top to the bottom. It's those small things and details that keep me coming back.",0,0,0

I was beyond excited when I booked the ""terrace one bedroom"" for 5 days 4 nights.

I realize at this point Cosmo is not exactly a brand new hotel anymore, millions of people had already visited this vegas hot spot. With that being said, the kid in me was still wowed when I arrived at the checkin\/concierge area, who can beat those 8 digitalized giant floor-to-ceiling columns? (BTW, look out for ""monarch,"" this visual experience drapes with hypnotizing music in the backgound was just sheer glamorous and sophistication that is cosmopolitan!!)

Upon arrival of our room, BF and I were immediately impressed by the chic décor. Though the entire room was beautiful, we've encountered several ""malefactions"" and quality control issues. So the next day, we went back to the check in area and notified the management (through the help of Aaron from the check-in desk) and they upgraded us to the famous ""wraparound terrace suite!!!!"" The wraparound terrace suite accompanied a breathtaking view on the strip and the management even had a box of chocolate along with an apology card waiting for us when we arrived in the room! 

Not to be a complainer, but we again encountered more quality control issues along the rest of our stay, so we gave the management (Spoke to Manager Christine Monson) a list of problems when we checked out. Other than more apologies, she even issued us another $200 credits back to our account! Our stay with Cosmopolitan was truly a treat, the entire hotel staffs went all out to make sure of our satisfactory, the professionalism Cosmopolitan delivered was just unbelievable!

Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas offers more than just nice rooms or chic, advanced digitalized décor throughout the entire building, it also houses the most delicious and sophisticated restaurants and bars on the strip, not to mention I had the best spa experience of my life at Sahra Spa & Hammam!! I absolutely adore this upscale hotel and I cannot wait to go back for more.

I'm sure at some point the reference will be ""Cosmo.""

We happen to arrive in Vegas on grand opening day of the hotel\/casino.  I have to mention, the engineer of the parking garage should be given an award for those parking ""red"" and ""green"" lights to know where the available spots are located.  I know there are several of those here in Los Angeles, but it seems like Vegas is behind on this technology.

As soon as you walk in from valet, there are retro pink chandeliers with crystals  and continuing into the casino has somewhat a clubby vibe.  I'm not sure if the vibe was only because of the grand opening with several areas set up with DJs at the bars, lounge and in the middle of the casino.  I'm going to take a guess and say yes.  I don't see how this place could be like this all the time.  Let's face it everything is sparkly, new and fresh.  There are interactive screens to learn about the hotel\/casino and digital screen pillars that change light bulb images on them in the check-in area.  They are definitely going for that tekkie and posh design.  It's a casino that they can drop onto Sunset Blvd. and it would fit in quite nicely.

As we stood in line for our Identity cards aka players card, we were told that this place originally was only going to be condos (can you imagine how large the rooms must be?), but the property was going into foreclosure, so someone stepped in and included the casino.  I have to say the casino seemed a bit small to me.  Maybe because it wasn't intended to be a casino? I do like the openness of the bar (the one closest to the strip entrance) and crystals sparkling all around (yes, i love sparkly things). Oh and your Identity cards rack up points when you eat, shop and play and Cosmo - so use it to start earning free play and possibly discounted rooms.

We played for an 1 1\/2 here on the Cash Spin machines.  Almost won $5,000 (had that needle stayed on the $5k!)...that would have been nice to be a big winner on the first opening day.

Let's see how this place does once the buzz slowly fades.  Personally, it's a small casino (unless I missed the rest of the casino - doubt it.), not as many machines or tables as the rest of the casinos on the strip.  I'd love to come here to be amongst the fixtures and relax at the bar if I can't get on any of the machines.",1,0,1

Serious evaluation should be done on all dealers and should be ranked by the customers. If they hate there jobs then they should find work elsewhere. For the good dealers and pit bosses, you guys are awesome, but for those and you know who you are. QUIT your job cause you stink at it and are miserable and bring misery to the hands that feed you.

The styling in the hotel fits me well. I was awed and noted a lot of the little details they infused into the place. It was like Tom Ford had a party with David Bowie and then did drugs with maybe Christian Dior or Diane von Furstenberg. Just very cool, modern, with touches of glamour everywhere.

However, a few detrimental notes:

The Chandelier, was hyped up to me but once I was inside it - it lost its lustre. Yes, you are a sitting in a place strewn with crystals, but I expected a little more. It also didn't do them well, that once sat - it took about 10-15 minutes to be noticed. And this is while everyone is waiting in line at Marquee on a Saturday night. So needless to say, first impression of service... BLEW.

The signature Cosmopolitan sucked. And for it being the name, I expected something out of it. It's like Carrie Bradshaw took a big wee-wee in my glass. 

While styled well, the hotel might have been planned out more than what it should have been. Everything was packed in so tight and it made for a bit of claustrophobia. You couldn't see where you were going, when you walked in and about. Best design element that struck a chord were the video walls in the lobby. Those fascinated me the most.

Crowd was okay - it tasted like LA walking through here. There was so many LBDs (or little black dresses to you) that it looked like Herve Leger took a big shit on the place.

Bottom line lies in the execution. For paying good money, you still need to be seamlessly good, and the Cosmopolitan failed at that point just on the surface. It still holds my curiosity at this point, but it wouldn't be my first choice to come back to when staying in Vegas - I don't think.",2,6,1

I have stayed here over 30 times and it was my go to hotel for work trips because they are more generous with room comps than the bigger brands. Love the food options, although one more quick cheap option in addition to the pizza place would be nice.  The restaurants are great but they are all fancy sit down places which leaves grabbing a quick lunch difficult if you don't want pizza every day (even this pizza which is in my top 5 favorite slices anywhere can get repetitive). 

Unfortunately the property has suffered a slow decline since it opened.  This trip may have sealed it for me. Usually the check in lines are painfully slow, expect to spend 30-45 minutes when it is isn't busy and an hour plus if it is.  I checked in and went up to my room. Keycard in, light turns green but the handle won't turn. Try it a couple of times. Had to trudge all the way back down and they apologized and gave me a different room.  Get in the new room and go to put my stuff in the safe and the safe doesn't work. Call and ask them to fix it while I now have to lug all my valuables around to go eat. Gone for 4 hours but when I get back safe still doesn't work.  The view is great of the bellagio fountains but the water canons can be loudly heard through the windows.  Cell reception sucks in most of the rooms  I have stayed in. 

The next day I spend in the room getting some work done. Then the wifi and the TV go down. It has been down for 30 minutes and after calling I am told it is just a quick reset.  Add to that the casino is small and the ""party pit"" looks like the stage for a high school play and not something in line with a high end hotel.  The casino is also laid out terribly. It has table games in sections that scattered, there is no flow to it. The sports book is in the second floor away from everything else and it feels like an afterthought, a small cramped afterthought. No space to hang out and drink while betting (they have a couple of rows of cubicles with TVs but they are built for individuals and not watching with fiends).  The pool scene during the summer is also pretty cramped (I am not including marquee as that is a day club and not part of the resort pools. The two pools are nice, but small, and forget it if you get there after 10 am without a reservation.  Basically you can tell this building was crammed into a small footprint and there wasn't enough room for everything. Rather than leave anything out they just under did each thing. And then they charge a $30 per day resort fee, when you aren't really getting the same quality as any of the neighboring properties.",2,0,1

This last time, it caused us to stay in our room almost the whole first day waiting around for them to put us in the room they promised us in the first place.

The second thing that got me a little concerned is that both of the rooms we had this last time had seriously stained sheets, and it's obvious what kind of stain it was.. gross.

The ambiance was fantastic, with a view overlooking the strip. But that did not make up for the horrible (SLOW) service, despite the lack of customers; and the awful food.  I ordered the Endive and Mache salad.  Per the menu: smoked walnut, clementine, bleu cheese and walnut sherry dressing.  The salad had almost no greens and all cabbage, which was not indicated on the menu.  Not worth it for the price OR for the view.  

So we decided to get a better experience in the casino.  While at a black jack table, the dealer made an error.  She payed out my hand with a 20 (two face cards) before looking at her second card.  She called over the supervisor to inform him (Peter) of her mistake.  He had her pull the cards back out of discard stack.  He proceeded to take back my winnings from the dealers error.  I questioned this action, and he said the casino can do so. I decided to let it be as I didn't want to cause a disturbance.

don't get me wrong, i loved the atmosphere, i perhaps need to visit this place again in order for The Cosmopolitan for me to change my mind.  additionally, there was a robbery going on the night we came where the thief ran away with some chips and security flew pass by me as the thief dropped his chips.  of course, i returned the chips.

We had 7 girls left after a horrible experience at Marquee (we had 15 girls for a bachelorette party) the other 8 girls left and got taken care of at another hotel. us 7 girls went down to the casino to gamble, they all wanted drinks, after a while from not seeing a waitress we saw a security guard and asked him if they even had waitresses walking around, it was only 1 am. He said yes and radioed for one. She finally came over 20 minutes later and went to the guard and said what, where? He pointed at us and she said ""they're not playing"" he stared at her and said ""I see reels going, I see money being played, they are playing"" she then got half the girls' orders and left. 2 of us didn't get drinks, she came back and dropped off the drinks, I tried to get her attention but she ran off, another 10 minutes goes by and she walks by us, I said ""excuse me"" not yelling, not mean, very polite, she stops, turns around and puts her finger up and says ""wait"", she then left and never came back. I couldn't believe it.

My mom is a cocktail waitress at an older casino and has been for years so I know how they work, but working at one of the newest hottest casinos on the strip, you think you would be out more because I know they don't get paid much, they make their money on their tips.

A few reasons to love it: 

1. Secret pizza- Little pizza shop on the third level! One of the best pizzas I ever had !!!

2. The Terrance studio\/ one bedroom is really worth it ! It has a Japanese soaking tub, a balcony, and if you get it with a view, the Bellagio fountain and the panoramic view of the Vegas strip are amazing ! 

3. Marquee- how nice is to just walk up to your hotel after a night of clubbing and don't have to deal with the taxi line ?!

Some friends and I decided on staying the weekend in the Terrace Balcony rooms, which is so worth it.  The views are absolutely amazing at night, and the size of the room was really nice.  The hotel in itself is stunning, very modern, without being over the top, very classic, appealing to both men and women.  I really liked the organization of the hotel, and the layout.  Literally, all weekend I had whiplash with all of the very beautiful people milling about.  I didn't know where to look first! 

The staff and service was also top notch, from the waitstaff, to the check in to the concierge,  and everyone in between was super friendly, and responsive. 

Honestly, I could have stayed there and never had to leave all weekend, honestly, the only time I did was to see a couple of shows and a dinner at Nobu.  

What I really liked about the hotel is that it appealed to different demographics.  As a 35 year old, I felt completely comfortable, although there were lots and lots of 20ish people running around.

I stay here probably once every few months and can say that every room here is a good choice. 

If you have the money the ONLY other hotel that beats the Cosmo is the Wynn\/Encore and that's if luxury and service is your main focus. If you're looking for an upscale place to party\/mingle with people in their 20s then definitely choose this hotel (the Cosmo). 

Rooms:
- If you're with more than 3 people get the wraparound terrace suite and ask for rollaway beds. This suite is HUGE like 1,200 sq ft. 
- Terrace suites are good choices for parties of 2. 
- Do not get an angle suite. 
- Any of the suites come with a fridge\/freezer, stove, and an oven. I doubt anyone cooks in Vegas, but if you're looking to save money then bringing\/cooking your own food in the rooms will definitely equate to about $200-500 off of the total price depending on the number of people in your party and the places you eat out. 
- The bedding sometime smells off. This is the way that they wash the sheets and I guess it's to be ignored or you can call and ask them to change your sheets to new ones and they'll know what you mean. 

Dining:
- Try the in room dining for breakfast at least once. It's better than most of the restaurants at this resort. 
- Eat at China Poblana (Mexican and Chinese fusion, don't be scared and order the ""when pigs fly"" and guacamole)
- Eat at DOCG and order the veal Parmesan (Italian restaurant next to Scarpetta) 
- ""Secret"" pizza place adjacent to the sushi place and the Spanish place. Really good pizza
- SKIP EVERY other restaurant at the resort. You'll be disappointed and will have spent a lot of money.

- You will want to bring your own cosmetics since the shampoo, conditioner, soap and mouthwash is pretty bad here. Actually, the mouthwash is laughably bad.",4,1,0

I booked it through a 3rd party travel site and got a sweet weekend deal. You will pay a small premium for the balcony rooms, but let me tell you: They definitely are worth it for the absolute best views in vegas. All the rooms at the Cosmo are suites with a fridge, microwave, minibar, etc. They are tastefully decorated and very spacious. But the feature attraction was the balcony. My room was on the side of the building facing the Bellagio fountains watershow. To be able to walk out on the balcony and see the show  from ABOVE the fountains  was absolutely awesome!! You can literally see the entire strip all lit up at night, and it is truly a sight to see. 
They have an awesome Pool party\/nightclub called Marquee.

There were 2 empty tables for blackjack. 2. both were $50 minimums. AT 4:42! So i asked the pit boss if he would reduce it to $25 and the 5 of us would sit down. Basically, an entire table. I didn't say something unrealistic like $5 or $10, (which is really not that unrealistic) and he said he couldn't do it.

The room is spectacular. Full kitchen\/ washer \/dryer \/ 2 showers, very big. We had a view of Bellagio Fountains and the strip.

One HUGE HUGE downside and its probably a deal breaker to stay again, and its hard to say that because this is the best Vegas room I've been in. The non-existant water pressure in the shower is unacceptable. 
If you are standing under the shower, and literally can't feel the water hitting you, its a problem. I am not talking 'rain water' shower head, I am talking sucko \/ awful - can't get the shampoo out of your hair.

As for the casino, Chandelier bar and all that. It was ok. After reading the reviews, I kind of expected more. Its really small, I won't fault them for that, the decor isn't so great.. IDK. I am not a hater, but aesthetically, Bellagio is my favorite. I didn't think the crowd so 'young and hip' either. Not that I need that, but its kind of what I was expecting.

The retail shops in this hotel are better than most. Really excellent actually. Restaurant selection and small coffee shop type places, very good also.

Our room faced the Bellagio fountains where we had a great view of the fountain show every night and the room itself was a mini suite decorated well with a small kitchenette huge bathrooms and two large flat screen TVs.  Our room even had a large bath tub facing out the window so you could watch the Bellagio Fountains while enjoying a bath.  I would say it was by far one of the nicest rooms I've stayed at while in Vegas (we've stayed at Mandalay and Aria).  The balcony was the most amazing feature of our room.  We had a perfect view of the Vegas strip!

So some things that I did not care for:

The Casino was small.  On a busy night all the tables were filled, i had to go to Aria or Bellagio to gamble.  There's no poker room here either.  The registration\/valet desk was on the complete opposite side of the property so we had to walk across the whole Casino every time we went anywhere.

The decor is contemporary and fun. The chandelier is a must-see. I love the fact that these rooms have balconies. It was amazing being able to stand outside on the balcony, enjoying the fresh air and seeing what is going on up and down the strip. The location is prime and there is so much going on at the hotel that you practically don't have to go anywhere else. 

The bathrooms were high-end and the showers were clean and huge. I felt that the room was very clean and the satellite radio on the TV was a bonus! I haven't seen that before and it allowed us to keep the music pumping all weekend without having to worry about controlling an iPod. I stayed in the Wraparound Terrace Suite and it was so amazing that I feel too spoiled to stay anywhere else from now on! I have no complaints about this hotel and I can't wait to stay there again. 

We came on a Cyber Monday deal that we booked back in November. The deal was AMAZING. I don't think you can beat it for any hotel out there. So definitely keep an eye out for that once the time comes around.",3,0,0

Well we booked them when they were in the same price range as Monte Carlo and Planet Hollywood and were relatively low. A few months after we booked with them their prices sky-rocketed. They are in competition with Caesars for the top highest price hotel in vegas. I did have 6 rooms that were booked at the cosmo, but the rest of my guests booked elsewhere because of the price increase. I was told that we had a block of rooms for the guests that did book there. My travel agent did speak with their rep and got our rooms upgraded to the premium view one bedroom from a regular one bedroom that we had originally paid for. Before we left not too many problems, but the hotel was not really friendly or willing to go above and beyond. I had looked into doing my after party at Marquee and it was insane the prices they wanted $45 per person to get in the door over $1500 for a table. When my now husband and I arrived we were told that a block of rooms did not mean by one another it just meant we had a guaranteed room( We call that a reservation), but they put guests arriving would be put by my room.  We were also told that our credit card would be CHARGED $150 per night incase the room was damaged and would be refunded no later that 5 days after we checked out. The room was amazing the view was spectacular 58 floor right over the fountain. You do not really have a mini fridge because it is stocked with crap that if you remove you are charged( you can have everything removed for a fee). Everything was ok unitl my other guests started arriving. My mom was told their were no notes on the account and that she was not by us actually in the other tower. My mom was finally moved the day before the wedding after much hassle. My mom did get them to only charge $150 total for my guests and not per night. The rooms were a disaster. My guests were on differnet floors and all over the place. My aunt was put in a room that had used rubbers on the balcony and blood on the sheets. When she complained she was told that is was a mistake that housekeeping didn't clean that room yet oops. When they did come to clean the room they said they ran out of king sheets so she would have to deal with this queen sheet until the next day. They said there was a pull out sofa, but there was not so they brought a roll away bed that had makeup all over the sheets. All of my guests experienced similar issues with housekeeping( hair everywhere, lipstick on glasses. razors left in room, gum on desk, coffee stains on counter, bed was broken, cleaned with do not disturb sign on once, but never again, didn't bring toilet paper etc.) I could go on and on with how horrible it was and no one would really take responsibility it was a computer error blah blah blah. My dad left his suit in the room when they left I called 6 hours later and the suit is still nowhere to be found. They did not do anything for my husband and I until I went to the desk and told them to do something so they gave us a $50 dining and upgraded us one night in the wrap around( which they now say makes everything better( it was a $100 upgrade from where we were)). They also gave my mom and aunt a dining credit after I called and asked to talk to a manager. Some of the staff is nice at the moment, but does not follow thru. Natalie was great and she did put notes on my account that it was my wedding and honeymoon and that there were guests connected with us and also noted the problems. Rico was another great manager that helped me out. No-one went above and beyond unless I contacted them.There is no communication or concern in this hotel. The staff is rude and does not care about their guests.  The wicked spoon was ok,but rude and when one of my guests went there at 1 they could not even finish their lunch because when they went up to the buffet they came back to their table cleaned off. They spoke to the manager who basically told them too bad its closing time at two. So There was some good stuff. The Henry restaurant was amazing great staff and awesome food. The hidden pizza place was great too, but go for the 10 slice whole pizza for around  $22 with toppings vs. $18 for four slices individually( they won't tell you this). If you ask them for their phone number you can call ahead and then you don't have to wait. THe bartender Char and manager on the floor at night Marie were awesome and so sweet! The hotel is gorgeous, but unless their customer service increases they will not be around very much longer! The pictures at the hotel turned out amazing:)",1,0,0

My god, I've never seen a hotel that just mixed everything I've always wanted in the same place.

1.  Modern amenities, yet staying classy? Check.
2.  A ridiculously fantastic room with an awe-inspiring view? Check.
3.  Great service? YEP.
4.  Top-class food? Check.
5.  Best nightclub in Las Vegas? SUPER CHECK.

It's hard for me to really describe the hotel with regards to the way it looks.  Quite simply though, the Cosmo has ""IT.""  Somehow, it combined a ultra contemporary design with the classiness of a Wynn\/Encore but amazingly without the overt pretentiousness.  Sometimes, I feel like rolling into Wynn or Encore that if I'm not a balla, I really have no business being there.  In contrast, even with how nice the Cosmo is, you never feel like the hotel is too good for you at any moment you're in it.

The rooms...yeah, they may be a little overpriced compared to other Vegas hotels.  But come on, you in VEGAS son.  You come to Vegas, you gotta roll deep as hell and get a room worth rollin deep for.  Terrace Suite is...wow.  You get what you pay for, I will say as much as that.  The hotel's ultra contemporary\/modern design carries over into the rooms.  What else?  TWO bathrooms (very convenient when you have guys\/girls staying together).  A freaking oven and washer\/dryer (yeah, I know the Cosmo was designed for condos originally, but I'm still shocked they kept it around).  Two huge HDTVs (not that anyone's staying in the room all day, but hey at least it's nice to have).  Oh, and that unfettered view of the Bellagio fountains....yeah, I think you could do worse for views.  Quite frankly, you are getting great value for money.

Also love the phones in the room.  It seriously makes getting help pretty much as dumbproof as you can get.  Every time I called for a request (TV system needed resetting, extra towels, needed maid service), it was promptly answered.  Not just that, but they called back to confirm everything went well.  That's called giving a damn, and I appreciate it.

Food.  All you need to know is STK, Wicked Spoon Buffet, Holstein's, Secret Pizza.  All I'll say for now, since I'll drop my knowledge on that later, is that you will not run out of options for cheap food, top-class food, and anything in between.  Again, you honestly never feel out of place here because there's always something affordable if you want it.

And Marquee, I'll save the details for my Marquee review.  But I will say this: BEST CLUB EVER.

Yeah, I'm never staying anywhere else again if I'm on staying on the Strip.


P.S. I could've upgraded to the Wraparound Terrace Suite for $100 total (for two nights).  Kinda wish I did, but I needed to see the smaller version first.

P.P.S. The greatest thing about that phone is the ""Lights Off"" and ""Lights On"" options.  Lights Off is self-explanatory, and makes my life a HELL of a lot easier.  Lights on though?  It's great to bomb people in the morning when they're all hungover. :P

P.P.P.S. Do NOT underestimate how clutch it is to be able to WALK TO THE CLUB BECAUSE IT IS IN YOUR HOTEL.  This right here probably saves you at LEAST $40-$50 in cab fare, and I don't even know how much of a price you can put on the time saved.  Oh, and for whatever (insert reason here) to bounce early?  I'd say it's a bit easier to walk back to the room than wait in a massively long line at 4 AM for a cab.  And having Secret Pizza in the same hotel that Marquee is at?  I mean, this isn't even fair at this point.  Just bow down man.",5,5,5

WiFi and cellphone signals always work great in my rooms here whenever I stay here which is obviously a big plus! The hotel has plenty of nice restaurants and bars along with an always happening casino area that begs to be conquered. Located in the heart of Las Vegas strip you can't go wrong staying here as you will always be close to the lights and the action.

It is the one place that I feel is elegant and doesn't smell like smoke when you walk into the casinos.  We stayed here for the first time and unfortunately, they sent us to a room that was occupied.  They promptly rectified the situation and upgraded our room to a room overlooking the Bellagio fountains with a balcony.  I loved the room.  It was beautiful, with a large couch, air tub,and large shower.  It seems like the hallways were a bit dirty, but maybe it is just the color of the carpets.  The gym was great.  I just wish they had more than one sit down breakfast place.  And if you haven't heard of the ""secret pizza place"", find it.  Their Italian sausage and pepperoncini pepper pizza was the best I've had and I felt like I was back in Manhattan.  Hopefully I will be back at the Cosmo very soon.  

PS-I would have lost my shit if we didn't get a room that we already paid for (as another reviewer mentioned).  That is a total d*ck move.

I had two free nights at the Southpoint but I REALLY wanted to stay @ the Cosmo. My cousin decided to look it up on her phone and told me a night's stay was $50 cheaper than when I previously checked. We decided to book a night there but there was a phone glitch and it didn't go thru - TWICE! 

We called in and tried to charge on her debit card. DECLINED. I told her not to panic and used my card instead. It zipped thru. She checked her account and sure enough there were two charges from the Cosmo. She gets back on the phone with them to try to credit it but unfortunately (nice guy) could only credit one charge.

We were like: ""Two tears in a bucket. MotherFvck it!"" We got back to a Vegas state of mind.

So I'm driving my happy ass on and what do I see?! Pinche flashing lights behind me! Balls n Tits!!!!!!

We get pulled over and long story short, po po likes Filipina girls and let's me ride with a warning instead of a speeding ticket!!! Yahoooooo!

The night couldn't get better! Oh wait! But it did!! As soon as we get to Southpoint we end up winning at the penny slots!!! My cousin got her Vegas money back inadvertently.

The next day we spend time gambling. Winning. Eating. Watching. Then it was time to check out then check in at the Cosmo.

We check in and registration guy confirms our room: Wraparound Suite for less than 2 bills. Me and my cuz look at each other and.....squeal. LOL. Registration guy says: ""We apologize for any inconvenience with our online reservation system. Please accept this upgrade to the Wraparound Suite.""

We rush our happy asses thru this beautiful hotel (chandeliers, plush velvet couches, dim mood lighting) to get to the elevators (separate key card to access the floor of your room).

We spot our suite and our breaths are literally sucked out. I shuffle my behind across the room and do what tards do when they're happy (hump everything in site)! (I'm the type that likes to splurge on hotel rooms when I go to Vegas and this room was amazing!)

The terrace view was awe inspiring and the bed was wet dreamy! (best sleep ever in Vegas)

There were 2 bathrooms (both could've fit a rugby team). The freebies were top notch too! The kitchen was better than my kitchen at home! The layout was roomy, comfy and trés chíc!

The front desk agent told me they were aware of the draining issue, which ""happens to most of the rooms."" 

I requested switching to a new room which they agreed. But this time the shower was just as dirty, the bathroom faucets were all crooked, and better yet, there was no water coming out from one of the faucets!

The atmosphere of the place feels upscale similar to the Hard Rock Hotel but not ritzy like the Wynn or Bellagio. I like the variety of restaurants available of which many I'd like to try out.,0,0,0

When gambling, I've found that the dealers are the coolest.  They have a sense of humor, and the floormen allow them to have fun with their jobs.  Some other casinos get really strict about if I can be sitting or not, and touching some cards isn't allowed.  I've done everything in the book that gets me yelled at elsewhere.  Cosmopolitan just rolls with it.

The pool is obviously awesome.  It is going to be the hot spot of the summer.  And they drain the pool and have concerts out here... I saw Girl Talk and it was a great venue to be at, other than it was slightly windy and cold.

Oh, and they throw a bunch of different open bars and food events for FREE if you have a players card.  I'm proud to say I got my players card on opening night and have a four digit number.  That's pretty cool in itself, I'm like a founding member!

Room is spacious with a lot of amenities.  Plenty of outlets for electrical devices.  A new thing I have noticed in some hotels, not all, is the USB outlets.  This room had one which I think is great.

The bathroom was spacious.  The shower on one side and the toilet on the other side of the sink.  Very specious bathroom.  The sliding door to close the bathroom is also the door to the closet where the safe is.  The shower is spacious and can be viewed in the room.  A good thing or bad thing depending on whom you're sharing the room with.

Bed was very comfortable.  Pillows were a little on the hard side but comfy.  My room had a nice view overlooking the Bellagio and the strip.  

The facility has 2 pools which were really nice.  One pool overlooks the Strip.  There are plenty of places to lay out.

The rooms were built to be condo units so have mini kitchens, sitting area, oversized bath and balconies.  The balcony is pretty cool and rare in Vegas.

Exactly two years ago, my husband proposed to me at the Cosmopolitan  during Thanksgiving week and our experience was fabulous.  It was so fabulous that we returned for a few nights during our honeymoon in July 2016.  The stay was still fabulous.  This summer we decided to return to the Cosmopolitan during Thanksgiving week 2017 and bring my husband's adult children with us in order to create some fun, blended family bonding.  

Mistake #1: we talked SO highly of the Cosmopolitan, that we set an expectation.  Since we are Marriott Rewards members, we check in through the autograph lounge. Through our rewards program we were told we'd receive an upgraded room, however, we were sent to a room in the Chelsea Tower with a view of the back of Aria.  (I later learned that they will be renovating the Chelsea Tower... thanks for the upgrade to an old room, Cosmopolitan!) I normally would not care which room we were in, but compared to my other stays, THIS time the hotel (and more specifically the room) was showing signs of wear and tear.  We had trouble with lighting, surfaces were dirty, the carpets were nasty, there was a cigarette butt that sat in a decorative dish near the elevators for almost the entire week, and TWICE housekeeping skipped us and we had to call for service.  Ultimately, the hotel was NOT the same.  

Mistake #2: We hyped up the buffet @ the Wicked Spoon, which we planned for Thanksgiving because it WAS so good!!! It is not a cheap buffet.  It has always been fabulous.  What the heck is going on Cosmopolitan????? We waited in line (got there early) and as the hostess was seating us we were told we had a 1.5 hour time limit!  Seriously???? Pay $$$, shove it down your throat & get the hell out.  That's how I felt.  We hadn't even eaten yet and the experience was ruined.  As for the food, it was OK.  Most of it was lukewarm at best. Other than some turkey at the carving station and a big blob of dry stuffing, there was nothing special for Thanksgiving selection.  

The overall atmosphere and energy at the Cosmopolitan was less than stellar.  There also seemed to be a lot of chaos in the hotel.  There were children screaming, running around, doing cartwheels in common areas, whipping balls at the art collections that are hung near the ballrooms.... I am outraged that hotel staff did NOTHING.  It is unfortunate because this hotel used to be awesome!!! Are you trying to become the next Excalibur?  

As someone who has been traveling to Vegas for 25 years, I can only hope that the Cosmopolitan pulls it together or they will surely be losing a lot of business.  There are MANY other hotel options on the strip that are willing go the distance to keep you coming back.  We walked through Bellagio several times and no such nonsense was happening.
Additionally, a $150 per night 'hold' on a credit card for any 'incidentals' ON TOP OF the hotel charge is outrageous.  What about my incidentals??? And what exactly are you appraising at $150 per night when you are allowing your decor to be used as ash trays and children to use your common spaces as their own ballpark?",0,0,0

Last weekend, a group of us decided to come to Las Vegas to celebrate my best friend's bachelorette party, and everyone kept telling me that the Cosmopolitan was the place to be. Being that three of us were coming from Vancouver, and two were flying in from Toronto, we had booked two separate rooms. When the three of us Vancouver gals arrived, we asked the front desk if it would be possible to have adjoining rooms so that we could stay close together. The super friendly check-in agent did us one better and offered us a spectacular two-bedroom, three bathroom suite on the 45th floor overlooking the Bellagio fountains. At only $200 extra a night (or $40 per person) how could we say no?

When we arrived at our room, we were all astounded at how beautiful it was. The decor was tasteful (as it was in the entire hotel), and with the bathrooms having double sinks it made it incredibly easy for all five of us to get ready each day without worries about bathroom hogging, etc. The bathrooms each had walk-in showers and deep, soaker tubs that were ultra-luxurious. Everything was clean and fresh-looking, which is great for me since I tend to be a little neurotic about hotel cleanliness.

When it came time to (sadly) check-out, I was a little worried about the wait times, as I had heard countless stories from friends about them having to wait an hour in Sunday check-out lines in Vegas hotels. I was astounded when we were checked out in less than two minutes, and the kind staff let us keep our hotel room keys as souvenirs. Overall, you can hotel that the Cosmopolitan Hotel has spent a lot of time perfecting the small details that make a good hotel a great one. If you're looking to stay in a beautiful, well-designed and non-cheesy hotel on the best part of the Strip, the Cosmopolitan is the place to be.",3,1,1

If you are not tattooed with sleeves, or if you can string an entire sentence together without the word ""like"" or ""f*ck"", you are not the target market here. 

On first glance, the room was beautiful the decor was well thought out and we were excited. But as we wnt to sleep, a light randomly turned itself on twice, as did the jacuzzi bathtub. Also, when we turned on the fan in the bathroom the stench of cigarette smoke was nauseating. These are 100% non-smoking rooms...supposedly. 

Housekeeping was very nice and changed the air filter in our bathroom, and we unplugged our lamps. 

We had a nice day of pool and dinner (Scarpetta is 5-star).  

On our second night the stench of cigarettes from the hallway was ridiculous. I call downstairs and security said they were going to send someone up to break up the ""in hallway party"" but nobody ever came. To make matters worse, they had a ""dive in movie"" playing outside and the sound was so loud it was louder than our TV. No sleeping with that. It was a double feature: with the first movie at 730 and the second movie starting at 10 p.m.  I found this information by talking to the operator and when I said it was so loud no one can sleep here his only response was ""the movie ends somewhere around midnight.""

The Cosmopolitan is my favorite casino and it's absolutely breathtaking! It's a good mix of modern & classy as you can see from the outside and the inside. I love the views as I go up and down the elevators and there is even a separate chandelier floor (floor 1.5) where they have a bar.

The drink service here at the casino is among the best that I've experienced, ever. The drinks come promptly and the cocktail waitresses are so nice and come around frequently enough. In other casinos the drinks come around slowly and makes me wonder if it's ever coming, not the case here.

Floor 2 is the location of the Marquee Nightclub, which is arguably one of the hottest nightclubs in Las Vegas right now. I've never been inside but I heard great things about Marquee. If you're into Electronic Dance Music (EDM) as I am, they have famous DJ's come and play here depending on the event.

Floor 3 they have a lounge area where you can play billiards for free which is an awesome deal if you ask me. I love hanging out here and playing billiards with the random people that I meet in this area. If you want a quick bite to eat there is a secret pizza place which is located in the narrow alley, they serve some awesome pizza. You'll just have to go there to experience it.

I travel a ton and have stayed at hotels all over the world.  They've ranged from 2-star to 5-star and my experience at the Cosmopolitan was absolutely an incredible 5-star.  To start off, you enter the hotel with a huge dramatic sign (COSMOPOLITAN) letting you know exactly where you are.  The main lobby is full of LCD screens with changing graphics that add to the glamor of the hotel.  The rooms were amazing - I believe they all have balconies and ours looked over the LV strip, which was amazing.  The room itself is HUGE!  It was basically a suite with a  separate living room, changing area, comfortable bedroom and a huge bathroom, which included a big tub that also looked-out over the strip.  There are two LCD TVs in the room and the entire thing is decorated with chic furniture.

The amenities at the hotel are crazy - 3 pools (including the very chic Marquee Dayclub), the Marquee Nightclub, a handful of lounges\/bars, fantastic restaurants, great shopping, an incredible fitness center and plenty of space for meetings\/conventions.  The entire hotel is decked-out in modern, yet ornate furniture and artwork that really makes a statement.  While most hotels have a bit more of a traditional feel, The Cosmopolitan definitely was more cutting edge.

As most teenagers I promised myself that as soon as I'd turn 21 I would head over there and party the night away. For one reason or another 21 came and went and I never made it there... that is until this year!

With so many different hotel options it can be a little overwhelming to choose where to stay in Las Vegas. We knew we wanted something right on the strip that would allow us to explore without the need for transportation. Our main hotel choices were the Vdara, the Aria, the Palazzo, and the Cosmopolitan. After much debating and a thorough evaluation of the TripAdvisor reviews we decided to go with the Cosmo. 

We flew from Bellingham via Allegiant Air and we arrived to Vegas at around 10am and ended up getting to our hotel close to 11am. The Cosmopolitan is stunning from both the outside and the inside. Its location on the strip is enviable as it has the Bellagio Fountains on one side, the Paris and Planet Hollywood in front of it, and the super luxurious Crystals mall on the other side.

The lobby at the Cosmopolitan is very high tech in comparison to the rest of the hotel lobbys in Vegas. As soon as you enter the hotel's main floor you'll be greeted by glass columns that have screens inside of them that display ever-changing art sets. The different art sets completely alter the mood of the lobby - amongst some of the displays we saw were flowers, books, fish, lines, and my favourite of them all, naked models inside of columns full of steam (shown below and in more detail on this blog). If you enjoy art and a contemporary hotel feel you won't be disappointed staying at the Cosmo.

One word of advice when it comes to the check-in process - the line ups can be extremely long at around 11am (the time we got there) as people are checking in and out at around the same time and even though the hotel offers express checkout many of the guests are reluctant to use it. If your flight arrives at around 10am like ours did, you'd be better to go out for breakfast or lunch first and then register at the hotel afterwards. In terms of our room, we originally got a Terrace Studio but when we got there we were asked if we wanted to upgrade to a Terrace Studio with Fountain Views for approximately $30 more per night. Since this was our first time in Las Vegas we decided to go for the upgrade and I am very glad we did. The views on our studio suite were out of this world - we could literally sit in our balcony and watch the Bellagio Fountains show.

My hubby and I made the following video to showcase the suite in a bit more detail. Hope you enjoy it: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WlssJPWfkko&feature=plcp

Another great aspect of The Cosmopolitan is the fact that it has three different pools, all with different moods and landscaping. My favourite pool was the one at The Marquee. The Marquee is a very exclusive day club and night club in Las Vegas - the entry cover fee is usually $40 per day but Cosmopolitan guests get in for free by showing their room key and ID - a huge perk! The Marquee has high energy DJ music playing on the background, a nice pool in the middle and some VIP cabanas along the edges of the club which come equipped with a private mini pool. If you go to the day club make sure to order a Surfside - it has some delicious tropical flavours that will keep you coming back for more!

If you happen to be a Foursquare user you may actually benefit from checking-in at the Cosmo. First of all follow The Cosmopolitan on Foursquare and then check-in at three different categories of venues at the resort to unlock a special Cosmopolitan badge which will get you VIP entry access to Wicked Spoon - their world renown buffet.

Having never been to Vegas before we were a little unsure as to what shows to watch and how to get a good deal on the tickets for them. Luckily enough one of my co-workers had mentioned to me that some kiosks along the strip sell discounted tickets for shows playing the same night. Sure enough we found a Tix4Tonight booth across the street from our hotel. We did end up getting a pretty good deal on the tickets and we also got some discounts on dinner options. In terms of the shows, we decided to watch Le Reve and The Phantom Of The Opera. You will not be disappointed with either of these shows but my personal favourite was Le Reve - a show in which dancers and acrobats come in and out of a huge water pool in the middle of the stage. 

In terms of shopping I would highly recommend making a trip to both The Fashion Show Mall and The Premium Outlets - they both have tons of quality stores and you can find great deals literally everywhere. In terms of dining my favourite restaurant was Taqueria Cañonita - featuring contemporary mexican fusion cuisine with views of the Venetian water canals.

The decor is absolutely beautiful (more upscale and trendy than some of the other hotels). They did a great job using the latest technology to accommodate their guests. For example, iPads at the check-in counter to browse and sign your name. In the rooms, everything (such as a\/c and lighting) can be controlled on the TV. The bed is also super comfortable. My only complaint is that the walls are super thin. I was able to hear guys next door goofing around all hours of the night. If it wasn't for them, I could have slept like a baby. I guess my fault for not bringing ear plugs but luckily they checked out the second day. =)

The property has a different atmosphere than the other popular hotels like Bellagio, Venetian, or Wynn. First of all, everywhere you turn, you are bound to see beautiful people wandering around. You know how when you go to places like Bellagio and you see older, touristy people? Well, there was really none of that at the Cosmopolitan. Just young, hot people who were there to party it up. Make sure you bring your hippest, sexiest clothes. You do not want to feel ""under dressed"", trust me.  

The only time my husband and I had to leave the hotel was to shop. I can honestly say the Cosmopolitan had everything so that we didn't have to leave. Restaurants, bars\/lounges, and the fabulous nightclub, Marquee. Good times! Can't wait to go back!

While admittedly, most newer hotels on the LV strip are top notch, The Cosmo definitely appeals to the more contemporary and under 45 crowd. 

The decor, amenities and location are everything you could ask for and more. Loved the 4th floor pool area (Westside Tower) a bit more than the Bamboo pool (Eastside). At check in, we received an upgraded room in the Westside Tower (strip side) with a sunken tub and separate shower. The 69th floor room was so nice that it made leaving out quite the challenge. 

Check in for Gold and Platinum members involves a much shorter wait time (ask a floor rep for details) and the complimentary bottles of water is a welcomed treat especially during summer months. There is also a private concierge agent who helped us score great seats for the Cirque  de Soleil Michael Jackson One show. 

Valet Parking is free and is located just off the strip on the Eastside of the property. There is also a designated area to the left of the Eastside entrance doors for rideshare (Uber\/Lyft) pick ups. 

The only problem during our stay was there was one elevator working in our Tower at check in and the cushion in our balcony furniture was quite stained and not a match for the set.",8,3,5

It's conceptually sexy, chic and well-rounded.  The customer service has been exceptional in my experience for  2 consecutive vacations. I'm embarrassed at how domestic I've become while also admitting that I barely left the hotel for the duration of my stay. The Chandelier bar is great for people watching. Now, que the Sia track and imagine Shia Lebouf interpretive dancing in his underwear and that's precisely how vegas makes me feel. I spent several hours giggling and watching many a drunk men do unusual mating rituals at this watering hole. It was highly entertaining.  I had a jacuzzi tub and the east tower has a spectacular view.

The only thing I didn't like was The Wicked Spoon . That begs the question: Is a buffet ever a good idea? My tummy says, ""No"".",5,2,2

If you don't want to walk on carpet that looks 500 years old while enjoying MODERN decor\/cuisine\/nightlife\/slots\/games etc...then this is the place for you! We have stayed here several times and each time gets better and better.

* There are unique and brand new slots
* A lot of rooms come with kitchens as a lot of rooms were initially meant to be sold rather than rented as a hotel room
* You can become a VIP gambling client after only a few days of staying with the hotel (not by playing slots really but if you play card games and for example play roulette at $200 a hand at times, adds up quick)
- No poker room
- If you gamble high limit, they definitely take advantage and switch the dealer\/you mysteriously start loosing after you play hundreds of dollars a hand so I wouldn't advise gambling here...I know that Vegas have ""cheaters"" that are professional people who are hired by the casinos to cheat the clients but here it's like a DUH moment where you just KNOW that they are doing this...other casinos it's not AS obvious...

--Lodging Accommodations:

**I stayed here for the first time back in October for my birthday, and we were lucky enough to snag one of their Wraparound Terrace Suites. Our party of 5 stayed comfortably in this suite, but we also added on a surprisingly comfortable roll-away. The room was obviously super luxurious, with 2 full baths, and a reasonably-sized kitchen with bar, microwave, freezer\/refrigerator (tooootaaalllyyyy stuffed our liquor in these), etc.  The living area had a dining table for 4, coupled with a perfect wraparound (trend much...?), sectional couch that can sleep 2 smaller-stature people. The separate bedroom has the most glorious bed you will ever experience...like, ever (shout-out, T-Swift). I know that ""sleeping on a cloud"" is the cliche expression, but this is precisely what it felt like. We fit 2-3 on this each night (er...morning, technically), and 4 actually wasn't even that bad. And, of course the 500 sq. ft. terrace is the perfect touch on this suite-- there are 3 separate sliding doors surrounding the suite that all open up to the terrace.
TIP: We stayed in the West Tower with a gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountains. Some people may balk at the WT because it ""isn't right on the Strip,"" but trust me, if you have a fountain view: GET THE WEST TOWER. Why, you may ask? Well, the east tower's north face has the Bellagio Bell-tower\/clock right in front of it; and, starting early in the morning, all you will hear every hour is GOOONGGGG, GONNGGGGGGGGG by the bell slamming around. Kiss that minimal amount of uninterrupted sleep good-byeeee. Our other friend with us had a Terrace One-bedroom in the East Tower and voiced her dismay with the loud bell-tower. 

**My sister and I recently stayed in just their basic City Room over Thanksgiving break and were just as impressed. Very well-appointed rooms and MUCH nicer than Bellagio, which is typically more expensive! 
FINAL NOTE: For lodging, don't hesitate to pick the Cosmo, even their most basic room. Gorgeous rooms with awe-inspiring views, luxurious bathrooms (oxymoron...?--maybe, but you know what I mean), and the best.beds.ever.

**SUPREME LOCATION. I don't know of anything else that can top The Cosmo for their prime location; with Bellagio right to the north and CityCenter south, you'll have all you need. Caesar's isn't too far, either (just north of Bellagio).

--Gaming

**If you aren't a gambler, then this will be pretty irrelevant for your desires to stay here. However, this is unequivocally my favorite casino on the strip...and for a plethora of reasons! 
1) Machines to suit any player's palette. Several machines have competitive progressives. I last saw a $1 video poker machine at a progressive amount of $5,900 (normal payout=$4000 for a Royal Flush).
2) The dealers and pit bosses I have encountered have been typically friendly and personable. One of the last pit bosses I had, Barry, was probably the most congenial pit boss I've encountered. 
3) I really like their Identity Players' Card system. Mostly for the fact that for every $1 you spend in the resort (spa, lodging, food & bev), you get 5 points! That's like $5 for every $100 spent. I'll take my 5% resort credit all daaay e'ry day. 
4) Very neat roulette tables-- whichever number hits, all outside bets (and the given number) legitimately LIGHT UP on the table. This is a very nice feature for the beginning roulette player. 
5) Well-lit, well-ventilated casino floor. It's right behind Wynn\/Encore for smoke ventilation. 

--Bars & Restaurants

**I either have current reviews for some places in the Cosmo (Book & Stage being one of them: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/book-and-stage-las-vegas#hrid:uoTNNE0o67_BUiBRyUgNdw) or plan to write additional reviews (we have enjoyed D.O.C.G Enoteca and Scarpetta). The third floor has various fab dining options, and don't forget about the Secret Pizza for that late-night, post-Marquee, post-booze food! Speaking of Marquee...

--Nightclub Scene: MARQUEE

**Marquee Nightclub is going to be my next review, complete with tips (especially for us guys-- nightclubs love to nickel & dime us!) and handy-dandy info. For a true nightclub experience, Marquee will have you covered. Stand-by for that review!

Also a perfect location on the strip. Honestly, we only left this place a couple times. Once to go to a different pool party (wet republic). But you really don't have to leave this hotel once you're there. Their pool party (marquee) was the highlight of my trip (A better scene than wet republic too). We were partying in one of those private cabanas with the infinity pools. The guys & girls bringing the booze to us were great- always making sure we were having a great time and very professional. There are TONS of restaurants right in the hotel too. Both expensive and extremely casual. And their nightclub, marquee, was also a great time.

My room choice of the night for my stay was the Wrap Around Terrence suite. Located on the 38th floor, which I believe was the top of the tower on the west side of the strip. My photos speak for themselfs, I loved every second of being in that room.

With the arrivals of 3 V.I.P yelpers...
(Anthony N, Stefany C, and myself.. Jessica A) We definitely had the red carpet rolling once we stepped in the most...Elegant, Sophisticated, Most Newest Luxurious Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.

Words cannot even describe the beauty that this commercial establishment represents. I felt Kashmir, I felt Gucci, I felt... like the world belonged to me (exactly almost what the word Cosmopolitan means)

The hotel was absolutely stunning. Goodbye Sahara, New York New York, Caesar's Palace,  Flamingo, Rio, heck even Planet Hollywood or the Hilton. The next generation of hotels have arrived.   Once my friends arrived I literally mistakened the lobby for an airport.  The desks; the attendants (I mean front desk people); were all airport bound.  
My favorite part of the whole hotel? Everything was almost touchscreen.  Billboards; side menus; maps of the area ( like a mall telling you ""You Are Here"" ) was touch screen. Think about a human sized iphone against the walls and all you have to do is swipe...
:

As Anthony N. stated; The Cosmopolitan originally was set to be a residential place, but they converted it into a hotel\/casino. Rooms differ with space and price ranges. Note to self : Very Pricey.

Our free room ended up to be : The King Terrace Bedroom.
Room was gigantic. Heck I think it was bigger than my apartment.  Kitchen equipped; living room furnished, 2 LED touch screen tvs from LG; a computer desk room; a king sized bedroom with an amazing balcony sight over viewing Vegas; and last but not least.. a full sized bathroom equipped with a built in jacuzzi.

The hotel has two towers : Eastside and Westside. Variety of elegant bars and outstanding pool areas (many to choose from and are equipped with games and screen tvs for your viewing pleasures)
The nightclub is opened from Thursday-Sunday, you have many restaurants to dine in at, and of course shopping areas. Basically think of this.. as a fine 5 star walk-in mall. 

Cosmo offers the Sahara Spa, Gym, Bars, Pools, Lounges, Game Rooms, HIDDEN pizzeria for those late night outs ;) , Marquee Nightclub, Amazing Casino on 1st Floors, and eminent customer service. Their employees are there to help all your needs ;)

Restaurants: Tried Holsteins and Wicked Spoon Buffet (see separate reviews).  Good.

Casino:  Loved the vip treatment.  I was never short a drink as I played into the wee hours and sometimes made a little money.

**my one complaint is I left a NICE pair of sunglasses in my room when we checked out.  I called from the cab and was transferred to a voicemail upon which I left a detailed message.  I hear no response and called again to be transferred to someone in security who's exact words at that time ""I could do that but I am not going to""  WTF?  I simply asked him to inquire per the person who cleaned our room that day.  He refused.  I called again and got supposedly the man in charge.  He apologized profusely.

Access to the strip is very easy, with walk ways connecting the hotel directly to Wallgreens and adjacent restaurants and casinos. I happened to have a room that had a great view of the Bellagio fountain, Paris tower, etc. Additionally, the hotel keys and flat screen TVs all add a personal touch by having the guests name on the screen \/ key. Lastly, the hotel has many well rated restaurants, shops, clubs and bars conveniently located. The one thing that keeps this hotel from being a 5-star hotel is that the rooms do not come equipped with coffee makers and complementary coffee.  Coffee is a must have in my book. For being such a beautiful and new hotel, you would think that adding coffee maker in each room would be no big deal.

This place is stunning.

Even the valet driveway sparkles. The Lobby looks like a high-tech glam music video with it's computerized plasma screen pillars that has ever changing artwork. The five story chandelier dripping with crystal with a lounge\/bar inside of it was where I spent half my Vegas money. 

I was fortunate enough to discover a free wine tasting that takes place every Saturday afternoon we met the hotel sommelier.  Before leaving I asked if there was anything else we should see and he insisted ""before you leave you MUST go see the pool.

The Pool? It was January! I wasn't in a pool state of mind. I'm so glad we went. The pool is amazing and in the summer months I can only imagine that this will THE place to be seen on the strip.

The Boulevard pool over looks the strip. Most of the expansive pool is about 2 feet deep and furnished with loungers in the water. There is a bar of course and a play area equipped with ping pong tables, pool tables and pinball machines. The covered patio area has a wall of flat screens where you can lounge on a squishy soft sofa and recline while watching the game. It definitely has a pool party atmosphere...but if you want to relax...go up to the 14th floor on the west tower where the Bamboo pool is. It's quiet, zen, just as beautiful and you can hear yourself think.

Before you leave register for a free players card called Identity. It's not just for gamblers. Every single dollar you spend at the hotel whether it's for the spa, food, drinks, gaming or anything else goes towards rewards.

They really try hard to capture the essence of Vegas by theming up the place with modernized looks from the 60's and their James Bond themed bars. There are actually 2 Bond bars, the Vesper Bar and the James Bond Bar itself.  They also have their famous Chanelier Bar, with a gi-normous chandelier hanging down 3 entire floors with bars built around them.  It's really a beautifully designed casino inside, the public area's lounges and walkways have a sleek, colorful design that remind me of the 1960's but touched up to look modern.  There are several restaurants on the top floor that are impressive (Holsteins Burger joint has foie gras burgers!) including STK, Rose Rabbit Lie and the hidden pizza joint.  Their main attraction, though, is the Wicked Spoon which is my favorite buffet place.

I've stayed here twice now, the first time on a Tues I upgraded to a suite and it was incredible!  The room was entirely automated with 2 bathrooms and a jacuzzi bath in the master, the room controlled by the TV (temperature, lights, music) as well as washing machine and a view of the Bellagio fountains on the patio, so you can here the music in the open air as well.

Valet is FREE so be sure to take advantage of that option with the ability to call your car 24\/7. If you choose to use the bell hop, we were told it would be about 45 minutes so we decided to pass.

The city room with two queen beds was pretty spacious and had a nice view. The bathroom was a decent size as well. My only qualm was the sliding door for the bathroom...you could pretty much hear everything that was going on inside. There was also spilled wine all over the bathroom door from former patrons. Other than these small hiccups, the room proved to be spacious, clean and comfortable.

I also like the convenience of the hotel..housing not only a delicious buffet (The Wicked Spoon) but also the ever popular Marquee. Folks staying in the hotel also get free entrance to the club.

HOWEVER, a regular of the Wynn, Aria, Bellagio, and even Venetian, this place feels like its trying to be something its not. The clientele is a bit trashier, the service is a bit less warm, and the food selection isn't as robust as the others that I've mentioned. 

The best thing about this hotel are the balcony-equipped rooms, although not all rooms have balconies. I felt the beds are as nice as the Wynn's which are my favorite beds. Their suites are also much more comfortable than the regular rooms.

Their toiletries that come with the room are also top notch. 

This hotel definitely has a boutiquey feel. Their crowd is a bit younger and I hear their club, marquee, is the hottest club in Vegas at the moment, but it still feels like a hotel that is trying too hard to be hip, a second rate hotel masquarading as top notch one.

So, my final diagnostic is that its a nice hotel, but if you're looking for a classier crowd in a place that pays attention to the details, the Wynn is where I'd recommend.",7,0,1

I have never driven into a valet and\/or parking garage and had my mouth drop open in Awe!  The Cosmo did that for me!  I continued to walk around in a cloud of disbelief that this hotel could offer everything Vegas stands for.

Two things stand out about this property....
1. It has a 3 story chandelier in the main lobby.  Over 3 million crystals hang from this breathtaking masterpiece.  Not to mention the spiral staircase that flows through the middle of the chandelier leading guests to one of the bars that sits within the chandelier!  I have never been in the middle of such a work of art.
2. The rooms at The Cosmo have terraces.  This is unheard of on the Las Vegas Strip!  Take full advantage of cocktails on the patio overlooking this great city.  All the rooms are suites so I don't think you will be disappointed.  It's worth every penny and then some!

We didn't stay here, but popped into the casino on Friday night and hit the buffett on Saturday (See my review for Wicked Spoon...awesome). We stopped in to check out another casino and instantly knew it wasn't our vibe. It was very hip and trendy, which is okay, just not my thing. Nobody really seemed to be playing the machines, it was more about being seen at the bars and whatnot. They did have a cool live perfomer that was doing a realy upbeat violin type performance that was really cool, but that was the only thing we enjoyed. Not a huge fan of the casino, but the buffet on the other hand is what makes it worth it.",2,0,0

::::: TERRACE ONE BEDROOM - 4\/5 :::::

We were here for a company trip - specifically, for team building and a little competitive analysis (or something), which makes sense for a mobile social gaming start-up.... right?

Beautiful room, though it seems rather small once you've stayed at the Wraparound Terrace Suite. I'd say size-wise and layout-wise, it's comparable to the standard king room at the Encore. 

There's a sofa bed in the living room, which makes sharing a room with 2 other people possible. Also, I LOVE the balcony w\/the wicker lounger..

::::: WRAPAROUND TERRACE SUITE - 5\/5 :::::

The Wraparound Terrace Suite was incredible. I booked it for my birthday trip, which we celebrated the night before (for the countdown to 12am) in a private cabana overlooking the Strip at the Surrender in the Wynn, where Sultan & Ned Shepard were playing.

There's a bar, a sitting area, 2 bathrooms, a gorgeous tub where my husband prepared a bubble bath for me on my birthday, and two wicker loungers outside, one for each side of the L-shaped balcony.

So far, of all the hotels I've stayed at in Vegas, I'd say this is easily my ULTIMATE FAVORITE. But ONLY if you're staying in one of the SUITES & manage to find it for less than $250\/night. Based on the candid pictures and descriptions by some of my family, Cosmopolitan's standard City Room looks cramped and basic for Vegas standards.

___________________________________

NOTE: I've always visited any combination of at least 3 of the following places on each Vegas trip I take, regardless of where I was staying at the time.

::::: PLACES WORTH VISITING AT THE COSMOPOLITAN :::::

* CHANDELIER (Lounge)
           - My first choice for cocktails, conversation, and general lounging in Las Vegas. On four separate occasions, I was still lounging with a friend until they closed the bar and a little beyond sunrise, after which I move to Vesper downstairs - also delish. 
* VESPER (Lounge)
          - The gorgeous tall and tan female bartender w\/short hair makes a kick-ass custom cocktail that includes Rumchata, Nutella, Coffee, Baileys, and Kahlua. YUM.
* WICKED SPOON (Buffet)
           - One of my top 2 buffet picks. Really, this place is unlike any other Las Vegas buffet. They don't only focus on the array of food, but also the quality and flavor in each dish. That's what sets them apart from the many other buffets on the Strip.
* MARQUEE (Club)
           - My favorite club in Las Vegas. Lots of great world-famous DJs play here - I've been here to see Gabriel & Dresden. Although I'm accustomed to clubbing in Jakarta, where I've always had a private table and usually a security guard by our table.. well, when I went to Marquee I didn't book a table (since I was in Vegas with only one friend) and still had a good time. It can get very crowded.
* HOLSTEINS (Restaurant)
           - Spiked milkshakes! Also, the pork belly buns and billionaire burger.
* THE HENRY (Restaurant)
           - Bloody Mary and truffle tater tots..
* SCARPETTA (Restaurant)
           - Foie gras ravioli. I mean, really.",6,3,2

I encountered my first billing issue when for whatever reason the website refused to accept my visa card, but still charged it for the reservation deposit. It took THREE weeks to get it refunded after countless calls and being given the run around. 

Beginning with check in, check in was fast and amazing (I arrived on a summer monday around 5:00 pm) and I was surprised to find out I had been upgraded to the same exact view but instead of a terrace studio ( my original reservation) I received a terrace one bedroom for only $10 extra per night stay. 

The rooms are modern with a city sleek view. They also have some odd amenities because this hotel was supposed to be Condos. My kitchenette had a dishwasher, microwave and quite a bit of empty cabinet space. The bed is VERY comfortable and perfect for when you are dragging back from Marquee nightclub just downstairs at 5 in the morning! The bathroom is what wins it all! The double sink is a required feature for my crew when traveling, but the deep tup with windows facing the Bellagio fountains and mountains was absolutely AMAZING! I recommend a morning bubble bath with a mimosa from the chandelier bar. The terrace is huge and also has a nice seating arrangement set up perfect for smokers and also offers a breathtaking view! 

Check out was a bit of a mess: I used a prepaid debit card, and my room had over used the authorized amount, no biggie. On my way in from the night club I stopped in at check in to switch cards and the woman either didn't listen or didn't know the right answer and I was told that I didn't  need to put up a different card until I was ready to check out. She asked if I was ready and I said no, we still are going to charge breakfast and a couple drinks since we don't leave for awhile. Her response was thats fine just pay the remaining balance at check out, no problem. I get back to my room and my phone is saying I have a message, I call in and she says "" that i have. A balance and need to put up my card, I tell her I was just downstairs and repeated what I was told, and she says ok.  I charge breakfast and a couple drinks to the room with no issue but when I try to go eat at the buffet its an issue. I have to go downstairs and switch cards before we can eat because apparently my 4:30 AM stop wasn't enough! The manager had us on hold up in the mixing bowl forever for an issue I addressed TWICE! Annoying.....
Other than the front desk customer service I would recommend this hotel. The view is just breathtaking and no rival hotel can offer you a better view!! Make sure to plan some time to explore the hotel, it has awesome food selections and Marquee is a blast! This is NOT a gambling hotel from what I hear and saw!",0,0,0

Single\/double-deck blackjack here pays only 6-to-5 on blackjack, but that seems to be fairly prevalent in Vegas these days.  Somebody commented after my trip that this was supposedly where the beautiful people went, at which I chuckled awkwardly in response and secretly congratulated myself for surviving a week in disguise.  I certainly won't complain about the human shrubbery (er... I mean, scenery), but it didn't strike me as more beautifully peopled than other comparable resorts in Vegas, maybe more monied.

The abstract:  I stayed here for nearly a week and had a great time:  it is a very nice base camp in Vegas.  I came here to celebrate my brother's birthday and stayed a few more days with a friend.  It was kind of a personal challenge to see if I could endure a week in Vegas.  I not only survived but ended up having a great time.  Yes, I came to Vegas to relax.  Yes, I challenged myself to relax in Vegas.  Yes, I am a strange one.

At first I was not super impressed:  I was surprised by some minor wear and tear (small carpet stains or furniture wear) in my Terrace Suite -- which is why I am docking a star, but that's being quite picky and partly due to a personal resolution to not become Five-Star Man.  But over the course of the week, I really came to appreciate the hotel (it is beautiful), the room (brunch on a balcony overlooking the Bellagio is great a way to relax), the spa, and the little clothing boutiques (I normally avoid shopping but found some time to get fitted).

Good:  cool bars within the casino (Bond and Chandelier are my picks), beautiful spa with excellent masseuse pairing (female, strong hands, pleasant looking enough to touch my body but no chance of attraction), good people watching, clothing boutiques are nice (I liked Stitched and All Saints), good customer service, great views of the Bellagio fountain, walking distance to convenience stores like Walgreens for basics.

Annoying:  at a high-end hotel, I was surprised to be charged $15 for Internet access for 2 devices every 24 hours.  I was surprised to be charged by the hour for use of the tennis courts.  Feels ""off"" to be nickle-and-dimed when you are already paying a premium at a ""resort"" that advertises these amenities.

Tips:  dressier than most other casinos on the strip.  Bond is a cool bar and had a Vegas DJ that actually knew how to mix (!!!), playing non-crap house music (!!!).  Chandelier has a nice custom cocktail selection.  Pool areas seem on the smaller side.  Get a room with a view of the Bellagio fountain.  If you are a regular or plan to be one, MGM Resorts seems to have a better loyalty program, but the Cosmo's open balconies are unique and hard to beat if you like having a nice room to chill out.",1,2,0

Came here with two of my girlfriends for a quick summer getaway. The room was not ready under my name because I had borrowed my dad's card to book it. Within minutes, we were comped $100 to the Holstein's restaurant upstairs for food and drinks. We were also given 3 free breakfasts at the Wicked Spoon (which was so freaking good, btw). Holstein's was also amazing. 

The room was really nice and spacious. We had a great view of the strip. We loved the different pools and switched it up everyday at a new one. The hotel had a variety of different restaurants to pick from and we never got bored. The casino was great as well, and we even spotted a few celebrities.

It was clean and gorgeous. The people were fine, the company was fine, I was literally in another world. The glistening jewels of the ceiling decorations came down in pretty droplets as if it was raining crystals, there were translucent drapes lit up by pink and purple dancing across the top. It's safe to say the the decor was impeccable. The people working the front of Marquee at Cosmo was very professional and courteous, since we were on the VIP list we got to the club in matter of minutes instead of waiting in line. So kudos to the employees there!

There's this red stiletto shoe on the first floor that everyone likes to take pictures with and the line to take a photo can get long at least when I was visiting.

I've also wandered the halls of Cosmo and they have a really cool interactive art gallery on one of their floors along with other swanky restaurants that I haven't tried, but the art gallery is definitely a place to take a look at. I also love the fact that they have a lot of chairs for people who are either tired walking around or just want a place to sit and relax and best of all the chairs were very comfortable!

7 Pros:

1.Marque club, good music that night with guest DJ KASCADE
2.The Chandelier Bar was fun
3.Customer Service\/ Room service was good
4.Rooms decorated so nice, it's hard to leave them
5.LOTS of great places to eat- China Poblano was yum!
6.If you are eating strict Paleo, you have a lot of things to choose from
7.Walking around the place is just plain fun : )


3 Cons:

#1.No comforters in the bedroom and the pillows are so soft your head sinks in. Order about 3 pillows. I thought for as much money as we spent, they should have more to offer than a thin hospital cotton blanket, it was a little weird.


#2.The Wicked Spoon Front Desk People & their line. 

Be warned, they don't monitor people taking cuts in line and a few fights almost broke out.   We waited a hour and half in line and got only half way through the line. With 45 minutes until they were supposed to be ""closed."" I I walked to the desk and politely waited for about 5 minutes with no glance in my direction. I finally voiced up and asked what would happen to all the people behind us in line if they closed. Would we be let in? I was rudely responded to as ""No, we will close the doors, unless you are in the Seating line. ""Where's that?"" I asked. She pointed to a second long line behind the main resturant wall."" I walked back in line, like a crazy person and waited still until.....

It felt like seconds later a manager came out to the line to tell everyone that the wait might be another two hours and if they had not paid at the end of the first line, they would not be seated.....


Went to China Poblano.......waited 5 minutes....ate like a queen for the same price.

#3. Security....or lack of it. People get drunk here and get angry, I understand that,  On 1\/15\/11 we walked by and saw A REALLY REALLY crazy woman just throwing punches. Hate to admit this part, but we were gawkers. I was worried that the waiter trying to hold her back was going to get hurt, he definitly took a few punches to the face.

It was already 5 minutes without any people coming in to break it up (even when people were shouting ""Security"") and broke free from him and ran down the hall, litterally punching random passers by that had no idea of what was going on. I ran down the hall after her warning others to watch out. She punched anyone in her way, even women with kids and was screaming about someone taking her clothes. All the while I was shouting ""Security"" along with others. It felt longer than it probably was, but it felt like 20 minutes went by as she crazily ran back and forth down the same hallway screaming and punching at will. Finally a person with a badge came and escorted her outside. It appeared she ran away.

I hoped she recieved the Karma that was coming to her

We arrived at the suite with our apparently pre-programmed keys once we received a text message that the room was ready. Well the keys didn't work and we had to wait in the hallway for 45 minutes for security to open the room for us. Not exactly the best start to our suite experience. Since we had lost that time, I requested a late check out and they rudely explained that their next VIP guest needed the room early so we couldn't get a late check out even though late check out is supposed to work on a first come first serve basis.

You won't be any happier with your room!   I think we paid around $200 a night and that rate also included the buffet at The Wicked Spoon restaurant. The buffet was probably one of the best buffets that I've ever had. 

Every part of our stay at The Cosmopolitan was a lesson in great customer service.  It's a well run establishment that impresses at every turn.  They had quite a large LGBTQ presence in both staffing and guests.  

The pool on the 14th floor was more our speed: mellow and chill. The pool on the 4th floor was energetic and pretty young. It was nice to have a choice!

Every restaurant that we ate in was very good too.  Secret Pizza, DOCG and my favorite---Beauty and Essex.  

Again, our studio was beautiful and overlooking the Bellagio Fountains and Paris just added to the ambiance.

Super chic, i love the purple, silver, and black color theme they have going on. We did the $20 trick and we were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite that had a HUGE living room, comfortable couch and we were even comped with a roll away bed. The Wicked Spoon buffet is my new favorite buffet in Vegas... their desserts are to die for. I think all of us had about 3 slices of the strawberry shortcake and the gelato was also top notch.

The main reason why I would recommend this hotel because they were so accommodating and do everything possible to ensure you had a great stay. We had a little mishap with the tub, it overflowed, and didn't realize the bathroom and bedroom are wide OPEN. While someone takes a bath someone can open the blinds from the bedroom and watch them, I guess it's supposed to be sexy but in our case the water overflowed into the bedroom, onto our luggage and left a GIGANTIC wet spot on the hotel floor. Had to call front desk and they sent a huge fan to blow it out for a few hours. When we checked out we were charged $500 in damages, but our lovely lady who checked us in was able to help us out and wrote notes down about the incident. She comped us $50 in credit and the charges were dropped.

We wound up with a Bellagio Fountain View room with a Terrace. Really nice room and amazing view. We also had brunch comped for 2 at the Wicked Spoon every morning. Free Sirius radio in the rooms controlled via a panel next to the bed. Lights and climate can also be controlled this way. The housekeeping was a little off, nothing was dirty but the first time they came the beds still looked like a disaster after they made them. Not a big deal though.

Guests get into Marquee day club free and night club as well excluding Saturdays which is a nice perk. The hotel itself is beautiful, the pools are nice and the location is great. I wouldn't pay rack rate for a room here, but then again I wouldn't pay rack rate for a room anywhere in Las Vegas.

This is a sleek newness to the hotel, with people matching the attire, with a snobbish flair, that is expected from a place that is hip and trendy.  I love the amenities, including an amazing lobby, clean rooms, and pleasantly decent smelling public areas, that aren't filled with smoke.

I love the service, from the first moment, you feel like you are the first class visitor, I love how they were accommodating to my requests, and without any visible expectation anything in return, but a great time.  My friends who came with me, and hung out with me here... it became the go-to place, seemingly, everyone just made it here at some point.  

The Chandelier bar was great, with great drinks, different drinks on each level, and surprisingly great décor.  Henry was a great place to grab lunch\/brunch, and it was delicious fooding.

The special attention to detail is what separates this hotel from the rest.

We gambled here for a little while. The service here is just excellent. They have retail space on the second floor of this hotel. Great place to take some photos. I liked the fact that when I got off the second floor escalator I saw a waiting\/playroom area. Some dudes were casually playing pool in the middle of the floor.

The hotel is so beautifully designed that it's definitely worth the money to stay here. A group of five girls and I were celebrating a friend's 30th birthday and Elizabeth Diaz at the Concierge desk was beyond helpful in making reservations and helping us plan all of our activities before we arrived. You never have to leave the hotel if you don't want to as there are a number of yummy restaurants on premise. I highly recommend STK and the Wicked Spoon. The wait was a bit long at STK, even though we had reservations, but the peppercorn crusted skirt steak with asparagus was well seasoned and definitely worth the hour wait. Wicked Spoon is the buffet on premise and all of the food was so yummy that we had to peel ourselves away from the table!

If you're planning on utilizing the spa I would recommend the Sahra Hammam massage with Joe! Joe was able to work out all of the tightness in my shoulders and alleviate the pain in my lower back caused by our 5 hour plane ride from NYC. Joe applied the right amount of pressure and I would definitely recommend him especially if you carry heavy shoulder bags on a daily basis.

The 3 pools were all beautiful but I would definitely recommend getting there by 10am to grab enough chairs for more than 2 people. (The key is to just place towels on the chairs and just come back after breakfast). 

The Marquee nightclub also seems like the club everyone goes to and it was a lot of fun as well. I would also recommend getting to this line early (before 11am) in order to avoid the $30 cover charge and the hour long wait. The special hotel guest line to get into the Marquee was about an hour wait as well. I don't recommend purchasing any of the club passes on the street as these promoters don't have much pull in getting you into the nightclubs for free after 11p and most clubs don't charge anything before 11p anyway.

The room we got (1428) which is a loft style, with one king bed. 

Pros: The beauty of the hotel\/room, the free admission on Fridays to Marquee with key card to room

Cons: See below.

 
* On April 8, 2011 I reserved via telephone a two bedroom city suite for May 6, 2011 through May 8, 2011.
* On the phone, I immediately prepaid for the first night. 
* I called three times prior to arrival to double check the reservation was still available.
* I arrived at the hotel around 830pm May 6, 2011. 
* I waited 20 minutes in line only to be told my reservation was bumped and went to another person due to the large number of VIPs who had arrived. 
* I repeated that I prepaid for the reservation a $1,000.00 and booked a month in advance.
* I was told there were no rooms available to accommodate me at the Cosmopolitan.
* This discussion went on for 45 minutes as your employees attempted to figure out what to do. 
* I was rendered homeless when I prepaid for a $2,000 suite.
* I was told that in alternative, I can be offered a place at the Venetian. 
* Upon demanding first that arrangements are made at the Venetian another 30 minutes passed. 
* No rooms were available to accommodate us at the Venetian.
* Imagine, after leaving Cosmopolitan I would have discovered this only after going to the Venetian, luggage and all, had I not demanded your employees first check. 
* I finally had enough and stated my demand was to get a suite at the Cosmopolitan. 
* One hour and 45 minutes had passed since I arrived at the hotel. 
* Although at the beginning I was told nothing was available, I was shown a suite, 1428.
* At this point it was past 10pm.
* The suite was full of moths. I was told this would be taken care of.
* Also, I was told two roll away beds would be brought up immediately 
* Moths were never taken care of, albeit multiple requests. 
* The roll away beds arrived at 330am. No, you are not reading that wrong. It took five hours and my fiancé to walk downstairs to the lobby after four calls.
* We agreed to take the suite, because frankly, we would be homeless otherwise since most of the hotels were all booked. 
* Hair dryers in suite did not work. 
* The first night we spent listening to music all night long coming from the Bamboo Pool, well past 4am. No one really slept that night.
* I was extended a credit for food and beverage for two days for $175.
* Upon checking on the credit the second day, I was told no such credit existed. 
* I took two of my companions down to the lobby to discuss this as they were present the previous night during the negotiation. 
* After they confirmed, that the credit was for two nights, I was given a credit. So otherwise I would have been called a liar?!
* There was an accounting mess. My card was overcharged. A manager, Brian and your accountant had to figure it out.
* A hold for $392 was placed on my card. O",7,0,1

I knew the Cosmo would be pretty great but my mind was blown.
When I made my reservation over the phone, the woman who I spoke with was great. She was really helpful and even explained that they had a deal going on that included a $150 gaming and f&b credit. I was sold.
We get to the hotel Sunday at around 11am and the line at the front desk is insanely long. We checked our bags and our bellman told us that we should try to check in early so we went for it. Andrea at the front desk was so friendly even though they were slammed with guests trying to check in. She had no problem checking us into our room at 11:45. 
So we get into our beautiful City View room and I was pretty impressed except for the fact that we had no tub :( the woman I spoke with said we would have a 'Japanese soaking tub'. I was upset but I looked past it and we went down to the Marquee pool party which was so amazing despite the not so great weather. Our bartender Shawna was so sweet and friendly. After a great time at the pool, we went back to the room and I had still been upset about not having a tub and was even willing to pay an upgrade to get a tub in my room. I called guest services and spoke with Danielle Marie. What an amazing girl. I explained the situation about how id wanted a tub and after a few minutes, she had upgraded me, complimentary, to a terrace room just right above our current room! She made me feel like we were the only ones in the entire hotel and was the true definition of hospitable. 

The only reason I give this hotel a 4 starts is because it took the bellman well over 50 minutes to bring us our bags and it took the housekeeping about 45 minutes for new towels :\. Besides that, the hotel was perfect. All the restaurant were fabulous, all the people I spoke with at Identity were very knowledgable and I can not wait to come back!

The Wicked Spoon buffet was amazing and haute cuisine!   It's pure luxury but don't go gamble at 5 in the morning.  I am an early bird and two out of my three mornings there, (granted one being Saturday and one being Sunday) found left over drunk 20 to 30 somethings sprawled everywhere.  Apparently the two night clubs there are the hottest in town, and by the time they close the kids have nowhere to go.  There was a passed out drunk on a 6 seat roulette machine and the only thing security did while I sat there was poke him to see if he woke up.  I was accosted by  2 different drunks each of those days who wouldn't leave me alone.   I finally cashed out and moved to the other side of the casino.  The frustrating piece is you know they are being watched from above, and you know there are security around.  They did nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  
My older 67 year male cousin (I am female) was repeatedly ""bumped"" as he walked the gauntlet of drunks to the casino, from the floor elevators, and finally had to yell at the guy to ""@#$%=off""  
You shouldn't have to pay for that kind of treatment. You could get it free or cheaper many places in Vegas.  The neat little coffee bar is right outside one club, and if you go too early, you might have to step over puke.  Seriously.  Too bad.  The rooms are great and so are the shops and most restaurants. 

As far as good for kids, NO!  The walls have amazing digital art, but there are very full frontal nudes in some of the displays that rotate.  It's cool tho, and looks like they are encased inside a glass pillar as it changes, walking around inside. The room wallpaper is an optical illusion of either just a curvy pattern or two naked women.",0,0,0

I was not able to get the light on over the bed. There was lights on the side that were fine. In addition, the bedroom had a sliding door that separated the bedroom from the living room. This made the room fell larger than 610 sq feet. The bathroom has a water closet for the toilet. The door on it was heavy and I used the trash can to keep it propped open. There were two sinks in the bathroom. Included with the soaps, lotions was a toothbrush and toothpaste. The shower was a glass walk in. I felt the hot water could have been warmer.

After trying out other hotels on the strip, I'd have to say that Cosmo takes the cake. The service is excellent and the staff is always polite. I consider this to be the ""heart"" of the strip. It's a posh hotel located next to Aria and Vdara. You can walk to Crystals or take the tram to other hotels on the strip. You can also enjoy the view of the city through your very own balcony. 

The crystal chandeliers and artwork give this place a hip, luxurious feel. I prefer to stay on the east side so I can easily take the elevators down to the restaurants or Marquee. Trust me, it makes a HUGE difference when you're room is at the same hotel as the club. They also have two pools (Boulevard and Bamboo pool) which turn into ice skating rinks in the winter.

Both the east and west side towers have a gym. The west side tower is next to the spa and has a front desk attendant. The gym is bigger and has a boxing ring, whereas the east side gym is smaller with 24\/7 access using your keycard. Both gyms offer complimentary water and apples.

The rooms are very spacious and you get a lot of amenities. The bathrooms are huge, complete with a shower, hot tub, his and her sink and a separate room for the toilet. The rooms also have a large ""common area"" with a couch, table and tv. Perfect for hosting guests. The beds are very comfortable with plenty of pillows and blankets. There's also small desk space to do work...but are you really going to get work done in Vegas?

The hotel has a decent selection of restaurants including a buffet. I opt for Secret Pizza (the lines get super long during peak times) for a quick bite or Holsteins to get my burger fix. Va Bene Caffe is pricey but a convenient to grab a quick coffee and snack. If you're not in the mood to go clubbing, check out Rose.Rabbit.Lie. They have excellent cocktails and caviar cocktails and live jazz music.

Lastly, if you want off-strip access or plan to cab around to multiple hotels, you may want to consider renting a car. There's tons of great restaurants off the strip. You can rent a car at the airport or make a reservation with an on-site Hertz representative at Cosmo.

So then we had to go back downstairs to wait in line to get our bags.... annoying way to start our trip.

Our room was updated and looked clean. When we booked it said we would have a fridge.... the fridge was completely full with products you have to pay for so I had no place to put my cold food that I brought with me. I called the front desk to complain and they brought up a fridge at no charge. Still... very annoying way to start our trip. 

The rest of our stay at Cosmo was great! Everyone that worked there was very friendly and helpful. The bed was comfy. Room was clean. Great location on the strip. Great restaurants. Amazing views from the pool. My only other complaint is that the room wasn't very noice proof. Many of the other hotels we've stayed at in Vegas have blocked the noise well. We could hear the people next door talking even though they weren't talking very loud. Surprising since this is a newer hotel.",4,1,1

Well since it's my birthday today the guy Kendhal gave a great gift at giving the lovely view. The room is super clean and i love a hotel with plenty of mirrors and this place haves them.

The hotel is nice from the outside, the lobby, and if you're in a suite. The first time I stayed in a regular city room. There were issues that you would not expect 5 star hotel to have. Dust, water stains
 Wires coming out of the lamp. What really got me was the hotel staff. The front desk staff all 3 x were very very rude, and snobby. The valets\/guys at the door did not open the doors for me when I entered or exited on my visits. The only nice hotel staff I could think of was the housekeeper and the bellhop. For what this hotel charges I would definitely expect a higher class of service.  Not a Fremont street hotel. I plan to go to Vegas soon, but I do not think I will give the cosmopolitan a 4th chance or spend that much money at what is best a 3 star hotel. One of the things that really got me was when I cut myself on one of their lamps that had a broken edge on it. The concierge told me that I could not have a band aid for free that I would have to go downstairs and buy it myself. Or I could call security and fill out a claim. Which I did! Absolutely rude. But the security guy was very nice and gave me a darn band aid.",0,0,0

I enjoy that the hotel is still fairly new and that it doesn't stink like an ashtray like many older ones do. 

The rooms are nice and modern with an edgy feel. The wall between the shower and the bathroom is glass so you can lift up the curtain and give a peep show. If you don't get a room with a balcony you will at least get a room with a view of the strip and the gorgeous Fountains of Bellagio.

Perfect, centralized location to be able to walk up and down the strip. Easy to get in and out of the hotel. No confusing entrance or exits. Signs help guide the way. The hotel smells GOOD. Once you walk in, it's a refreshing smell and not smokey at all. What sets it apart, the terrace balcony overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Well worth the price.

Room is very spacious with living room area, kitchen with sink, cabinets, and microwave. I found out after the first day that I could and did, request a mini fridge to use, instead of trying to use their built-in fridge with the weight sensor alcohol charge. King bed was very comfortable. The other unique feature of the room was their Japanese soaking tub, which I used everyday to soak and relax my muscles after a long day\/night of walking. Room service did a very excellent job in preparing my room and changing the towels. Room came with 2 Samsung flat screen TVs. One in the bedroom and the other in the living room. The living room TV comes with a media console that you can connect your laptop or gaming device to it to project on the TV. I was able to use my Amazon Fire tv stick without any problems. Wifi in the room was excellent, although a bit weak when trying to use on the terrace. Only con is that the front door is very heavy and hard to open at times. 

Service was excellent. From checking in to checking out. I had called the night before to request a hypoallergenic room and that request was fulfilled when I checked in. The next morning I had to call for maintenance as one of the 2 bathroom sinks was not draining properly and 2-bed headlamps were giving problems. Within 30 minutes of calling the front desk, 2 maintenance workers came in and fixed the problem.

From the overall hotel location, ease of access, service, room, and view, this is my favorite hotel to stay at. Price is a bit steep, but worth it. The resort fee of $35 is a bit steep too, but the $10 24 hour in and out is cheaper than most hotels located in the same area. Parking was very easy.

I heard only the best about the Wicked buffet, but sadly did not partake. 

You cannot beat its location by the Bellagio - so convenient. 

The rooms are fantastic - mini kitchen with microwave, mini fridge, and nice in-room amenities. Beds are huge and comfy, and there were two TVs in my room. The bathroom is beautiful - big huge tub with jets, wallpaper in bathroom makes you feel like you're tripping on acid, and a huge glass shower with good quality C.O. Bigelow shampoo\/conditioner and awesome shower head. There's even a weighing scale...

The casino is very snazzy, and all of the tables are in the $$$ range, so go to Casino Royale or downtown to the Western Casino if you're looking to make your money last a long time ($1 craps, baby!).

Usually, there's internet in the hotel, but we happened to visit during a hotel-wide outage of phones, cable, and internet. Why did I still give a 5 star rating?

1. Check in (this maybe the worst part of the stay) only because lines are usually long but having status has its benefits so the private check in for us folks makes this process quick and easy.
2. Casino floor (just the right amount of size) it's not to big, not to small and as Goldye locks would say it's just right. Expect higher table minimums and as the night gets later or the weekend bigger don't expect a table less than 25\/50. I mean you're at the Cosmo not circus circus 
3. The rooms. The city rooms are the smallest of the rooms but a nice size but they don't have a balcony. If at all upgrade to a room with a terrace & view of the bellagio fountain. I've stayed in all rooms except the penthouse but had a nice time visiting it with new friends I met at the pool. (That's another review) but the rooms are nice, bed is plush n the bathroom nice. 
4. The hotel amenities from shopping to clubs to restaurants. Everything you need is there. Now let me state everything in the cosmopolitan has an extra surcharge I guess to pay off the space or for the location so expect pricey drinks, price shops, pricey food but hey it's the cosmopolitan; if you wanted a cheap hotel you would go to downtown Vegas 
5. The crowd is younger than the other 5 star hotels thank goodness but old enough to have some sense. It doesn't feel like a retirement home like the Trump or the Wynn but not young enough to attract the crowd from the D or NYNY. It's a great time",1,1,1

I was blown away from the room as I walked in.  Large living area\/office with small half kitchen (fridge, microwave, and wet bar).  Toward the back was a closed off room for the bedroom and onto the large balcony complete with balcony furniture.  The bathroom was a huge highlight, easier larger than the bedroom itself.  Large walk-in shower than continued into a jacuzzi tub with a huge window overlooking Las Vegas.  Don't worry the glass has a mirror coating, you can enjoy that shower\/bath without closing the blinds, at least I did!  Separate room for the toilet.

There are big flat screen TVs in both the living area and bedroom.  The office desk had tons of power and connectivity options including HDMI for the office TV which was nice.

For me the true test is the bed and pillows.  I'm extremely picking as back home I've spend thousands on quality bedding.  I must say the mattress was very comfortable and the pillows were to my liking.  I got a great sleep with no back issues the following morning.

If you wanna do Vegas big time, you stay at the Cosmopolitan. My review will be a bit biased because #luckyme my friend works the front desk and put us in the nicest available room. We stayed in a Terrace One Bedroom - straight from their website ""Experience pure luxury with an expansive private terrace and telescoping doors separating the urban-inspired living area from a spacious bedroom. Step into a large, decadent bathroom featuring marble tiles and a unique Japanese soaking tub."" So yeah, the long and short of it - we lived like ballers for a few days.

The room is exactly like you see it on their website (http:\/\/www.cosmopolitanlasvegas.com\/stay\/rooms-and-suites.aspx) - it is beauts! (And it is very expensive...no doubt.) From the fancy couch, to the two flat screen TVs, to the comfy firm bed, to the huge closet and ottoman, to the magical furo (Japanese soaking tub), and, finally, to the huge terrace that provides you a magestic view of the Bellagio water show and the LV Strip - this stay was a dream come true. 

The pools are made for the Vegas life - so make sure to take some time to lay out. Enjoy the fab food options - the three places we tried were awesome: Holsteins, Wicked Spoon, and, the oh-so-not-secret, Secret Pizza. The casino is always bumpin' no matter what time of day. (Only bummer, the machines weren't as loose as my wallet would've liked. Ha!) You might also want to check out The Chelsea for concerts. Part of the package we purchased included standing room tickets to see, the one and only, Bruno Mars. #AMAZE!

Cosmo's parking lot is easily accessible to the Strip and to the freeway. We had zero problems finding parking - due to the #genius parking sensors that tell you where the open spots are! Unfortunately, our only problem we experienced was in the shower. Haha - wait a minute, take your mind out of the gutter. (If you've read my previous hotel reviews, I'm a water pressure & towel snob.) Shower water pressure sucked, but I just used the furo tub water because it blasts out of control. But we encountered a slow-drainer (think six inches around your feet by the end of your shower - disgusting!), but maintenance quickly addressed the issue. (Let me tell you, when he got the plunger out and pulled out the black gunk, it was grooosssss!)  #thingsidontneedtosee

All in all, would I stay at The Cosmo again? Hell, yeah! We had an amazing time and experience. Personally, I would be completely happy at an off-the-Strip hotel where it's smoke-free. But, when I wanna do Vegas in a big way, The Cosmopolitan is a great choice!",7,4,7

While my overall stay was okay, there were definitely some issues that I encountered during my stay that prevent me from giving the hotel better than a 3 star rating. 

First, it took me over an hour to check in and there were only 5 people in line ahead of me. I checked in on a Sunday and there were only two people working the check-in area. To make up for the extremely long wait to check in, I was upgraded to a wraparound terrace suite. 

Second, in the upgraded room, both of my two televisions were broken. The TVs, which control the amenities in the room, would in some instances, not turn on, and in others, turn on without being touched, to a music station at a very loud volume.

Lastly, the walls are extremely thin! I heard noise from the pool party until the wee hours of the morning and noise from the hallway at all hours. Had I not been there for business I may not have noticed this as much but as it stands it prevented me from getting a good night's sleep.

Outside of these three issues, I have to say that the suite was decadent. It was well appointed with a full refrigerator, excellent selection of spirits, and multiples areas for entertaining. The bed was beyond comfortable and the bathroom offered his and her dressing stations separated by a glass enclosed shower facing a large jetted tub. 

Since I was working from my room, it is important to note that this suite came with a nice work space and had power outlets well positioned throughout the suite.

Upon checkout I had some issues reconciling my bill. I had already paid for one night's stay via a conference registration site but this was not reflected. When I brought it up, they first tried to deduct a lesser amount (instead of what I had already paid), and three tries later, finally corrected it. It took a series of 4 charges to my corporate card and 3 reversals before it was all said and done.

If you're in Vegas for pleasure only, and don't intend on staying in your room all that much, this is the hotel for you. If you're visiting for business, I would recommend a quieter environment.",4,0,0

Twice my girlfriend and I came for birthday celebration and twice did they ruin the celebration. 

2014 - we tried to get an extended stay in the wee hours of Vegas morning. We called the front desk and also went down to the front desk in person to try to extend our room but they could not help us. They told us to check out and wait at the lobby and try to check in at a later time saying that the room has been pre-booked by someone else even though there are other rooms of the same type available to check in after 3pm. We tried calling other hotels but they were booked full. We tried one last time to call the front desk to help extend our room and finally they extended the room for us and switched the other reservation to another room of the same type after following our simple suggestion. We spent 2-3 hours packing and calling other hotels at 4am when such an easy job could have been done way earlier. 

A complaint was made to Marriott and Marriott were at least kind enough to give us an apology and had forwarded the complaint email to Cosmopolitan for them to take care. What did they do? Nothing. Not even an email of apology. 

2015 - the credit card on file had a problem during our stay because of a security breach found by the bank and transactions in the hotel had been declined due to that. I received a temporary card and had hoped to change the card on file to the temporary card even though we know that it is most likely not accepted but we tried anyway because I did not want my girlfriend to be paying for the stay in Vegas for her own birthday celebration. I begged the front desk to see if there is anything he can do to help us and he said, ""Who is to say that you did not pick this from the ground and try to use it."" Really? Is that customer appreciation and care? Accusing customers of being a thief? There are many other ways to decline the temporary card to show understanding and care for the customers. 

It is a shame that I am not recommending this hotel because all other back of house (operators, cleaners, maintenance) were very kind and nice but yet few front of house people just ruin every hopes and dreams.

I did not stay at The Cosmopolitan hotel, but I did spend a little time in the hotel (including the rooms).  The Cosmopolitan is the new hotel that is adjacent to the CityCenter but not part of it (one of the towers, from the outside, looks similar to the Ritz Carlton at LA Live).

Like Aria (located in the CityCenter), The Cosmopolitan is less themed than other Vegas hotels (like Bellagio, Venetian, Mirage, Paris, and so on).  So if you are not a fan of those themed places, you may like The Cosmopolitan.

I can see how some people would find The Cosmopolitan a little boring when compared to some of the other Vegas casinos.  Luckily, The Cosmopolitan does have a few noticeable advantages over Aria and provides a much more unique experience.

First, the decor is nicer.  Very upscale, sleek and contemporary.  The atmosphere throughout the hotel and the casino floor reminded me of some of the nice and trendy places you may find on Sunset Blvd in West Hollywood.  I felt there was a sense of style and point-of-view with The Cosmopolitan while Aria felt much more sterile.

The Cosmopolitan (which was designed to bring in some residential business) also features bigger rooms with more apartment-like features such as kitchenettes.  All the rooms I went to had balconies, which were nice (haven't seen that on The Strip).  The balconies were also thoughtfully designed to prevent accidents.  Depending on which side of the building your room is located, you may get treated to a great view of Paris, Bellagio and the Bellagio Fountains.

Finally, The Cosmopolitan was bringing in a lot of young people (at least right now).  That might be a plus or negative depending on your life stage.  Place was definitely crowded and hopping.

Several of the restaurants at The Cosmopolitan have locations in L.A. (Scarpetta, Comme Ca and STK).  I think they also have some upscale shopping boutiques, but I did not check them out.

The Cosmopolitan is a nice hotel and it is one I would consider staying at if the price was right.  The balcony is a nice touch and the rooms were also nice.  It also has a great location by being near other big casinos like Bellagio, Caesars Palace and MGM Grand.  And unlike Aria, it is much closer to The Strip.  If I wanted to try one of the newer hotels out (in the CityCenter or near it), I think The Cosmopolitan would be my first choice.

I saw valet parking here.  I am not sure if they also have a parking structure for self-parking.",31,21,25

The main attraction in my opinion was the giant high heel shoe. The size of the shoe was unreal. That's the biggest shoe statue I've ever seen in my life.

I have to note that I have never stayed here while visiting Vegas but I've been in there every year since it opened and recently attended a wedding here.

I can't speak for those who HAD the wedding here, but as an attendee... I expected more out of this place.  For starters, the ceremony was in a room, not a chapel and this room was very warm & stuffy considering it was over 100 degrees outside in June.  Moving onto the reception which was held on the 36th floor in a suite, I experienced the same thing...was the AC not working? Was it not up to par??? I get the doors were opening and closing to the balcony but it's not like it was often enough to really warm up this place.  It was very uncomfortable in there, and one side note...the wedding planner announced the wedding party at the reception and announced the BRIDE and GROOM'S names wrong!!! In fact, she announced the WRONG names altogether.  Aside from it being a sauna in there, the food was awesome, and so was the view.  I got to check out the suite they were staying in on the 50-something floor and that view with a wrap around balcony was pretty amazing.  Again, I expected a bit more from this place ...

There was a block of rooms booked for the wedding which also happened to be EDC weekend and the city suite was $2,000 for Saturday alone.  We decided to NOT stay there with the wedding party and stay at the more reasonable Flamingo instead.  Also, they do not provide rollaway beds here.

I would probably consider staying here in the future as a guest while on vacation in Las Vegas, but I wouldn't suggest to anyone to have a wedding here as I know the bride and groom ran into other problems here I don't want to speak about on my yelp review.",0,1,0

The staff is always professional and courteous, and my room has always been available at check-in.  As far as the rooms themselves, you can't really go wrong with any of them.  I've stayed in the basic rooms as well as the suites and was equally satisfied with all of them.  I'd recommend everyone who stays here ask if there is a fountain view room available.  It really adds to the Vegas experience when you can look down at the Bellagio fountains from your private balcony.  All of the rooms have lighting and climate control which is a big plus.  The decor is very artsy and the beds are super comfortable.  This hotel is more well-suited for the younger crowd, and it shows when you walk through it.  If you make the right turn around a certain corner, you may just run into the secret pizza shop there.

It was classy, sexy and fun. Marquee was also just steps away. The concierge got us on a list to Hakkasan no problem. Right next door to the Bellagio and across from Planet Hollywood so we walked to Britney easily. 
Room for improvement: The casino seemed to be the smokiest in all of Vegas which kept irritating my lungs\/eyes. I much preferred the Wynn casino.

I had just came back to the hotel with my girlfriends when this wannabe-cop-security guy demanded we show him I.D. Ok...I asked for him to show some identification...it's Vegas any guy can be walking around a hotel asking to see some I.D. He said he was security for the hotel. Ok we all gave him our I.D. He asked why were were at the hotel. EXCUSE ME!? I told him we were guest at the hotel and I demanded why we were being asked for identification. He refused to talk to us as he was on the radio with some other incompetent security man I assume. After finally clarifying we were on the radio he let us know that there had been an incident involving two black females, One with a black skirt and one with black leggings. Two things here..I was wearing a black dress that reached my shins....black skirt? Hmm what school did you go to? Two my friend was wearing grey leggings...ah yes I can see you may have been colorblind dear incompetent security man. Two the way he went about demanding to see identification I felt that he was targeting us as if we were criminals. I let him know that his mannerisms and his tone of voice was not acceptable considering we were paying guests of the hotel. His response was ""If you feel offended because I asked to see identification something must be wrong with you."" Are you serious right now? As an African-American woman in a high-end hotel if someone just comes up to you and demand you show identification without being told why prior would you not feel like you were being targeted? I actually in my anger smiled a little because my friend was just standing there shaking her head at him saying, ""You are going to wish you never said that my friend."" Yeah I've gotten a couple people fired from their jobs for things they've said to me. Do I feel bad? NOPE!

The head of security was very calm with me after I spoke very passionately (yelling at the top of my lungs) about this security guy who would do better handing out flyers to tourists on the strip. I filed a formal complaint and will definitely follow-up about what will be done. I certainly will make sure that this type of incompetence is never experienced myself at the Cosmo again...especially from SECURITY. 

 Ugh...Cosmopolitan in the day of the over-saturated job market I'm absolutely positive that you could find another security guard who doesn't think he's working for the Vice\/Drug sector of the Vegas PD.

You took my money. I want it back. But I enjoyed losing it to you. Isn't that the point? I mean, if I'm going to drop a couple hundred bucks in the casino, at least you're taking it with a smile and even a handshake and free drink, just like a used car salesman. 

No other casino has made me want to sit at a bar and pay for a drink simply because that bar looks like a cool place to hang out, instead of getting it for free while playing craps. So, the decor is great. The layout of the place is non-standard and strange, but perhaps that only contributes to overall eclectic feel. 

Two other things I really admire about this place: the Art-o-Mats and the cool common areas scattered around. There is not another casino where you can play a free game of pool and sit on a comfy couch or chair in a common area on the third floor.

Took a taxi to the hotel to go to Marquee and it's very well lit and filled with people. The decor is very urban, posh and full of sex appeal. Love how the restroom near the entrance has a chain monument separating the men and women's restroom, while allowing us to take a peek at any attractive guests walking by. ;)

Men and women are everywhere. We were constantly getting hollered at...great for a self esteem booster!

The chandelier bar is gorgeous! Drinks prices are a bit steep ($15 each)....but the bartenders got some heavy hands!!!

I definitely want to stay here on my next vegas trip. 

Cosmopolitan's definitely got ""just the right amount of wrong"".",1,1,2

The hotel is massive and gorgeous; everywhere you go there is something to gawk at. The employees are very friendly and helpful; every question was answered and some employees went way beyond the call of duty to point us in the right direction.

The check in process needs work - we waited in line for an hour only to be told that it would be an additional two hours before our room was ready. 

Our room - Terrace Studio - was gorgeous; they spent the bulk of the budget on getting the look right but didn't pay enough attention to things actually being comfortable or working properly. The couches were stiff, hot water came out of some faucets but not others, only one TV was working and the lighting is challenging to sort out - even when you're sober. However, the house staff was all really nice and within minutes of asking for another blanket, towel or glass they were knocking on the door. 

The restaurants and bars are hit or miss. We tried six (I'll review those in detail separately). In short - pass on the Vesper & Bond bars - both are not staffed to handle crowds and you'll wait 20-30 minutes to put in an order much less get a drink and eating . Blue Ribbon Sushi is a bit over priced but we lucked out with a fantastic waiter who kept us drinking and laughing.  The Crystal Bar was ok, quick to get a drink (but it wasn't that busy) but the bartenders were super cranky - don't expect friendly witty banter. The Wicked Spoon was by far the best food and best service.  The Marquee was everything you want in a club with convenient bars, a fun crowd and great music at any of the floors you walked on to. 

Security left a lot to be desired - we had items stolen from our room and there was a pick pocket loose in The Marquee - neither occurrence was met with any amount of concern much less action from the security staff or management.

Bottom line - If you love flash and forgive the lack of substance this is where you want to be.  Given that this is a new hotel I'm not surprised with the issues we encountered and I really hope they get it together because I'd love to give them another try.",0,0,0

My room and the nextdoor have a common door in the middle which makes it even easier to hear Everything from them. Plus they are constantly going in and out of their rooms on the same floor so there are door slamming and knocking every 5 mins and I'm at exaggerating. 

We called hotel service at 10pm while my son was getting ready for bed and nothing changed. After half an hour, my 5 year old couldn't fall asleep, we made a second call to the hotel. At least 15mins later, security came to knock at my neighbor's door and nicely advised them to turn it down and HAVE FUN! 
Then the music is lower now but we can still hear every song with loud talking and laughing and door slamming which is very very disturbing. There is no way I can manage to fall asleep before they stop partying. 

I'm confused: Has Cosmo done the best they can for us tonight? are we going to bed too early as Cosmo guests? What are the hotel policies on noisy guests at night? 

I have stayed pretty much every hotel on the strip. I am aware there are more family friendly hotels like Mandalay bay and Venetian compared to Cosmo. But Cosmo do you really have to tell us to stay away from you? 
Im staying here only because Cosmo has been sending me complementary stays every month. But I won't come back and will not spend one more penny in Cosmo casino. 

All I can say is customer service is WEAK when we need you!

2nd time...
we received a free room upgrade (thanks to the hubby's marriott platinum elite status!) to the terrace one bedroom.
the best feature...the japanese soaking tub with a strip view.
so awesome!!!

3rd time...
had an unexpectedly disappointing check in experience.
i think the 'boy' that checked us in was new.
he was argumentative and completely unaccommodating.
didn't care that the hubby was platinum elite so rather than arguing with the kid we paid for our upgrade cuz i wanted to experience another type of room.
this time we got the terrace suite which is a one bedroom suite with a kitchen, 2 bathrooms and an in room washer\/dryer.
i deducted 1 star for the boy's inexperience.
in a hotel such as this, one should never experience such inadequate service.

The VIP check-in was anything but VIP. The agent was impersonal and tried to upsell us when I asked for our complimentary upgrade. We used Visa Signature to book our room, and the site stated that we'd receive a free upgrade if available. The agent, however, did not seem to be very well-versed in the package's amenities, and was argumentative with me about the late checkout that we were supposed to receive as well. He said that there was no way we could get a 3 p.m. check out because housekeeping needs to clean the rooms, and that the best he could do was a 2 p.m. check out. I'd understand if the rooms were all booked and there'd be no vacancy the next day, but we were checking out on a Sunday, and my impression from him was that they do not, under any condition, honor 3 p.m. check outs. If that is the case, then they should consider NOT listing that as an amenity on the site, as we were counting on it to spend some extra hours by the pool.

Once we got to our room, it reeked of cigarette smoke, had an ashtray full of butts, orange makeup smeared against the mirrored closet door, and a layer of ash\/dust on one of the chairs. In addition to cig burns on a few pieces of the furniture. We had to call the front desk and ask to be switched because my asthma was starting to act up from being in the room. Not too long after our call, the Housekeeping Manager, Chadwick, came to inspect the room. He swiped the chair and found his hand to be covered in the dust\/ash, confirmed that the smell of cigarettes lingered in the room, and that he'd do his best to find us a suitable room to switch to. He even empathized with my plight, stating that he had a family member with bad asthma as well, and understood that staying in such a room could trigger terrible reactions. I mentioned to him that we DID book a non-smoking room, and he stated that all of the Cosmo's rooms are supposed to be non-smoking. For our troubles, Chadwick said that he'd post a resort credit to the room.

A bellhop came to help us with our bags and to relocate us to our new room. When we got back to our new room after dinner that night, we were greeted by room service, there to deliver us a bottle of champagne on ice, along with a personal note from Chadwick.

I wanted a VIP weekend for a very special occasion, and that's exactly what the fine folks at the Cosmopolitan delivered - and more.

If you are looking for a hotel that delivers the glitz and youthful glam of Vegas coupled with impressive VIP service, the Cosmopolitan is an excellent choice. I had reserved a two bedroom suite (not on the website, you have to call reservations to inquire) for a small private party I wanted to host.

Prior to my arrival
All my reception catering questions were answered promptly (the same business day).

Days before my trip, I received a courtesy phone call to see if there was anything I needed for my trip to their property. 

Upon arrival 
Check-in was fast. Even better they upgraded me to a Bungalow suite - since there was some availability. Wow. Can you say beautifully appointed, 3-story (2,400 sq ft) suite, with private jacuzzi on the roof, overlooking the Marquis on one side and with a view of the Bellagio fountains on the other side? Ridiculous.

From there it just got better, the champagne that my co-workers sent ahead of time, was chilled and waiting in the room for us. The hotel figured out I like tequila and had a complimentary bottle of Patron waiting in the room. When they learned my preference was Don Julio 1942, they swapped out the Patron without batting an eyelash. (no, I didn't scoff at the Patron.)

Their butler service was on point and attentive the entire weekend. 

Catering was 100x better than I expected. I was reluctant to have them cater the party at first, especially since there are so many awesome restaurants in LV. But I was plesantly surprised. Blame it on the al-al-alcohol?! I think not. My friends came up to me to tell me how much they enjoyed the food too. 

Room audio hook ups
BUMP-IN! I just docked my iphone, turned on the spotify and we were good to go.

Casino
Beautifully decorated, amazing complimentary cocktails if you're playing, and friendly dealers. 

I've never done Vegas like this. It was pricey to be sure. But for me, it was a once in a lifetime kind of party, and it was worth every penny!

I can't tell you how much I love this hotel.  I used to be a loyal Wynn\/Encore girl all the way, but I'm afraid The Cosmo has stolen my heart.

Every detail about this hotel is fabulous.  The layout makes it surprisingly easy to navigate, especially when you're staying there as a guest.  I'm pretty sure this is one of the only big hotels on the strip where you don't have to walk through the entire casino to reach the guest elevators - so refreshing!

The rooms here are very...cosmopolitan!  Yes it is one of the priciest places to stay, but if you want the Vegas experience, and maybe you're looking for something trendier, and more sexy, this is your spot!  Even the most basic room will not disappoint.

The casino and casino bars are super swanky, which I love.  All the decor is done to the nines, with really cool LED light fixtures and other intriguing designs to make you feel extra fancy wherever you are.

Our room was in the east tower and every time you want to take an Uber you have to walk all the way through the lobby to the west tower, out the door, and down the way to a very hot underground corner. (Cabs will cost you 3 times as much as an uber and they don't like it!) When you get dropped off after a nice dinner and drinking, you can sometimes convince the drivers to drop you by the east door, otherwise you have to trek through the damn lobby again! Very annoying.
Our room was nice except for the stained carpet and seemingly dirty couch. The bathmat also had frayed sides, which I would expect from a higher end hotel. 
Oh, this hotel is also more for people under 40 that are the hipster, dudebro, jersey shore type! They were laughable, but I wish I would have stayed somewhere with classier clientele.

+'s
++ Accessibility to restaurants, shopping, bars, clubs
++ One bedroom with terrace is roomy, well decorated and has nice views of the strip and Bellagio fountain
+ Shower with the glass panel to the bedroom and bathroom can be fun, if you're on a romantic getaway
+ Nice amount of bars with different vibes.  Especially liked the chandelier bar
+ Good number of food & drink choices.  Must also order something from Neapolitan if you're at the pool.
+ Nice spa facilities with steam, sauna and hot tub

-'s
- Glass panel to the shower can also be seen as a negative if you're sharing the room with friends or other family members... weird
- Strange layout of the hotel and decor in common areas.  I've been to hotels like Gramercy Park Hotel, and it seems this hotel is going for the same look and feel, but GPH fills its space so much better with the eclectic works of art throughout.  I know this is a huge hotel, but roaming the halls on some of the floors, you wouldn't know if you were in Vegas or a convention in Indiana.  And I know they are just hallways, but all of them were drab.  Again, pick any hotel and you're there.
- Small casino floor
- Spa services not so great; probably one of the worst massages I've gotten
- Room was generally clean, but there were already cigarette burns on the terrace furniture
- Check in took forever, and they won't let you pay up to guarantee early check.  We got a room early anyway, but not before we waited 45 minutes in lines to check in.
- Pools were small.  Boulevard pool is like a zoo and it's impossible to get a seat.  I don't know how the 2 small pools can accommodate all of the hotel's guests.  it's always a quest to find a seat if you're not there early.  and waiting for the service can take a while.
- Service could be better in general.  Over the last few years, Vegas has lost some of it's attention to detail when it comes with customer service.  If I'm spending serious dough at dinners, shows, drinks, etc. I'd like the service to be better

Overall, the positives still outweighed the negatives because I'm not sure you would have fared much better at other hotels on the strip.  It is a younger crowd, but that makes for a lot of good people watching.  I'd probably stay there again.",0,0,0

Shower is designed so the floor slopes toward the rest of the bathroom (no barrier on the shower floor) so water went everywhere. The bathroom was half flooded. Ridiculous.

Every adjective you've heard about the Cosmopolitan is true. It's a chic, contemporary, opulent, decadent, lovely, lavish, romantic, artsy, naughty, and hip hotel located in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip with amazing panoramic views, a bevy of restaurants, and a very cool club in Marquee.

Olivia Z. and me stayed in a luxurious Terrace One Bedroom on the 62nd floor with an outdoor Private Terrace offering a magnificent panoramic view of the neon-lit Strip. The room featured separate king bed and living areas including a kitchenette. The bathroom had dual sinks, shower, and a wonderful Japanese Soaking Tub (that was an amazing way to unwind at the end of each day).

Stay in the East Tower if you want to be closer to the Strip, Restaurants, Marquee Day & Night Club, and Bars. It was very convenient for us. Since Cosmopolitan is next to Bellagio, many rooms (with up charge) offer a view of the Fountains or you can easily walk there to catch a few of the Fountain Shows. Another upgrade option is a Upgrade to a Wrap Around Terrace on a corner which was really promoted when we checked-in.

Resort Fees are $28 and include access to the Gym, Pool, and WiFi (2 devices only).

Self Parking is easy. If you are staying in the East Tower, be sure to drive all the way to the east side of the parking lot for convenience to your elevator. Also, note the shortcut entrance\/exit from the east tower, too. Valet is easy, too. It is all done in the parking structure and very comfortable and convenient.

Wicked Buffet is over-rated, but ok. Holsteins, on the other hand, makes an amazing burger (The Risng Sun with Kobe-style Beef & add Fried Egg). Secret Pizza isn't a secret anymore. Comme Ca is a relaxing choice for happy hour. STK and Scarpetta are so-so for the higher prices.

I was sent a text message letting me know when our rooms were ready and we went directly to our rooms. 

The check-in lobby is breath taking and has large column screens that have rotating videos. We had no trouble at all booking a Cirque de soiel tickets at the concierge.

The Cosmo is not short of their fair share of eateries. On the second level you'll find a west coast favorite - egg slut, as well as a juice stand. Be sure to grab the infamous Verbana drink for the Chandelier bar, and the brunch buffet from Wicked Spoon.

We stayed in a Terrance room that overlooked the Bellagio Fountains. From our balcony we were able to view the Bellagio Fountain show as many times as we wanted and could even hear the music. My favorite part of the room would have to be the jets inside the tub of our room.

The hotel is gorgeous and I have always wanted to stay here.  Most of the rooms have a balcony and the 2 different rooms I stayed in were excellent.  You almost can't go wrong here.  The building is VERY tall so be warned if you have a fear of heights.  My ears popped a few times on the elevator.  They don't charge a resort fee but any extra is a separate fee:  internet, gym, spa, etc.  The gym is very nice w\/a tv on each machine and a small yoga studio, free weights area, etc.  The spa is nice also, however I would have liked a co-ed area for when you are there w\/your significant other so you can relax together.  I didn't have any services done, so no comment on that.  

One small annoyance with all these newer, bigger, better hotels is the tricky gadgetry.  The phones are computer-ish so it takes time to figure out how to use them and if they reset, you can not use the phone.  The lights are each operated by electric buttons that don't always work and it made it very difficult to control the lighting in the room.  Not a fan.  Ended up unscrewing the light bulb on the main center light.   Also I made a big deal about upgrading to the room w\/the jacuzzi tub and found the tub to be a little disappointing.  The bubbles are very tame and I got bored.  Nice features like a big fridge, full kitchen, and washer and dryer.  But who actually uses these things?  It's not like they give you any laundry detergent or pots and pans.  I assume you can request it.

Dining in the Cosmo is ok, but my best food was found elsewhere.  We had breakfast here at Henry's everyday which was pretty good in terms of quality.  We had dinner at STK upstairs and were happy but not blown away, especially considering the prices.  We ate at the new Gordon Ramsay place across the street the next night and were very happy there.  Same price point but much more of an experience and more interesting food.  

The pool is ok and apparently heated but shockingly small considering the size of the hotel.  I expected more.

Check-in was very easy and pleasant. I gave the gentleman at the front desk the  name of a person that will be staying in the room (arriving later in the evening) - no problems. 

We arrived at the room only to be immediately greeted by a pungent smell of smoke. I called and spoke to a manager about it.  Instead of moving us to another room, he asked me to provide him with a convenient time for his staff to bring in an ""ozone machine"" to deodorize the space. I was speechless.

I then go to use the bathroom, only to realize that we had NO trash cans in the ENTIRE room.  I called again. They assured me that someone was on their way to deliver new cans. We went out to grab food and gamble (2-3 hours). Arrived back - still no trash cans. Again, I called the front desk, they assured me they were on their way. 30 min later there was a knock on my door. 

We then head out to dinner. Our friend arrives at the hotel while we are out. He gives the front desk both his and my name. They give him the room key - no problems there. He then gets to the room, unpacks, showers, shaves, grabs a drink from the mini bar and takes off to meet us at the casino. Long story short...About 2 hrs later we figure out that the front desk had given him the wrong room key (directed him to the wrong room). All this time he was showering and settling in to a room that wasn't his - luckily the owners of the room hadn't returned since he had arrived. We immediately went to speak to the front desk about this - they lightheartedly apologized (as if it was funny). Not the reaction I was expecting. They brought over another gentleman who claimed to be a ""manager,"" all he did was briefly apologize. He did not seem too interested in making sure we were satisfied. 

btw...all of this happened on my girlfriend's bday weekend.

The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas has definitely upped the ante with its über fashion-chic groove and even groovier clientele.  I finally had the opportunity recently to experience this hotel as a bona fide guest.  Super upgrade considering I was shacking up at the Excalibur this past summer.  I guess it really depends how you hit things.  Found an outrageous flight\/transfer\/hotel package that included staying here for a song.

Reason returning was my birthday weekend.  Last year I was finishing the HNL Marathon, so this year, I decided to treat myself and stay here.  Check in was fine after somewhat of a line.  I pre-planned to use my $20 sandwich-trick that worked at getting me an upgrade at Excalibur.  Unfortunately, my French-speaking receptionist didn't take my money.  Instead she upgraded me even higher than I expected to a Terrace One Bedroom, giving me back my $20.  How glorious!

The room was amaze-balls!  Probably one of the nicest rooms we have ever had.  Just huge with a living room, kitchenette, shower suite complete with a furo style soaking tub that had a priceless view facing Aria and the lighted Pyramid of Luxor.  All this with a King size bed and a private terrace with lounge chair.  We loved the bedside phone that controlled the room's temperature and lights (oooh, aaahhh).  The shower was a case in point.  I could have spent my entire stay there, just getting drenched and relaxing.  You could literally fill this shower suite with 10 people easy (okay, get your mind out of the gutter).  Just saying, huge-o-rama.

I know a room's just a room and people say you're hardly spending time there.  Well, these peeps aren't staying at the Cosmopolitan.  Returning each night felt like a swell of pride and privilege as I inserted my room card into the elevators and ascending to the 57th floor.  Yes, I'm too sexy and don't you forget it.

If you want more peace and quiet and don't want to be disturbed by the Marquee nightclub, best to request a super high floor in the West Tower.  Perfectly quiet nights and uninterrupted sleepy dreams.  Also, they don't charge resort fees, but do charge if you want to use their gym.  I always have the intention of doing good and working out while on vacation and that's usually what it ends up being, an intention.  I think it would set you back $20\/day.  That's a very nice cocktail even by Vegas standards.

Don't miss the video pillars at reception showcasing a variety of scenes that dramatically alter the mood around it.  My favorite was the rather racy scenes of a nude couple flaunting their assets and tantalizing those pretending not to notice.  Ooh La La!  So I raise my friends' Cosmo to toast the Cosmopolitan and all it's modern finery.

Our rooms weren't ready on time.  When they were our keys didn't work.  It was almost impossible to get a drink at the bar (it wasn't crowded).  Room service tray was so hot that I was burned.

I had the pleasure of staying here during Memorial Day weekend and one word to sum up my visit would be ""WOW""! This hotel is absolutely stunning. The decor is modern, pristine, and in the words of my fellow Yelper Sharen G., ""SEXY!"" Most importantly, I felt at home here. Unlike some of the ""nicer"" hotels on the strip, the age range of the guests here were on the younger side, about early 20's to early 30's. 

As for the rooms, they had to be the nicest I have ever stayed in! We had two connecting rooms, with one being a bit larger than the other. The larger room had 2 bathrooms and its own mini kitchen complete with an oven, full-size fridge and wait for it....a washer & dryer! The smaller room had a mini fridge and a really cool shower which had steps leading up to a tub with the view of the outside. I felt VERY spoiled staying here. 

There was also ample seating, tons of mirrors, cool artwork and of course, balconies for each room. We had the view of the Bellagio fountains...the water show at night was gorgeous! The hotel also offers FREE WIFI and they use C.O. Bigelow products for their bathroom amenities...very very cool.

Aside from the rooms, another reason I love The Cosmopolitan is because of its ideal location. My friends & I were able to grab some dessert at Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio next door, go across the street to Planet Hollywood to grab some 'yards' and walked around the shops at the Aria also next door. 

During our visit, we ate at Holstein's, The Wicked Spoon Buffet and partied at Marquee (which by the way is my favorite club at the moment...the music was SO GOOD! Way better than XS!! Another bonus was we got to enter through the 'Hotel Guest' line and surpassed the regular guest line that snaked around the entire floor!). We also hung out at the pool (NOT the day club) which had a nice relaxed vibe and great drinks. As you can see, the hotel itself offers so much to see and do :)

If you're looking to go ""all-out"" in Vegas, then I highly suggest you stay at The Cosmopolitan. It really is the best of the best!",3,1,1

There were a few glitches when we first got there, for example we booked a room with two queen sized beds and somehow we were going to be given a room with one king sized bed and a pull-out.  We weren't too thrilled, so we told the manager and they were happy to upgrade us to a suite with a view of the Bellagio fountains!  Not bad!  Not to mention, it had a balcony as well!  The bathroom alone was huge.  It had a large counter area and actually a SEPARATE shower room connected.  You open the glass door to the super huge shower, and there is also a Japanese soaking tub next to it with a window so you can overlook the strip while you enjoy a bath.  Not bad!

There was a kitchenette area out in the ""living room"" area complete with a stove, fridge, dishwasher, and a mircrowave.  The beds were comfortable and the TV was great too.  Plenty of space for at least 4 people to move about in this room.

The hotel itself is laid out a little strange and takes some getting used to.  Certain things are on certain sides of the hotel, but it's not too hard to figure out.  There are plenty of bars and restaurants (The Henry is really good for breakfast!) and there's also a nightclub inside too.  

I like that this hotel is located next to some of the newer hotels (Aria, for example) as well as Crystal's.  I would stay here again if I was given the opportunity since it's a more modern hotel than some of the others.",0,0,0

The checking-in process was a bit of waiting but the front desk staff (Anna) was quite nice and helpful... We upgraded to the terrace one bedroom suite with the Bellagio's fountain view... It was totally worth very penny!

The room was spacious, with nice sitting balcony and killer view! Love the technology... You can turn the chandelier, bathroom, living, bedroom lights, room climate control and so on with your TV remote! Gotta love technology! The Japanese tub facing the strip is awesome! 

The gym has many equipments and a boxing ring! There are three pools but not enough chairs... So you gotta get there earlier or pay for the cabana!

There are several restaurants. We went to the Wicked Spoon for lunch and dinner... And quite happy with the buffet choices! And if you are starving after midnight... There is the secret pizza (this place does not have nam!) on the third floor, next to the Blue Ribbon restaurant... Quite secret that you might not know that you are there even if you are right in front of it! 

We have a great time here... Definitely will stay here again... So why did I give this place a five star?!

For few reasons... (maybe a bit nit picking!)
- no dresser in the room... I don't like my underclothes expose!
- no coffee shops or in-room coffee maker for quick coffee break... Do people still drink coffee?
- not enough seating at the pools
- shopping selections... So so
- finally, it will take lots of luck to win here!",1,1,0

-Excellent modern design
-Courteous and understanding staff (with the exception of some of the housekeeping staff)
-Large variety of eateries and shops on the second and third floors away from the super busy and smokey casino floor 
-Super high tech! You can control everything from the TVs in your room
-STUNNING views looking out at most of the strip and the Bellagio fountains! (This upgrade will cost you more). Our room on the 57th floor even had a balcony with a comfortable lounge mini sofa.
-The Identity membership is totally worth it. Even though everything is pricey in the hotel, signing up for this program will give you cash back to use at pretty much any of the places inside the hotel during your stay
-Great central location on the strip (smack in the middle of the main action (close to Bellagio, Paris, Planet Hollywood, etc). 
-Right next to City Center 
-They even have Tennis Courts on the 14th floor next to the gym and pool. The gym is also pretty high tech and large

There were also a few negatives though:
-They were SUPER CROWDED on President's Day Weekend (this is understandable, but they needed more CoStars (their customer service reps) at the Front Desk! Seriously! The lines were crazy long to check in! 
-While all the high tech elements are cool, they often stopped working or were buggy (our TVs went black or fuzzy often). They also had a problem with their phone system while we were here. We tried to call the front desk and were put on 20 minute holds every time! To their credit, we complained at check out and they comped one of our charges at The Wicked Spoon Buffet.
-The housekeeping staff was a little rude and pushy. They wanted to clean our room in the morning, and they knocked at least three times all within an hour. Can't they just come back a little later in the afternoon?
-The design of the rooms is a little odd (they are very spacious, but there's a random kitchen with a microwave and a dishwasher smack in the middle of the room. They had to install two TVs in each room because the kitchen takes up the space in the center. This is a little funky.

Overall, a great destination in Vegas. I would definitely recommend it! Splurge for the Bellagio Fountain view. It's totally worth it.",0,0,0

I stayed here for 2 nights and paid the $250 pet deposit (which is really $280 plus tax). Our dog is kennel trained and we left the room seriously spotless. Upon checkout I noticed that my credit card statement showed two additional $200ish charges on top of our room charge. One was a pending charge that they quickly removed after my first phone call. The other stubborn $200ish charge to my credit card has been impossible to retrieve. Every person that I've talked to at Cosmopolitan has agreed that I should be refunded that amount.

""It'll take 3-5 business days.""
""It'll take 7-10 business days.""
""Our accounting dept is only open M-F.""
""I will fix the problem with accounting and call you tomorrow with an update."" - no call back from a service rep named Promise.
""Don't worry we took care of it. You got your refund and you'll see it reflected on your folio which I will email to you right now."" per a service rep named Joann. Never received the refund or the folio. 

I have yet to receive this refund after nearly a month after checking out and I feel violated. I'm planning my next move which is to call American Express and the Better Business Bureau. 

There were other minor annoyances with the stay as well:

We were told that housekeeping would be up to put a sign on the door to indicate that we had a pet in the room. They never came and when I asked about it in passing they stated that they ran out of signs 3 months ago. 

They advertise that they do 24 hr turn down linen service. They should give their poor workers a break because they seem understaffed and unable to deal with the volume of normal requests. We asked for extra towels once and got stood up too, like a lot of you have.

After reading other sketchy yelp reviews about the hotel, upon check out I made sure there were no erroneous Mini Bar or movie charges. I checked out over the phone from the room and the rep that I talked to confirmed that I had no charges. She also never sent me the final bill via email as promised so lo and behold during the multiple back and forth phone calls, I discovered that I indeed was charged for something I never took. They did refund me for that amount  after I voiced my frustration over all the erroneous charges. ugh. I seriously hope I'm one of the exceptions. 

Bottom line: The Cosmo does not respect your financial info. You may take a chance and decide to stay there anyway because it really is a fun hotel. However be vigilant about accounting errors because you could end up with more of a headache. 

If anyone from accounting or management is reading this. I hope you read the negative reviews and discern if this is a system error that needs fixing. I have never had a horrible hotel checkout experience at any hotel, especially a vegas hotel before in my whole life. A serious disappointment and I'm unable to, in good faith, recommend that any of my friends stay here unless management steps up and corrects some seriously ill behind-the-scenes issues.",15,1,1

This is THE room to have at the Cosmo, with an L-shapped balcony along the strip as well as the bellagio fountain...built in entertainment!
One of my favorite rooms I have ever stayed in, even though it only has one bedroom, you can actually lose someone in this room. Bathrooms are major for me in hotel rooms, and this room has 2 of them, both with showers. 
Didnt touch the washer\/dryer, or the full kitchen, but its nice that they're there.
There are fun touches everywhere including Johnathan Adler bookends, colored pencils at the desk, and a well stocked fridge. The Cosmo is very ""young"", and knows its audience, having PBR in the fridge, an ""intimacy kit"" available for purchase in the room, Foosball tables in one of the lounge areas, by the pool, etc.
What sets this hotel apart right now is its newness. While there's certainly nothing wrong with the Palazzo, or many other hotels on the strip, they can at times, look a little threadbare. People, including myself, run these rooms HARD. 
But at the Cosmopolitan, the towels are still plush, the couches still unstained, and the pools still pristine.
Nice music and cable options in the rooms as well, and I was pleasantly surprised with how much I like the C.O bigelow products.
I can't stress enough how much I LOVED the wrap around terrace suite. Its absolutely worth the extra dollar. 
The balcony lets you experience Vegas in a whole new way. 
The Boulevard pool is a new favorite as well, very high energy, with giant showers in the pool at your disposal with the push of a button. Different levels in the pool mean that you can swim, or just lie in the pool to cool off and lounge. 
The food poolside was also surprisingly good, the ceviche is not to be missed! I had it twice!
There's a nice covered area by the pool as well, with Foosball, ping pong, and about 10 TVs with bean bag chairs, if you just cant miss the game.
As far as the shopping in Cosmo, its merely average, but only because I'm from Los Angeles and they have a lot of the same stores. They could also use another convenient store selling more than just dean and deluca.
I also went to a few restaurants in the Cosmo, and the nightclub Marquee as well, but I'll save those for other reviews.

Check in took a while, and the people behind me got more than a bit antsy, but it wouldnt be Vegas without a little bit of a hassle. They go hand in hand.

All in all, I'd highly recommend The Cosmopolitan. Its young, its sexy, its fun. I'm personally done with theme hotels, and the only theme here is pure Vegas glitz.",0,0,0

I had a one bedroom suite for a few nights with a view of the Bellagio fountain and the north side of the strip. The room was huge, with a sectional, 2 large TV's, kitchenette, 2 person tub, mini library, and 2 sinks. Large balcony with a patio loveseat to just come out and relax on. Lucky me, someone at the front desk hooked me up with an upgrade.

One day I decided to go to the boulevard pool. It is barely pool, mostly Astroturf and seats. The bamboo pool was closed so I went to the pool at Marquee, which was hilarious. Apparently you can't get even a seat without $150 of bottle service, but you sit at the bar for free. NO ONE WAS THERE. They were hyping buying a seat all the way up the elevator and no one was at the pool! AHAHAHAHAHA. I walked out really quick.

Food selection here is ok, but not as good as other properties. If the two popular venues here are the chandelier bar and the secret pizza place, there's a problem. 

This hotel gets 4 stars for being hot stuff, and not 5 because I didn't appreciate the hookers outside my door at 4am bitching about how cheap the guy next door was. Hello security? They don't let riff raff like that troll the halls at the Wynn.",2,3,3

First, I made my reservation over 8 months ago and I requested, and was told I would receive, a suite on east tower fountain side.  When I checked in, they didn't have that room, and put me in a room on the west tower.  I said I wouldn't accept west tower, and wanted east, as I told them when I made the reservation, and also told them the day before when I called to confirm he reservation.  .  They finally found a room in east tower, but it was facing the wrong way.  Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but this week they are tearing down the Harmon and for 8-10 hours a day straight, all I can hear on the balcony is the jackhammer from across the street. 

I went to the desk after one night and I explained that I have a medical condition that makes me really sensitive to sound.   The jackhammer nonstop is actually causing me a ton of physical pain, and is exceedingly annoying.   They refused to change my room to the other side of the building, away from the construction site, without me paying an extra $100 a night.  I thought this was really unnecessary since I need to move for a medical reason... They didn't care.  

They told me at the front desk they would call me when my new room was ready, 3 pm at the latest.  In the meantime, I should move out of my current room. I move out, but they never called!! I was wandering the city all day waiting for the call they promised.  Eventually I went to the front desk to ask and they said ""oh yes it's been ready."" They why didn't they call? 

So I finally got up to my new suite.  At this point I'm paying $800 a night for this  room.  It takes the bell hop over an hour to bring my bags up.  Then, I realize that the full kitchen in my room has not one utensil- not a fork, not a coffee cup, not a coffee maker, nothing!! Since I'd already bought groceries I called down to have some utensils sent up.  They charged me a dollar per utensil to have then sent up.  I was outraged.   I'm paying $800 a night and I still have to pay $1 for a fork!? And, the pan they sent up ( and charged me a dollar for) was broken and unusable.   The person who brought it up acknowledged it was broken but said they didn't have anything else.  Still charged me for it.  

In addition to this, the new room was really dirty... The couch has crud on it.  The toilet paper wasn't changed from the previous guest.   

I'm really disappointed.  I felt very disrespected the entire trip.  Since the new owners bought this hotel the service has gone way way downhill.   I don't recommend this place at all.  I'll never sty here again.",0,1,0

The one thing my friends and I keep saying about this place was that 95% of the staff was EXCEEDINGLY nice and patient. Cocktail waitresses, bell staff, front desk, etc., were just extremely genuine and patient. But be prepared for the type of people who were staying at the hotel: DOUCHES. 

The other 5% were a few of the staff inside restaurants within the hotel. In particular, this blond middle aged man who was our server at The Henry, their 24 hour restaurant. Worst restaurant server I've ever had. The kind of guy who acts like you're bothering him by patronizing the place he works at. He NEVER refilled out drinks (isn't that Serving 101?), and was annoyed every time we ordered something else. My food was pretty amazing though- the french dip with truffle tater tots. The other bad experience was with the pool server, who pretended to forget to bring us our change from $100 bill because her shift was over. We literally had to hunt her down after 30 minutes and report it to the manager.

The Wicked Spoon buffet was one of the best I've had in Vegas. Most of the food they offer comes portioned in miniature pots, dishes, fryer baskets, whatever was appropriate for the dish. It was all too adorable. Some of the food was slightly bland, but the selection and the fresh taste was top-notch. 

We stayed in a room with two beds, and it was pretty baller. Two flat screen TVs, a deep tub with jets, sitting area, balcony with a huge comfy chair, and the beds were just heavenly- like sleeping in a cloud. One lame thing was that the room did not come with complimentary coffee. Very frustrating, but I guess they figure if you can afford the room, you can afford $5 more for a pot of coffee. 

We had a huge problem with the tub. The jets would turn on by themselves throughout the night, startling us awake. We reported it the first two times as it was happening, and reported the rest in the morning. They were very nice and gave us a complimentary buffet to make up for our lost night of rest.",0,0,0

I had the studio terrace room. The room was spacious and I liked the way the shower \/ Jacuzzi tub were set up, you walk directly into the tub from the shower area (plus, you get a view of the strip from your tub). I really liked this hotel, there are a couple of good places to eat, and it's in a really good location on the strip.  I stayed here for work and some of my coworkers received a follow up email in regards to their stay, I haven't gotten one.
 
At dinner one of my coworkers told me that while she was settling in to her room she heard a knock at the door, when she called out 'Just a minute!'  Someone immediately entered her room, dropped some promotional information on the table and then let themselves out. Another one of my coworkers had a similar story, except she didn't respond when the person knocked on the door; she was heading over to open the door when the person came in to check her mini fridge.
 
Around 11:40 on my last night, I heard men yelling outside of my room (I disregarded it because it's Vegas); I then heard a couple of loud bangs right up against my door (I could tell it was my door because the wall in the front of my room shook) and then the sound of glass breaking. I got up and called down to the front desk, the man who answered confirmed my room number and told me not to worry & that they would rush security up. I have included pictures of what was DIRECTLY in front of my door when I opened it, the pepper flakes from the hallway a long with a couple of small pieces of glass had come in to my room under the door, I stepped on that when I went to look through the peep hole in the door.  I checked outside my door about 30-45 minutes and the mess still wasn't cleaned up and security never came by to check on me (very unprofessional).

This was the first time I have stayed at a Vegas hotel other than the Encore.  I was not disappointed, however, Encore is still my fav!!!  Sorry to admit that on The Cosmo's review, but it's the truth...plus...I still give The Cosmo 4 stars!!!

I have no real complaints about this hotel.  The staff is great, bartenders AWESOME (Tim at the Chandelier Bar!!!), rooms are large and nice, customer service good, food is decent, and plenty to do within the hotel itself.

The check-in process is quick and efficient, however, the staff at the front are not overly friendly.  They do their job, but that is about it.  Not a negative, but just expected  a little more convo and smiles.  However, Ali at the front desk is top notch...he provides the type of customer service I expect!!!  The rooms are quite large and funky.  The shower\/tub area is ginormous and a huge plus.  However, shower\/tub area is so large that it is freezing in there unless you are actually standing under the water.  So...didn't really get to fully use the tub area.  The vanity\/sink top is a bit small for 2 people with lots of product, but not a big deal.  Other than that, the room is fab.  House keeping is very good at keeping up with messy peeps (my husBAND), but we did have 1 strange encounter with them.  My husBAND and a friend went up to the room 1 night to drop some stuff off and when they opened the door there was a lady in there.  My husBAND assumed he was in the wrong room as the lady just looked at them and didn't say a word.  He went back to the elevator and retraced his steps and ended up back at the same door.  This time he knocked and the maid opened the door and simply asked ""May I help you?"".  She just gave my husBAND the vibe that this was her room and not that she was cleaning it.  He finally got into the room, but just left feeling weird about her being in the room.

We tried many of the bars and restaurants at The Cosmo and loved them all.  The room service food is a big miss, however.  Very bland and overly priced, but what room service isn't?

The main floor of the Cosmo is predominately non carpeted and very busy.  Someone had spilled their drink and my husBAND slipped and fell.  There were many employees around, but not one stopped to ask if he was okay or to find out what happened.  I guess they assumed he was drunk.  We had to go over to security and tell them that they might want to clean the spill up so someone doesn't get hurt.  This example is my only real gripe about The Cosmo.  While they provide good customer service when you ask for it, they are not very perceptive about someone needing customer service.

Oh...one more gripe.  We had booked our room on our debit card and given our credit card at check in.  When we left, our charges were charged to our debit card.  We called and were told that this is because this is the card we used to book and if we wanted to use a different card for charges we would have had to give the other card at check in.  WE DID!!!  Very strange, but whatevs.

Overall a fantastic hotel and I would definitely suggest it to anyone visiting Vegas.  However, I do think the Encore has The Cosmo beat in all aspects so I will no longer be cheating on the Encore.  Wait...The Cosmo does have a better location than the Encore.  It is right near the heart of the strip and you can easily walk to everything.  With the Encore, you have to cab it everywhere.  That is a HUGE plus, but still sticking with the Encore!!!",0,0,0

Before departing for home, we decided to swing by Wicked Spoon for amazing food and food coma for our flight! The night before we were just at STK and it was BOMB DIGGITY! (review will be up shortly). 

Before checking into Wicked Spoon, we checked in our bags to the bellhop, so they can store our stuff while we eat, and then we would pick up our things on our way out and depart back to the Bay Area. What happened next was NOT what I expected. 

When we got back to the bellhop, the person at the desk told us that our bags are being ""located"". 

After realizing that we were waiting for almost 30 minutes, I asked again, and then a manager told me that ""unfortunately our bags must have been delivered to a guest's room and that they were trying to locate them"". 

Realizing that we were about to miss our flight due to this mishap, I asked the bellhop Manager, Ross Nohara, what they could do to help us in this instance and they reassured me things would be taken care of. 

Ross, provided us with a $150 credit for FOOD\/Beverages Only (not for any personal use like contact solution, sanitary pads, tooth brush or paste, ibuprophen or anything NON-Food related) and put us in a room for the night until the bags are located. They told us that if the bags were not located by 7AM (our next flight time), Cosmo will FedEx the luggage to us. 

Hotel Resort Manager, Nicole (aka Margaret). After explaining the situation again to her, she had the audacity to tell me ""you guys would have missed your flight anyway"" and that they would be in no way responsible for our missed flight. We explained to her that they should help us pay for our flight home. We told Nicole that the only reason why we missed our flight is because they lost our bags. Nicole then rudely says, ""Did anyone promise you or say they will expense your flight or is that your assumptions? You're just assuming because we never told you that."" I didn't feel like arguing with her so I stepped away to call Southwest and THANKFULLY the representative who helped me, confirmed that they could rebook my flight without any penalties or fees. 

Thankfully, around 2AM, the Guest who received our bags called down at the front desk to let them know that there are bags in their room that don't belong to them.

I'm rating Cosmo, with ONE STAR. Nicole, being the Hotel Resort Manager, knowing the fact that the bellhop delivered our bags to the wrong room, having managers give us faulty information, giving us room credit but we couldn't use them on personal care items, and then not wanting to help us with our flight situation, you would think she would be equipped to handle the situation A LOT better. She could have checked her attitude at the door and tried to help us figure out this situation instead of letting us know right away that we ""probably would have missed our flight anyway"". 

1) I don't think that was professional 

2) They should have protocol for situations like this 

3) They should consider if they lost a guest's bags who had medications or personal care items that are absolutely needed, how would the guest survive an over night situation 

I really hope after this past weekend, their team puts a process and procedure in place so that others do not have to deal with this type of service.",21,5,4

I worked with their group sales rep (Sabrina), and she was awesome, she helped my group book over 10 rooms - all with great views, great prices, and even a complimentary upgrade to the Terrace Suite for myself :) One friend did request a different room, and she was accommodated until she was pleased. Sabrina also was kind enough to put our entire group on the same floor (without me asking), which made planning for the weekend so much easier. 

If you stay at the Cosmopolitan, make sure you make it to the Bond Bar for at least a cocktail, it really may be my favorite place in Vegas! 

The rooms are just spectacular, and that is mostly due to the amazing views of the Bellagio Fountains. Sure, this hotel is still new, and has a few kinks to work out, but everyone I encountered from the Dealers to the Bellman was warm, helpful and efficient. The Cosmo casino staff\/dealers were the most fun out of any of the places we went too - and that really does make a difference (although the tables do get pricey).

The bell boys are union and they have there own rules per their cba per the night manger and this is what the hotel goes by.

The rooms are super spacious, with generous water pressure in the bathrooms, a double vanity (in our double bed room), ample storage, killer strip views, and undoubtedly one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in.  I was ensconced in comfort.  It was so easy to sleep after a day and night of drinking, lounging, people-watching, and passing out on the bathroom floor.

By the way, I'M not the one who passed out on the floor.  But, I was able to take some of the lovely covers from the bed and place them over my wonderful friend who couldn't make it back the ten feet from the commode to the comfort of which I extol.  

The Chandelier is a MUST, as is grabbing a taco at the 2nd floor to-go counter.  And, if you feel like playing some games, head up to 3 for billiards, table games, foosball, and rec room atmosphere.  Lastly, take the lift all the way up to the top and hang in what promises to be a kick-ass pool experience come warmer weather.  Until we hit that time of year, chillax in the large jacuzzi\/whirlpool.

The room was a big bedroom, i dont know how they could consider it an upgrade! The pullout couch was stained with everything that can possible be on a bed and all the linens had holes. The 2 different roll a way beds they brought were the same! All they did was give us  a $75 credit. It took 3 hours to get 2 grilled cheese sandwiches for $80! It even got worse when we went to Marque club and were put in the hotel guest line which took 3 hours to get in. I could have just came early and paid and got in faster.

Arrived here Wednesday around 8:30 pm and waited 5 mins to check in.  Originally, I just booked one bedroom terrace but apparently they told me I was upgraded to terrace suite, for free!! They did offer me if I wanted to upgrade again to a wraparound suite for $50 but I declined...

The terrace suite was fabulous! (I believe the terrace suite rooms are all facing the Bellagio fountain)   Did I mention they have your own washer and dryer?! 
1 master bath and 1\/2 bath too! 
Also I love how they have HBO but the only thing bad about this hotel is no signal when I want to text or call 

Located FYI- One Bedroom Terrace and Terrace Suite are totally different so make sure you reserved the right room.  (Highly reccomend the terrace suite.)



Wicked Spoon is only good if it's your first time here otherwise, eating here too much can be a lil disappointing.  
The secret pizza joint is located on the third floor next to Jaleo and all you do is walk through a dark hallway and you'll see a video game in front of you then you'll know your heading the right direction.

We are Marriott Platinum members, so we were able to stay here on points.  Based on the points we used, our expectations were high.  Upon arrival, we were ""upgraded"" to a wraparound suite, but no fountain view, so naturally, we were very disappointed.  We had a view of the West buildings and part of the Southern strip, i.e. not much of a view.  The check-in process went smoothly since we were able to check into the special lounge area for Platinum members.  A typical concierge lounge for Marriott will have light apps, water, sodas, coffee and tea.  This had coffee and tea.  That's it.  The entrance to the room was nothing like I have ever experienced before--a long mirrored foyer that led into the living room and kitchen area.  There were two full bathrooms, one for us and one for the kids.  The kids had to stay in the living room--there was an L-shaped couch and also a lounge-type bed.  The ""kitchen"" is really just an over-sized bar, with seating and large refrigerator.  My first impression of the carpet and furniture is that this place is a bit worn down.  The carpets and couches were stained.  The couch was hard and uncomfortable.  The kid's bathroom had a huge shower.  The bathroom products were amazing and we asked housekeeping for more and they happily gave us a bag full of shampoo, conditioner and lotion.  The sunken tub was so amazing and there was a separate shower in the master bath as well.  The decor was a bit weird, hard to explain.  The bed was comfortable, but in the middle of the night\/early morning, without warning what so ever, the headboard came off the wall.  I called the front desk to report it, and strangely, a worker knocked on our door a few minutes later.  We told him we were sleeping and that the head board was sitting on the floor and we're not in danger of it falling on us anymore (it already fell on us once!).  The main fitness center was nice and we all used the excellent equipment.  I wanted to take a tennis lesson, but it was too hot, but it was definitely cool to see a rooftop tennis court.  The boulevard pools and jacuzzi were quite an experience.  You were swimming on top of a building, looking at the strip.  It is a pretty cool experience.  We ordered pool-side service which was friendly but pricey for chicken strips, fries and some fruit and soda.  We did not eat at the hotel per se since there were lots of restaurants located in the mall attached to the hotel (Egg slut, The Henry, China Poblano and Secret Pizza).  We went to the drug store across the street to fill up our fridge with water, soda and snacks to make up for the lack of concierge lounge.  Upon checking out, I asked the front desk about transportation to the airport.  I had thought they offered a car service for Platinum members.  The girl at the desk rudely told me ""NO"", stared at me and no other apology or explanation (her expression was ""Are you kidding, get out of my face).  I checked out Marriott chatter and other websites and others have said they do.  Very disappointing.  BTW, their slots were tight.  Complete waste and wasn't even fun.  I would much rather pay and stay elsewhere on the strip next time.",1,1,0

Complained about it at 4:00pm and they promised to clean by 6:00pm so we when out for dinner. Come back at 8:00pm nothing happened to the room. So we called again and basically received a set of fresh towels with the old ones on the floor. No cleaning for the day. They finally came the next day as well as the rest of my stay.  Comp me with some chocolate bars plus $75 dinner credit.  I expected a free night stand.

Thanks to my bf who gambled at the Cosmo a couple times, we were given comped rooms at the Cosmo for our last trip to Vegas in August. I've never stayed at the Cosmo prior and so I was pleasantly surprised with our stay. 

Check-in was a breeze and probably the quickest check-in experience I've had at any hotel. They also offered a $50 upgrade from a Terrace suite to a suite facing the Bellagio fountains with a jacuzzi tub. We passed on the offer since we figured we wouldn't be staying in our rooms for very long. The hotel clerk also mentioned that for hotel guests, entrance fees to all the clubs were comped from Monday-Friday! This is a huge plus for guys since it can cost a guy upwards of $75 just to get into Marquee on a Friday night! 

As we walked through the hotel up to our rooms, we saw many artwork and statues along the way. The whole feel of the hotel definitely caters towards the young business professional. Once we walked into our room, we were surprised how big it was! There was a tub, shower, bar area, living room area with a fold out sofa bed, and the main bedroom was separated at the end of the room with a king sized bed facing a spectacular view of Aria, and right below us was the pool. The entire room was beautifully decorated with ornate wallpaper, and Art Deco style artwork. 

My only concern for the room was that all the lighting were programmed in uniform so if you were to turn on the lights in the bathroom, the lights in the rest of the room would light up as well. This created a bit of a problem for us since my bf and I couldn't figure out how one of us could use the restroom without turning on the lights in the middle of the night to wake up the other person who's sleeping. 

As part of the hotel amenities, there's a gym and a pool area for guests. We were able to spend some quiet time relaxing by the pool, which I enjoyed glazing up at the spectacular views. The pool was separated from the day club so there were actual lounge chairs available without having to book a cabana. We didn't find the time for the gym which I'll definitely schedule for a short workout in the future since I heard they have a boxing ring in there!",10,3,4

As soon as you walk-in the front desk lobby is rows of giant floor length LCD screens that are so cool and chic that you literally exclaim, ""WOW!"" I love all the bar areas too, they are covered in chandeliers, it's sooo beautiful and classy...just FABULOUS!!!

I stayed in a suite with 2 full baths, full kitchen and a washer and dryer! I mean WOW! Rooms were beautiful and every room has a balcony with a spectacular view. It over looks the Bellagio watershow.  I LOVED IT! Room service was also delicious...I got a Nutella Stuffed French Toast with a cornflake crust uhhhhh YUM! 

The casino is smaller than the other hotels which I liked it more quiet, it made the experience more intimate and not crazy like the other casinos.  Most of the dealers are nice and fun too.  There's a small section next to a bar where they play loud music while you gamble and there are go-go dancers dancing on the table which was super fun...it just hypes you up even though you are losing all your money hahaha! I liked that the hotel did not stink of cigarettes too, they have a super fancy ventilation system.

They have Wicked Spoon as their buffet which carries a lot of items you don't expect to find at a buffet.  I loved the asian section, they put the fried rice in mini Chinese to-go containers and also have duk bok gi!! If you're Korean you know how rare that is to find at a buffet!  So they have an awesome buffet, room service and also an array of restaurants to choose from.  Whether your in the mood for a nice steak, sushi or a burger they got you covered. Do yourself a favor and find the ""Secret Pizza Place"" located somewhere on the 3rd floor and get the ""white slice"" YOU'RE WELCOME! I dream about this pizza and miss it dearly.

The pools are nice and quiet. The east pool ""The Boulevard"" is bigger and plays music but it gets packed and you won't be able to find a seat if you're looking to lay out because most of them have a drink minimum so try to get there early.  I liked Bamboo on the West side because it was one floor down from my tower and they had seats floating in the water you could just lay out on. It is a more chill smaller pool.

So we got pools, bars, buffet, restaurants...what else? Oh yeah they have stores to shop like a huge All Saints.  Then they have a walkway that connects to the mall across the street and Planet Hollywood.  If you need a Walgreens, that's across the street too.  What else you need? Oh yeah, if you want to go to the hottest night club in Vegas they have Marquee located in the hotel too.  I didn't get a chance to check it out, but the line was insane for it when I walked by.

Ok so I think I covered everything, all I have left to say is that if you want the best experience Vegas has to offer, you MUST stay at the Cosmo!  Seriously the nicest hotel I've been to in Vegas so far and will be the only hotel I stay at from now on.  I stayed 5 days and was soo sad to leave :( I didn't want to leave!

The Cosmo is currently the newest hotel on the strip, and it shows. Everything about this place is clean, sparkly, and awesome. The check in lobby is an experience in itself. The elevators are fast and efficient, and the casino is large and in charge. There's a sweet bar in the middle called the Chandalier, I think. It is three stories and boasts good bartenders that know their drinks. 

The boo and I had a terrace studio room, and it was well worth the high rate. It came with a super modern shower and soaking tub, and the best bed I've ever had in a hotel, hands down. Flat screen TV was awesome, and WiFi was good, even though you have to pay. 

Sometimes the front desk will give you a pass for the Marquee Nightclub. Use it and skip the douchebag line. The club itself gets its own review. 

There are plenty of stupid assholes here, but that's the whole strip. Also saw Joey Fatone at the Bond Bar, he was surrounded by his all male entourage, which tells you something about his sexual preference.

Also if you're into pizza, do checkout their secret pizza joint on the third floor in the east tower. It is adjacent to the blue ribbon sushi bar grill.  It is the best NY style pizza.",1,0,0

I loved the decor of the hotel, the ambiance, the food, the casino, and I loved that the waitresses kept the drinks coming when I was gambling.  The only ripoff was the Club Marquee, it was way overpriced and you could not sit down unless you got bottle service.  I could only last an hour before my feet in my 5 inch heels were screaming.  I say skip the club and hang out in the casino, the spa, and hit their buffet.  I was also able to book my husband a boxing lesson in the gym at the last minute as his birthday present, after the boxing lesson we were able to use the spa services all day at no additional charge.

While the vibe is super hip & trendy and you absolutely can't beat the atmosphere in the casino, I wasn't THAT impressed with the hotel itself (meaning the rooms & service). 

I think the conference room rate was $190\/nt, which got us a room literally at the end of the hallway. No balcony, 2 queen beds (an upgrade to a King would've been +$75\/nt), and not even motorized drapes? 

I've eaten at Holsteins, China Poblano, and Secret Pizza....overall they have a nice variety of food options and of course there's lots within walking distance at other resorts. For conference-goers, my fiance says the catered food they served her group was quite good. 

While it's nice that Cosmo doesn't have a resort fee, now I'm annoyed having to pay a la carte for all the stuff I have now come to expect. Want internet? $14\/day. Want to use the gym? $20\/day. I'm used to paying a resort fee at every major hotel on the strip, I'd rather you just charge me rather than feel like I'm getting nickel & dimed to death. 

Final nuisance: none of the dealers\/pit bosses wear name tags. After a few drinks I like to get chatty with my dealer, it's common courtesy to at least know their name.

We VIP'd our way into the fancy check-in and rode the VIP wave through the weekend. A friend snagged one of the giant suites overlooking the Bellagio fountain which served as our pre-party homebase. My three companions and I shared a much smaller but still awesome room with a great view across the Strip. The hotel\/casino is a glossy glitterbomb. Great people watching, including ourselves most of the time. The highlight is the bar in the chandelier, aptly named Chandelier Bar. I have to wax girly for a moment: it is so pretty! I wanted to live in it. And not just for the booze.

We partook of much of what Cosmo had to offer. I'll break out the resto\/club reviews separately:

The Henry: Solid brunch. Pricey but everything tasted great. Knowing that I had a sequined body-killing dress to fit into, I engaged in the one moment of temperance for the weekend and got a salad. And a bisque. Hello, I AM a total fatkid. Also had artichoke dip. Yeah. Sorry Vegas dress!

Blue Ribbon: With the Vegas dress left in the dust from the previous evening, I ordered about a billion rolls of sushi. Actual size: Four. But they were giant and awesome. I wish I'd gotten sashimi so I could tell how great the fish was, but being the aforementioned fat kid, I instead got....fried chicken wings! In a bucket! Seriously. They were terrific. Also of note: This place has really fancy saki bombs where instead of pounding on a table, you just pull a shot glass out of your drink. Not as fun, but still got me pretty schwasted.

Marquee: I can't even. It's....no words. Just images. Party warehouse. Blue drinks. Plastic cups. Glittery pool. Paris Hilton. Fuck you dancing. Europeans. No tomorrow. 

Well, there was a tomorrow, and it wasn't pretty. At least for me, who woke up on top of the covers, fully clothed in last night's sweaty tutu, sleeping next to an almost naked gay guy. Granted, he was my favorite person ever after the weekend, but still. Not auspicious, to say the least. The only thing to do was hit up In-N-Out and get the hell out of dodge. 

Vegas weekend = success. In the words of my deceptive blue cocktail companion: Adios Muthafucka!",6,6,5

My first impression of the hotel was great. The check-in processes was relatively easy and the girls which greeted us with bottles of water was a nice touch. I won some quick cash and headed up to the room with a smile on my face. We also got upgraded to a really high floor which was a really nice considering the view of the Bellagio fountains. 

However, after the initial excitement, all the tiny problems started to unravel. At first glance the room looked nice. But then... cigarette burns in the carpet, old gum on the floor, dirty pants in the closet?? Then we noticed that the glasses had white residue (picture old milk). I called concierge which put in a request to get them replaced, to haul away the pants, and we requested a roll away bed. Two hours later no show from house keeping. I called again, they tried to connect me with house keeping, and after being on hold for 7 min I hung up. I call concierge and they apologize that they didn't inform me two hours earlier that a roll away is not available for my room as it's a fire hazard. I ask them to at least come with new glasses and to remove the pants. 30 min later a guy shows up to take the pants... still no glasses. Finally (HOURS later) clean glasses arrive. Wow... I don't think you can encounter service this bad at a holiday inn. 

The next day I found out why the glasses are dirty... I witnessed the maid give the a quick rinse in the sink. Sanitary?!?! 

Additionally, outside of the amazing Marquee, the cool chandelier, there's really not all that much to the hotel. I'd rather stay at Wynn\/ Encore or Aria.",4,1,1

When we went to Marquee (the club there) we checked our coats and had to wait in line for THREE HOURS to get our stuff back and they still couldn't find one of the coats! We then went back the next day to try to get it back and that took another three hours. The staff there is poorly trained if at all and no one has any idea where anything is. They didn't refund our coat check money nor did they do anything to reconcile all the time and cab money spent we wasted at this godforsaken hotel. The decor is maybe the only cool thing about this place. Walk through for ten minutes and that's should be the extent of your Cosmopolitan exposure.

The decor is great. Very artsy and colorful. But some things are definitely out of place, and the designer definitely had some kind of foot fetish. I'll leave it at that.

Note: I did not stay here. So I can't comment on the rooms or stay, but I did gamble and eat\/drink here and that was a very positive experience. Their restaurants are definitely up there, and their bartenders were all super approachable. One even made me a champagne cocktail because he heard me say, ""I 'm craving a champagne cocktail but I don't see any on the menu."" That's awesome.

My only complaint, the place is totally confusing to walk through. It has about 3 or 4 floors and they're all split in different directions and what not. Not really ""user friendly"" if that makes any sense. But apparently these were supposed to be condos before the decision was made to make the Cosmo so that explains it a bit.

Pros-
1) great design.
2) awesome energy! Their demographic seems to be late 20's-mid 40's mainly.
3)Great location.
Cons
1)THEY NICKEL & DIME YOU FOR EVERYTHING. Again, if your paying $350-$1000+ a night, how about a coffee maker in your room?
2)Service is no where near Aria or Wynn. Again, not a problem unless you are charging the same prices.
3)restaurants are just average for Vegas. Vegas has become the Mecca for celiberty chefs. STK is all right, but Mastros is way better & Right next door Aria.
4)No poker room? Come on.
5)valet sucks! We left at 8:30 am on a Wednesday and had to wait 55 minutes for a cab! We asked what the deal was and the manager told us a convention was leaving and most cab drivers take off Tuesday & Wednesday. Really? You knew you had a few hundred people checking out and did nothing to prevent the disaster that took place? Several people all around us missed their flights. 5 diamond my as$!

It baffles my mind that at this stage of evolution Vegas has redefined itself yet again by the addition of the Cosmopolitan or as the locals will label it: The Cosmo

The Cosmo is different........  I say different because, unlike the normal Casino\/Resort that was once only a place to gamble and enjoy cheap drinks and subpar restaurants the Cosmo seems to hit on every single level.  Not only is almost everything from top to bottom world class, but everything inside is an experience! The selection of restaurants cause you to think outside the norm and break free of the traditional menus of cafe, buffet, steakhouse.  Each chef takes pride in playful spins on traditional menu items.  You can experience fusion in burgers and shakes at Holsteins; French & American classics at Comme Ca; sexy steak at STK; Sushi and fresh Surf at Milos\/Blue Ribbon; and Hispanic Ethnic fusion at Jaleo.  

The casino has several lounges; not bars.  You can expect fresh ingredients and upscale cocktails with areas to mingle around every single corner.  Pre-porhibition style cocktails with style throughout the entire property.  The spa is world class with services never before seen in Vegas.  Maybe the best part of the resort; the rooms.

Almost every room has a balcony with a great view of the Vegas strip.  Some rooms even come complete with a kitchen as the original concept of the Cosmo was a condo-hotel.  If you want shopping you can have a suit created for you while sampling fine single-malt scotch at Stitched.

This place offer something different as I stated before.  It's a breath of fresh air and fresh fun to Vegas.  As someone who grew up here in Vegas I'm overly joyed to have a place like Cosmo leading the charge in a new wave of thinking and a new wave of having a blast in Vegas!",3,0,2

My boyfriend's good friends decided to get married somewhat last minute on Valentines Day at the Cosmopolitan, so we chucked our plan of a romantic weekend in NYC and headed to Vegas, sigh.

The hotel made our stay a happy one. The check in line was long (typical Vegas) but we were eased through with efficiency and quickness to the VIP lounge. Wilbur was kind enough to not only have a room ready for us at 11am, but to also upgrade us to a terrace studio on the 39th floor overlooking the Bellagio water shows. Thank you Wilbur!

Service everywhere was wonderful--housekeeping, Luis in Guest services\/Engineering, and especially Niki (former bodybuilder) who worked in the Fitness Center and showed me how to correctly use one of the machines, and even printed out kettle bell exercises for my boyfriend.

The Marquee nightclub was cool, and we really enjoyed Rose.Rabbit.Lie, their new supperclub\/nightclub.  The night we were there we danced to a hot female DJ with random performers popping up intermittently--a rapper in a tux one moment, a 3 piece marching band the next.

We ate at Wicked Spoon (one of their many restaurants) on our last morning. I felt like I was at Disneyland, because there was one long line to prepay for the buffet, and a second long line to get into the restaurant once we paid. Both lines went pretty quickly, and once we sat down we were not disappointed. Our server Will was incredibly sweet and never rushed us through our meal. The food was wonderful and many of the dishes were served in individualized pots\/dishes, not just from a large chafing dish, as is usually the case with buffets.

I'm usually the travel on a budget kind of guy, so this was a little indulgent, but I was dying to stay here and I was super duper impressed.

Now, a parking garage is usually not that interesting.  Leave it to the Cosmo to win your affections with trendy wall art by Obey and parking spot indicators to let you know open spaces available.  If there is a red light over the spot- it's taken, green of course means, go.  No more circling the lot hoping to find the closest opening like an idiot.  Unless you're colorblind, this was a genius idea.

From the moment you walk into the hotel, you know this is going to be an experience unlike anything else.  First, the air is not stale and smokey.  Instead, it smells fresh and clean and you don't feel like your suffocating in a chain-smoking old lady's car.  That not enough?  Visual displays line the walls with cool artwork and the furniture looks as if you're in a loungey nightclub versus a hotel.  Just speculation, but this could be one of the main reasons why the demographic of the patrons seems to skew younger.  Not rowdy fraternity type, but more like younger businesslike professionals.

A nice hotel room to me is the Monte Carlo, so this was a huge upgrade.  We got a Terrace Suite and OMG.   A living area, a bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and walk in shower with seating, flatscreen televisions in your living room and bedroom, a plush micro-fiber L-shaped couch, a full work area, half kitchen, a private balcony overlooking the strip and a bed that felt like clouds.  It took every ounce in my being to not leave the room during the stay.

If you're the clubby type, they have Marquee, a popular Vegas hotspot right on premises.  During the day, the pool definitely fills up as top-40 gets blasted over the speakers.  We didn't get a chance to try it, but the Cosmo's buffet, Wicked Spoon,  is supposed to be one of the best in Vegas.  I will definitely have to check it out upon my next visit!

Hotel is gorgeous!! The rooms, pools, casino's and restaurants were beautiful. For the most part the staff was great. However there were a few that were not so great and will make me second guess staying here again. 

I am a larger woman and let's just say felt discriminated against a little at the pool area's \/ restaurants. I shouldn't let a few ignorant people change my experience yet they also need to understand that regardless of appearance, sex, sexual orientation, etc our money spends the same and EVERYONE should be treated equal. If you don't want to do that... you should not be in that line of business.

Side Note;  I emailed the Resport Manager about my negative experience on 07\/13 (today is 07\/21) and I have yet to receive any kind of response.  I was not looking for any credit or freebies, just acknowledgement of my concerns.   Poor Customer Service Cosmopolitan - So disappointing!",2,2,0

---I am updating my review now that I am at the end of my stay.  Unless you call to have room service pick up your food, it will sit in your room or in the hallway for over 24 hours.  Housekeeping will not put it outside.  And I couldn't figure out how to unlatch the table or I would have put it outside myself.  I had very loud drunk hotel guests on my floor.  One of them was fighting with his girlfriend outside my room.  I walked outside to see what was going on and the guy had puked in the middle of the hallway right outside my door.  I called security and also housekeeping who said they were on their way. It's been over an hour and the drunk guy is gone but the vomit is still outside of my door.  It smells and its gross.

They saw that i was drunk and thought i would be an easy target. I very clearly and explicitly told them i wasn't interested but these skanks just kept going and followed me all the way to my room. Why is security allowing these people in to the casino at all, let alone allowing them to follow me all the way to my room??? These girls were doing everything they could to get into my room so they could rob me blind and the hotel is allowing them to roam freely around the place. A day later, i was playing blackjack and saw two more OBVIOUS, dirty, rat-like ghetto hookers just roaming the tables at 7am looking for any drunk mark they could get their claws in to.

The problem for me with this hotel is that it seems to be aimed at 20-somethings, which I'm definitely not. If you want a hotel that's very slick, modern, and hip, this is probably the hotel for you. If you don't like super-busy, noisy places, or want something more understated (I know, it's Vegas), go elsewhere. 

My biggest complaint was with a weird, periodic noise in my room (it almost sounded like a vuvuzela) that made sleeping very difficult, and the service I received to deal with it. The first time I called about it, no one came after about an hour, at which point I left. The second time, in the middle of the night, the engineer couldn't find the source of the problem, but the front desk wouldn't move me. Finally, later that night, when I still couldn't sleep, I called again, and they agreed to move me to a different room (which was quieter but still not very, due to nightclub music).

The fitness center was nice, but I don't know if I'd call it 5-star, and the Wicked Spoon is a decent buffet, but nothing compared to the Mirage's.

We were upgraded for $50\/night to a one-bedroom suite with a terrace overlooking the Bellagio fountains and Paris Las Vegas. Gorgeous suite with a huge living room and bathroom. 

The Wicked Spoon was fantastic for brunch. Few of us paid for drinks, but we were all served unlimited mimosas, champagne, and bloody marys. Both the Chandelier Bar and Bond Bar were beautiful. The theme of the hotel is basically pink and sparkly, which is exactly what I love. Each drink cost between $13-17, so pretty expensive. We also got drinks IN the jacuzzi by the Boulevard Pool!

Since we were hotel guests, we were able to skip the line and get in for free at the Marquee! The best part was the huge patio\/pool area which gives you a nice break from the cramped dance floor.

 The one thing they really need to work on is service in the hotel rooms. Losing 1 star because the mattress in the pull out bed smelled of urine and we weren't able to get anyone's attention that night even though we were told continuously that someone had been sent to take a look at it.

It's different than any hotel I've ever stayed at and is delightfully a little trippy. This marks my 4th separate time staying at the Cosmopolitan. I'm not a crazy gambler, just happen to have conventions here on a regular basis. This is a fantastic place to have conventions. Every time I come, I recognize how much better this hotel is for conventions than other convention hotels. 

Let's dive a bit deeper into the pros and cons of this hotel. You'll notice that I didn't give it 5. There are a few things that are consistent and could be taken care of. For one, although the lobby is fantastic and welcoming there is always a line to check in. It usually takes 10-20 minutes of waiting in line and being mesmerized by their animated pillars, but nonetheless after a long flight and holding all your luggage you don't want to wait in line for anything. When you do get to the front of the line, the people checking you in are always fun and helpful. It is apparent that there is some kind of issue with their check in computer because every time they're confused by my reservation. We always get a roommate and almost every time they have to ask for help to get the right name on the reservation. Overall, the process is painless but it's still a little annoying to have the same problem multiple times in a row. 

Next is the room. Getting up the elevators and having a fun and personalized key card makes this experience personalized and fabulous. The elevators are fun and quick. The first impression of your room is also quite trippy and fabulous. The beds feel like clouds and often you have a view of the water show.  This may not be the style of a room that I would decorate my house, but it is very sexy, fun, trippy, and comfortable. I especially love the showers. If you have a random roommate or are not here with your +1, make sure you have the screen down! :) If you're sharing a room, make sure that you take showers a bit a part because they're prone to drainage issues. Very annoying there is no coffee in the room. Very annoying that they'll charge you if you touch the snacks\/mini bar. 

Convention- service and food has been top notch every time I'm here. The wifi is free in the main events and it is an ideal place for around 800-1200 people. I absolutely LOVE the Chelsea theater as a concert hall and a place for a key note speaker. I saw Brad Paisley and the acoustics were fantastic as well as providing an intimate feel. One of my favorite concert venues of all time. The lighting is excellent, acoustics spectacular, lots of places to sneak away for a good conversation, clean and large bathrooms, and an overall great atmosphere. 

Bars- Marquee is fun and keeps up with this whole theme. The Bamboo pool is fantastic. There are lots of fun shops, restaurants, and terrific modern art that decorates the halls. I'm a big fan of this place. I had an issue in my room this last time and they took good care of me. I'm not going to go into details because it was taken care of in a swift manner and I'm already over it. 

Overall- excellent hotel for a convention, fun place to come on vacation if you have the $$ for it, and a terrific place to see a concert. It's not perfect, but this themed hotel is one of my favorites.",0,0,0

I've been going to Vegas for years, and there is always a churn of what is the place to be, and what is growing old.

For me, the Cosmopolitan is where I want to be in Vegas these days. The Aria, next door, looks great on the outside, but on the inside is just sort of blah - that said, The Aria seems great for a large number of people, and I'm probably just being snobby.

But The Cosmopolitan even passes my strongest snobbery tests.

Location-wise, it is excellent - between Bellagio and Aria\/Crystals. The interior decor is fantastic - cool art, moving video installations, and even the parts that sound like they would be tacky (huge multiple story hanging crystal chandelier bar) are actually pretty cool.

Bond bar is tiny but fun (gets crowded fast on weekends) with its go-go dancers, Vesper by the check-in is great for people watching. The Henry has 24 hour food and isn't too expensive (although I'm sure you can find the same thing cheaper in another casino), and the decor is great in there (if you like leather couches). Holsteins has great higher end hamburgers and milkshakes with alcohol (not great for families, I guess).

All of the bars in the place make good cocktails, if you want that sort of thing, or they can do the standard well drink sort of thing if you don't care (one time through I just wanted the standard Vegas ""diet Red Bull and Grey Goose"" and they did that all night for us - the past time through they put up with my snobbish requests for a better old fashioned.

The room was so much bigger and nicer than I expected as well, which was great as I just got the cheapest thing they had at the time. Two decent sized flat screens, a balcony (from the outside, you can see not every room has one - but I didn't pay extra for it, so not sure how that works). Huge shower\/tub area, and a kitchen area with a mini-bar. Couch area, office, and then you have a $25 a night ""resort fee"" that gets you wireless everywhere in the casino.

There is a three person concierge area for the normal people, and then also a Platinum and VIP area with more features if you are one of those types. They can help get you into shows\/clubs.

There is a big club in the casino, but that isn't really my thing, so I don't know how that is. From my room I could see the big pool, but it was too cold out to use - was on the roof of a lower level (either 4 or 14, don't recall which).

That said, they dropped the ball in a few spots:
1) check-in lines were crazy on Fri-Sun (no idea why Sunday was crowded) - even though they have over 10 lines to handle people and even some self-check-in terminals
2) the gaming area isn't amazing (not really a concern for me, as I'm not huge into gaming) - but their slots don't fit in with the decor and are sort of lame, and just not a huge gaming floor (I didn't check out their poker room on this past trip, but that is usually my main thing - and to be honest, I am not sure they even have one)
3) some days, room service never came by (to their credit, we didn't call down and ask either)
4) someone stole our ""do not disturb sign"" and the hotel never put it back (to their credit, we didn't call down and ask)
5) even when room service came, they didn't always replenish the shampoo and the like, and didn't always put away the iron\/ironing board (the latter is actually fine by me, as cleaning staff always empty the iron when they do that, and I'm lazy and don't want to refill it)
6) one night the elevators didn't work to go down - we were on the 36th floor, so stairs were not a fun prospect - but they happened to have someone on the maintenance staff there to let us into a back elevator for staff

Not sure if you can request it, but I think the higher up you are, the better - as some reviews talk about the nightclub being loud - we were too high up to hear.

It will be my casino of choice for now for sure.

And please, please, please don't bring your kids here.

I really dig the Cosmopolitan!  First off, free wi-fi!  I don't know if it was intentional, but I was able to get free wi-fi anywhere on the property except the conference areas (near the buffet).  It's like a really big, fancy coffeehouse that has gambling and alcohol!

Also, I really like the art-o-matic machines.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=A-WVio3dtFfMLK_vAi_o4w  There are supposed to be six on the property.  Two are next to Monogram (just next to Holsteins) and another two are just outside the buffet.  I'll have to hunt down the final two. Each machine has different art for sale inside for only 5 dollars.  If you are looking for practicality, one of the machines had fan pulls for ceiling fans.  I went completely impractical and got a bearded bunny, which is essentially a block of wood with a bearded bunny painted on it.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=4eKNtvWYCBty3LyMOLLy7w  But it's so awesome!  I'll be hitting up these machines every time I visit.  The machines only take cash and will only take $1 or $5 bills so be prepared. 

The public art scattered throughout the place is pretty awesome as well.  If you can bear to be away from the free wi-fi for a while, check out the art in the conference area.  Really cool, big high heel shoes(http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=T0D70Wvlsj3pmh1pOdtU_Q), stonehenge-like dogs (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=wXqlz0vFleLXG2hMlm30tQ), and other great things.

Sooo many restaurants, it's overwhelming.  I'm a little concerned that any property can support this many restaurants.  Nothing that I would consider a high-end, special occasion restaurant but everything looks good.  It's gonna take three foodie crawls to make it through them all.

I'm happy this property came to town and looking forward to visiting it whenever I can tolerate going on to the Strip.",3,3,4

None of the other hotels had this distinct smell. It was fruity? Can't describe it....you'll just have to go there and take a wiff at what I'm talking about.

Being one of the newer hotels, I expected nothing less. The decor is gorgeous. From the moment you enter the the hotel and throughout the entire place, you will find very chic decor and furniture. Of course, the chandelier was the main attraction. The staff is great and the restaurants in the hotel are awesome! The secret pizza place and Wicked Spoon are a must when staying at the Cosmo. Also, the Boulevard Pool is sweet. It's a day club in itself! Very very chic and spacious, and I love the idea of having a cold pool, a warm pool, and a hot tub.

The room was...average. It was pretty small but we had a gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountains, so we were able to watch the show from our room. The one thing I disliked was the window to the shower. There's a full length window that has blinds only accessible from the OUTSIDE. This means that to whoever is taking a shower, they better pray that the people sitting on the beds outside the bathroom aren't dbags. Unfortunately for me, when people are drunk, all reason flies out the window, and I found myself yelling at one of the guys who pulled the blinds on me in a drunken stupor. Also, I figured out that if the light in the bathroom is on and the lights in the bedroom are dim, you can see every silhouette in the shower. Makes for awkwardness. Feel like this window feature can do more bad than good....

Anyways, great location on the strip, close to all of the other great hotels, and has a lot to offer. Definitely a great hotel.",0,0,1

Highlights: The view from our room was amazing.  It is, in my opinion, the best view on the strip.  We stayed (after complaining about the view in the first room) in a fountain view wraparound suite.  We had a view of the strip and the fountains.  I have stayed in a penthouse suite at the Bellagio hotel with a centralized lake view as well as a stay at the Skyline Terrace with an oversized terrace at the MGM.  I would give the nod to the Cosmo.  

Lowlight number one:  The Cosmo is for folks who do not need to interact with hotel representatives, management, guest services, etc.  It is for folks who want to drop their luggage, head out, come back home and repeat. If you, on the other hand, need anything from the hotel, you will be disappointed because you will be given misinformation and poor customer service.  For example, I was very disappointed to walk into my room and see that the hotel does not stock the kitchen with forks, knives, spoons, pots, or even pans.This is very disappointing because it's the reason we chose to stay at this hotel. We spent $100 for breakfast food believing we would cook breakfast and eat lunch and dinner out. When we requested pan's etc., we were told that they didn't provide it anymore. So, we were forced to order breakfast in. I had a casual conversation with the guy who brought in the breakfast and asked him when did they stop providing the pans? He said they didn't, all you have to do is ask. So, I told him we did ask and they said they don not provide these items.  He then said well, I don't want to get into it if that's what they said that's what they said. So we called down to get clarification and was told that the first lady gave us the wrong information. So, now I'm really irritated because I ordered $100 worth of room service when apparently I didn't have to. By the way, the pan finally came about two days later. I had to ask about five times.  What pissed me off is that every time I would call to request it, they acted like it was my first time calling.  No note of my previous request.  Anyway.  

Lowlight number two, which was actually lowlight number one, is that I was called and told my room was ready.  But, when I got back to the hotel and called the bell desk to help me with luggage (we were changing rooms) I was then told my room was not in fact ready. So, I had to make more calls to management just to be told I was given the wrong information from the bell desk.  My room was ready.  

Low light number three:  I was given a $50 dining credit because the hotel just couldn't get things right.  Unfortunately, upon checkout, they did not apply it.  When I called to find out why, they said that there was ""miscommunication"" and they would make sure my 50.00 credit was promptly applied.  

Lowlight number four:  One of the ladies was very rude during my phone conversation. She was not able to deal with someone who was upset. You would expect this kind of hotel to have staff who are trained in the ability to de-escalate, listen, and resolve. Not be offended because the customer is upset.  She even had the nerve to tell me that talking to a supervisor would get me no where because they ""empower"" their employees and back them.  

Low low light number five:  When we checked out early morning, the bell guy who brought down our luggage walked in and said, ""What up G"".  Um, excuse me.  That's so unprofessional.  If my last name is Williams, address me as such.  It's actually pretty sad.  

In the end, I would likely not stay here again. We stayed at the Bellagio in Oct 2015, in a penthouse fountain view suite.  The over all service was excellent.  I felt like they actually cared about my stay and appreciated the fact that I chose them.  Looking down at the fountain crowd looking up at me wasn't bad either.",0,3,0

I have never been so grossed out with a hotel on the strip and this is one of the newest ones. 

Really? Really tho? 

I called the front desk and they understood that it was unexceptable, but all they could give us was a $75 credit for food and drink... I guess... But I had to ask for that credit... If not they weren't going to do shit.

I lived in Vegas for a few years and over those years had the opportunity to stay in several nice strip properties.  NONE of them begin to compare with the Cosmo experience.
I had booked a Terrace One Bedroom Fountain View on a 25% off advance purchase deal so I was feeling pretty good about what I paid for 3 nights.
Upon check in, I slipped the clerk a $20 and asked about upgrades since we were getting married.  
I was upgraded to a Terrace One Bedroom Suite for $50\/night.  Still felt like I got a decent deal overall.  Then I saw the room on the 56th Floor and realized I got a STEAL.  The 1-bedroom\/2 bath room had a huge balcony overlooking the fountains, and a kitchen (which obviously NO ONE uses in Vegas).  The bathroom was huge and had a nice, jetted tub and a big shower.  
We actually got married on the very roomy balcony overlooking the fountains (which I highly recommend if you hate the tacky chapels like I do).  LOVED OUR ROOM
The service at Marriotts in general has improved vastly in the past 5 years.  The service at Cosmo is the best of the best without a doubt.  I felt pampered our entire stay, and I didn't get the impression it was because of my room status or Marriott status.  We tipped well, but overall, we just got great service at every turn.
The property itself is gorgeous.  Modern, but with a vintage luxe kind of feel.  
Staying here truly makes you feel special.  Spend the extra few bucks.  
Personally, I'll never stay at another property on the strip again.  Cosmo has ruined me for strip resorts forever.",2,0,3

However, my stay here was disappointing enough to blab about.

Hubbers and I were here the night before we checked in to meet with people (who were already checked in) for a few drinks before the big event the next day. 

It is both our first time here. Although valet was free, we decided to park our car ourselves. Took the elevator to the lobby, and the very first impression we got soon as the elevator doors opened was: THE SMELL. 

It smelled like someone passed gas, somehow reproduced itself to a ridiculous scale and just... LINGERED. 

Luckily, we were able to walk through without having to pass out. 

We decided to hang out at the sports bar to watch a few games. Got a comp'd drink as we played on the poker machine. (TIP: If you play\/bet enough, the machines will spit out free cocktail coupons!) And then... a different kind of smell. It is the smell of various people marinating in their colognes. 

Granted, that's not the hotel's fault, but there's gotta be a way to make the vents handle this! 

MOVING ON! 

We came back the next day to check-in our room. We decided to valet this time as we needed a porter for the luggage. Walked in through the doors and the odor wasn't so bad. 

But the deeper inside the casino floor we got, the more the stench made itself obvious. 

Early check in was given to us (YES!). I also decided to upgrade the room to get a balcony as well as a Jacuzzi-style tub. Then she says, ""There's also a mandatory $36.00 hotel resort fee."" 

This sucks, by the way, because this hotel resort fee includes:
* Fitness center access - DIDN'T USE IT. We didn't have time.
* Sporting facilities or equipment - DIDN'T USE THAT EITHER. See above.
* Internet access - COULDN'T USE IT AS THEY DIDN'T PROVIDE A PIN. 
* Phone calls - THE PHONE WAS BROKEN IN MY ROOM. We had to get an engineer to fix it.

We had to prep for a wedding soon as we checked in, so we didn't have time to use said facilities paid via the hotel resort fee. But I understand: THIS IS VEGAS. (How about just charging those who actually use it!) 

Made our way up to our room and there go that familiar scent from the night before. Walking through the hallway to our room was almost tormenting. It's like the walls and carpeting were with defecation (human or otherwise) then cleaned with cheap disinfectant!

But! The room was fantastic. It was crisp, clean, CANNOT complain about any weird odors...

Checked out the next day via the TV remote. 

We rarely visit Vegas, but... Hubbers and I agreed this would be on our ""DO NOT STAY HERE!"" list. The stink was just too overbearing.

(I find it funny some of the reviewers actually work there LOL)  I went for the first time this weekend to see Damain Marley and Nas in concert.  Now, JUST pulling in to the hotel was already a bad experience.  I am pretty sure that the guys who designed this place (both inside and out) were on acid when they did it, and just scribbled on some paper.  It was worse than trying to figure out a labyrinth.  

I valet a lot, and even before I had ever been to the Cosmo, I was warned by a couple of different friends that the valets have a tendency to steal.  One friend actually had his iPod Touch stolen out of his arm rest, and they refused to do anything to replace it.  Anyway.  I pull in to valet to see ""Valet Full.""  Okay, that's weird for a new, hip, hotel but it happens.  My boyfriend rolls down the window to ask about self parking, and hears a worker tell another patron say, ""No, it's not full.  There is just no valet at all."" Huh???  SO we go to the parking garage and the sign says there's 100+ parking spaces, buuuuut there were none - on more than one floor.  The garage itself is poorly designed, as if they just tried to fit as many cars into one tiny space as they could.  Parallel parking spaces in a parking garage?  Seriously?  It took us almost an hour just to find a spot.  And that's just the parking.

When we walk into the hotel, it is gorgeous.  The art is digital, hip and pretty cool.  The chandelier is AMAZING to look at.  Aesthetically, the Cosmopolitan is very pleasing.  However, that's about all the props it gets.  I asked a worker where to go to pick up tickets, and they said ""I don't know.  I think the pool is on the 5th floor, though."" (Despite the sign right next to him saying that it's on the 4th floor.)  Apparently, ""I don't know"" was the phrase of the night for most of the staff, because nobody knew anything.  Two people actually directed us to Marquee after I asked them where the Boulevard Pool was.  Some of them didn't even know about a concert at all.  Communication much?  After asking 8 different people (no exaggeration), and 30 more minutes of walking around, I finally found ONE man who told me where to pick up my tickets.   

Did I mention the inside is just as much a maze as the parking garage?  The escalators are not close to eachother at all, and I felt like I was going in circles.  I was dizzy by the time I reached will-call.  Needless to say, chances are, I will not be going back.  For a place that is supposed to be new and hip and for all the hype it gets, that's all it is - hype.",0,2,0

Most hotel rooms are so bland, tiny and uncomfortable, I can't stand to be in them. I was really impressed with our room here.
Stayed in a fountain view room; awesome views and the balcony is a nice extra! 
Room is comfortable, with large bathroom, separate lounge and bed areas with their own TVs. Mini kitchenette, microwave, fridge and a selection of over priced drinks and snacks. Unfortunately the fridge is stocked with drinks, leaving no room to keep anything you bring cold. We called the front to have someone sent up to take items out so we could actually, you know, use the fridge! Well, they don't do that- not that I was surprised by this. They did however comp a 2nd mini fridge and a staff member was up with it within the hour. Nice customer service! In fact all staff we interacted with were fantastic and accommodating. 
The crowd at Cosmo is young, cooler than I, and very much the 'in crowd'. We certainly stood out in our Levi's and Tshirts :) But I did enjoy the people watching!
We ate at Secret Pizza and Wicked Spoon; both were fantastic!

Brilliant art installation in the lobby, even though it stopped working a few days after I arrived

On with the bad stuff:
My room and those of others in my party had bathtub poltergeists that would cause a single jet or two to go off in the night. Not making this up. And it was LOUD. 

The nitwit that checked me in never bothered to activate my key cards.

Let's see...it was overpriced--I'm sorry, but you can't charge that much for a hotel just because you're next to the Bellagio!!! And at least the Bellagio understand that there are certain times of day when you lower your table minimums. The Cosmo had $25 blackjack at 11 AM on a Sunday.

We decided to check out The Cosmopolitan during the day and do some gambling. Walked in and I fell in love! This place was very hip and modern looking. It had a real nice vibe to it. And had some great table games. 

Fast forward to that evening. 

Having had a great time during the day we decided to return at night to check out Holsteins and Marquee. It was a madhouse. I have never seen so many ppl crammed into a hotel space. Everywhere you tried to walk there were mobs of ppl and the bathrooms were the filthiest I have ever seen at any major hotel (even casino royale had cleaner toilets). The line for Marquee was insanity it wrapped around the entire 2nd floor...there were lines for VIP's, lines for Guests of hotel , and the regular line for everyone else. I have never seen so many lines to get into a club. 

Luckily there was no line for Holsteins. The hamburgers were pretty good and the Beer Menu was exceptional. Monk's Flemish on tap! Nice.. 

Marquee was a no go because the line was just too damn long. 


We returned the next day to gamble some more. Once again it was a nice relaxed experience. 

Next time I am in Vegas I plan on staying at Cosmo. I'm not going to let the entire filled over capacity and nasty bath rooms experience ruin what could potentially be some of the nicest rooms I have stayed at in Vegas.",0,0,0

The rooms are huge. Even a standard room is plenty big enough for you and they are well kept and clean.

The soaps and amenities are nice. If you're day drunk like me you'll end up with a suitcase full of shampoos and colored pencils from the housekeeping cart.

The casino is glitz and glamor at its best. It's not cheesy at all. It gives you that Las Vegas glam but with a New York twist.

The various bars along with the waitstaff will be more than happy to get you a drink.

The spa is amazing and both gyms (one in each tower) are great. One gym is 24\/7 and one is open until 8pm. Ask at checkin and they will put you in a tower of possible that's closest to the gym you want. You'll need it after knocking back all those beers and the buffets.

Don't stay anywhere else. It may be more expensive than other places but the quality is there. The service is there and really, this is a place you can spend the majority of your time at and not even leave. Stay here. You won't regret it at all!",6,4,6

The third level is where all the restaurant and food court but in the middle of the room is a waiting area with a pool table.  It's like an upgraded sorority or frat house with class.  The top level is where the pools and cabanas but they wow you with fooseball table, flat screen TV, and gorgeous layout of where you can lounge.

Check in staff was rude and it took over 4 hours to get our room.  We spent most of our stay in the lobby discussing with staff their failures.  room we got when we finally got it was filthy and gross.  the room was not clean and bed was not even made.  Scale was broken in the room so we could not weigh our luggage.  We paid extra for a wrap around terrace with a view and they did not have that available so we got a 1 BR but we had to fight with them which was absurd.  Floors were filthy throughout our entire stay even in the hallways and outside the elevators.  I actually could not believe how many problems there were given some of the reviews - service was very spotty more to the poor than the good hence the rating.  if you are going to spend money don;t do it here.  I'm not sure the view was worth it in the end.  If I ever return to Vegas I will never stay here. their customer service is just lacking in too many areas.  Lights did not work took 4 phone calls to get it fixed over 2 days, terrace was not cleaned laundry left in the washing machine the entire stay that was not ours.  there was food in the fridge that was not ours when we checked in.  The only thing that went well were things that we had arranged prior to us coming to Vegas.  Don't expect that the concierge will give you even close to the correct information or that you will not have problems with their arrangements.

We checked in around 4pm midweek and the computers were supposedly down according to the girl behind the desk. She did not know how to work the room key machine or the ipad at the front desk. Finally, the ""manager"" came over and figured out what she had been doing wrong right away. Seriously? It might be a good idea to teach your staff the basics on how to check people in.

So we got to our room, I had paid for a one bedroom suite with the premium view. First problem.... we were on the bottom floor facing a building that was not the skyline described on their site. Second problem... the room was dirty, puke stains on the entrance tile, no toiletries, dirty glasses and hair in the bathroom. So we called the front desk and they told us to come down and change our room. They also tried to make us think this was the room we paid for... until we talked to the manager again who corrected his staff member. This has happened before at other hotels, and they immediately apologized and offered food or other comped amenities. Instead, these people tried to cover up their mistakes by making excuses.

Ok... so we get in the room we paid for. Really nice view, awesome patio, comfy bed. The room decor was a little cheesy for a luxury hotel. If planet hollywood and mgm had a baby.. this would be it. I was expecting a posh and upscale decor for the rooms, not old vegas carpet and doors. They definitely cheaped out on the rooms for sure.

After watching it slowly get built over the years each time I visited Vegas, I got more and more curious as to how it would turn out; it's construction itself is a roller coaster of a story in that it nearly didn't get built due to the project running out of money *stuff that you don't care about but I'm telling you anyways* But at last, it opened and I anxiously awaited my opportunity to stay at probably the most glitzy and tacky hotel on the Strip. My chance finally arrived earlier this year.

Parking is around the CityCenter so we all know how that goes -- hope your gambling hot streak begins as soon as you pull onto Las Vegas Blvd because you're gonna either have to know where to go exactly or be incredibly lucky. Walking in, I have to admit I was pretty dazzled at how obnoxious the decor was -- it's loud, it sparkles...hell, it might even make your eyes bleed. But look at what city you're in -- it works and it is impressive, even if your corneas get burned.

Check-in was a breeze; the columns with the shadowy people is a little creepy. Kinda wish they changed that as that was not sexy at all to me...more like creeperish. And I'm a dude. Anywho, we had a wraparound suite which was just sized perfectly for 4 adults. Decor was a bit more downtempo than downstairs; definitely pretty funky. It also was clean, so fortunately I didn't feel like I was gonna contract an STD when I sat down on one of the couches. They also had a leather lounger by the balcony door which was amazing and I want one for my bedroom. The master bed was very nice as was the shower, but doesn't offer much privacy. Secondary bath was just as nice albeit smaller, of course. The kitchenette is pretty boss and you could easily kick back and cook all your dinners yourself if you so desired (but why would you when you're surrounded by all the great eats???). Our view wasn't the best, but we did get an offcenter view of the Fountains from a corner suite facing northwest. I'm afraid of heights so I didn't spend too much time on the balcony other than quickly peeking out and running back in; we were in the 40s for floor level so staying out there for very long was a ""hell no.""

Location is pretty good in terms of being central, layout isn't too weird or anything, staff is nice...my only real quip with the hotel is the relatively small casino floor. I like me some space when I'm tossing dice and it's cramped in here, especially around all the pit games. Yah, I know...Cosmo was supposed to be condos only so they weren't going to even build a casino but still...it's there now and the space sucks.

We also ate at Scarpetta (reviewed separately) and the buffet ain't too shabby. Didn't check out the other amenities (pool, spa, etc.) but I can say Cosmo is up there in terms of LV strip ranking; another reason for taking off a star is the pricing -- a tad too high, even by Vegas standards. Is Cosmo the best? Certainly not...but if you can get in a room at a decent rate, I doubt you'll be complaining too much.",2,3,3

There were cigarette butts and ashes all over the balcony. Glasses with last night's unfinished whiskey on the sink. The microwave wasn't clean. There were items in the safe. And according to her, the toilet was not cleaned enough. Yuck. She asked if she could return with a cleaning staff member and that she would supervise them to make sure the room is cleaned properly. Since we had a dinner reservation that was coming up soon so we said ""sure.""
Dinner ends. It's midnight now and we're tired from day's work, the flight and the night's festivities. We're walking back and looking forward to showering and relaxing in what is (despite it's uncleanliness) still a luxurious room. However, we return to our room to find a dirty broom left leaning on the sink counter and that we have no toiletries what-so-ever. I call and ask for toiletries and to tell them they forgot their broom, lady says she'll send someone up right away. ""Right away"" turns into an hour and still no sign of toiletries. My girlfriend calls to ask again and 10 minutes later, I open the door to an angry man who says nothing, storms into the bathroom, drops off a handful of toiletries and on the way out, he asks in an irritated tone ""is there's anything else you need?"" my girlfriend comes out and tells him he forgot his broom.
Since we were only staying for one night, we requested a later check-out time when we were checking in. They allowed us to check out at 2PM instead of the standard 11AM. Great. Around 12PM the next day, the phone rings and the most rude woman tells me what time standard check-out is and has the nerve to condescendingly ask me if I know what time it currently is.

I booked a wraparound terrace suite with fountain view for my girlfriend and I on Valentines Day, it being her birthday as well. I booked the room a few weeks in advance to avoid occupancy issues and hoped that would give me a better room location. Seeing the room online, I wanted to visit it in person before my stay which was very easy to do thanks to the concierge department. I went to visit the room about a week before my stay and it was fabulous, great view, very spacious, beautiful bathroom. The room I visited was on the 36th floor. On the day of check in I called about an early check in and they said you can come check in but it doesn't guarantee an early check in because it was a premium room, so I went and checked in early hoping the best. They ended up texting me that my room was ready at 2pm, saying my room number and floor. The room they gave me was on the 19th floor, which was not what I was expecting. So I called and they said it was because of room occupancy and they only can guarantee the room, not the floor it's on. That was okay but I wanted it to be a great view as well as a great room so when I arrived at the hotel I went and talked to the hotel check in service and they were able to put me on the 28th floor which was better. When I got to the room it was all like the one I had visited besides two things: the ashtray on the balcony wasn't emptied from the guests before which is not that big of deal but I don't smoke and thought it was a little gross and it should've been emptied, and the pillows for the couches on the balcony were laying on the floor. I was okay with these but getting woken up at 3am by construction or work trucks on the street was not okay. I wanted to leave the balcony doors open for the nice weather outside and I did so, only to be woken up later that night. I'm not sure if being on a higher floor or not would have changed that but I know it would've been worse if I was still on the 19th floor.

My cousins and I stayed at the Cosmo for a joint 21st birthday celebration. This hotel has this modern, glamorous and intimate feel to it as opposed to plain ol' glamorous many newer hotels have. And lemme tell ya, modern and elegance creates a very 5-star experience.

The hotel appeals to a younger, hip crowd with its modern stylings and classy decorations. Older guests, tourists and families are obviously welcome, but don't expect to feel a relaxed and old-fashioned vibe many other casinos hold.

Upon check-in, we decided to upgrade our rooms to Terrace Studios (2 queens) with a view located on the west end. The hotel rooms were a bit on the smaller end, but nonetheless given that Cosmo touch: modern with the glam & glitz.

It should be worth noting that the Cosmo sacrifices comfort in exchange for atmosphere. Our room albeit incredibly fancy did not have that comfort and homey feeling I've experienced in other hotels. Is it a bad thing? No, not exactly. But it's something worth pointing out.

Also, the room I was staying in was fairly dirty, something I wasn't expecting from such an extravagant hotel. There were spots and dirt in the bathtub, questionable marks on the floor and, the worst of them all, disgusting stains on the balcony chair pillows. We couldn't remove them either since they were attached to the chair, so we had to flip them over and deal with them. Yikes!

However, aside from all the dirt, our party decided two key factors that made our stay pleasant: the balcony and the convenience.

The balcony in the Terrace Studios is amazing. If asked, I highly recommend upgrading to rooms with views facing the fountains. You won't regret it. The view is absolutely breathtaking and makes the perfect picture-taking opportunity for any time of the day. There's just something about soaking in the view with a drink in hand that really adds on to your experience at the Cosmo.

As for the convenience, the Cosmo is located smack middle of where all the action is. It can be hard to leave the hotel since everything you need is in the hotel or near the hotel itself. Need cheap dining options? Right across the street are some fast food restaurants. Need to pick up a few items from the store? Walgreens across the street has *almost* everything you need (for the right price, anyways).

Staff here are friendly but a bit slow. The front desk did manage to send people to our door whenever we needed something, but it wouldn't arrive until maybe half an hour to an hour later.

Casino is nice. Definitely not as much variety with the slots, but there's a respectable amount of table games. Tables are especially hot at night.

All in all, the Cosmopolitan is definitely worth checking out. Everything is decked out in a chic and elegant flare, something only the Cosmopolitan could only pull off. As for staying at the hotel itself, it's worth staying here at least once. Just like their tagline, the Cosmopolitan has just the right amount of wrong.

By the way, have you guys smelled the hotel's second floor near the west end elevators? It smells like soap. So good. They should sell candles with that scent. I'd buy 100.",2,1,1

Truly things technically small but things that you should appreciate.  Once you get inside doesn't dissappoint as well;  the chandelier bar is so exquisitely gaudy in how it fits so perfectly in this place and if you meander around enough you will find little things here and there that will remind you that you're in Vegas!  From the 8 foot high heels you can take a picture in, to the random but beautiful pictures on the walls (my personal favorite is the chocolate covered high heels), the experience will not dissappoint.

Back in the day I stayed at the Sands.   More recently the Venetian and Four Seasons.  My experience at The Cosmopolitan far exceeded my expectations.   

From check in with Mark who came out from behind his desk to bring us forward, engaged us in personal and proffessional conversation, offering us upgrades and still getting us swiftly through the process.  To every food and beverage stop we made.  Chris at The Henry where we enjoyed two excellant breakfasts.  Jayme at the Vesper bar.  Outstanding.  Had a great lunch by the pool as well as an excellant dinner at China Poblano.  We even had a great experience at the Secret Pizza.  And we didn't even check out the finer dining choices.

The rooms.  Beautiful!  Huge!!  Balconies!!!  A real rarity in Las Vegas.  Well appointed and spotless.  we had a room two away from the elevator which I thought might be a noise issue.  I was aware the The Cosmopolitan has a reputation for having a younger crowd.  Never heard a sound from the hallway.  

Again, myself and my husband, together and separately, travel to Vegas every year.  We will be staying at The Cosmopolitan from now on.",1,0,0

However for both stays, the rooms were great.  The first one had a deep Japanese style bath overlooking the strip (the shower in the middle of the bathroom was a bit interesting I guess it was so you can shower immediately after the bath).  But the room itself was very nice and comfortable.  Always a necessity when you visit Vegas with a non-partier or non-gambler.

There were minor glitches (leftover pizza crust found by Apricot) bellman who after being tipped left the cart in the luggage room even though I mentioned that we were leaving directly).  Overall, having the pet area on the 14th floor instead of the hustle and bustle of the main floor was fantastic!

The regular prices are too steep for me considering I have a lot of offers for free accommodations when I visit Vegas at least three times a year for family events.  The availability of various restaurants were good but pricey except for the Secret Pizza joint tucked in between Jaleo and Blue ribbon sushi.  And the pizza was delicious but I feel awkward eating between the pricier joints.  You can order a whole pizza to bring back to your room.

If you get a great deal and want to stay at a nice newer place, give The Cosmopolitan a try! They always have good deals online on non-holiday-or midweek stays.",6,2,4

So many beautiful details decorate the hotel. Art everywhere. And their color scheme is my favorite color. The most memorable and breathtaking element is the chandelier lounge. It truly is a must-see and it's a great place to hang out at before Marquee since there is a good amount of seating throughout &  you can actually hold conversations with your friends. My group & I did exactly that on NYE until Marquee was able to let people in again (they were at capacity for over an hour & weren't able to let anyone in until later). We had an amazing time.

My friends had a room here and it was nice but personally, the Wynn properties are still my favorite. Still, Cosmo is no chopped liver by any means. There are lots of restaurants & little shops yet to be explored. Self parking system is up-to-date: number of spaces on levels display on an lcd screen & little lights above spaces shine in green to indicate a free spot.

So it's safe to say I am definitely not what you'd call a ""Vegas person."" However limited my knowledge of contemporary Vegas may be, even I have seen those creepy\/cool commercials when the Cosmopolitan launched a couple of years ago (set to Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's ""Spread Your Love"", thumbs up), and their tagline ""Just the Right Amount of Wrong"" is pretty cheeky and intriguing. Plus I'd heard about their pretty impressive art collection and that seemed like something worthwhile to see. If I were to want to go to any hotel in Vegas it'd probably be this one. So when a friend's bday came up and we wanted to do something pretty special we decided on a Vegas weekend at the Cosmopolitan. From the moment you enter their parking structure you know this is going to be a cool experience. The walls decorated with work from some of the most renowned contemporary graffiti artists? Check. The lobby that looks like an airport from some luxe future? Check. Modern, comfortable rooms with some interesting touches like a glass wall in the shower that can be revealed by someone opening blinds from the outside? Check! 

The four of us shared a City Room in the West Tower that had two queen beds and one bathroom. Two sinks though, which was a plus. For being their basic room it was pretty darn nice. Loved the comfy beds and the decor, and the fantastic view from our 50th-story window looking down on the Bellagio fountain! But thumbs down on the pay WiFi ($15\/night for two devices wtf) and minibar and snack tray with sensors that will charge you if you even move the items around! We were given a helpful warning by the guy who checked us in so we avoided that trap. After unpacking and freshening up we decided to take a gander around the place and we were suitably impressed. The casino is an afterthought in this place, which was great because that is the tackiest part of any Vegas hotel, as far as I'm concerned. We blew by the noisy blinking machines and the tables and headed up the escalators to check out their shops, restaurants, and bars. We decided to save the Wicked Spoon buffet for the next night and instead opted to go try out a couple of different eateries, like China Poblano and Secret Pizza (individual reviews to follow). There was even an artist-in-residence gallery that had an interesting exhibit called ""Exchange Your Luck."" They have all kinds of interesting contemporary art everywhere, actually, and it added a lot to the experience for me.

The next day we checked out their Ice Rink, which was one of their pools frozen over. As such, it was pretty small and not really worth skating on, but it looked like a lot of kids were having fun. It was one of the few ""kid"" things at this place, as this hotel is geared more toward adults (which is one of the reasons why we enjoyed it so much, truth be told). We had a good time watching the skaters as we sat around one of the many fire pits drinking spiked cocoa drinks and making s'mores--it was a chilly day and it was a nice way to while away a couple of hours in the afternoon. We spied a jacuzzi in this pool area and we were thinking some hot tub time was in order. We were hoping the pool in the West Tower was open, but alas it was not, which meant we had to trek across to the East Tower in our robes and towels, lol. We drew some stares walking past some of the shops and stuff but at least we didn't have to walk through the casino! The jacuzzi was REALLY nice, and we got warm enough to not loath getting out. That night we decided to go to the Marquee nightclub for our friend's bday celebration, since it was in the hotel and all. There was some superstart DJ in town so the club was packed, and even though we thought we'd secured free entrance for all of us via a connection, turns out it was only for the wimmins--they still wanted the guy in our party to pay $50! Craziness. We all managed to get in and have a good time, but I really feel no desire to go back if I have to pay :P Whew, all in all an amazing weekend--I definitely wouldn't mind coming back to this hotel if the opportunity presents itself again!",5,4,6

With balconies facing The Strip and The Bellagio fountains, hosting a club as grandeur as Marquee, fancy blue lights on the side of their hotels that just scream ""LOOK AT ME!,"" and all the cool little touches in every room, what's not to love?  They even have jetted Japanese bath tubs and a nice relaxing shower if it's not your cup of tea.  Even the lobby looks cool with their columns of ever-changing mini-movies and artsy displays.

While Cosmo is definitely modern and swanky, the staff here isn't as friendly as some of the other places.  I think the fact that they work in the coolest and newest hotel on The Strip has gotten to their head.  Pretentious much?  Cosmopolitan appeals to the younger crowds with their trendy glamorous ambiance.  Girls in short skits and stripper heels and guys looking douchey, this is what Vegas is stereotyped for, babes.

However, this weekend my wife and I were victim to the harsh reality of being at the wrong place on the wrong night...

We had spent the evening blowing hundreds on drinks and food in the casino bar and at Marquee nightclub. There were two sheriffs standing guard outside the nightclub, but ironically everyone inside was very nice and it was a great experience. The problem came when (inebriated and tired) we were leaving the casino for the night.

Just steps from the valet area near the restrooms, a young man appeared from nowhere and grabbed my wife. She is very pretty, so attention is common but being grabbed while standing next to a 6'2"" 250 pound man is not. She reacted as you'd expect, shying away from him and looking at me for help. When I pushed the man off her and said ""get your hands off my wife"" I was punched in the face and the next thing I knew I was on the floor. Looking up I saw 4-6 men lurching for me against hotel security which, thankfully, were all over these guys and I DO applaud them for that. We quickly walked out the exit and were rapidly followed by two men in suits that encouraged us to leave and not come back inside. I was inclined to go find the two Sheriffs upstairs who are obviously posted there exactly for this reason, but was not allowed back into the casino.  When we got back the Mandalay Bay, I got on the phone with the Cosmo hotel and though apologetic, they did little to follow up. 

The crew of hoodlums that provided my wife with unwanted touching and me a trip to the shiny floor seconds from leaving were allowed to continue on into the casino and go molest and attack more people. Calling the police was worthless, they literally gave me the impression that I can walk through the Cosmo grabbing women and socking people for fun.  Unless at 4am you want to go file a police report that most likely (considering all the bigger problems the police have in Vegas) would go unnoticed, I feel a need to warn others that this happened and that there were zero repercussions for the incident. 

Knowing that this whole thing is on Casino cameras and nobody sought to stop the group, grab the police to prevent this happening again, or send a message that you can't get away with behavior like this in the Cosmopolitan is pretty deflating... and to any doubters out there, I'm not leaving anything out. I realize that these guys might have only seen me push this man off my wife in the same way that a surfer realizes he might look like a seal to a shark. We still seek ways to keep aggressive animals away from the general populace... especially when you have them on film, and swimming in your private property.",9,1,0

I like how the towers are not too far away from each other (unlike at the Venetian-Palazzo) - key if you are staying with other friends in the hotel. Also liked that parking is readily accessible from both towers and reception, and the vibe is more modern. The selection of restaurants in the hotel was $$ - my favorite was Momofuku Milk bar for the corn cookie, Wicked Spoon, and the Chandlier bar.

However, the upgraded suites are not that impressive as they are still not as large as a regular sized room at the Venetian, and comes with a small, oddly shaped and uncomfortable tub. If you choose to be upgraded those rooms only come with a single King sized bed (no double queens).",5,1,3

Wow, well-appointed rooms, great view, the hotel decor a little eclectic, with chandeliers that I could swear were partially fabricated out of chicken wire sprayed white, but really interesting.  The view was amazing.  If I weren't a local, I'd truly feel like I was straight-wired to the pulse of vegas in that room. I liked the mirror columns in the lobby that reflected pictures as if there were built-in monitors in all of them.  Oh so soft bed sheets, almost enough to skip the night of gambling and roll around in them; so-so toiletries but a great bath\/shower.  Not all of the restaurants were open. We chose Holsteins before gambling.  We started with the lobster corn dogs which i recommend and gobbled up but too few of them. I ordered the traditional burger plus aged blue cheese...i'm a sucker for hi-end stinky cheese. my date was not in an original mood so stuck with the basic traditional, which he said was perfectly medium cooked.  I'm not a burger connisseur, but the service was spot on and the food was Great!  After gambling the obligatory amount a local should, to do their share to contribute to the local economy, we had breakfast at the Wicked Spoon Buffet.  I am rarely off from work weekends for breakfast.  That said, would I come back here? Absolutely.  I really liked that the majority of the food stations served individual-sized serving dishes of each entree.  I did not have to pick the freshest looking entree among the cafeteria sized serving pans.  They were served individually.  My eggs benedict was perfect with fresh hollandaise.  I also liked their eclectic flair of brunch items with a multi-cultural flair.  I saw hummus, figs, dates for the middle-eastern taste. The fruit was as fresh as fruit can be pre-season.  A wonderful buffet, altogether.  Time will tell if they can keep it up.    The only downside is that it is quite a walk from your hotel room.

My only complaint is that the remotes for the tv tend to be a  bit wonky and sometimes just plain difficult in doing what you want them to do. 

The casino itself is only a 3-4 star casino though. It's a great place to hang out late night and watch the prostitutes pick up on the businessmen. Gambling's okay. Most of the games are between a $15-$25 minimum. The casino bar (and by that I mean the drinks you get while your gambling) has skimped back a bit and although they serve fat tire which is great, how do you not offer new castle?!

First off, they put a hold on my card for twice what my room rate was because of ""incidentals""  which caused me to lose most of my gambling\/fun money.  Then they refused to deliver my bags to my room unless I was in the room.  I was in town for work and had to meet with customers as soon as I got off of the plane.  It makes no sense that the cleaning lady can be in my room with no supervision, but the bell hop cannot.  I understand the guy wants a tip, but I left a note  with instructions AND a tip just inside the door.  This is a horrible policy that caused me to look bad in front of a client because I was unable to change clothes after my flight.  I could go on for days about how horribly that place is run, these are just two of many problems that I had the weekend I stayed.  I will not be going back.  Ever.

The rooms are huge! We received an awesome balcony view of the entire strip! You can't beat it, especially at

I stayed here on a Monday night, was upgraded to the 47th floor Terrace suite. Cool. The room was nice, no complaints here but the hotel service loses some points. I called for more towels and it took an hour and a half and 3 phone calls for someone to come.

Got free night at this hotel due to my Marriott Rewards points and decided to use it before it expires.  It costs 70,000 points for one night and i have to pay for the differential, which came out to be $250 for the whole stay, still not bad.

Arrived into the Valet and they quickly took my car and helped me unload with Bell Hops.  The line to check in was kind of a wait, but what Hotel isn't on Vegas on a Friday Night?  The check-in staff here is pretty awesome, they walk up to you and shake your hand?  Pretty class stuff.  The guy was personable and gave some good tips on how to make the most of my Vegas trip, and he upgraded us to a better section of the hotel away from the noise.  I tipped the guy for his service.

Got to the One Bedroom suite on the 31st floor overlooking the pool and Aria, it was awesome to say the least, very upscale and sparkling new.  Dumped our jackets and was literally about to walk out the door when the Bell hop knocks with our luggages, they were johnnies on the spot with it.  Usually Bell Hops take a minimum of 30 minutes to get your luggages to your room, scored another point.

It was around 11pm and we were starving, hence the rush from our room.  The Bell Hop recommended Holsteins, a chic Burger joint downstairs and we thought we'd give it a try.  The Burgers were legit and they even had a live dj in the restaurant.  The only bad part of the restaurant is that it was a little too loud, I dont enjoy having to shout to my gf asking how's her burger.  Other than that, well recommended restaurant.

Played at the only two Pai-Gow tables in the whole casino and minimums were $50, so i decide why not.  The GF looked bored while i was gambling away so I put a $50 down on the spot she was sitting on, the dealer said you can't have another person play for you while you have an active hand, but the dealer said , ""alright, just one hand."" So she picked up her hand and said.....slowly pulls out four 5's! She landed a four of a kind on her first hand and everybody around us just went NUTS.  I was high fiving the dealer and his pit boss came over and ask whats going on, I think the dealer regrets making the one time exception.  I still tipped him out to ease the pain of getting bitched out by the boss.   Talk about beginners luck.

Later that night when we tried sleeping, its true you can definitely hear the club music banging away even on the 31st floor.  But im a heavy sleeper and i play music when i sleep so it was a plus for me.  The rooms had a bubble bath, with no bubbles provided (bring your own, i guess), which is rare for a Vegas hotel.

Closing Statements: You should definitely stay here at least once, its the hot spot in Vegas, at least for the time being.  One side note, you do not accumulate Hotel points at any of the restaurants like you usually do at other Marriott properties, just an FYI. I walked away up $200 bucks, requested late check out at 12pm ( the front desk staff didn't give me a hard time, they just easily extended the checkout like THAT when i called at 4am in the morning).  We did express check out in our room and bypassed the 30 minute wait.  We will come back here again once our schedule permits.",4,2,2

It takes time for a hotel (or any other business) to hit its stride and figure things out. But at what point do a few mistakes cross over into incompetence? Try as I might, I just can't think highly of The Cosmopolitan. The staff are uniformly delightful people and claim to be very concerned about customer service. And I do think the concern is there - just not the execution. Various things in the room were broken and took forever to get fixed. It was our last night in Vegas and we lost at least 4 hours waiting around for staff to come fix things, waiting for them to work out the bugs in the check-in process, and waiting for our waiter to bring the dishes he forgot. Brilliant - just how I wanted to spend my evening. Then the phones weren't working so we had no way of calling the concierge. The TV remotes didn't work properly either.

Given what it seems like average prices are generally, I'd go with ""probably not"". But I certainly *enjoyed* having one night of much more luxury than usual in a hotel (which I obviously repaid them by spending quite a lot at their various super-delicious restaurants and bars). 

Anyway, apart from what the price would have been had we paid for it (they didn't even charge us the resort fee, which I totally expected they would), everything was pretty close to perfect: checkin and checkout were painless and almost instant (sad they couldn't get us a room facing the fountain, but I didn't *expect* they would), the room itself was gorgeous and crazy spacious, the bathroom was huge (with a super deep tub), the bed was incredibly comfortable, the balcony was a nice fun touch, the location is perfect, parking was seamless with my status card, and obviously, I love being surrounded by totally amazing cocktail bars (I enjoyed trying several new drinks from several different Cosmopolitan bars, and they were all awesome, especially the two off-menu drinks the bartender made based on my feedback in The Study - really nice being able to drink a bunch and then just take the elevator up to your room!).

Every employee was helpful, and in general, I really just have a couple minor complaints. The big one is that, even 50 floors up, I could hear the BOOM BOOM BOOM of the stupid trance music from the party pool 50 floors below - would be nice if rooms facing that direction were a lot more sound-shielded (thankfully it was only for a few hours, and I was away from my room for most of that time). I also had a couple minor complaints about the bathroom - notably, that while the frosted glass looks super cool, it also lets a ton of light through right into the bed, which is unfortunate if you're using the bathroom while sharing the room with someone who's sleeping. Our bathtub also started randomly turning the bubbles on while it wasn't in use (or had any water in it), which was a bit odd, but that's a lot more likely to have been specific to that specific tub, and to be fixed once they get a few complaints about it. The other two are more general, though.",3,1,1

When we got there we requested a room with a view of the Bellagio Fountain.  They said we had to upgrade to a room with a view.  An extra $25\/night and we got upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite with a view of the Bellagio fountain and Paris.  GREAT idea since we barely wanted to leave our room the entire weekend! :)  Bring bubble bath, thank me later. :)

The hotel is a haven for the hallucinogenic mushroom trippin' fans.  (not that I would know personally)  Every corner you turn has something cool to look at.  Every elevator you get into, has you staring at the wall as something is melting right in front of your eyes.  

Every time we left our hotel or our hotel room, we wanted to come back.  

Cosmopolitan has it all.  Great lounges to chill at. Awesome restaurants to dine at.  Shops to shop at.  And I think there's even a casino, though we never made it in there.  

There's also a few clubs, but again, we didn't make to any of them.  We did make it to the pool a bit, and then decided the private ""pool"" in our room was more fun.

You get over all of the glitz and glamour of the hotel fast because right away the customer service at this hotel is noticeably dysfunctional.

We stayed at this hotel because my brother was getting married in Las Vegas. He would have had it at the Cosmo but because the hotel lacked any services for weddings and were so unorganized plans fell through. If I was to tell that whole story I would need another review. 

Back to my stay here. We checked in on Wednesday. Checking in at this hotel is a daunting task. They have 3 main lines, since the lines are so huge there is no order to falling in line. You end up standing next to someone else, and feel anxious because there is no one there to greet you and show you which front desk person you are in line for. We get up to the front and the front desk guys are messing around because they are hitting on their manager, giving her cat calls. So unprofessional. Then just as we are about to get our room the whole system crashes! I get that it's not their fault, it happens. We are then told to come back, not even at a specific time, just when ever. 

We get our room. The rooms are nice and spacious. We had a premium view room that overlooked the fountains, it was great. Since the system crashed our phone in our room was not working either, we wanted to call down for our car. Come to find out you can't call down, you have to physically go downstairs and let your ticket get scanned by a machine. Other than that our room was clean but unfortunately two rooms from our party had issues with their rooms. In one of our friends rooms the toiletries were not replaced, they had half used shampoo and conditioner bottles.  In my brother's room they had absolutely no face towels in the whole room. They called housekeeping but no one ever came. Then when my brother got the wrap around suite on Sunday housekeeping did not clean out their fridge. They had left over stuff from the previous occupants. Now I am not so sure how clean the rooms are. 

Another major issue with this hotel is the lack of unity. Everyone in the different departments points fingers at each other. We were told that we could use our room key to make purchases or play in the casino. Once we get into the casino we are told that we have to sign up for an identity card. I go over to the Identity membership area and the lady tells me that I don't have to get a new identity card, and that the departments are having a contest to see who can get the most people to sign up, if they win they get a bonus. So in the end the customers get screwed cause now all their points are dispersed amongst a whole bunch of different  member numbers, so you can never really get the proper compensation.

What's with the hot ass elevators? They do not have air conditioning in them! By the time you get to your floor your sweating!

So this is not even the worst part of our stay here. The worst customer service came from Chris the manager at Concierge. My sister in-law and I decided to go talk to him because she felt unappreciated, the hotel new for sure that they were getting married that weekend and did nothing to make them feel special. Not even a bottle of champagne and a note sent up to the room. They were spending quite a bit of money at the Cosmo. First off hosting a spa day for a party of 26 people, as well as a 14 course dinner at the Blue Ribbon restaurant also inside of the hotel, lastly having a room block at the hotel so a majority of their 100+ guests stayed here. Since most of us were staying here we wanted to see what the rules were for us to get into the Marquee. As guests you are allowed two comped entrance fees to the club. We were told by Chris that only girls can get in for free and that our male significant others who are staying with us will only get a $5 discount. Also, that it's not really guaranteed if we get in, it's up to the Marquee to decide because they are a separate entity! Okay I get that but he can't make a call to speak with anyone to see what can be done to assure that our guests get in? It's like they don't work with the owners of the Marquee at all!!! So, I was over that whole thing and asked him if he could do anything for us at any of the bars that Cosmo owned and he said that he can't do anything for us at all!! AT ALL!! His condescending attitude and tone pissed us off. We asked him for upper managements contact info and he told us he can't give that to us either! He said,""It stops here!"" You would expect better service from the concierge manager, they are supposed to be the ones that try to go above and beyond, but I guess not at the Cosmopolitan!

The hotel has so much potential but it's sad that they can't get their customer service together. I never plan on staying here again. I'll go back to eat at the restaurants, they had good customer service....probably because they are separate entities from the hotel",11,0,0

Some of the high points of our late-January visit:

* The room: massive, with balcony overlooking the Bellagio fountains and jacuzzi tub with same view.  Best hotel room I've ever stayed in --  I love the turn in the economy that turned condo units into hotel rooms.  Combine all that with The Best And Most Essential Vegas Invention Ever -- the 8PM Checkout -- and I'm hooked. 

* The overwhelming casino\/lobby\/entertainment areas, with the 3 stories of ""chandelier"" spilling down and enough big-screen morphing art displays to evoke Blade Runner (but with more class, less rain, and fewer androids).  

* The staff.  I don't know if it's just that they're new in their jobs and aren't all jaded yet, but it's nice to find a place in Vegas where the employees make eye contact in passing, smile, and throw out a lot of ""good evening sir.""  Our favorite, however, was sports book bartender Jennie, who always managed to detour us from wherever else we were going -- and who would shoo away people from smoking at her bar.  Which leads me to...

* Cocktails.  You know how casinos will begrudgingly slide you a few Bud Lites while you play video poker?  At the Cosmopolitan, it's top-shelf martinis, some of their amazing custom creations, and a beer list with selections from Belgium (and Stone), not begrudgingly poured, either.

* The patrons and fellow guests.  Helluva lot classier and better mannered (and yes, I'm using those terms in the Vegas relative sense) than in the surrounding resorts.

* Marquee and one of the restaurants (soon to appear in another review...)

And now for the why-not-five-or-six-or-seven-stars reason:  too many quirks to make this a seamless, effortless, fine time.  

You'd think after being open a month they'd have time to shake the bugs out of the system.  But we still had to deal with:

* A shower with water pressure that would cycle from full stream to a dribble on a routine basis,

* The 8pm checkout leading to room keycard issues, the type that inexcusably took a couple trips to reception and 20 minutes to resolve.  When the staff fumbles with the keycard machine, gives you a total of three keycards (""try these two, and if they don't work, try this one"") you know they're not ready for prime time.  

* Maid service, who took the generous tip left for them but didn't clean up the room.  Huh?

* And using the TV and a TV remote in the room to control everything from lights to temperature was an annoying (and occasionally cold and dark) process. Plus one of the TV's wouldn't even get TV.

Still, I'm giving the Cosmopolitan another chance -- and probably many more chances.",4,0,3

-  the casinos in Las Vegas really need to go smoke-free.  it's sickening and my eyes water, burn and sinuses clog within 10 minutes of enduring the air quality.  in NY we tax the hell out of people dumb enough to smoke, so it was a shocker for me to see so many people puffing away on cancer sticks.  I wish the hotel staff would at least consider keeping the lounge area next to the concierge area smoke-free.  Also, many idiot parents in Las Vegas bring their infants into the smoky casinos.  INSANE.  WORST PARENTS IN THE WORLD!

My friends and I were in town for a bachelorette weekend, and were treated like cattle- completely expendable.  

Hotel itself.... The front desk was difficult, and not willing to honor the free upgrade we had received, instead they insisted on trying to uncharge us for what we had already been promised, and that I confirmed when I called the hotel prior to our arrival.  There is not a fridge that is for ""personal use"", it is strictly a weighted mini bar, so if you take anything out they will charge you.  They offered to clean it out for a fee, or bring another fridge up for a fee.. The air conditioning was pretty poor, and our room was extremely humid. The wifi that is supposedly included in the resort fee wasn't working. 

Quite honestly my biggest complaint is that because we were a group of young women who were completely capable and willing to pay for our own beverages and food, we were ignored.  We weren't interested in 'flirting' with the guys in order to get them to spend money, and for that reason we were blown off. 

At the vesper bar our server we didn't see our server for 30 minutes after receiving our first drink. 

At the Marquee day club, we reserved a cabana, so that we would have a server and be able to order food and drinks easily.. Our server convinced us to order water ($48.....) when there was already complimentary water in the mini fridge--which she told us after the fact, and then ignored us in favor of the men in the cabana next to us. We complained to management, he said he would send her over..she didn't come by.. we complained again, he asked us what we wanted and said he would put the order in himself.. 10 min later when we saw all of the servers goofing around and joking at the server station I decided to go to the bar and get our drinks ourselves. Finally one of the girls in my party had hit her limit and demanded the manager come back over, she explained what we had been experiencing and looked at her and said ""well what do you want me to do?""... YOUR JOB, BRO!  

The whole staff was completely indifferent to us, and dropped us the second they swiped our credit card. At the end of the day when we were packing up--and had to ask two separate bussers to please send our server over so that we could cash out, she had the audacity to ask us for an additional tip outside of the 20% of what they had already factored in, or ""if you girls have some cash on you, you can slip that in too!"" 

We honestly could have walked in off the street and gotten the same level of service- it was absolutely in no way worth spending the minimum to reserve the cabana.  At the end of the day, the life guards came up and apologized on behalf of the Tao Group, and said that they saw that no one was waiting on us all day.  

I am extremely, extremely disappointed. We even tried reaching out after the fact and did not receive a follow up, it took several emails, and phone calls to even talk to a manager, and he offered to by us a round if we went to the Marquee Nightclub that night. We opted to pass, and went to Tao in the Venetian where we were actually treated with respect and hospitality that we had expected to receive at the Cosmo.",2,1,1

Anyway, I did enjoy the people watching and there appeared to be a lot of YOUNG kids there (or maybe I am getting old) and hookers. Lot's of hookers. Or at least young girls who looked like hookers.

The hotel is really modern and nice.  Facilities are very cool - with the lobby pillars changing scenes, most of the staff very accommodating and service oriented.  I'm not a big gambler so can't comment on that.

Great restaurants (lots of them so you have a ton of options - I would suggest checking out STK late at night!), nice spa, right across from Crystals shopping.  Housekeeping was great, as well!  

However, one of the concierge staff was completely useless - told us 3 clubs to go to for good music and had NO idea they were ALL closed that night!  (Who knew Vegas clubs close on Wednesdays!  However, as part of the concierge staff, she should've known!  She even didn't believe my friend when he told her Marquee within the hotel was closed!!!)  After the goose chase and coming back to the hotel, she then sent us to see one of her ""friends"" who was a bartender at another place...when we arrived, we found out he had not worked at that place in TWO MONTHS!!!  My friend called to complain because it was for my bday night and it was kind of ruined because of poor concierge - we spent the entire night running around to closed clubs!  You'd think they would've comped us something but we got nothing.  VERY poor service here.  Despite this, I would still stay here again because the rest of the experience was very nice.

We were unable to really enjoy the pools because the weather didn't permit it but the pools are heated.  Spent one day getting a massage.  The massage was mediocre (I requested a female masseuse who turned out to be a pregnant woman - she never asked how the pressure was but I wasn't about to ask a pregnant woman to use more force, even though I thought it was too light).  But the spa has a nice eucalyptus steam rm and cool steam room.  There is a nice huge hot tub to soak in w\/ a rain shower.  I could've spent one more day enjoying the spa (but this time I would've requested a male masseuse!)

I took a bootcamp class at the gym one morning and it was really good - 30 min of bootcamp and 30 min of yogalates...awesome!

1. There was no coffee maker, or refrigerator or microwave in the rooms, so people had to ask for coffee with rooms service and it was ridiculously expensive. You would not expect that from a 5 star hotel which is already so expensive.
2. All the pools were closed. Their excuse was the weather, but the weather was good and other hotels had their pools open.
3. Our rooms had not been properly cleaned. I read that in other reviews before I booked that hotel, but I thought it was bad luck. Well it's not! Staff and room service just suck.
4. The rooms were just plain. There was nothing special or interesting about them, and they don't have standard guest rooms with king beds!!
5. Nothing is included. You have to pay for the Internet, spa, and the gym all separately. I think we paid over $60\/day\/room just for all these things. THEY SAY WIFI IS FREE, BUT IT IS NOT.

So I've been to Vegas a bunch of times over the years with my parents and also by myself with friends. I've stayed at the likes of Bellagio, Aria, Venetian, Wynn and Monte Carlo. The Cosmo in terms of class is up there with the best of them. It might not have that ultra luxury vibe that you get at the Wynn\/Encore, but it has this youthful, posh vibe to enjoy. Yes, I did noticed that the hotel crowd was more youthful... anywhere from young 20's to late 30's was the typical age of hotel guests. That's not to say we didn't see people in their 40's and 50's at the hotel. 

My group stayed in a terrace studio with 2 queen beds. We had a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountains from our balcony. The room itself was very clean. The only thing to note is if you are traveling with friends, keep in mind that the bathroom and bedroom has an open air window between the two. (You can see into the bathroom from the bedroom). There is a drop down blind to block the view, but you can still hear sounds from the bathroom. 

I felt the location was excellent. Mid strip, right next to Aria, and across from Planet Hollywood for our stops at the ABC convenience store. Each morning I would head down to the main level of the hotel and grabbed coffee and a breakfast sandwich at the coffee shop in the casino. Some great sandwiches there. I also grabbed a turkey sandwich late at night, loved it. There are a lot of great restaurants in the hotel that can appeal to everyone's budget. Marquee nightclub is on the 2nd floor of the hotel, so it does get crowded at night.

We repeatedly had to call the front desk to send maintenance up to fix our AC. The room was so hot even though the thermostat said 65. After 12 hours of going back and forth on the phone, going down to the desk to speak to them in person, they finally sent someone up at 3am when we got back from the club. Turned out the air filter hadn't been changed (probably ever) and as soon as he changed it the difference was palpable. Casino itself is glitzy and glam. Drinks are 15+, elevator wait times are horrendous at peak check out times, and one of the doormen told my friend to put a shirt on over her bathing suit.

So for this, I'm reviewing the casino and not the hotel accommodations since I didn't stay here. 

Not too bad, but not my favorite on the strip. It seems so upscale when you walk in (upstairs from the strip and you come down an escalator to the casino). The ceiling is draped in jewels and the place is decorated in vintage photos and giant shoes that you can climb into and have someone snap a pic of you.  Once you hit the casino though, it seems dark and sort of cramped.

I will say, the coolest feature is these old time cigarette machines everywhere.  However, they are stocked with cigarette sized boxes with limited edition art pieces. Random pieces made by artists I've never heard of, but so very creative to retask old machines into something new.

The machines were all slots everywhere. They did have an Organic Roulette machine, but the drink gals were slow and seemed less than happy to serve the 8 people playing on it. Very disappointing. After some time we decided that there were better casinos and off we went \/ plus the drinks were stronger elsewhere.

The bathrooms were huge, and spotless. Always a plus.",6,3,4

I've stayed here twice: June and January. On our most recent visit, we had a couple of issues with the cleaning staff with our room: there were gloves left on our balcony and then some other supplies left the next day in the bathroom, including a rag in the tub. We addressed this with the front desk and they comped the upgrade fee ($40) for one night. 
If you are going with friends, be sure to try to get into the same tower (east may be best in summer\/pool season as you bypass the pool elevator traffic). You also may consider the block of floors as there are 3 elevators then in each tower depending on the floor you are staying  on. Just something to consider.
The hotel is nice and posh; it doesn't have an overwhelming theme like others do, but if the theme is anything, maybe it is chandeliers and shoes!
The casinos are nice. They have a variety of options so you can go from high roller to a $5 table to the slots.

A friend of mine shelled out major coin to get a suite with a wraparound balcony overlooking the Strip, and it was actually kind of a disappointment! 
The room itself was AWESOME -- bad ass decor, full kitchen and bar, lots of cool art books all over the place, colored pencils on the desk and funky furnishings as far as the eye could see. The fridge minibar was filled with ironic hipster drinks like Pabst Blue Ribbon and Yoo-Hoo, and the minibar also very thoughtfully included a pair of binoculars, which came in VERY USEFUL for spying on people from the balcony. I watched a mook in a hot tub 30 stories below rolling a joint...and watched some cops arrest some poor fool in a pickup truck in the Aria valet...all from the comfort of the balcony. GOOOOOOOOD TIMES!

HOWEVER, the balcony was the main reason he booked the room -- the plan was to sit outside at night with a doob and a stick of incense, ruminating on life and whatnot -- but the BRAIN SHATTERINGLY LOUD thumping and bumping OONCE-OONCE-OONCE from the g.d. stupid nightclub 30 stories below TOTALLY RUINED that idea. It was SO LOUD out there, he literally had to keep the sliding glass doors shut the whole time, and had to sleep with earplugs in. Caveat emptor!! And it NEVER STOPS -- once the last addle-brained party whore stumbles out at 5am, the whole f*ckin' circus starts up again for Marquee's poolside Dayclub. Arrrrgrh! If you want to use your balcony at all, and be able to carry on a conversation while doing so, better git r done between 5-9am, as that appears to be the only time that place shuts down to swab up all the spilled vomit, piss and amniotic fluid.

Another beef was the room service: it SUCKED! I tried to order something from the extremely limited menu only to be told ""Oh, you must have the OLD room service menu...we changed it! Would you like us to bring you a new one?"" Uh, YEAH!! It took them so long (40 minutes) to bring a new menu that I had already gone online, looked at it on their website, and placed my order. And it's a good thing I didn't wait -- because they brought us the SAME DAMN MENU again! The ""old"" one!!! So now we had two obsolete menus.. which really didn't matter, because the limited selection of shitty food was a disappointment anyway.

My third and final beef was the WiFi connection. It is impossible to go online with an iPad (my friend and I tried on both of ours), and unless your laptop is directly plugged into the ethernet cable on the desk, you can't even stay online on a laptop very long before being kicked off, over and over. VERY annoying. 

In summary: if you want to enjoy your balcony, either get a room facing away from the Strip, or come here Mon-Weds when the stupid nightclub\/dayclub is closed. Bring binoculars (or pay out the ass for the ones in the minibar). Don't order room service, and leave your iPad at home.",24,16,7

The ultimate party hotel in Vegas. From the risque lobby video pillars, to every bar in the lobby, to Marqee (both day and night clubs), the whole hotel just oozes of sexy. While every party hotel claims to have this, only the Cosmo has it in almost every part of the hotel. EVERY part. That's right, valet pool, lobby lounge, bar, elevators, tables, hotel room.... and maybe even a few of the housekeepers (no... really).

What many Cosmo visitors don't realize is that the Vesper Bar in the lobby lounge is one of the top ranked in Vegas for craft cocktails. This place is legit. One of the best, with cream-of-the-crop mixologists, and a cocktail menu to make even New York's elite envious.

The housekeeping staff really needs to get it together here.

Hotel: We stayed in both a regular 2 Double Bed room, and a Studio Suite, both the same size, but different lay outs.  Studio Suites w\/ a view are amazing, but contain couches +1 King bed, a balcony, sink\/fridge\/microwave, and a large bathroom.  Why isn't this place for kids?  The shower.  Every room has a window looking into the bathroom, probably not the best idea for friends, but perfect for couples.  There also pictures of ""sexy-feet"" throughout the hallways, and sex is just layed out everywhere... right down to the concierge saying ""Hi this is ______ at your beck and call"" sexy.  The double bed room, where we stayed, was just for 1 night, because they overbooked...they gave us $100 credit for the inconvenience though (used gratefully @ the bar downstairs).

Marquee: First off, let's get one thing straight, 'Vegas on a budget' means you ain't doing it right.  To party, live, and be like a baller...you're gonna have to make some sacrifices.  With tax+tip, its around $600\/bottle for every 2 guys on the patio, and climbs higher as you get closer to the danc floor.  Outside is a $2000 minimum per table, and we had 9 guys...roughly $300\/pp.  But this place is crackin.  The main stage is decent sized, but its all the various rooms, nooks, crannies, dance floors that make this place huge.  So many places\/things\/ladies to do!

If you ain't got bottles or boobs, u will probably not get in.  VIP\/guestlist line is almost as long as the regular line, and if you're not there by 8:30, u mind asd well go somewhere else.  People wait in upwards of 3 hours to get in, and don't...so don't set yourself up for dissapointment. If you wanna come in and party, be ready to pay the price.

The room we stayed in was a well appointed ""studio"" style suite. It had a seating area in the front room and a large desk area. The mini bar was fully stocked. 

The bathroom was very large. The bathroom entrance led to a double vanity. To the left, behind another door was the toilet. To the right was the large, glass walled shower. The shower was really cool... in theory.

The shower has a large glass wall that faces the bedroom\/balcony. I repeat, a large glass wall. It is not privacy glass. Now, this seems to be a trend among newer hotels and I will never understand why. Why, oh why, does the shower need to be so NOT private. I personally prefer to wash myself in privacy. Maybe I'm just old fashioned. Even if in a room with a boyfriend, I still want a chance at some privacy and I don't want that only chance to be when I'm on the toilet. I want to be able to turn on the hot water, close my eyes and drift away into my thoughts. That is hard to do when you feel like you are on display the entire time.

Okay, so the Cosmo tried to make up for this major design flaw by adding wooden blinds to the glass wall. That way you can make the shower a private experience if you so choose. BUT, and this is a huge but, they put the wooden blinds on the outside of the shower. You access the blinds from the bedroom. Yep, that's right. Anyone in the bedroom can open the blinds while you are in the shower.

Now, being in this hotel with a few friends, you can only imagine how immature we were and thought it was hilarious to open the blinds on each other. Surprise! We would laugh and then close them again. Still not a fan.

The balcony was my favorite part of this room. It had ocean blue colored cushions on the furniture and was just a very nice place to hang out. Getting a balcony in Vegas usually costs an arm and a leg so knowing that the Cosmo has many on hand for lower rates is great.

The gaudy chandeliers around the lobby and casino gross me out but after a while you kind of forget about them.",3,4,3

However, the way the management responded to a noise incident makes it impossible for me to do so.

You know how I mentioned those suites are well set up for entertaining? That's what a group I was with was doing. We had a private event and when the party got going, it was loud. But it wasn't any louder than events I've been to in hotel suites over many years for both professional and personal reasons.

It would have been perfectly reasonable for the hotel to send security to shut the party down and require everyone to leave in response to the noise. And if that is what happened I'd probably have given the hotel the four star review its facilities warrant.

But the response of management, while absolutely within its rights, was excessive. They shut the party down and required everyone to leave. That's fine. What they also did is why I am giving they hotel one star. 

They evicted the people who paid for the suite. You read that right. They tossed them out of the hotel.

The Cosmopolitan had the absolute right to do this. But people looking to book an event in the suites should be aware of this policy. They have a no tolerance policy and if they decide your event is too loud, this could happen to you.",4,1,1

A friend and I stayed at the Terrace Wraparound suite. The view was amazing! The room was nice; there were drinks already missing from the fridge, but we didn't want to worry about that right off the bat. I immediately took a shower and the water pressure was reallllLLLLY weak. Thought about calling someone about it, but why bother-- I think they were trying to conserve water or something so I let this one go.

I played pai-gow and roulette here. Nice tables, but definitely didn't make me feel at home (I'm in love with gambling at Paris and Cesar's). The waitresses were attentive and drinks came around quick. 

Overall I had a very very nice stay! The problem is the charges to the room after we left. I checked out over the phone and had someone come up to the room and tell me that no charges would be placed on the room. To my surprise when I got home there were over $300+ charges on my credit card. Reading a few of the other reviews it seems as though I am not the only one this is happening to.

I have called the Cosmopolitan 3 times. They keep telling me ""There is nothing we can do about it. We need to check the tapes. My manager will call you within 2 days."" Of course 2 days pass and no return call. It is beyondddd frustrating. My bank has better customer service than this place. 

I really liked the hotel, but I am beyond words when it comes to their customer service. I never expected this kind of treatment from a new hotel. Keep in mind I left the room in the same condition it was found in. The maid came in to clean on Saturday without my knowledge (I had a do not disturb sign on my door). After that the charges began rolling in-- I suppose she\/he was mad that we did not leave a tip or something and began charging us for anything she could find. 

I will never stay here again. I will never recommend this place to my friends, and it looks like I will never see that $300+ in charges back either. I am still trying to get my money back, but it looks like I will have to push harder to speak to someone about this. This place has really put a damper on my Vegas experience. They definitely need to change their practices.

Finally got through and they said I should be receiving my money back in 7-10 days! Will change my rating to neutral",12,1,1

By far and away the worst problem in this hotel are the elevators. The card key access to all of the floors is a joke. It does not work half of the time, and you end up overshooting your floor as you bang away trying to get your card key to work. It wasn't just my key, every single time up the elevator I would see people having the same problem as me. . It's a nightmare. 

The rooms were not much better. I had a room with a couch and a king size bed, so not a low end room. In my room half of the fixtures & appliances had some sort of problem. For some of the lights the switch is just didn't work. The television set was hung with a noticeable tilt. Stains on the carpet and on the ledge. The battery in the safe died one night as I was preparing to leave, necessitating a 20 minute wait for maintenance. One night they did not change out all of the towels.

I am a born and raised Vegas native, really, what does one overpriced, smoky casino have different from the next one? The Cosmo answers that question, and then leaves you wondering what you just experienced. From the poolside movies, the suites with balconies, the endless food options, and the weird and corky décor throughout, it really takes you off the typical Vegas strip, and into a place, almost magical. 

I am not exactly sure how this casino is not as smoky as the rest, but I love it. I can actually play slots here without smoke burrowing in my face. Major plus for us non-smokers! 

This place is beyond modern or contemporary. There is a secret restaurant, (technically two if you know anything about Jose Andres) and pink chandeliers and classy martinis that will cost you $18 easy. 

But then they also welcome families with ice skating in the winter. 

You could come here for pleasure, dinner, a vacation, a business venture, a wedding, the pool, a party. Really, how about you tell me what they don't offer! 

Sure, the prices are up there, but it is for a reason! If you have a bad experience, let someone know, and they will correct it. 

 Not a HUGE fan of STK, simply because I can give love to any restaurant who caters to prostitution. Yes, hookers need love too. But when I dine there on my date night, I want the same service the hookers who spend thousands get. Is it worth ducking a star over one guy's restaurant, NAAA! Just give everyone the same love, especially people like me who love good food and tip well.

When we got there, we were told that we didn't have a premium view of the Bellagio fountains, which we'd hoped for.  We asked for an upgrade but the premium view rooms were sold out because it was a busy weekend thanks to the Manny Pacquiao fight.

Our wraparound terrace suite overlooked the south strip with a view of the Aria and the Cosmopolitan's Marquee club right below us.  We checked in on Thursday and checked out on Monday.  On Sunday night, after all the crowds had left, they ""downgraded"" us to a premium view one bedroom terrace suite overlooking the Bellagio fountain.  So we got to experience two different rooms in this hotel.

Here are the pros and cons of our stay at the Cosmopolitan:

PROS:

1) The wraparound terrace suite is extremely spacious.  It has two bathrooms, both with showers.  The tub is big and there are two sinks in the main bathroom, one on each side of the shower.  The kitchen has a minibar with a shelf for your own items, a microwave, dishwasher, and wine cooler.  (See the cons for the things that the kitchen lacks.)

2) The terrace on the wraparound suite is huge.  

3) The one bedroom premium view terrace suite was AWESOME.  We preferred it over the wraparound terrace suite with south strip view.  The one bedroom suite has a deep two-person tub that overlooks the Bellagio fountain, Paris hotel, and strip.  I'm sure that the wraparound terrace suite with premium view over the fountains is awesome, too.  If you have the choice between the wraparound terrace suite with non-premium view and the one bedroom terrace suite with premium view *definitely* choose the latter.  Unless you have more than two people and need the two bathrooms that the wraparound offers.

4) The ""secret"" pizza joint in the hotel is amazing.  At 4:30am after a long night on the town it was awesome to be able to grab a pizza.  The place is open til 5am. It's not very expensive, either.  The only problem is that on Friday and Saturday nights the place is filled with people leaving the hotel's clubs.  We had to walk through vomit to get there on Saturday night.  It's okay, though - the pizza was worth it.  Recommend the pepperoni pizza with peppers.  Yummy!

5) The dealers at the casino tables were also quite friendly.  At other casinos we've been to, the dealers had serious attitude problems.  At the Cospomolitan, we had one dealer tell us she'd been dealing for 31 years and loves her job and she was just a wonderful breath of fresh air in Vegas.

CONS:

1) Room service takes ridiculously long.  It took an hour to an hour and a half to have food delivered.

2) There is no coffee maker in the rooms.  This was not a problem for me because I don't drink coffee, but my fiance was freaking out every morning because he couldn't make coffee as soon as he woke up.  And because room service takes an hour or more (see #1) it was an hour's wait to have coffee delivered.  So he went down to the coffee shop in the hotel for coffee.  While he was there he talked to the coffee shop staff about there being no coffee maker in the room and they told him that the Cosmopolitan does this on purpose so that hotel guests will go downstairs to buy expensive coffee.  Not exactly welcoming or warm.  If you're paying $300 for a room, it's nice to have a coffee maker in the room.

3) If your room is in the east tower overlooking Marquee expect a lot of noise on Friday and Saturday nights, especially if your room is on a lower floor.  This wasn't a big deal for us because we are up late and out of our room until 5am but if you want to get to bed early then request a room iin a different part of the hotel.

4) The technology in the room has serious problems.  When we first checked into the wraparound terrace suite, we couldn't get the minibar\/fridge open.  We called front desk at about 8pm and they said that the ""system"" was being rebooted and that is why it wouldn't open.  When we came back to the room later that night, the fridge still wouldn't 
open so we called the front desk again and they said it might be a problem with just our fridge and not a hotel-wide problem.  They never did figure it out and eventually my fiance figured out a way to force the stupid thing open.  

The next afternoon, we were tired from the night before and wanted to relax in the room and watch a movie. We chose a pay per view movie but it didn't work.  Called front desk and they said there was a hotel-wide problem with the movie system.  They said they had no idea when it would be fixed.  So we ended up watching the Colbert Report.

5) The wraparound terrace has a full kitchenette with stove, microwave, and dishawasher but there are no dishes or silverware.  

6) The crowd in the hotel on Friday and Saturday nights that goes there for the clubs is kind of annoying.  They were vomiting all over the place and acting like idiots.",3,1,0

I love the glamour style. The Grand Chandelier was absolutely breathtaking. First things first, the only CONS or issue I had with the hotel was the long wait to check-in and check-out.

When we arrived at the Front desk we were greeted with friendly smiles. They told us their computer systems were down, hence the long lines. We kindly asked for an upgrade on our rooms and they were nice enough to do so. We stayed at The Boulevard Tower on the 59th floor. The views were magnificent. The main PROS of the hotel are the variety of restaurants and bars and it was centrally located to the strip. The ambiance is great because as soon as you walk in the hotel you felt like this is where the party is happening. There is so much going on.  The staff and people at the restaurants were VERY helpful and friendly. They always gave great suggestions on what to do and where to go in Vegas.

Front desk told us that they can't control the bugs and how they get in to the rooms. They then went on to say that maybe this hotel wasn't for us as it attracts a different crowd due to the club on the property and that's why we smelled marijuana in our room.

The casino is the best I've seen in Vegas.  Not too smokey and not too old.  Just perfect with good, FREQUENT service.  Yes. Yes. Yes.

The restaurants in the Cosmo: yeah, they're expensive, but HELLO, you ARE in Vegas.  Get used to it. At least here, you feel like you're getting something for your money as opposed to the Bellagio where ( I personally) felt ripped off for the money I was shelling out.  

After staying a week in Vegas and seeing and spending time in other casinos, I can safely and confidently say, that I will never (money allowing) stay anywhere but the Cosmo.  It won me over in every way possible.  I LOVE THE COSMO!!!!!!",4,0,0

So I was super excited that we got to stay at the Cosmopolitan. Learned a fun factoid of Vegas hotels is that valet is free you just tip when you get your car back. We got passed up by another guest and the valet saw my boyfriend's confusion and she said she would put our car in VIP. When we got the car back the dashboard area was cleaned and wiped down and there were cold bottled waters in the compartment. It was incredibly nice and unexpected.

This hotel is just sensory overload. There's so much to see that I don't think even a weekend in Vegas could be nearly enough. It's attention to detail and artistry is everywhere, even in the walkways between the event space to the buffet and Rose. Rabbit. Lie. Art installations are scattered every which way. The check-in lobby is just stunning with mesmerizing pillars that change from crazy alien flowers to glowing bookcases as soon as you turn your head.

After passing by the pretty chandelier bars we got to our tower and to our room on the 50th floor. Our room was so fancy. It was just about as big as our apartment haha It had a media desk which didn't dawn on us until the day we checked out that we could connect our devices to play music and movies through the tv in the living room. I thought it was peculiar that we had a dishwasher but no dishes or silverware.

I'm no fancy room connoisseur so I don't know the rules of the mini bar. There was the mini fridge full of goodies (which boyfriend indulged in a YooHoo which was super delicious after pizza from Secret Pizza) I didn't realize that the top of the mini bar items had a sensor..I picked up almost everything including the $45 pair of binoculars so I could do some amateur bird watching from our balcony in the morning..yeah. ^__^ Luckily as far as I know, none of the items were charged after I got handsy with the goods on the top of the mini bar. Lesson learned. 

Along with just how flat out pretty the room was as whole; the room had a lot of fun books mainly art themed. There was a very ostentatious book of erotic art from ancient Japan tucked under the dresser next to the bed coincidence, methinks not.

When you're relaxing in the plush bed, you have couple focal points of interest. The panoramic view from the balcony..or the window that looks right into the shower area ooh la la. You can crank the blinds down to give way to some privacy. There's also access to the giant square bathtub directly from the bedroom that also has an optional privacy partition.

It was cool to be able to open the balcony door and hear the nightclub Marquee going day and night so we had our own dance parties in our room. Usually Vegas I don't usually pay too much detail into where we stay since we would be exploring the strip most of the time. However, the Cosmopolitan has redefined what comfort and luxury is in Vegas and I had such a great time just kicking back and relaxing in our room till we were ready to roll in the city. 

The staff was very helpful from the moment we checked the car in at valet till we checked out when the weekend was over. 

I look forward to staying at the Cosmopolitan the next time I'm in Vegas.",3,1,3

It is not much that they can do. After 2 hours at the front desk, they finally agreed to give us the room that we reserved by tomorrow.

Chandelier Bar is...truly something else. Just ginormous chandeliers everywhere and you feel like you're floating in the sky. A faux library that turns out to be a bunch of columns of video monitors. Brilliant. Lots and Lots and LOTS of beautiful people wearing very little clothing. (Although a note to the ladies: as much as I love short skintight dresses with high heels and although you look great in the Herve Leger knock-offs, please know that there are more than two possible outfits to wear to this hotel).
Marquee day and nightclub is just out of this world.

I'd compare this place to the SLS in LA, but...really this is just on such a completely different level.

This place is gorgeous and from the moment you walk in, the staff at the Cosmopolitan make an effort for you to feel special. Just note that the $20 sandwich here did not work for me (a $20 bill sandwiched between your credit card and license to get an upgrade). 

As it turns out, the sandwich was unnecessary as the room with its large living room, separate bedroom, walk in shower, sunken tub and terrace was pretty awesome. (See pics). Also, with robes, slippers and top notch Bigelow soaps and stuff, the room is pretty darn comfy. However, on the minus side--no place to make coffee and if you want anything from the fridge--be prepared to sign over your first born.  Outrageously priced bar fridge items aside, the room is great.  

In addition to the great room, the restaurants Wicked Spoon and Red.Rabbit.Lie. are fantastic and worth a visit. The multiple bars, Chandelier etc. are worth a visit---if anything for the people watching alone.

Generally, the main Vegas hotels are pretty good. I've stayed at countless Vegas hotels, and I've never encountered a theft problem--until my stay at Cosmo. 

We stayed at Cosmo for my friend's bachelorette party, and we got two adjoining suites.  All of us went to the spa one afternoon, bringing only a few items, since we were going to have to store everything in lockers anyway.  When we returned, we saw our rooms had been cleaned, so housekeeping had been there.  We left for dinner in a cab.  When we were getting out of the cab, we all discovered that ALL our money had been taken from each of our wallets (except one girl, who had kept her bag in the safe deposit because the bag itself was pricey).  The worst part of the whole experience was Cosmo's lack of action and response to our theft report.  They said they would ""investigate"" the issue, but no one ever got back to us.  When I called to follow-up, they just gave me the runaround.  In the end, they did nothing at all.

The parking garage alone is enough for me to come back, I know that sounds odd, but little light fixtures that are above each parking space lets you know if there is an empty spot (green) or if the spot is full (red). There is also ample multi level garage parking that is free. Garage elevators are not rickety and scary, but are much nicer than a lot of the garage elevators in Vegas.

Hotel employees are very nice here. I was constantly greeted there by a great gentleman, he also seemed to be a hit with everyone else, his jokes were also actually funny and not annoying.

The people here are just nicer overall. I don't think I saw one customer under dressed or looking like they had a long night of drinking and losing money. 

The room we got was amazing. The balcony view of the Bellagio water show, I cannot even compare it to other places I have stayed in Vegas. The room was not as large as others that I have stayed in, but that view, the cleanliness of the room, the flat screen tv's, and the spa tub, that you can also see the Vegas strip from, was so amazing. The hotel was quiet, no one was loud and annoying, the staff was quiet, housekeeping was quiet and helpful, very nice and happy to greet you just if you were walking by to your room or the elevator. 

This hotel has top notch restaurants and is definitely nowhere near as smokey in the casino as other hotels I have stayed in. There was a minor issue with check out as I was stupid enough to move something that was in our bar. I simply picked it up and put it back down, but the desk had it rung up as if we had purchased it, which wasn't the case. Minor argument at check out (we made the mistake of paying cash for our room, so we had to wait in an hour long line just to check out), the gal that was checking us out seemed clueless, and didn't even give the correct amount of change, she was a few cents off and didn't seem to understand how to make change for money. I will let that slide because I really love this hotel, but I found that she was so spacey to be really odd.

hotel - the worst hotel i ever been to in my vegas life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! we got to cosmopolitan at 2:30pm we went to check in line. so crazy how we waited in line for 30 mins not because the line was very long but these agents just take to d*** long. now that we got to an open agent we told them our information to check. the agent said "" unfortunately  your room has been given away to another customer."" what hotel does that? i was so shocked and pretty piss to start my vacation as you don't have a room. who gives room away to other people that is already paid. what kind of idiot does that!?!?!? we drove 5 hours to hear that we don't have the room we booked. and a reminder it wasn't the cheapest room either! i understand if they give away smoking rooms away but jesus ... not only did they give us a smaller room the agent said oh well we are going to take off $200 dallors off on your room. well no s*** you are giving us a smaller room. isnt that given? so stupid. and after i started yelling at the agent and asking for the manager he leaves to get the manager and comes back by himself. what kind of manager leaves a angry customer and not come to handle the problem when the agent cant? horrible customer service. oh by the way cosmo your 100 dallor credit is a piece of ****. :) 

second, the rooms are dirty. very dirty. the bathroom is dirty. i rarely take showers with my flip flops on. the shower area, the floor is black and you can see soap scums everywhere. i dont think they bother to clean anything. sink had soap stain everywhere. the mirror and water marks everywhere. remind you ladies, they are no bathtub in the 2 bed suit rooms. the tissue box only had 2 tissues. strange you would think they would check to make sure a least there's half.. 

we called house keeping to get extra towels and pillow. that took exactly 2 hours and 27 mins... very nice.. 

we normally stay at aria and wynn. but i've heard that cosmo was pretty nice so we decided to stay but dang never will i stay there and i will make sure none of my friends and family will go there. 

also i understand people throw up places where they shouldnt be but its vegas, but aleast clean the throw up right away, why do workers stare at is and away and no body show up till later? great way to gamble and smell throw up. 

last, why dont cosmo just hire security guards or whatever to check that they are going to their rooms instead of making the key go in, in the elevator. REMINDER if you dont put the key in time the door will close and go on to whatever floor its going. You can not just press the room floor and be able to go out. its complicated and stupid.

The Cosmo has none of that, instead using huge crystal accents and open spaces with cold, hard floors to showcase the latest in technology and customer traffic management.

Since I only walked around here I can't speak of the rooms, just the casino floor and the ambiance of the main lobby. Granted it is fresh and beautiful, but I honestly can't tell if it will be ""timeless"" and worth going to time and time again as the years go by. If you depend too much on artificial coolness to get by, then it will cost a LOT to maintain it, rather than build a heart and soul-for example MGM still looks decently modern and is capable of having that heart thanks to the psuedo-loop that goes around the casino.

Ok, before I get started, I should note that, from what I've heard, Cosmo is not part of CityCenter\/MGM group... It's actually owned by the Marriot group.

...guess that explains why it's not a fail.

We were also at CityCenter\/Aria's grand opening about a year ago and remembering it still leaves a sour taste in my mouth. CityCenter, namely Aria, was a huge disappointment. It was trying too hard to be the ""new"" Vegas, with it's geometric shapes, modernized decor, and its shopping center that, realistically, caters to about 1% of the population that comes through it. Basically, it tried too hard to be ""expensive,"" when it should really have been more ""Vegas.""

Enter Cosmopolitan. 

Wow. Even the parking garage is sexy. People were taking pictures in it! We arrived at the valet, and were greeted at the entrance as we walked in. The lobby was AMAZING. From the glamorous decor, to the attractive front desk girls, to the ""video pillars"", the Ocean's 11-esque music, etc. It all makes you feel like a million bucks as you walk through. Just about everyone and their mom were taking pictures. I can't blame em. It's truly a work of art.. I took a few myself. 

There was so much to drool over. Everything was screaming luxury. The casino floor was stylized, yet easy to navigate. The restaurants were masterpieces on their own. The bars, namely the Chandelier, were all beyond fabulous. We climbed to the 2nd floor, which seemed to be where the all restaurants and stores were at. Marquee's entrance was here as well. The 3rd floor had more restaurants, bars, and a little gaming\/lounging area. At the top floor was the rooftop swimming pool area, complete with gazebos overlooking the strip. The water was heated to 80 degrees, so yes, even in the snow weather, people were still out there having a good time. Love it.

All in all, just about every single thing at Cosmo receives high marks from me. We'll definitely be staying here the next time we're in Vegas.

This is what Aria was supposed to be... 
The Cosmopolitan is the TRUE new face of Las Vegas.

They had spelled my first and last name wrong... we only found out when we were checking out because I was unable to check out on my tv or with express checkout. No compensation was given for the inability to use the internet as well as be delayed an extra hour with all the check out confusion. 

That being said, it wasn't enough for me to write the review until I went to the bar. My first question was if they had a blender behind the bar. The bartender rudely said no and returned to tidying up his empty bar.

- No security at elevators, so anyone can take any elevator up and down.

One of the few bright spots on my trip was a new bartender at The Cosmopolitan, named Will.  I met him on my first day at the Queue Bar.  Apparently he was in training, but you couldn't tell.  I thought he was a lead bartender.  He is charismatic, professional, engaging, and goes above and beyond to make the patron feel like the only person in the entire Casino.  There was a couple there from the UK that he chatted up while they gambled for 3 hours (much longer than they planned on, but they were having so much fun!  --paraphrasing).    No one's glass was ever empty and Will answered questions and made everyone feel right at home.

I ran into Will another day at the ""sports bar"" (don't know official name), and he was the same there.

Later, when my flight was canceled - I came back to book another night and found him at the ""mid-Chandelier"" bar.  A gal and I both noted how at ease he was.  I told her that he seemed to fit at whichever bar he was at - and seemed to have been there a lot longer and flow with the environment and with the different patrons at each bar.  She too, was amazed to find out he was still new at Cosmos.

I don't usually write complaints or rave reviews... but Will deserves a rave review since he was one of the few things making me smile last week.  If I come back to Vegas - I will be back at Cosmo's for sure!

The staff, cleanliness, rooms, pools, and everything else was also great - but Will just stuck out above the rest!  (go to the Bamboo Pool!)",2,0,1

Again surprisingly for a Tuesday night the casino floor was packed with people playing. The place feels elegant and large. We spent hours playing and the only reason we left was because it was late and we were tired. Cocktail service was very good. 
P.s. I heard they changed their comp procedure at the bar where you only get a drink after you play a certain amount and then a ticket gets printed out to give to the bartender. Though we didn't play at the bar and would have no problem getting these ""tickets"", if this is true I would be insulted and wouldn't return. How petty can you be.

The good: 
The lobby is stunning with amazing changing visuals on large pillars.  
Fountain view suites are amazing...views, appointments, etc.
Beds are super comfortable. 
Staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. 
Casino is classy. 
Marquee is right in your hotel. 
Location can't be beat. 

Unfortunately, The Cosmopolitan is not perfect...
Minimal towels. I expect more than two in a one bedroom suite. 
One bathrobe. I'm going to venture a guess that there's usually more than one person staying in a suite. 
Our room was not available when we arrived. Apparently, they cannot guarantee your room...ever? We had to stay in a standard room on the first night, then pack up our stuff, bring it down to the bell desk, and wait 4 hours for our originally booked suite to be ready. For a hotel of this level, I'd have expected someone to at least arrange for pick up of our luggage and delivery to a new room. That's said, we were given a food\/drink credit that helped the frustration slightly. 
Come 4am, the lobby bar is prostitution central. I've been to Vegas plenty of times and seen my fair share of prostitutes but the Cosmo was different.  A swarm of prostitutes and their pimps invaded the lobby bar. It was so in your face that it was uncomfortable. The four pimps actually had a roster\/check list to keep track of who was taken and who wasn't. I'd expect this type of thing to be a little lower key than what we saw...t just seemed super classless.  I mean, a hooker checklist? Come on. 

All that said, I still rank the Cosmo in at 4 stars, relative to other options on the strip.  They could use a few improvements but overall, worth the money.",0,1,0

Location - right in the middle of everything. 

Shopping - there's some cool shops all throughout city center and within the cosmopolitan itself, if wanna get fancy tho head over to Crystals, bring your credit card and forget your conscience. 

Restaurants - during my recent stay we ate at : Holsteins awesome burger place, Blue Ribbon Sushi - fantastic, Jaleo - delicious tapas place, and Scarpetta - Scott conant's italian place - which I liked a lot, but I should have ordered something different. The room service breakfast was delicious and well portioned.

The rooms - best on the strip, easily. We had a terrace suite in the west tower and it was straight out of a movie. The entire Cosmopolitan is artfully and beautifully decorated down to the last detail, every little nook and cranny of this place is designed to please the eyes and it accomplishes that marvelously. 

Service - every employee there was impressively accomadate and nice. You'll feel special here. The valet and bell service is ridiculously fast, convenient and polite. Everyone that works here looks happy. 

The casino - fun as can be. Every dealer we had was fun, smart and polite. 

The bars - all  the casino bars are nice looking have comfortable seating and pro level bartenders. 

The clubs - we went to Marquee and it was the coolest club I've ever been to, you'll feel like you're in a movie. We saw Sander Van Doorn and he killed it, I wrote a separate review for marquee, check it out. 

If you can afford to stay, eat and gamble here, it's all worth it, please do it, allow this place to be the base camp of your Vegas Adventure, you'll be so happy. Trust me. 

Thank you Cosmopolitan for the best Week I've had in Vegas in my life...so far.  

Almost forgot - The fitness center - has all the essentials and is very well staffed. There's also outdoor tennis and it was fun. 

And.....The Identity rewards program is also my new favorite one in Vegas, sign up immediately and earn points on everything you buy in the casino. Even all the shops. Boom. Done",1,1,1

I called ahead to ask if they had a check in time, 3pm. Our flight was landing at 11 so they said if our room was ready, we could go in right away, otherwise, the bell desk would keep our luggage safe. It took FOREVER just to check in. The service was ridiculously slow. There were two lines for any front desk service. They didn't differentiate between people checking in or out. There were maybe 3-4 people\/groups in front of us and it took around 40 minutes to talk to someone. Our room wasn't ready yet and I didn't mind. I know it's early so that's fine. We had booked a package deal that came with $50 dining credit so we figured we might as well eat lunch here. They gave us room keys and said that we would get a call once our room is ready and we could just head up to the room with those keys. Since we didn't have a room number, I asked if we'd still be able to eat at the buffet and charge it to our room to use up that dining credit. Yeah, sure..no problem. They can look it up by name. (We get to the buffet and this is totally not the case.) 

We eat lunch, go shopping...kill time. Still no call. By 3, I was getting pretty irritated since my feet were hurting from walking around and I just wanted to plop down in a soft bed. We head back to the desk to ask about our room and ta-da...they assign us to a room. So our room was ready...but we never get a call? Annoyance #1.

We finally get to our room and the bathroom door handle is broken. Broken as in you can't lock it and every time you tried to slide it shut, it would fall out. Awesome. We call the front desk to inform them. We're not too picky, but we called just to make sure we wouldn't get accused of breaking it later on. You would think they'd notice that stuff like this is broken...

Next, we try to connect our iPhones to the connectivity panel on the desk to play music on the TV. Won't work. I tried to control the room functions via the TV as well. Didn't work either. I was starting to get pretty irritated. I ask the hotel to fix it and they send IT up to our room. It takes him awhile to fix it, but it finally works. He also said that connecting your phone to the panel doesn't do anything but charge it and you have to use an auxiliary cable, which they normally provide, but are completely out of. Great! What's the point of that whole panel then? Annoyance #2.

The shower was annoyance #3. I tried taking a warm shower and the temperature would not stay steady. I'd turn the knob up a little to make up for the chill in the water and it would turn scalding hot. Turn it back down, it would be warm for 2 seconds before getting cold. Repeated this process for the duration of the shower.

Another gripe, there's no security at the elevators. They don't have elevators that serve only hotel guests which gets ridiculous when everyone wants to party at the new hotel and every elevator is packed. There is a card key device where you have to swipe your card before getting access to guest floors...but I never had to swipe my card once. So much for security? People would also hop into the elevators and just ask people to swipe them up to different floors. This is what I blamed for some drunkard pounding on my door several times (along with the doors of our neighbors) at 4 or 5 in the morning.

The service was pretty bleh for a hotel that makes itself look like a giant boutique. They're a newer hotel and I understand that, but surely they should have worked out all the kinks with customer service and their technology systems by now. The rooms themselves were great and fantastic...but the service definitely left me underwhelmed. This is also a party hotel. I'm not sure how many of the people that filled the lobby area or 2nd floor were even staying at the hotel, but it was honestly party all the time. The crowd was pretty young. I would go so far as to say it was closer to the age range of 21-25. However, I'm not a fan of the Jersey Shore-esque, Ed Hardy crowds.",4,1,0

This place is owned by a bank and acts like it.
Its all glamor show...I mean ""SHOW"" and its very attractive to those who are very ""shallow"" with money to burn. 

 IF you gamble good luck....you have better shot going to Caesars or anywhere else.

 IF you like to buy $20 Hamburger or $45 steaks that taste worse than Wendy's or sizzler this is the place.

some facts based on my stay in the hotel room:

The Rooms:

1. CLEANLINESS- The room are not that kept up
2. THIN WALLS  (thin cheap drywall) Don't be alarmed but there is a good chance at finding writing on the walls
3.TOILET - sometimes flushes fully sometime only 1\/2 you really have push the lever down
4. No thought must have gone on when putting a safety lock box with a sliding door to bathroom because if you close that slider and not using the lock box the box door will swing open and almost  LOCK YOU in the bathroom.
5. They do have a good view of another hotels watershow...but it gets old quick and those thin walls you will hear EVERY blast they make.
6. Pillows are soft...I thought they might be made from helium
7. Bed casing cheeeeeeaap and dirty....but I found 15 cents from noticing how dirty they were...


The TV (when you have dull time between conference meetings this is important)

1.  TV's was scratched which made watching annoying (thought it was only one time thing....low and behold the second time I stayed it had scratches too)
2.  PIX ELATION VIEWING that is what you will see when watching TV here - NO HDTV at all.
3.  When using this funky TV REMOTE they give you - you must point directly at one part of the TV otherwise forget it.
4.  TV CLOCK (it thinks your in another timezone) is an hour off which makes the ""TV Guide"" useless
5.- CHANNEL LAG - ANY channel you wish to watch takes 2-4 minutes before it appears (it does get better in the afternoon), so if you like channel hopping grab snickers as it will take a awhile.
6- MENU SYSTEM - The menu system on the TV which is important for other than watching its awful and after you do a check out it will just sit there....then you do it again...again...and finally it will acknowledge you.


Features of the room:

1. ooooh the LIGHTING....hello\/ goodbye seem the only choices here - its not easy to set lights and made difficult by placing the master switch at the door. (hard to explain this system but expect frustration here)
2. in 2012 room came with a high tech PHONE which handled most everything which helped with operating the lights from the bed.....BUT in 2013 they must have went REAL CHEAP and got some ill advised cordless cheap phone cause none of the shortcut buttons work essentially just hit 0 cause everything else will be a chore.
3 The FURNITURE-  It seems Deutsch Bank (owners of Cosmopolitan) got all the hotel room furniture at a low cost thrift center but must hired someone to attempt to make it look ""cool""
4. ICE ICE BABY -- good luck  they have one ice machine per floor (fine!) but they give you a microscopic ice bucket, so you have either make many trips or take the liner out of the garbage can and use that one to get ice.
5. NICKEL AND DIME you with food tray and filled refrigerator with high priced stock....it would have been nicer to remove all that and let the customer use the fridge for other things...plus be careful open it that fridge and its $9-12 charge just to look whats inside it.
6. ELEVATORS so many sets of elevators you must pay attention to which set is going to your room....also just recently the elevator buttons get stuck...meaning the elevators will skip your floor and you could wait awhile before someone fixes it...even if they already know there is a problem  (how could this be because EMPLOYEES have their own elevator they take)



ambiance
1. it looks like they re-purposed a bunch of old photos of old Vegas to make it hip
2. They must have take art work from local middle school odd design classes...and placed it around floor 2 and 3  (although 5 dogs staring at each other got more interesting as time went on)
3. Chandeliers  are plastic....not a total surprise really.
4. Lots of woman with short dresses  (plus in my book but its really gold diggers looking for some c-notes)
5. Pools are weird and ok....hardly see them used as a pool situation though gym is good


Customer Service 
Expect lousy to ok....thats it...
 look to see how they are pushy to get tips from you.


conference rooms
The set up is good here....but flimsy walls and doors that don't close right can be annoying and over time I see this place degrading.

Up-suites
They have some rather large room which at first glance is pretty cool but as you really get used to it...you realize its no differently built wise than the smaller rooms...noise is ALWAYS present

We arrived fairly early in the morning, so there were no rooms ready (not a big deal). They pre-checked us in, took our phone number and said they would send a text with the room number as soon as it was ready (they gave us keys that were already programmed for the room). We were able to walk over to the bellhop station and check our bags so we didn't have to drag them around. There was a lounge right near the lobby that we could sit down and relax. The woman at the front desk also gave us a temporary password for the wireless internet so that we could use it before we had a room number. 

Within an hour, we got a text with our room number and went upstairs. We were in the West Tower. The one was a one bedroom suite with Japanese soaker tub and a balcony.  The tub, while a nice feature with a giant window, was a bit odd. The shower\/tub are in one giant room, and one side of the tub opens to the bedroom (just blinds, no actual wall) - so it made for a bit breezy of a shower. (Not in any way a deal-breaker - just odd.) The rest of the room was great - good size, fridge, sink, a door between the sitting area and the bedroom. Pocket doors - which are a quirk that I love. 

The only downfall of the room was the battery on the smoke alarm failing at 4am one night. Not a great way to wake up. Though when I called the front desk, they sent someone right up - and he was very nice, quick and thanked me for not ripping it out of the wall like other guests. :)

Like anywhere in Vegas - you have to walk a mile through the hotel to get anywhere, but that was okay. It felt open and made for a quick walk. There were plenty of bars and places to grab some food. The grand chandelier in the East Tower was nice to look at. I didn't do much gaming, so can't really comment on that. I also didn't visit the pool or fitness center. The buffet at the Wicked Spoon was okay (only went for breakfast) - but perhaps not a good value for your money. 

Note: There is a $30 resort fee that covers internet, the pool and fitness center. This wasn't mentioned in our rate - we found out about it when we got there. (Though typical for Vegas, so not really a ""surprise."")

I'd certainly consider staying again.",1,0,0

I love the glam and glory decor in the casino area and the wide variety of restaurants to choose from.  We got the Wraparound Suite this time - the room was very spacious with two full bathrooms, great night view of the strip, but its furnitures were a little worn down and not exactly the quality that matches Cosmopolitan's glam lobby. This is really a great room for hosting small parties - a bar top, large seating area, and a balcony that can fit at least 20 people. They provide full toiletry and slippers, all good quality! However, the housekeeping can do a better job - our bed sheet had cigarette-burnt holes and the pillows on the sofa smelled like old greasy hair. Overall staff service was excellent, from check-in to internet troubleshooting on the phone!",0,0,0

Number one - Bad coffee!  No Starbucks or Peets or even a no name coffee that just tastes good.  Watery, tea like, tasteless coffee.  

The Cosmopolitan bills itself as a sexy, metro chic hotel but it was filled with small children running around, splashing in the pools and screeching.  As a parent of older children, I love children, but when I want a kid free getaway I didn't figure the Cosmopolitan would be literally swimming with them.

We spent a day at the Bamboo Pool which calls itself a calm desert oasis.  NOT!  I already told you about the mountains of screeching children but let's talk about bad service or no service at all.  No one came over to take a drink order or to offer us snacks for 45 minutes. My husband spent the afternoon running back and forth to the bar to get our drinks.  Then much too late, a young girl sauntered lazily by to say ""You guys are okay right?""  Uh wrong.  It was our anniversary so we were hoping to get a cabana on a Monday for a reasonable price.  They would not budge on their $300 fee.  So 80% of them remained unsold.  And these Day Beds they offer for $150 - NO SHADE.  Why would you charge people to lay on a mattress in the broiling desert sun.  I can get sunstroke for free at home!

The room?  Well we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite, which was a really nice gesture.  But again, I wonder who designed this hotel?  It has a lovely sitting area\/living room when you walk in but it feels uncomfortable because it's away from the verandah and it is dark.  It has a sink\/bar area but no trash can.  In the whole room, there is only one small trash can in the bathroom, not even one in the toilet closet.  So if you're mixing a drink or preparing an appetizer, you have to go to the bathroom to throw out your trash.  

Then there's this whole wasted space where the closet is.  It's basically a third of the room that's just a hallway with a closet in it.  And then there's the bathroom.  One giant shower room with a soaking tub in it.  Seems cool but the soaking tub is really shallow and designed all wrong.  It is very difficult to get into because the step in is so wide and then if you can manage to get yourself out, you are stepping out onto a wet, slippery surface.  The shower handles are broken. The bath handles are not marked hot\/cold.  And the whole bathing area is exposed to the bedroom. I guess that's sexy to the twenty something crowd but decidedly not appealing to a woman who may want a little privacy.  And speaking of privacy, remember the whole closet\/hallway area?  Well that's covered in mirrors but the bedroom has no mirrors!  So trying to figure out a place where I could get dressed in private and see how I look before going out for the evening was a challenge.  My husband had to stay in the bedroom with the door closed, so I could freely move about.

Lastly, the verandah.  What a nice idea.  Guess what?  The Signature at MGM Grand has had them for years and they are wonderful plus real service, elegance and amenities.  Our verandah at Cosmo had an impressive view but one teeny, tiny piece of furniture on which to sit, blaring all night music from I don't know where, constant ambulance sirens too.  And as soon as you open the slider, the air in the whole room shuts off.  So there will be no sleeping with a little fresh air coming in.  Nope you either sizzle on the balcony or spend the whole night breathing in air conditioning.  

The best thing about the hotel is the food!  China Poblano is amazing.  Extremely overpriced like all things Vegas now, but really delicious food.  The Chandelier Bar has exquisite, inventive cocktails for $15 a pop and not one peanut on which to nibble.  So you can't really hang out there and drink because there's nothing to soak up all that alcohol. 

So I will definitely be back for the cocktails and food but will not stay here again.  If you're looking for true elegance and service, Vdara or The Signature at MGM is a much better bet.",2,2,2

We ordered a bottle of champagne and balloons for my friend and it was there waiting for us after we came back from our show the first night.  So cute!

The decor is really fun, the beds were comfy (and had NO BEDBUGS, YAYYYYY!!!), the staff were friendly, and the hotel is clean and attractive.

So it is cool to be here, but that also means it is busy.  Sometimes VERY busy...like over hour waits for some of the food spots.

But the good thing is, there are tons of good bites to eat here, ranging from inexpensive to crazy expensive.  Something for every wallet and palate here.

I've checked out Marquee dayclub before too, and the setting and eye candy is great.  They also have THE best poolside food I've had...including an amazing prime rib sandwich!  Yes, amazing!

We got to check out the rooms for a party the other night, and they got the one bedroom corner suite style room...the one with the wrap around balcony.  The balcony itself is amazing, and the views are great being central on the strip.  The rooms were nice, but I am really into the darker contemporary look vs the very light theme they have going on here.  Still one of the better rooms on the strip, but you'll pay for it.

We had a two bedroom suite in the West Tower. I would recommend getting a room in the East Tower, if possible because it is closer to the strip. Our room had two full bathroom, one half bath, one king bed, two queen beds and one pull out couch. The suite is useful if you want a place to gather with friends before heading out for a night on the town. Our suite had a nice view of the Fountains of Bellagio, but no balcony. 

The reason for the 3 star review is because the room did have quite a few glaring deficiencies. The TV did not work at all, the room had no unified media or lighting control systems, the water in the shower was either way too hot or way too cold, and the bathrooms were semi-private (had blinds that were controlled from the outside). Overall, while the rooms are larger at Cosmo, I think the room product at Aria is better due to the tech features and more well thought out designs.",1,0,0

We contacted them and wasted about 1.5 hours of time in vegas dealing with this. All we got was our resort fee taken out. What if we hadn't checked until we got home... would we have gotten our $500 refund? We went down to the front desk before checking out to ENSURE that everything was sorted out and they let us know that our room was still unpaid for. I assured them that I provided my credit card and showed them the pending charge on my card. They said that it was in process of being refunded and that they had to recharge me.

Recently stayed here again in March 2014 and August. The place was a little runned down. Don't think its still worth $300 a night.

Last visit was a little irritating checking in. I drove four hours from LA to Vegas to expect my room to be ready. We get in to check-in and they told us we'll have to wait because our room isn't ready. Now, what pizzed me off was that I told that check-in isn't till 3pm. We were there at 3:50pm. The lady had the audacity to tell me ""just because check in is at 3pm, it doesn't guarantee for it to be ready."" Which is bull shyte. I'm paying, booked way in advance, followed the policy and was checking-in after 3pm. How could it not guaranteed? 

I finally threw a bissh fit and asked for a supervisor. She also came along and told me the same thing. I told her the same story from the lady before and kept at it for a good 10 minutes.

I was comp'd $300 and maybe you are thinking wow that's reasonable. I avidly go to Vegas and if that list of things happened at any other hotel a night or two would've been refunded (I've had that happened).

During the day, my wife and I (early 30's with a love of 80's music) came and spent a good deal of time on the video poker machines and just slowly playing roulette out on the floor.  They were pumping awesome 80's tunes into the casino, it was super quiet, and relaxed.  We won some money there, and left happily.  Drink service was consistent and pleasant.  The dealer\/spinner guy at the roulette wheel was super pleasant and friendly (they're taking your money, so it's the least they can do).

My wife and I came back at night, and it was a completely different experience.  The laid-back, 80's throwback vibe that had hooked us in was now replaced with a much more modern, Millenial-friendly atmosphere.  It was loud, smokey, and obnoxious.  Hipsters hung from chandeliers and the corners like a pirate crew besieging a coastal whorehouse.  It was a completely different experience, and we did NOT like it.

So- if you're looking for a quiet, low-key place during the DAYTIME hours, go.  That's when all the skinny jean-ed turds are getting over their moscato hangovers, apparently.  If you want to avoid a party atmosphere which is obnoxious in feel, avoid at night.  If you don't like what I have to say, reverse it and you'll be fine.

Boulevard - gets busy but fairly tame (on weekend nights, they often have one off concerts here - we just so happened to see Robin Thicke and Jason Derulo perform), Marquee - think Mykonos\/Ibiza\/Agia Napa mixed into one crazy day club, you won't know if you're Arthur or Martha and Bamboo - a quiet alternative for those who need to nurse a major hangover (be sure to order the tuna salad - good grief, as fresh as it can get). As others have mentioned, the secret pizza place is by no means the best pizza you'll have eaten but it's certainly worth a visit any time of the day. Do check out Chandelier Bar.

After returning to the hotel, I turned the hot tub water. When I was getting into the hot tub, and there were SEVERAL GUY HAIR and mingled dusts floating on the water. Its definitely not my bf's and it was not mine neither. yuck! 
Next morning, the TV stopped working again.. I didn't call the front again since I didn't wanted to wait and waste another hour.
It was very disappointing that the hotel did nothing about giving me a room with that kind of TV. They definitely knew that it wasn't working properly because they told me I'm not the only one. I've been in numerous hotels and whenever there is some problem, they adjust the room upgrading fee or something since its their fault, but this hotel? they didn't even apologize. They didn't bother. 
On the first night, we went to Marquee night club. The bald chubby guy at the front was very arrogant and rude. He didn't wanted to talk to Asians. I don't know how some ignorant and racist guy like this can be working as a guard.
On the second night, we were all tired so I called the front and asked if I could do little late check-out. The front said rooms are fully booked so they can't give any late check-out. 
Man, it was on the weekday, not even busy weekend.  My check out is 11am and check in is 2pm. Most of the hotels provide at least 12pm check out even if they have another booking that day. But again, they didn't bother.
We went out from our room at 10:50am and the cleaning ladies were already knocking at people's doors and asking if they are ready to go out. 
When I went to do check out, I wanted tell them about the TV and the hair on the hot tub, but the front desk guy didn't even bother to ask me how was my stay.
I know this hotel is kind of busy, but I've never seen that kind of attitude in Vegas hotels.  My room was nearly $300\/day and it was weekdays. For that price, I rather stay Vdara or somewhere else. I'm never going back to Cosmopolitan.

there is one thing that was horrible: MARQUEE! omg!!! we were on the 37th floor on the east side tower facing the pool...you can literally hear marquee til 5 AM! it was horrible. the second night we wanted to move rooms, but they didn't have our room so we just asked for ear plugs...GHETTO. i will NEVER stay on that side of the hotel. so if you're a party animal then you'll probably enjoy it...but i came to eat, relax, and gamble :]

speaking of gambling...the tables have decent limits (min: $10-$15) a lot of slots!!! ranging from pennies to hundreds lol. the gambling was amazing! i loved the selection!!!

also there are a lot of bars! the chandelier bar was amazing!!! it was so pretty and elegant...so high class\/trendy! loved it...didn't check out the other bars but definitely will next time. definitely worth your money! check it out you won't be disappointed (but remember EAST SIDE TOWER FACING POOL = LOUD!!!!!!!!)

OH YEA! almost left out the most important thing...at this casino sign up for the identity card even if you don't gamble. every dollar you spend money at (bars, restaurants, shops, rooms anything inside cosmo) you get a point! which means you can get free food, gambling money, even rooms! a good tip! take it...i won't charge you :P",5,2,2

My parents loved their suite here years ago, and I've been to marquee, so I was pretty excited to actually stay here overnight.

Pros:
-dog friendly. Everyone was showering my attention-whore dogs w attn
-Ivan at concierge. I got in extremely late, hangry, and cranky..and he was so understanding and sympathetic of our circumstances and tried to make our stay comfortable. I truly appreciate this, and bc of such small gestures, Cosmopolitan will now be my go-to hotel when I visit Vegas. Also nhan (I think? His manager when we checked in) was super accommodating and helpful. 
-marquee, duh 
-wicked spoon buffet. Pretty decent quality, and reasonable prices during brunch
-the casino doesn't reek of smoke
-soon they will have momofuku milk bar (expected opening 2017), which has my fave cookies ever (compost cookies)
-fast elevators and faster wifi
-spacious and luxurious rooms. Gorgeous views (even tho I didn't have the bellagio view, I thought my view of aria was still nice lol.) 
-overall just really nice amenities 
-service was so friendly by everybody..and special thank you to the awesome valet team who coordinated w a bellhop to get our stuff, the bellhops who dropped off\/retrieved our belongings and put them in the car, and the valet team who retrieved the car. 

Cons:
-I called in to inquire about something and both the people I talked to didn't really know\/have an answer. 
-I always get lost getting to valet pick up. I'm not sure why..but it's clearly not idiot proof

Easily one of the best hotels I've stayed in..Vegas or not.",0,0,0

I have to say up front that I am not a fan of Vegas, and that is a huge understatement.  I only went to this hotel because it was the conference hotel for a convention that required my attendance.  Many of my concerns could likely apply to other hotels on the strip.  That said, there were several public areas that were smoky.  I found it disheartening that so many of the women who worked in this hotel were dressed in uniforms that lacked modesty.  The guest room itself was impressive, though it is not one to share with someone who you don't want to be naked around.  There are glass doors that serve as a wall between the bedroom and the shower.  Others I was at the conference with described the shower area as like the set for a porn movie.  I don't disagree.  The lighting in the room turns on and off depending upon where you are in the room -- a 'green friendly' feature, but at times annoying.  Still, you can tell the hotel is very new and economical from an energy standpoint, and well constructed.  You have to walk through Casino areas to get to many places where you have to go in the hotel -- not a surprise, but also unpleasant for those of us (like me) who find such areas highly depressing.  One thing that was particularly difficult was finding any food options that were even moderately priced.  Everything anywhere close to this hotel was very, very expensive.  In a later visit to Vegas (again, required by another conference, it was a bad year), I stayed in another hotel that had some more low-moderate cost options.  Overall, I found that the facilities in this hotel were well constructed, staff were certainly attentive, and for what they are selling (an experience focused on the hope of winning money that almost all people won't win and wouldn't even make those who win it very happy anyway) and looking at women who are wearing very little in ways that objectify them, some customers may find some satisfaction.  As for me, I prefer other options.",1,1,1

The hotel is in a prime spot of real estate right in the middle of The Strip and all of the action that comes with it. The hotel itself is beautiful, trendy, and modern. The decor includes chandeliers everywhere, crystals draping all over the place, modern pieces of art, etc. 

I have stayed in two different rooms on both sides of The Cosmopolitan, and if you can, I encourage you to get a room that faces the Bellagio fountains\/ Paris Hotel\/ North Strip. The room that I stayed in most recently was a Terrace room on the 46th floor that had a terrace that was probably 30 feet long facing the Bellagio fountains. I challenge you to find another room in Las Vegas with a better view than we had. 

The rooms are clean, well decorated and rather large, compared to other hotels that I have stayed in. In the terrace suite, our room had a full kitchen, dining room, living room, two bathrooms and a large bedroom. It was a nice feature to have a room with two bathrooms, especially given the fact that we had five girls that all had to shower and get ready. I do caution you with the rooms that have full kitchens; Just because it's a full kitchen, that does not mean that it is equipped with all kitchen gadgets and supplies. We learned that the hard way when we attempted to make taquitos at about 4 a.m. and did not have a baking sheet. (Dont' worry, just throw those babies right on the oven rack and they'll cook up nice and crispy.)

Aside from the rooms and the view, another nice thing about staying at The Cosmopolitan was the club, Marquee, was right downstairs. We planned it out so that our last night in town we would go to Marquee, that way we wouldn't have to walk too far to get back to our room, being that as a girl in Vegas, your feet are completely blistered by the last night. Marquee was a lot of fun. It's a nice, open club that has multiple bars open to avoid long lines. They always have pretty good DJs and from what I hear, Marquee is one of the best clubs in Vegas.",4,0,4

Went to check it out and fell in love!   What a great feel....retro, classy, sexy, hip, happening, contemporary, luxurious, artsy, energetic vibe!      

Ate at the Overlook Grill (check out my review of this restaurant) and did some gambling.  I was determined to win the Tesla car at the slot machines...unfortunately, I didn't!      

Check out the life-size jacks located near the pool table at the open area of the 4th floor.  Brought back memories of playing jacks as a kid.   (you know the game where you scatter the jacks and take turn to bounce the ball off the ground, then pick up jacks, and then catch the ball before it bounces for a second time).     

When it was time to leave, we didn't feel like walking back to our hotel (too cold outside) so we went to get a taxi.   Check out the life-size retro lamp heater lamps with the pleated shades.    Again...brought back memories to my Mom's old living room lamps.

I left the casino with ""Do you know the way to San Jose"" in my head....great selection of 60's and 70's classics.

What 60's brain-child came up with the details for this casino?  Love it!",1,2,2

We stayed at the Cosmo which we've wanted to try for a long time  I cannot describe my excitement as we rolled into their driveway. But they left much to be desired. 

We had our reservations + a free upgrade offer that they had emailed us. I mentioned it when I called in to tell them that we're not arriving later & guest services asked if there was anything special we wanted in our room like a tub or something like that & we asked for a stove since we were gonna be there for several days. They said that it could definitely be accommodated based on availability. 

We walked up to the front desk where Mr. NoPersonality  helped us. We showed the printed offer & mentioned the stove & he found us a room with a kitchen, charged the deposit & sent us on our way. When we got to the room, there was no stove. There was a microwave & a sink. The room itself was nice but the view was of some horrible parking structure, but what can you do. We were kind of disappointed but I love eating out so I quickly got over it. 

Later on, I decided to take a bath in their beautiful bathroom which was open to the living room, kinda exciting, BUT when I went to fill the tub, I noticed a black ring around the tub which clearly hadn't been cleaned. I called the front desk, they apologized, but they couldn't move us till the next morning. 

The next day I mentioned the stove again, & they us found us one, but said we had to pay an extra $100 for the remaining nights. I wasn't happy because clearly they had said that with the upgrade offer this would be free, not to mention that they places us in a dirty room, but they didn't even try to make amends, just said sorry about that over and over. We negotiated & brought it down to $50\/night. Our new room was gorgeous & the view was fantastic, the kitchen was complete & the bathtub was clean. 

Later we noticed some issues with our new room as well & thought they weren't bad enough to switch rooms over, they did make me question Cosmos true quality. Is it all empty words for a lot of money, or did we just get the two worst rooms they had to present? There were cleanable stains here & there, we had holes in our sheets, the kitchen didn't have anything in it... I understand they send up clean dishes & utensils when you ask them, but could they keep some dish washing products in the room, or send them up with the dishes so we don't have to call for every bowl & fork which takes 30 mins to arrive forcing us to wash our dishes with shampoo and small towels.  

I can't see myself going back to Cosmo, which is what I said about Vdara, but staying in these rooms where the basics aren't covered, I feel like I owe Vdara an apology. 

------RESTAURANTS

On the 1st night we ordered from Holsteins. Brought the food back to our room & boy was it disappointing. The food was good, but some of the portions were made for a doll house. Our bill came out to $67 which isn't bad but not really appropriate for the amount of food. 

AHI POKE TOSTADA $15 - We thought we would get a decent amount of AHI. But we got two dressing cups of AHI & the ""tostada"" just happened to be 6 pieces of round Tortilla Chips. 6 pieces only! Pictures will be attached. 

TRUFFLE LOBSTER 'MAC N CHEESE' $16.50 - Not the best Lobster Mac N Cheese I've had but definitely the best dish of the night. Definitely think they could have put more in there but seeing the AHI we also know they could have put way less so lets just be grateful. 

POUTINE $13 - This dish could have won my heart because it had all the right things, but the gravy was dripped on for what I think might have been decorational reasons & overall it felt very dry. 

MILKSHAKES $9 - Chocolate & Malt for Bear & Strawberry for me. Yum! 

------
On the last night, we decided to try one more restaurant in the Hotel, China Poblano. We were under the impression that they had some cool hybrids & we got curious. The place was empty, but they didn't let us in without reservations so we got the food to go. The bill came out to $79, total Waste. 

Open Sesame noodles $9.88 - Went straight into the trash. 

Chicken Ji Song Lettuce Cups  - $16.88 - The only tasty dish, but there were only 4 baby romaine leafs (size of endives).  

Mongolian Beef Lettuce $18.88 - It was bad, like really bad. The beef came in chunks & the lettuce really clashed. Also went into the trash. 

Siu Mai Quail Eggs $16.88 - Yikes. 

------
After getting back to the room and seeing that China Poblano is causing a death wish in us, we went straight to Secret Pizza, ordered a few different ones which were ok, but the THICK WHITE PIZZA was bomb! I must express my appreciation this pizza place because after all the bad food, it kinda felt like flavor was nothing but a dream never to be found again, but Secret Pizza reassured us that flavor is still out there. The next morning we had a great meal at the Aria and got back on the road. Goodbye 4-ever Cosmo!",17,2,4

First the good points - all of the staff I came into contact with were very friendly. The decor was interesting - some of it beautiful. Check out and check in procedures were quick and efficient (I checked out via their TV service). 

Bad points - I'll start with the room: it was large and pretty, but it was also rundown. There was a broken lamp fixture in the bathroom, a broken drawer on the desk, and stains on the sofa cushions. The ironing board had holes burned into it, and the melted ironing board cover was stuck on the bottom of the iron. There was a rip in the sheets. There was a dirty dish left in our dishwasher from someone else! Some of the light fixtures did not work. Besides the room, my next complaint would be the restrooms in the convention space and casino. They were not cleaned regularly! The bathrooms near the convention space smelled strongly of sewer gas the first day (thankfully fixed by the next day). I've never been in a hotel that typically charged $300+\/night that had trash all over the bathroom floors! The carpet in the hallway near our room was stained. Another problem was the elevators - there are not enough of them to handle the volume of people trying to use them at certain times of the day (and if you do get an elevator at those times, you quickly find out that they are not air conditioned). 

I did not expect such poor housekeeping and such rundown fixtures as such a new and expensive hotel.",2,1,0

The only negative I would say about the room is that there is no refrigerator, or at least not in the suite we were staying at, only a minibar.

For us the issues started at check-in.  The dual line was over thirty minutes long (I think it actually took over forty-five minutes) and was being managed by line attendants who looked and acted like they were controlling access to some exclusive nightclub instead of a hotel registration desk.  Also a big issue (and this seems to be true of all the hotel\/casino lobbies in Vegas) is that you get a constant wafting of cigarette smoke because the casino floor is on the same level as the lobby.  The hotel registration person said she hated the smell too.  So beware if you have allergies\/breathing issues\/asthma - most, if not all, Vegas casinos are going to be a problem.

Getting up to our room was fine and the room itself seemed to have a veneer of niceness but you could quickly see that things weren't great.  For example of the four sink handles in the bathroom, three turned off at the same point.  One was off by ninety degrees to the others.  When they were all off it just looked bad.  If they don't care about the aesthetics of something like that, what else was wrong?  We found out that first night.

In the middle of the night the closet light came on and would never shut off.  We never figured out why but the next night it didn't turn on.  Given the line in the lobby we never complained and I figured I'd deal with it at checkout.

On our final morning, our neighbors decided it was time for a loud music party early in the morning.  With our kids asleep I called to complain.  Twenty minutes later NO ONE had picked up the phone.  I hung up in disgust with a mind to complain as we checked out.

But if you read above, the same thing that happened at check-in was again in effect.  With a line of well over thirty minutes I gave my keys to a line attendant hoping they would properly check us out (and knowing that AMEX would fix it if they didn't) and we left.

On returning, I emailed their customer service expecting a resolution but instead was told that since they didn't get an opportunity to fix the closet problem they didn't know if it was a real issue.  So apparently I'm lying.  I was also told that during our stay there was no point that a phone wait was 20 minutes.  Again, I can't measure time based on the clock I was staring at.

The only upside of our stay was that we could watch the Bellagio fountain show from our balcony.  Other than that, staying at the Cosmo is a complete bust.",2,0,0

I've only stayed once but my stay was nothing short of amazing. Loved every second of the Cosmopolitan. We were fortunate enough to stay in a wrap around terrace suite overlooking the strip. That weekend Lauryn Hill Performed so it was nice watching her perform from balcony.  So when you first walk into suite you walk into long ...long Mirrored Wall hallway ..hidden washer and dryer in one of the closets. How great is that? You get a guest bathroom then it's the full kitchen and dining area. There is a nice living room area with desk and lounge chairs too. The balcony has plenty of seating for you and guests as well. Then in the next room is the master bedroom with huge bathroom that has tub and shower and his and hers sinks...score!   Sliding glass doors in bedroom and main suite area too. Very modern decor and I loved every bit of it, when I have time I will add pics. I loved the toilet room wall paper, lol. 

I called for Spa appointment and staff was way cool and friendly. I got a massage and it was amazing. Spa was nice but Canyon Ranch at the Pallazo is by far my favorite The dealers in the Casino were all pretty great and food at restaurants was good. Loved getting Pizza in the wee early morning to sober up..I forget the name but it's right next to Marquee I think :)

Due to health, I look at different factors than most people do for what is important in a hotel. Perfect if you have any sort of mobility issue or health problems where you need things to be close and easy to access 

5 stars for :
- Room comfort ( nice thick mattress, comfy pillows, good size bathtub and shower)
- Room proximity to entrance ( if mobility is an issue, they have two towers that are easily accessible. The Chelsea tower is Right by the front entrance where you drop off the car to valet and right by the front desk too, so be sure to request this one. Bonus - if you are able to get this tower you have a chance at having a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains)
- Balcony - this is so refreshing with big comfy seating and great views, perfect to enjoy early morning or later on when the sun isn't burning down in summer time !
- Easy valet ( coming down from the room to the valet from Chelsea tower is a breeze! You walk out the front entrance, make a right and go immediately down the elevator or escalator and it's right there ! 1\/4 the distance of usual valets 
- Customer service - we had a few issues with room cleanliness and it still being dirty after it was supposedly cleaned again so that is an area that can be fixed, but Alexis in customer care made up for it and then some and that was appreciated! 
- Gambling - Now I never go with the expectation of winning, we just enjoy it, but I much rather play somewhere like here which makes it fun instead of just tanking all your money right away like most will. Maybe we have gotten lucky but haven't ever lost much an always had fun and good drinks ! 
- Restaurant quality- all of the places we tried here are great, especially Zuma which you can see my other review is amazing ! Most restaurants are in the boulevard tower but it is easily accessible if you park in the self parking and find a spot near the boulevard elevators and then pick your restaurant and go up to that level and they are right there!

3 Stars for: 
- Casino chair comfort - they have high chairs that are not really comfortable, especially if you have back issue or other pain factors, I was constantly shifting around and could never get comfy. Though this is pretty common among larger casinos. Mandalay Bay has great chairs that are adjustable up and down!",2,1,2

It's stunning to look at. You could and should spend hours just walking around admiring the details. It's multiple levels of extreme architecure and interior design.

We stayed here in the Wraparound Terrace Suite... I've never been in such a large and gorgeously-decorated room! The view from the comfy patio furniture was outstanding. I'd like to live here, please.

I love all of the different-looking and differently-themed bars and lounges around the casino. You don't even have to go out to a club to have a good time if you spend your night at these! The Chandelier is the obvious highlight. I could sit there with a signature drink and enjoy the glimmer for hours!

Of course, The Cosmopolitan hosts the most popular nightclub in Vegas at the moment, Marquee. (See my separate review for details: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/marquee-nightclub-las-vegas#hrid:bL60s1IxbUnzWpO338EtxQ\/src:self)

They have a good variety of restaurants to enjoy, too. We chose Holstein's by recommendation from Natalia, a bartender at Le Central Bar in Paris. (See my separate review for details: coming soon!)

We checked out the pool area on the top floor (actually multiple pool areas, including the pool area shared by Marquee) - I can't wait until summer to spend some time here! First of all, it's gorgeously designed. The lounge chairs look comfortable and inviting. There is a ton of stadium-style seating. There are lot of bars so no one goes thirsty. ;) When looking out, there is an amazing view of The Strip below.

Not only has this been the hotel in Vegas that everyone is talking about since it opened but they also run commercials for it constantly and I am easily influenced by brainwashing commercialism. I am glad that I stayed there on a recent trip to Las Vegas with my husband, if only to satisfy my curiosity, but I don't think we will stay there again. I wouldn't rule it out for a bachelorette or b-day party, though. It is more suited to a party weekend with friends than a relaxing getaway for a couple.

The room was really nice. A little more homey and not as luxurious compared to what I was expecting. We were in a one bedroom suite which was very spacious. It had a large ""living room"" with a couch and a desk and another TV as well as a little kitchen. I really loved the bathroom. It had a nice big shower and a deep soaking tub. The best part of our room was the awesome view directly overlooking the Bellagio fountains. It is pretty rare to get a balcony at a Vegas hotel, never mind one large enough to hold actual patio furniture. We sat out there and watched the water show. It was interesting that there were little vintage chic touches to make the place look old fashioned but yet it was very modern at the same time. It was fun controlling the a\/c and the lights thru the TV the first day or so but that got old fast.

Overall it's a great property, but somehow we just didn't feel comfortable there. It's like the place was designed to make you feel as if only the very trendy, very hip people go there. It is so hyped up that even though it is exciting at first, it becomes obnoxious after a while. We saw people lining up at eight o'clock to get into the club, which opens at ten. So you mean those girls are going to stand around in their micro minis and painfully high shoes for two whole hours?! You couldn't pay me to do that. So that, in a nutshell, is my problem with The Cosmopolitan, they are just trying way too hard to be cool. The sad part is, that it actually is a really cool place when taken in small doses. But put it all together and it is way too much. So what makes this place so cool, you ask? Well, hmm, its hard to explain. Sort of like the matrix, you can not be told, you have to see it for yourself. But here are some of the cool things about this place that I saw or experienced during our stay, in no particular order.

Amenities for everyone except kids. It isn't a hotel that caters to families (in my opinion) although there are a lot of pools...Las Vegas pools! T&A ALERT.  Would be a great place to hang out poolside in the summer with adult friends for laughs and drinks.

Casino: it was very basic and attracted people of all ages. You know there are some casinos in Vegas that are considered young and hip or for older people. This one falls in the middle. Plenty of slots and tables but not a huge variety like other hotels.

Comedy show, sport betting: comedy show was entertaining. Not a real knee slapped but something fun to do. In the back corner to the right of check in you'll find sport betting and plenty of tvs so you won't miss a game.

We loved the location-we could walk across the street easily from here and take the tram down the strip a little ways (doesn't go all the way down the strip in either direction-unfortunate, I know). Also, this hotel has ample FREE covered parking.

The location is perfectly located centrally on the strip. Right next to the Bellagio, so at a short walking distance or from your window, you can see the waterfall show .  No matter where your room is located, you will get a good view from any angle of the strip.  The layout of the hotel is not overly huge like the Venetian, therefore, its really easy to navigate.

One helpful hint, if you plan on staying at the Cosmopolitan I would recommend you ask for an upgrade to a room with a view overlooking the fountains at the Bellagio...well worth the extra $30 per night.

A little context: I'm not a crazy person with unrealistic expectations.  I know that Vegas is noisy, overpriced, and that The Cosmopolitan is a new hotel so some customer service kinks should be expected.  But this is the worst experience I have ever had - not only in Vegas but at any hotel in the history of the world.

A couple weeks before arrive: I call to book a massage at the spa.  All seems well.  I remember that I should ask for a female therapist and call back 45 minutes later.  THERE IS NO RECORD OF MY SPA RESERVATION?  Huh?  I have to re-book.  Good thing I called back.

We arrive: no one offers to help us with our bags to our room.   Fine, that's okay - no biggie.  We are told that we have to choose between a handicap room with a king-sized bed and a balcony or a standard room that has two beds and no balcony?  Huh?  Okay - we'll take the handicap king-size.  Sadly, this room would be a death trap for a handicapped person as it was nearly impossible to get into the tiny square tub with one very steep, dangerous marble step.

Still - no biggie.  I'm in Vegas!

We were on the 62nd floor right above the Marquee nightclub.  This is a biggie.  I wanted to slit my wrists.  Even that high up, and with ear plugs, the music was SO loud - thumping bass and wailing sirens.  Even with earplugs, we couldn't sleep.  As in, no sleep at all.  And we're not particularly light sleepers.  When we went to complain, we were told that we could not switch rooms until Sunday (we arrived on Friday).  Bad news.  I know you don't go to Vegas to go to bed at 10:00pm, but we couldn't get to sleep until AFTER 4:00am when the music went off.

Overall, the staff is totally aloof.  They make you feel like you are troubling them when you ask for basic things (i.e. - clean towels). Three times in three days, we had to call for clean towels (after our room was cleaned).  Each time it took at least half an hour.  They didn't restock our shampoos, etc. either.  We also had to call down for the Ipod stereo connector (advertised as being in all their rooms) and it took 45 minutes to get to us.  Also took an hour for a corkscrew.  Sigh.  The ""sub-zero fridge"" advertised on the website is also the bottom half of a mini bar that is an intense freezer.  It froze our beer cans in about 45 minutes, even on the lowest temperature setting.  Even though there is a microwave and ""fridge,"" there is no cutlery or utensils of any kind.

All in all, I felt like a total chump for staying here - that I had been duped by the glitz and glam.  It was a waste of money and a terrible disappointment.  When I spoke to a manager, all he offered me was a $100 food and beverage credit.  How about a refund for a night or two when we couldn't sleep!?  All the time we spent waiting for housekeeping should also be worth at least one night of a refund too.

If you are one of those people who goes to Vegas to wear your trashy Bebe dress and to have an intense 3 day bender where you don't care about clean towels, or sleeping, any kind of customer service, you will love this place.  If not, save yourself and stay somewhere else!",9,4,1

First impression - parking valet was super easy as the check-in lobby was right there when you entered the doors.  It was prime time check-in time (~2:30-3) and it was a breeze. 

We checked in and found out we were nicely upgraded as we needed two queen size beds.  We had a pretty nice room with two decent sized tvs, a small living area with two seats and a sofa, and a sink, microwave, and mini fridge.  Bathroom was nicely oversized with his and hers sinks, shower, soaker tub jacuzzi, and private toilet room.  Also brand named toiletries!!

The cleaners may have rushed cleaning our place as it wasn't PERFECT as I had dreamt.  My cousin, who we were with, has stayed there numerous times before and was looking forward to the slippers they provide and bathrobes.  Neither was available and we had to ask the cleaners that we saw in the hallway.  The locked safe was not working - I think out of batteries or something, and I told the lady who came up and she said she would call a guy.  Well, a guy never came up to fix it so I just forgot about it.  The toilet paper was not a fresh roll either.  A lot of little things that don't really matter but make up the whole experience.  For the price we paid, I'd hoped everything would have already been set up for us.

That may be the lens I'm seeing this hotel through because Vegas isn't the ""Vegas"" I remember anymore -at least in my eyes. It's obnoxiously expensive, gaudy, and the clientele here (and everywhere in this town) has become a walking spoof of Kardashian-like self absorbed airheads in ill fitting clothes and garish amounts of tattoos, and that's just the ladies. 

The reservation I made was for a balcony room but was suddenly unavailable once we checked in. Front desk attendant (Melissa) was rude and not accommodating in the least. I would've liked to know prior to my arrival because I would have stayed elsewhere.  Her attitude was too bad, so sad - give me your credit card. 

As far as the hotel goes - hang onto your wallet. Want breakfast for 2? $60+ tip. Lunch? $80+ tip. Dinner? $300 or so and this is even when ordering very modestly. Less than 20 years ago I could find deals galore on food and drinks. Now a round of drinks for two (domestic beer and a low end mixed drink) are $25 with tip. Want to get out to another hotel with your rental car? Many of the hotels now charge by the hour to park. That used to be a freebie to encourage crowds to come to your casino. Now each hotel parking lot is an ATM for them (as if their odds weren't already stacked) I had show tickets down the street at NY NY and they wanted $20 to $30 to let us self or valet park our car during a cirque du soleil show because guess what? T-Mobile arena rented ALL the garage spaces from NY NY. So guys like me get to walk a mile to park just to see the overpriced cirque du soleil show.

This room fit the bill for us. It is right off the finish line and the tub came in handy!

The service compared to the other hotels we've stayed at on the strip is outstanding. They walk up to the queue to walk you to their check-in desk and everything they do is to ensure you have a wonderful stay at the hotel. We had Sue checking us in, we were able to check-in early and get a side view of the Bellagio Water Show. 

We were thinking of getting a bed at the Bamboo pool, but there was a bit of a hiccup in communications regarding that. It didn't bother us much because we realized we can get a better tan in our room on the 55th floor! So much privacy + wraparound terrace = No tan lines ;D

The room was fantastic! Perfect for the two of us. 

The master bathroom had his and her sinks, a huge tube that fits my 6'1 husband (it's not fun for him to sit with his knees out of the water), two bathrooms - so no rushing LOL. 

The kitchen is strange, because it is stocked with nothing to cook with or eat on\/ eat with. But it has a huge fridge and microwave. Please note the sign that says, when you lift up the goodies in the fridge it auto charges. ALWAYS check your account information on the TV, so you do not accumulate silly charges for just looking at the bottle of alcohol. 

Wifi is strong, note that once you are outside on the terrace and close the doors to the balcony your wifi connection gets lost. 

We ordered room service for lunch and then breakfast the next day. Lunch was so-so. The breakfast burrito was not bad! The tortilla seemed like it was freshly made because it was flakey. I ordered pancakes for my pre-race meal!

We spent a whole day lounging on the terrace, watching TV, etc after the race. It was my little oasis.

Not broke, but with unemployment comes the opportunity to play a little. Quitting my line of work however is harder than leaving the Mob. Partly my fault as I am a bit of a work-a-holic and am doing my best to rid myself of a paycheck (for now).

I'm sure the boss people at The Cosmopolitan have been sitting on pins and needles waiting for me to post my review. I mean 1400 plus postings and mine would surely put this beautiful property over the top.

I've gotten too old for hotels that attract kids running up and down hallways, screaming 20 somethings next door slamming doors and trays of smelling food left outside of rooms. The Cosmopolitan caters towards an older crowd like myself (pushing 40 dude).

When I booked the hotel a few months ago I was really excited to stay there because I was given a great rate on the hotel because of the convention.  We arrived there before noon and checked in but was informed that our room was not available because the cleaning staff was still cleaning the rooms.  We agreed to wait and were given our keys to the room but that the staff would text me when the room was ready and that the keys would then be activated to the room.  There would be no need for us to come back to the check in desk unless there was an issue.  Next we checked in our bags at the bell desk and then proceeded to enjoy the hotels amenities.
So just before 2 PM I got a phone call from one of the staff at the hotel saying that the room I requested was not available but a room on the same floor with 2 Queen Beds was ready to be used.  Since it was just me and my wife I had originally asked for a single King size bed but due to time constraints, the convention started at 2PM and was at another hotel, we took the accommodation.  We figured that we would take the room, call the bell desk to bring up our bags and freshen up then go on our way to the convention a little late.  That was the biggest mistake ever and from then on it just got worse.  My wife went in to use the restroom and there she found a pubic hair on the toilet seat.  She really had to go so I wiped it off and she went.  The rest of what happened there can best be described by the pictures attached.  The room looked like it was cleaned by someone who did not know what they were doing while the whole time using a dirty towel and water.  
Here is a list of problems we found in the supposed clean room:
1. Pubic hair on toilet seat
2. Blood on the inside of the toilet bowl
3. Makeup stains on the walls
4. Smudge stains on the windows and mirrors
5. Mold on the wall
6. Air vents that have not been cleaned in quite a while
7. Seat cushion that had a good layer of dust on them
8. Stains on most of the carpet
9. Tickets and paper on the floor
10. Some crusty stain on one of the duvets
11. A drinking glass that looks like it had been never been cleaned

I called the housekeeping department immediately and the sent up the floor supervisor.  She was a very nice lady and was very sympathetic to our situation.  Once she started to clean she noticed that there were too many issues so she went looking for another room to move us into.  To help keep us informed she promised to be gone 5-10 minutes top.  When all was said and done it took us just under an hour to get to our new room literally 6 doors down and across the hall.  But to be fair to her she did call us a couple of times to let us know that she was cleaning the room for us.  
Once we got to the new room it was cleaner and it finally was the original room I was supposed to get, the one with the King size bed.  So now it is after 3 PM we had not eaten and still needed to get ready to go to the convention.  I was so livid that I called to speak guest services and I was connected to someone from the hotel that I had to explain my concerns before they would even connect me to the proper department.  Once connected I again had to explain what had happened. 
A few minutes later we got a knock at the door with someone delivering a box of chocolates and an apology letter. Now we left the room just after 3:45 having dealt with all of these issues.

We came back to the room that evening being tired from the convention and all of the rushed walking we had to do so that we could make up for the hours we had lost.  So tired we just went to bed.  The next morning while I was down stairs getting my wife some coffee she started to make the bed only to come across what looked like either blood or juice stain on the blanket we had just slept with.  I had gone to the gym and told my wife that when I was done I would try to get that fixed with housekeeping.  

Once I had finished my wife called me to tell me that the shower in our room was not draining so it was like standing in a lake.  Also lights in the room that seem to be working yesterday were not suddenly working now.  I went to the front desk to complain but they were not having it until I produced the pictures that we had taken of the previous room did I get someone from guest services to come out and talk to me.  She said that she would send up someone from the facilities department to address my issue and that she would comp me a visit to the day spa.  But when I looked into what she comped me it was so that I can take a shower there and nothing more.  If I wanted to shower in the open I would have stated in a hostel not a hotel.

Yup, as soon as you walk into the lobby, you are invited in with the allure of large glass columns with ever changing themes. Chic mirrors and chandeliers dripping with crystals from the ceiling and everything around you just seems to sparkle with a sleek, sexy flare that is all Vegas. 

I checked in for the July 4th weekend and got up sold by a very aggressive front desk clerk that insisted on getting me into the penthouse.  I settled for a 910sq. ft. angle suite on the 58th floor with additional Japanese soaking tub, terrace with a view of the Bellagio fountains, kitchenette with fridge & microwave and an additional full sized bath with shower. Not too shabby.   

The room I must say was very spacious, the view off the expansive terrace was breathtaking and i used the soaking tub practically every night after the clubs so it worked out great!

My only complaint was with housekeeping.  There's a circular red paper note you're supposed to leave on the bed to have your linens changed, which i did but every night i came back to the room, my sheets were done but not changed! It was ridonkulous! Even the dirty pillow that had some sketchy black skid mark smeared on it (that i never used from day one) remained in my room til the last day i was there....nuts!

Perhaps all the smoke and mirrors at the entrance lobby had me blinded by the hotel's sexy charm but with all due respect, my stay was very enjoyable and despite the minor flaws, I had a fantastic time... 

With that said, the hotel was conveniently located in the heart of the strip. It's steps away from the Bellagio, Planet Hollywood and Paris...and the Sahra Spa, brunch and pool were very enjoyable...and partying at the Marquee & Bond was priceless!

1st and foremost, the roof pool is amazing! I can only imagine this place in the summer. Views overlooking the Strip - like literally you're smack dab in the middle of it - and designed so trendily. Best part of this place.

Also went to the Chandelier Bar here. It was aight. You basically step inside the thing and you get 3 levels of bar. Whatever. Nothing special. I'd rather go to the bar on the other side of the casino called Bond. Significantly cooler and you're able to walk around more freely. 

Lastly, some of the decor of this place looked like it was entrusted to the casino owner's teenage daughter. She just went f'ing crazy and furnished the place from those ear-piercing shops they have at the mall. Fluffy, girly shit everywhere. It will be cool for a few years, but then get incredibly tacky onward. Please hire a new interior decorator.",0,1,0

Eventually, my friend and I stumbled on this amazing pizza spot next to Jose Andres' restaurant, which incidentally had actually been recommended to us by another friend though we didn't realize it until later. The pizza was on hit - piping hot, with just enough grease from meaty pepperoni to satisfy my buzzed cravings. Once we sobered up a little, we realized that the Cosmo was gorgeous and had a ton of fine dining to check out, making us realize we want to stay here the next time we are in town. Though we were happy with the Venetian, the Cosmo is sleek and has a great young and modern ambiance that fits in perfectly with those wanting a little sophistication during a weekend of debauchery.",2,1,0

The service was all over the place.  One bar had lame bartender who had no patience, although she WAS really busy.  One bar had bartenders sitting around who were very nice.  The two bars were about 20 feet from each other and one was packed and one had open seats.  I don't really understand, but okay!  Vegas is a crazy place!

Drinks were expensive which isn't surprising, but at least they were strong (also not surprising - welcome to Vegas).  

The atmosphere and decor were pretty cool.  They were all over the place, from the LED light shows to the giant chandelier, but the common theme was dark, modern, and vaguely club-like.  It was nice, almost felt like being in a club when you're just inside a foyer.  Oh, and the seat I was in at the bar?  Amazingly comfortable.",1,0,1

Our view was right over the bellagio water show, it was like front row tickets without all the rowdiness. Our room had two full bathrooms which came in handy with 4 girls. The annoying part was the kitchenette, it didn't come with any utensils or plates at all. We called in to get some brought up and it took more than an hour! It makes no sense, they should at least ask if you want the brought up during check out. The gadgets in the room are mostly touchscreen, and very new.** Be aware that your room key has your name on it, and you can only go up if you have a key to press the floor on the elevator*** So if your having people over, you will have to come downstairs to bring them up..lame..

Honestly, I thought their commercials were a little creepy and trying too hard.  So I was pleasantly surprised when I first visited the place and explored the different levels.  Ever since that first visit, the Cosmopolitan has kept me coming back for more.

There's a different feel to this place compared to most hotel\/casinos here. I feel like they were targeting my age group (the 20-30-somethings), a younger crowd than the usual Strip population. Whether or not it was on purpose, that is what the Cosmopolitan has become.

The other thing I like about this place: I feel like I can just hang out there.  And I don't feel that way about any other place on the strip.  If I do make my way onto the Strip, it's for a reason (usually eating or shopping).  But the numerous bars always make me consider the Cosmopolitan as a weekend option.

One more reason to love this place: Parking.  Their parking garages are pretty easy to access without having to spend too much time on Las Vegas Blvd. They've also made it easy to find a parking spot with red (occupied) and green (open) lights above each space. And I don't know if it's just my luck, but their valet parking is never full.  Even on a weekend or holiday.  These things are what make this local come back.",1,0,0

Every hotel that opens in Vegas tries to one-up and out-do the last property that had a grand opening.  The Cosmopolitan is actually a Marriott property, but they downplay that.  Clearly, the goal is to have the Cosmo be known as a unique luxury resort.

It's loud.  You can definitely get disoriented.  I don't think I'd make it in or out alive, by myself.  Even the parking underground is a maze.  Avoiding the gambling areas was a cinch, though.

Hotel rooms, conference space, and ballrooms are divided among different towers.  But the main part of The Cosmopolitan is a vertical shopping structure with eateries, bars and distractions on every level.

The main thing is, tons of people desperate to be noticed come here.  Maybe because the Cosmo is a relatively newer luxury hotel on the Strip-- not just a re-modeled one.  Maybe it has something to do with *untz untz untzz* Marquee being here.

Common areas are maddeningly crowded.  Making it frustrating as far as trying to get from point A to B.  Observing the washed and unwashed masses roaming around the Cosmopolitan is entertaining.

People just stand around blocking escalators, yelling at others in their crew, motor-boating female friends as greeting.  Hen nights.  Circus of randoms dressed and ready to wait in line for an hour just to klurrrb.  Gaggles of wimmens in their most obvious metallic, leather and shiniest, buy me a drank outfits, wobbling around in their seven-inch stilettos.  Hordes of them trying to bounce into Marquee.

Hotel rooms themselves are, thankfully, away from the ridjiculously crowded areas.  Also slightly intimidating, in a weird fashion-- with all the luxe, tech, painfully hip amenities.  Still, it's just a room, people.

Am I sounding not impressed?  Well don't get me wrong, it is an impressive property.  Just a bit overwhelming.

Suffice to say, the Cosmopolitan lives up to its name:  modern, chic... cosmopolitan.",175,177,173

One dollar for a spoon!!!  

Don't come and valet and use the bell carts if you have anything other than luggage. $20 charge for anything but luggage. We had wrapped bridesmaid gifts along with a ton of luggage and had to pay $20!!!  

Nickel and dimed for everything, everything costs extra and on top of the room rates, taxes, etc etc, there's a resort fee. For what???  One pool was closed and what other resort amenities do they have?  None!!  And if I'm paying to the gym, they have those at all hotels. Nothing special. 

About day two, we were done tipping, done paying for crap that should have been included because my gawd, there was a stove but if I had wanted a pan, it cost a dollar. Six nights there and again, the room was nice but we will never stay again. Hubby complained and they credited us $200 but that doesn't even cover the few spoons and cups we asked for along with all the detailed costs for every single thing.

Now, it's so overrated and it's so packed with people I will not stay here again. So many issues for a classy hotel, I'm very upset with my recent stay. 

Room Issues: I am paying an expensive resort fee for God knows what. $8 bottles of water in the mini bar is an outrage when they are $2 at the store. It just feels like a rip off here. The TV kept going on and off, on and off. Some sort of sensor was setting on the TV as I was trying to sleep. The pillows were very odd with no support. I pulled a muscle in my neck since I was straining my neck as I slept. The room temperature kept blasting out 40 degree cold air, and then the room would get warm, and then it would be freezing. My spouse and I both ended up shivering in this room and I got sick from the constant room temperature shifts. I was so uncomfortable staying here! 

Room Service: I was charged $40 for a plate of pasta and lemonade. I ordered it without shrimp since I'm vegetarian and they still charged me the price as if I got shrimp. The pasta was very salty and lukewarm. Underwhelming in-room dining experience. 

Dining: I had to wait over AN HOUR of Secret Pizza (not so secret anymore). The guy even forgot my slices so I had to wait another 15 minutes. There are tons of people and lines everywhere! I get it. It's on the Strip. But it's too crazy here now. 

I liked the old Cosmopolitan from maybe 5 years ago much better. Even though it's nicer renovations wise, the service has gone downhill and you are treated in an assembly line. I feel ripped off.

My boyfriend and I stayed here last weekend for our anniversary and I'm already counting the days when I can come back. From the ambiance to the simple things like pizza, I just couldn't get enough of this place. 

Let's start with check-in, the staff was very friendly and informative. She gave us a map of the place and also recommended going to the Marquee day club, since we were hotel guest we would be comped. 

The room was extravagant! I seriously had to tell myself to close my mouth when I walked into the room. Big, comfy bed with like 8 pillows, your body just sinks in. The tv controller not only controlled the tv but adjusted the lighting, climate and even made reservations for the restaurants in the hotel. The bathroom was unbelievable, so modern and luxurious but yet functional at the same time. 

The food was mouthwatering! We had a slice each at the hidden pizza place our first day and ended up ordering a whole pizza by the end of the first night. We ate at Jaleo for dinner, this place brings the authentic flavor of Spanish tapas and paellas to Vegas. The food was delectable and the service was incredible! We ate at The Henry for breakfast and for a late night sweet tooth fix. The service was also incredible and the food was good for something quick and convenient.

Marquee... Marquee... Marquee! What can I say about this place???? This is one of my favorite clubs in Vegas. We make it a point to come here every time we're in town. This time it was Party Rock Mondays Redfoo from LMFAO, let me just say, if you've never been, you're missing out on one of the best parties in Vegas! Redfoo definitely knows how to entertain! I had the time of my life! 

Now my favorite part of The Cosmopolitan is definitely the pool! The boulevard pool is the most relaxing pool I've ever been to. It has strip views and shallow parts to lay in, so if you get hot from laying out, you can lay out in the pool. I love, love, love this pool!

So needless to say, I highly recommend you stay here at least one but     trust me, you will definitely wanna come back!!!!!!!",3,1,1

We got into line at the registration desk and we're greeted by Alain. It was Alain's suggestion that we upgrade from the regular Terrace Studio to the Fountain View -- and he couldn't have been more right! His customer service was, by far, the best that I have ever seen -- hopefully he is promoted really soon! 

We booked the Terrace Studio Fountain View. This room has to be the best room I have stayed in. The bed and pillows were comfortable and relaxing. He bed came with 4 pillows, no need to call down and ask for more. The room had two bathrooms. The first was right as you enter, it had a shower and toilet. The second bathroom has double doors you enter through, there you have a shower, Japanese soaking tub (there's a window at the tub that you can close or keep open and look toward the Bellagio fountains and Paris. 

The patio had phenomenal views of the fountains, Paris, Bally's, the Cromwell and Flamingo. There were two patio chairs as well as ashtrays (if you wish to smoke).

When calling up for our bags, the bellman was at our door In less than 10 minutes. That was the quickest service I have ever got from a bellman at any hotel. Same when we called to have our bags stored before checking out, the bellman was quick and very courteous.

My fiancé, who was clearly not dressed, asked if she could wait until she put some clothes on. And the woman looked at her and said, ""I need to check your mini bar."" Instead of waiting, she continues to walk through our room, open up the mini bar door, take a look at the bottles, and walk out without saying anything else. I understand that she was doing her job, and we have no problem with staff members checking things out if they need to, but I'd appreciate a little more courtesy as a guest. I've read a few other reviews on Yelp where other people have complained about staff members entering their rooms unannounced or without permission. I find it odd that it seems to be a trend. Again, I understand that the staff members have to do their jobs, which include entering guests' rooms, but don't be surprised if someone barges into your room while you're standing in a towel.",2,0,0

The rooms are really nice.  We stayed in a suite that had balcony with a beautiful view of the water show next door to the Belagio and a gorgeous view of Vegas itself. The nice thing also is you walk outside and across the street is Planet Hollywood with their inside mall!. Close by to everything from other hotels, restaurants to clubs.

The room was very spacious.  I've had bad  experiences with hotel beds and pillows, even at the Vegas hotels. I feel like the pillows sometimes are too soft, or too elevated for me where I wake up with my neck all stiff. Normally the beds are too soft that you sink in them, how are you suppose to get busy with a woman if you can't keep yourself balanced or from sinking in?? Any who, I didn't have a problem with that at the Cosmopolitan.  I actually managed to get some rest to continue the partying the following night.  What I really loved from our suite, was the bathroom.  The bathtub had its own jets built-in that made it into a personal, one seat er jacuzzi.  I sat my ass in that bathtub for about an hour, dying from my hangover.  Surprisingly, it help!

Service was excellent, the price is a little steep, but totally worth the experience.  If your a ""weekend warrior"" that likes to go to Vegas often, try the Cosmopolitan at least once, pretty sure you'll like it.  Make sure you get a room on the side of the building that gets that water show from the Belagio!",1,0,0

This hotel is pretty and shiny and newish, but little cheesy\/eighties with the red and the black and the glittery bits. The entire property is basically one big nightclub with beds. I know you come across some degree of this in every Vegas property with a casino; but, this was to the nth degree of anything I have experienced in a long history of successful gambling\/bing drinking\/gourgingtrips to the city. 

We had called and requested a certain room type days in advance, then again called to confirm that morning of travel and were assured it would not be a problem. But, upon check-in, were advised the room was not available. The room we were placed in was fine, but situated directly above the indoor\/outdoor nightclub. You don't really sleep that much in Vegas anyway, but at 14 floors above the lounge I really wouldn't expect the party to be penetrating my walls from 6am to 4am. Don't most people stay in bed past at least 9am in Viva anyway?

The second night the hotel did move us, as requested, to the quieter side of the building, overlooking the Bellagio fountains. If I had some way to pipe the music up from the fountains to my room, I probably would have spent the whole weekend on the balcony. One very nice thing about the rooms was the access to a decent sized patio, which is hard to find anywhere in Las Vegas. 

Our second room was as attractive as the bellman that moved us into it. The rooms are contemporary, in a 'this was chic in 1985 is cool again white on white kind of way'. The rooms had two well defined areas, one for sleeping and one for lounging, as well as a nice sized bathroom with Bigelow amenities. I liked the fact that each room had lots of art and culture related books, although, one of the big picture books was sticky. Hotel+Vegas+Sticky Picture Book = Idontwannaknow. 

The bottom line for me is that I am not now, nor have I ever been a club girl. The Cosmopolitan is made for the club guys and girls of the world. And, with the $350 price tag on a holiday weekend, your average club guys and girls were packing themselves like sardines in to their double occupancy rooms so they could still afford their Red Bull & vodka cocktails. On several occasions we had to wait times to get up and down the elevators because they were so overly full. The civil engineer who approved that design should stick to single floor establishments. 

The hotel was absolutely overrun with hammered broads in cheap heels and cheaper dresses (I know guys - dream come true) and douchey dudes in stripey shirts. I walked outside one night to a waiting car, on our way out to a nice dinner, and stepped directly into gum, which essentially ruined my (not cheap) shoes. I could go on for days, but I think ""gum spitting crowd"" and a staff who doesn't care to clean it up pretty much sums up my experience here.",7,5,4

The hotel really booked me in a suite that already had customers still in it. I specifically booked that suite to enjoy a pre honeymoon weekend with my husband. They ended up changing our room to another suite (not the same one as booked) which was ok but I still wanted to be booked in the room with the jacuzzi. The hotel is beautiful and the food was good so I think they just need a better check in system because it took them FOREVER to figure out the situation once we told them the room they gave us was already occupied.

Last time we came, we received an upgrade to a very large suite but this time we were told it would cost $150 extra a night if we wanted the upgrade this time. This didn't make sense to me because the room was obviously available and they didn't charge us last time we requested an upgrade. Apparently they don't offer this perk for Platinum Elite anymore, but oh well. VIP Check-in is worth it so you don't have to wait in long lines. We received a room with a good fountain view, though smaller than I'd hoped for. Terrace Suite was good, clean, and comfortable. They do still offer the Wicked Spoon brunch buffet for two for Platinum, but the drinks are no longer included as they once were. Still, $10 dollar bottomless mimosas or bloody mary's...not too bad!

For the gamblers: The dealers here are very friendly - as the security guards are too. I can't tell you how many times I got carded and they asked in an INCREDIBLY polite way. My ID was never demanded, always asked politely if they could please see it. I shouldn't complain for getting carded, but when you hear it 15 times in an hour, you want to hear somebody be polite about it.

The Bad:

-This entire casino smells like sewage. Am I the only person who thinks this? I'm not sure if it's a combo of the perfumes and central air scent or what, but it's weird.

-Service has depleted a bit since our last visit a year ago.

My partner and I arrived on a Sunday, and were checking out on a Friday. We took a Lyft from McCarran and noted that the area for cars was a little small, but since it's a more contemporary hotel this is probably to minimize our environmental footprint. Since we arrived fairly early (around 12), we left our baggage with the bell desk, all of whom were quick, incredibly welcoming, and overall great. Afterwards, we headed to Wicked Spoon, then the front desk to check in and Andrea kindly assisted us. Originally we booked a terrace studio, but we mentioned we were on this trip for our anniversary and she provided a complimentary upgrade to a terrace suite facing the south part of the Strip.

My partner and I frequently travel, but we usually stay at modest Airbnbs. We booked our room with the expectation that it would be an experience to stay along the Strip. When we arrived, the room was wonderful and far more than we could have imagined. With its own living room, spacious closet, fridge and microwave, soaking tub (unfortunately with no jets), two sinks, sliding doors, comfortable bed, blackout curtains, and seating along the terrace, we were floored with how much was in it. The view on the terrace is not as gorgeous as the fountain view, but still certainly nice with a fun vantage point to watch events at the Marquee pool, etc. That being said, there were a few issues with the room: the toilet door kept getting jammed, one of the faucets in one of the sinks wouldn't turn at all, and the lights wouldn't turn off in the closet. The toilet door was taken care of as soon as it could be (thanks to David with Facilities!), and the front desk gave us a room credit as an apology, but it was still frustrating until fixed.

Housekeeping was incredibly respectful of our space, and when they came in while we had a do not disturb sign, they left a note and asked us to call the front if anything was needed. I appreciate that they only replace bed linens every third day because I respect conservation of resources. We were startled because one night our lights were on and balcony rearranged, but we came to the conclusion it was because they vacuumed. I would have liked a note, but that's ok. I did, however, call housekeeping for a comb and did not ever receive it. :(

The design of the hotel is sleek and very modern. There's a lot more open space here than older properties along the Strip, which I loved. The casino smells of cigarettes like most, but it's definitely not as bad as others. Slot machines are pretty modern, mostly electronic rather than manual. I do wish they offered you something besides $5 when you sign up for Identity (their rewards program), because another nearby hotel offers you either two free drinks or something else that I forgot.

The hotel consists of two towers, Chelsea and Boulevard. We stayed on the 25th floor of the Boulevard Tower. On the last few days of our trip the elevators only worked sporadically for the entire tower. My partner and I needed to leave by a certain time and literally no elevator passed our floor so I called Guest Services to inquire about the elevator situation. They apologized, said their technicians were fixing it, and offered us room credit and a phone call when it was done as compensation. Because of our time constraint, we had to walk down 25 flights of stairs, and I was in heels so I was not a happy camper. This kept happening throughout the last few days, to the point where we got in an elevator to go upstairs since we didn't know if it would come back down to our floor (it didn't, it reset). We hope they will resolve this permanently, but in the future I will request a room in the Chelsea Tower instead.

Check-out was initially disappointing. I shared some concerns with Diego, who did not seem to care and basically shooed us away after charging the card on file. I just felt like dollar signs rather than a valued guest. Frustrated, I later spoke with Alfredo at the Information desk, who brought me Valerie, the Director of Front Office. I shared my concerns (and also praise), and she handled the situation calmly, tactfully, and to my satisfaction. 

Some random cool things to note. The Chandelier bar is very interesting (different drinks on each floor) and all the lights are real. Secret Pizza, when you find it, is tasty. Summer Dive In movies at the Boulevard Pool are a fun activity, but if you're facing the south side of the Strip you can just watch from your balcony. There's a walkway outside that leads you to Planet Hollywood from the second floor.

To recap, the snafus with the toilet door, comb, elevator, and Diego brought this to 3; Andrea, David, Alfredo, and Valerie helped bring it back to a 4. I'm glad they made things right and I hope to encounter more staff like them whenever I return.",3,1,3

It's difficult to give only 1 star to what could easily be a five star hotel but because of their booking policy, I have to.
I booked with Expedia because I actually like dealing with them and you're guaranteed the room you book. I brought my entire family and I was staying for 5 days. We drove in late to avoid Saturday traffic. I had booked the one bedroom terrace suite overlooking the fountain. But when I got there, they had given my room to someone else and they gave me a handicapped studio on the other side of hotel ( not the Bellagio fountain). I had to move the next day to the room I had booked originally. Why?!!! What a stupid policy.
It completely ruined our whole evening and was a pain to have to unpack and pack up the next day. They downgraded our Saturday reservation! 
This is how they treat repeat customers who plan ahead. Wow! It was our anniversary. So instead of soaking in our tub as we watched the fountain,
I was crying into my cocktail and drank way too many. 
So my friends! It's a first come first serve, general admission hotel. Most of the people who work there are amazing and really sweet, I really appreciate all the people who tried to help me but one cannot makeup for a horrible booking policy or for ruining a couples anniversary.

Although the Cosmopolitan has been open for nearly a year they just don't have it together yet. 

The lines to check in or out at chaotic. I was unable to get a final statement when leaving as the front desk was a mob seen. A trip to the front desk to get an extra key took 25 minutes.

There was no facility to print boarding passes or at least none that any of the employees knew about. We left an extra hour early and had our boarding passes printed at the airport. 

A cab driver told us they avoid the hotel of traffic congestion, making the line long and slow. 

There were times we waited 15 minutes or more for an elevator to squeeze into. Many would stop at absolute capacity. 

I am told this building was intended to be condos rather than a hotel. This may explain the difficult approach for the cabs and the seemingly insufficient number of elevators. Residents would likely not be coming and going as often as visitors. 
Thus would be a good place to stay on weekday but not during busy times.

Checked in to the hotel on Sunday 10\/19\/2014.  The line to check out was pretty long but there were about 10 attendants assisting customers so the wait time was about 20 minutes to see a clerk to check you in which should not be the case at a higher rated resort.  The front desk had me as checking into a 'City Room' while I booked a one bedroom suite with a terrace.  They reviewed my reservation again and requested evidence from me for which they accommodated my reservation.  They attempt to up-sell nicer rooms which I am okay with but others may find this as an annoyance. The attendant keeps guiding you through photos on a screen of different room types and floor plans in hopes of up-selling.  I'm still okay with that but they may want to reconsider this practice when there is a line of 90 people waiting to check in to their rooms.  

The room itself nice mainly because it was newish but lacked some finishing touches and doesn't seem too well thought out.  For example, the suites at the Aria have heated toilets, the ones in the cosmo have toilets.  The bathroom is open to the bedroom.  No, this is not a typo, the bathroom is actually open to the bedroom. 

To use the square tub, enough for two people to sit in but extremely short (aprox 3.5') but is not enough for even one person to lay in or use as a tub.  The design allows for sitting only and the tub has a window open to the bedroom.  No glass, no wall, just a tub that looks into your bedroom with a wooden dusty shade (which looks like it was purchased second hand from an Econo Lodge) that could be pulled down between the bathroom and bedroom. 

The Balcony and the view...  so the balcony glass is absolutely FILTHY, it has not been cleaned since probably the first month the resort opened for business.  The view was of a massive air conditioning vent even thought the suite views are advertised as City, Strip and Fountain.  I don't care about view very much but I'd prefer not to go onto my terrace and see a massive central air condenser.

When I first got to the hotel, there were literally SEVEN knocks on my door by hotel staff.  They claim they received calls to drop off a hair dryer (not me), they receive another call to clean the balcony (not me- oh, and they swept the floor of the balcony but the glass is still a disaster), another visit to fill the mini bar (not me), one more because someone reported a fuse being blown out (not me), One more dropping off towels (not me) and the other two I can't recall off hand.  

I called the front desk and asked where they ""do not disturb"" signs are kept and they said it should be right behind the door.  I asked them to deliver one and they said they would but I requested they stop knocking, just please hang the sign on my door because I have not requested a anything from the staff and am getting harassed by hotel staff. They followed my request.  Thank you cosmo, you followed my instructions. 

Checkout times.... They have checkout at 11:00 AM.  To the best of my knowledge most strip hotels offer a Noon checkout but are extremely courteous to their guests with regard to checking out late. Nope, not here at the cosmo.  They knocked at my door at 11:50 (Do not disturb sign posted, but the knock for checking out late I could understand).  I told them I was packing up and will be out in a few minutes.  About 20 minutes went by when I look over the bill on the TV screen and see excessive mini bar charges.  This isn't my first time at a hotel with a mini bar so I'm familiar with charges being applied if anything is moved.  I confirmed and accounted for about four items being used, and they had about 7 other items which were not used or touched, one of which was cashews, which they charged three times for on the same day.  your 14.00 cashews are still here great cosmo people.  They proceeded to let me know they would check to confirm the items are still here and if they were they would remove them from the bill.  I'm okay with that but anytime I've ever called down for a item at the mini bar not having been used, without question, the front desk apologizes and removes it from the bill. 

I thanked them for reviewing my minibar situation and asked if he wanted me to check out on the screen or he wanted to check me out.  He was like, well you know Mr F., it's already after 12:30, and there will be a late checkout fee added to your room.  I asked if he can remove that as a courtesy since I was unfamiliar with the fee. He said he could not, I asked what the fee was waived.  The front desk Manager had a smirk on his face, was extremely obnoxious and unpleasant.  His name was Caleb and I'm mind-boggled that this dude has a job.  You suck!",1,1,0

-prostitutes
-trashy
-bad maintenance 
-dirty bathroom
-bad cleaning led to injury
-unreliable wifi 
-bad smell in room 
-no follow up when I expressed concerns

Detailed review:

The thing I noticed upon entering was the weird smell in the room. It smelled kind of like mildew and pot. I just left the door open to air the room out, but the smell ended up persisting for the whole stay. I also noticed that there was a huge wet spot on the carpet. I stepped in it and got my socks wet. It just seemed to be water so I let it go. I just thought the maid spilled water on the carpet. Little did I know, that nasty wet spot on the carpet would actually end up spreading and growing bigger throughout my stay. It seemed to be leakage from the air conditioning, so I think that was the source of the mildew smell. 

My room was also not cleaned well. This is absolutely unacceptable because I checked in later in the day, so their housekeeping had plenty of time to do a thorough job of cleaning up from the previous guest. The bathroom was sloppily cleaned. The sink vanity area had water spots all over the place and there were water spots all over the mirror. I do a much better job cleaning at home. The corners of the bathroom had piles of hair and dust from the previous occupants. 

The lack of attention to cleaning really showed in the shower. First of all, the handle to turn the water on in the shower was so loose that I could've easily pulled it off completely. This is something the maid should've noticed if they'd paid any attention while cleaning, which they clearly did not. Who would expect a new hotel to have some shoddy maintenance that their fixtures are already falling off? It turns out that this lack of attention to detail is DANGEROUS because my travel companion got a cut on their foot from a small glass shard that was in the shower. Not a good start to a trip in Vegas where you have to do a lot of walking. 

While I'm on the subject of the shower, you get a peekaboo style shower in your room. What this means is that if you don't close the blinds, everyone in the room gets to see you shower. The blinds roll down from the INSIDE of the room, not from within the shower. So if you piss off one of your travel companions, or they're big pranksters, that means they can roll up the blinds while you're showering...in which case I hope you've got a very fit body, waxed beforehand, and have an exhibitionist nature, or a swimsuit, because they'll see everything and you can't do a thing about it unless you step out of the shower to close the blinds. This feature sounds pretty sexy if you're traveling with your partner for a romantic weekend, but it's not ideal if you're traveling with family or friends. Even with the blinds rolled down, they'll see your silhouette anyways so you might as well put on a good show and shower seductively. Lol. I suggest you watch some Cinemax at night for ideas for posing. Ever think about how sexy you can look while washing shampoo out of your hair? Well you can test that out here. 

The resort fee is high and it covers wifi usage for your stay. I won't complain about high resort fees because that's pretty much standard I'm Vegas hotels now. What I will complain about however, is the unreliable internet connection. I had to wait a long time for pages to load and it cut in and out a lot. You can pay an extra fee for premium internet if you want. 

As far as the bedroom area is concerned, I was not impressed. It's got a lot of flashy design but it's nothing special as far as Vegas hotel rooms go. There are mirrors all over the place and artwork of female and male legs over the headboard of the beds. It's supposed to be sexy but it just reminded me of crime scene photos. The agenda of this hotel is pretty clear. If you look in the minibar area, you can buy a kit with condoms, lube, and mints from the minibar. 

On an elevator ride back up to my room one night, my elevator companions were two prostitutes accompanied by two clients. They were negotiating payment in the elevator. One John was so flustered that he forgot to get off the elevator with his lady. The door closed and she'd stepped out while he was stuck for another few floors. Talk about embarrassing. Lol. 

Fun fact: while prostitution is actually legal in Nevada, it's actually illegal in Clark County, which Las Vegas is a part of. It's one of those things that I think some hotels, such as this one, look the other way on. Do with that info as you wish. 

The overall impression I got was kind of trashy. Another thing that I saw in the hotel was a girl that was so drunk that she stumbled around, fell to the floor, and had to be escorted out by security in a wheelchair. Ever been so drunk that you need a wheelchair? It's like spring break up in here. 

For the price that I paid, I expected much more from this hotel. When I expressed my concerns to their ""guest services specialist"", I got no response. Very disappointing.",9,6,2

Although the presentation of the food was good.  It was definitely one of the worse buffet we had.  Both service and the food quality is simply unacceptable.  We entered the buffet at 5:30 PM on XMas Eve.  By 6:00 PM, most of the better food were completely gone.  And left with the pasta and cheap meat.  The roast beef\/prime rib was worse than the buffet you can find for $15\/person.  It has absolutely no taste.  They serve lamb, but they were serving lamb leg instead of rack of lamb.   We waited for 45 minutes for their soup noodles and it was never refilled.  The korean bbq short ribs were also gone by 6pm.  We had empty glasses of drinks and stacks of plate after an hour because we never seen our waiter.   There were like 12 different flavors of ice cream and 5 of them were out.  As for the fruit, they serve only 2 different kind of fruit which are pear and banana.  We talked with the manager about it, he agree that the service was unacceptable but never get back to us.  As for the crab legs, they were cheap small crab legs.  The buffet was definitely not worth $45.",0,0,0

Never again!!!!

How is it that everyone that got tickets to attend the Super Bowl Party at the Chelsea ballroom and about 100 people left standing.  There were not enough tables and chairs for the guests. It was ridiculous!!  It was so unorganized!!  

I had to put two chairs together side by side and three of us sit together, of course the other end girl and myself get to share it with only half of our cheeks.  My husband had to stand during the 1st half of the game.  The other guy went back up to the room and watch the game, my bro in law went out to game at a table, one girl went up to the room and took a nap.  Thats how 7 of us got seating at the end.  And we snatched from other tables too.  Pathetic.!!

The food selection was very minimal!!  One small circle and that's it.  No pizza, shrimp cocktails, Haagen dazs ice cream, buffalo wings ran out, No vegetarian food for veggie friend. I could go on... but I'm tired.   I guess we were spoiled by Caesers Palace Super Bowl.

Tonight we attended our second Identity Series cardholders' free event.  This was a ""tasting"" at the Wicked Spoon, their buffet.  Private room, all you can drink of the two specialty drinks that were available:  one was an apple and vodka concoction, and the other was a ginger beer and vodka.  Both were terrific, and I didn't get the name of either drink.  But before I could even get to Drink #2, I no longer cared  :D

The food was buffet-style, and tonight's offering was Polish Cuisine (as in Poland - you didn't have to shine anything).  They had the a dish akin to stuffed cabbage, only the little meatballs were mixed with shredded cabbage, rather than stuffed into cabbage leaves.  I'll have to remember this - it's much less work to prepare!  It was delicious.  There were also fresh green beans that had a major kick; beautiful yellow beets and purple cauliflower that were pickled, but much too tangy for my taste.  And there was also hot borscht, served in little glasses with or without sour cream.

Waiters passed trays of breaded pork filet ""fingers"" that were outstanding, and superb pirogies.

The desserts were to die for - upscale pastries and mousses that for once tasted as good as they looked, and white or dark chocolate-covered marshmallow lollipops.  

My group of seven was lucky to snare one of the four round banquettes that were available.  Others had to stand at tables, and this event, which was supposed to be two hours long, actually lasted quite a bit longer.

This was a fantastic event,  and FREE!!! - and if Cosmopolitan continues to offer this kind of perk to cardholders, it will be a death knell to other casinos.  

The ambience throughout the hotel is phenomenal.  My major quibble is that the casino does not have enough machines to pique the interest of us low-rollers.  Too many of the penny machines have outrageously high minimum bids, and they just turn me off.  If I wanted to blow $3 and up for each pull, I'd play dollar machines.  But I don't.  So I don't gamble any more money at Cosmopolitan, I just spend less time there.

I have to give big kudos to George, one of the security staff.  When I first got to the hotel tonight I sat down at a slot machine to search my purse for my Identity Card.  I couldn't find it easily, so I pulled everything out.  Midway through the Wicked Spoon event, I realized my iPhone was gone, and took the long hike back to that slot machine.  The machine was right next to an escalator which, because it wasn't working, had George in front of it directing people.  He was still there when I went back and, praise whatever deity you worship, he had my phone!!!  Of course, the major thank you has to go to the honest person who turned it in to him, but that identity will never be known.  

The phone caper was the icing on the cake for an evening that was perfectly executed and beyond classy.  I love this hotel!!!",2,1,1

The service was exceptional, particularly from Michaela in their guest services team.I have stayed in the Wraparound suites on each occasion and would definitely recommend it. Plenty of room, could easily fit upto 6 or 7 people in this room and the balcony is hUge (in warmer months you could actually have a couple of people sleep out on the balcony). Speak to guest services or pay the extra $ on the website for the view of the Bellagio fountains, it's well worth it! 

The food at The Wicked Spoon is great although $40+ is a bit steep but if you can get breakfast included with your room then it's well worth it. The pool area isn't huge (compared to say, The Aria) but is a cool place to hang out with good views of the strip.

I did used to stay at The Aria and whilst I wouldn't complain if I had to stay at The Aria again (another great hotel), The Cosmo has now become my residence of preference whenever I'm in Vegas. It's the kind of place Johnny Drama would stay and that's good enough for me.",0,0,0

I am soooo over the looks of Venetian, Wynn, Ceasers, etc- so done with old world sexy).

Love the room amenities- but hate that the fridge is not empty- we like to stock our own- so my tip... load that great deep kitchen sink with ice and throw your champagne bottles or six packs (however you roll-hey- it's THE Vegas) in there.

Check in was easy and quick- the quickest I have ever seen and we checked in on Saturday of Labor Day weekend. The pool you ask? Lovely and felt clean unlike at the day club at Marquee.Cosmo has access to lots of fun shopping and other great casinos, clubs, etc.

The hotel is stunning. The service is great, and there are a variety of restaurants from your standard Vegas hotel diner, the best buffet on the strip, and the secret pizza place (3rd floor, go down the hall that has the record covers). I haven't had a chance to try out some of the other restaurants but they always seemed to have a decent crowd.

The rooms have tons of amenities. BTW, don't touch anything on the minibar, even if you pick something up and set it back they'll charge you (do not know from experience, but have heard from others). The last time I went there was 4 of us sharing a jr. suite, and it is definitely meant for a couple. Luckily there are blinds to shut the 4 windows into the tub and shower or else we would have had to really get to know each other during our stay. 

Our balcony faced the Bellagio so it was just gorgeous looking out onto the fountain and strip.

The boulevard pool is awesome. We rented a day bed and were super glad we did, because the pool gets packed. The service is great and we definitely ate and drank our minimum easy. Great crowd and music and you don't feel like you don't fit in.

Vinny and I stayed there this summer during a quick jaunt to Vegas and really enjoyed the hotel and all of its amenities. When we first checked in, we didn't expect we'd have a good experience because right off the bat we had to wait in a 45-minute line to check in, and then, the hotel screwed up and didn't have our reservation correct. Fortunately, the folks at the Cosmopolitan more than made up for it by giving us an updated room free of charge-- and, I must say, the room was amazing!! It was a large 1 bedroom suite w\/ a balcony overlooking the Bellagio hotel and fountain (yes, the very one where they do the daily fountain and light show-- what a view, I tell ya)! Plus the room had a large sunken tub and walk-in shower, a large living room seating area, and high-tech work space (yep, sadly, I had to do a little work on the trip even though we were mostly there for vacation, but the work space turned out to be a godsend for me). 

Other great features of the Cosmopolitan include their casino (it's modern looking and packed with lots of high rollers and beautiful people), their abundance of restaurants and shops, and their large pool recreation area, which features a couple of outdoor bars and plenty of lounge chairs for relaxing.

My room was rather large, with a bathroom that looked into the bedroom!  Each room had a spacious balcony.  No Bibles or Book of Mormon instead they were replaced by art books and I had one of a Chinese Kama Sutra.  The mini-bar was responsible and there was even a can that contained condoms and other sensual delights (for $20 of course).  The hotel has numerous clever ""Do Not Disturb"" signs including one with 2 ladies in a very sexy pose.  

The art is incredible.  They have old cigarette vending machines throughout that are filled with various trinkets that you can purchase for $5 dollars.  I saw 2 very large high heeled shoes for a great photo op.  The lobby is amazing with screens everywhere allowing a quick change of appearance from an elevator shaft, to a library.

The eating areas were adequate.  I loved Eggslut!  (fantastic name)!  There is also another restaurant called Secret Pizza.  There is no mention of it in the signage as it is truly a secret (a cab driver told me about it on the way out).  

The casino area was good.  The table limits were mid- to upscale (rush times, craps tables had $15-$50 minimum bets).  There are 2 separate high-limit rooms.

The only downside was the check-in.  I arrived on a Sunday which I know was the worst day and I waited for 40 minutes.  Not sure if that is part of the mystique like waiting in line for a popular club.  There is some type of relationship between Marriott and the Cosmo and I wasn't sure what that was.  Marriott traditionally has never allowed gambling in any of its US properties.  Cosmo has its only rewards program that is separate from Marriott however I believe the points are transferable.  

This is without a doubt my favorite hotel.  Very surprising at every turn.  Kind of like a non-scary American Horror Story set (based off the LA Hotel season with Lady Gaga).",0,0,0

After enough complaining the hotel told my brother that they would move him to the west tower while we were out during the day.  By the time we returned at 5:00, not only did they not move him, but when we went to the front desk he was told there was no room available despite being told he would have one.  Exhausted, and lacking sleep they finally got himin a room but made him wait two hours for his bags keeping him from getting in a nap. 

In addition when we arrived on friday July 15th my brother had arranged for a welcome basket for us.  Unfortunately it was delivered to the wrong room.  I think around 8:00 or so that evening it finally showed up.  Oh well. 

My other gripe is that we wanted to go to peepshow.  Should have just gone to planet Hollywood to buy them.  We were told VIP was sold out but we would be right behind the VIP section.  If you call the back of the theater behind VIP then technically we were behind it.  

When we contacted the concierge they wouldn't do anything.  I've never experienced a hotel so disinterested in customer service.  

Today we ordered a large pot of coffee with extra cream.  $20.00 later including a $5.00 delivery charge  (no problem with that along with the included tip) we have coffee with milk.  How hard is it to get coffee right.  

My take on this place as a late 40's male with my late 30's wife is that this hotel is catering to the 20-30 crowd that doesn't mind $20+ cover charges $20 drinks and blaring techno.  I'm now too old for that so clearly I'm not that demo.  I want luxury. I don't mind paying for it.  

Maybe in a year or so this place will be great!  The property is run by deutche bank not MGM or ceasars or a regular casino operator so maybe over time it will be better.  I've stayed at dozens of Vegas hotels, and this place really is a nice property - great fit & finish with the rooms    I possibly had the random bad experience.  It happens but the way they treated my brother who unfortunately was stuck on the east tower makes me leery to stay here again out of fear that I might get a room on that side and never get sleep. 

So to sum it up.  

Great looking hotel
Poor customer service 
Geared towards a younger crowd

My favorite part is that the rooms have a balcony, and if you're lucky, you get a room facing the Bellagio fountains!! The view is beautiful during the day and at night!

The only thing is that I feel like all the rooms are centered around the shower. It's designed for a couple, cause the showers are very open and have windows that look into the bedroom or the balcony. It makes sharing a room with friends a little difficult lol. And the bathroom doors don't lock, just FYI.

WOW. 

Chic. Classy. Stunning. Glitz. Glamour. Upscale. Sexy. Do ya need more adjectives?!

This hotel is by far the nicest new kid on the block. The Bellagio has a special place in my heart as does the Wynn, but I feel like this hotel is more for the younger crowd. 

Be DRESSED TO IMPRESS. Because you will stick out like a sore thumb if you don't! Everyone else (females) are in cute dresses, decked out in jewlery, high stilleto's with hair and makeup did... men are in their collar shirts, slacks, dress shoes, hair did too!... 

EYE CANDY - everywhere! Chandeliers hanging everywhere and it's just amazing to see... so FLASHY! HELL even the BATHROOM is NICE! 

Nice huge floor full of gaming options... shops... various dining options... pool... and Marquee (hella packed!!!)... 

Definitely a choice to stay at on my future Vegas trip... if the Bellagio or Wynn doesn't reel me back in lol...

The crowd is youngER... (30's ish)... and everywhere you walk there are crowds of fine lookin people hanging out... I guess this is the newest hot spot on the strip! Kudos to you Cosmo! :)",1,1,4

I have only been absent from this place for 3 days now but I am so ready to head back. I stayed here for 5 nights and 4 days and enjoyed every minute of it. We arrived here on at Thursday afternoon and were originally dismayed when they said our rooms were not ready and that we would have to wait. This isn't exactly the thing you want to hear after traveling 2000+ miles but the situation was quickly corrected after our check in lady talked to management. Not only did they get us room upgrades but they were able to get me and my friend rooms on the same floor. Score!! Ronnie our check in lady was also gave us the lowdown on the hotel and told us the best places to eat and shop. First and foremost everything in this place is absolutely stunning (of course its new but its much more than just that). No expense was spared in design or materials. Jesus, they even hired a world famous graffiti artist to spray paint the walls in the parking garage. 

The room was tastefully decorated, comfortable, and spacious. They have kitchenettes which include microwave, fridge (stocked with ultra expensive goodies but still enough room to store some private items), coffee maker, and a sink. They also have a dishwasher and not sure what you would need that for even though one of my lascivious friends told me that sometimes people stick their sexy toys in there. The room has a freaky vibe since anyone in the Japanese soaking tub could be seen from the bedroom due to carefully placed window. The also have a window in the bedroom that opens up to view the shower. The lesson here is to not take any of your horny friends to the Cosmo (they also have a pleasure kit in the room which probably costs $50 and includes some intimate items that could make your night a good one). Ok this sex stuff caused me to digress. The bathroom is very large with nice toiletries.  The closet is also huge. The bed was very comfortable but the pillows weren't firm enough. Other high points:

Bars\/Lounges - the place to be right now in Las Vegas. The crowds tend to be younger and the bartenders here are exquisitely skilled. Every drink I ordered was fantastic. They also don't hold back on the alcohol. Visited The Chandelier a few times and Bond. Didn't make it to Marquee since Benny Benassi and Kaskade were there the weekend I was there and I didn't feel like fighting the crowds. The Chandelier is a nice place to people watch as they pass by all ho'ed up to go to Marquee. 

Restaurants - Tons of great places to get food here. We visited Holsteins, The Wicked Spoon, and Pizzeria. The more expensive joints are on the 3rd floor and we didn't make it here even though we had planned too. If you look at all the ratings collectively for the Cosmopolitan restaurants I dare you to find another hotel on the Strip that beats them currently. This place knows how to do good food.

Casino - Small as compared to others on the Strip. Limited selection of machines but everyone playing the tables seemed to be having a good time. Don't go to Cosmopolitan if gambling is your sole reason to stay at a hotel. 

Conference Rooms - I actually attended a conference here and it was one of the best conference centers I have been in. The AV was top notch. We had catered breakfast from the hotel each morning which was fantastic. Beautiful interior. Can't wait until they offer another conference here.

The Cosmopolitan clearly has a ""anti-ugly"" hiring policy. Everyone that works there is gorgeous. Hell even the maid staff seems to look like one of the first few contestants knocked off America's Next Top Model. I had to do a double take because I thought the bartender one night was Alexander Skarsgård. The staff there were also wired with blue tooth headsets. We called down for toilet paper one night and had it there in 3 minutes. Sydney Bristow couldn't have been that fast. These people don't play when it comes to communication or customer service.

FREE WIFI!! Take note other Vegas hotels. It's fast as hell too.

A few gripes. The pool area is very small. Definitely not equipped to handle the amount of rooms they have. Our room was on the 21st floor of the East Tower but we could clearly hear club beats all night. Had we not been so tired at the end of each day this could have put a serious crimp in my sleep schedule. 

I am absolutely in love with this place and will be back. Can't miss if you are planning a trip to Vegas.",2,2,1

Overall smaller classy casino in a prime location on the strip.  This was my first time straying from Mandalay and Mirage (my ""Go To"" spots to lay poolside).  

The suites were really a good deal and a great meet-up ""home base"" place if you have a group of pple hanging out over the weekend.  We stayed in a terrace suite, requesting a room w\/ a pool view.  

My impression of the rooms:
- I love all the interior design touches: interesting coffee table books to browse, artsy book ends and candy dishes, cool desk w\/ slide out...
- all suites, love the terrace view - perfect for hanging and seeing what's going on at the pools.  Want some of the pool club ambiance?  Just open your sliding door.
- great, comfy L-shaped couches
- However, one thing I was really disappointed in for such a new hotel:
POOR housekeeping.   :(   The shower drain still had hair from the previous guest (Ewww!!).

The pool areas overall were smaller than I thought:
- The Boulevard was a good hangout.  Smaller than I expected, but nice view of the strip.  Couple pools in this area.
- The Bamboo was less busy, more low key and the lap swimming pool.  Fake palm trees.  BOOO.   Oh, and where was the bamboo???
- never got around to the club... :( 
- pool restrooms weren't very nice :(
- seemed like the main attraction of the pools were the (2) in pool showers.  This probably would've been more entertaining and relaxing if they were always running, more like a waterfall.  As they are, the times when they were running were few and far between...  kind of boring.

The hotel layout was minorly annoying (true of most casinos)... not very much food\/beverage choices w\/in easy access of the pool areas so you inevitably had to go down an elevator to get something to eat\/drink (pool bar\/restaurant times don't coincide w\/ pool hours).    Maybe a way to lure you back into the casino area...  ;)

The casino was definitely smaller than I expected, thus also lacked some of the energy and excitement that comes along w\/ busy larger casino play.  

Would I go back?  For the room: Definitely.  Great hang out.
For the poolside fun: nope.  It's just not on par.",1,0,0

I must say, a major plus about this hotel is the view of the strip. I believe almost every room has a balcony, which was fantastic. 

Upon our arrival we upgraded our room. Totally worth it as it was out of this world. The bathroom was extremely spacious with his and her sinks + we even had an additional bathroom near the front door by the kitchen. The TV did everything from ordering room service to check out. The telephone also controlled climate, lighting, etc., how cool is that? 

Enough about the room... I couldn't stop taking photos of the awesome contemporary décor and digi boards. Apparently the digital boards are award-winning - they were gorgeous, definitely something you'll have to check out in person if you are ever in Vegas. You see them mostly in the main lobby and inside the elevators. 

As for customer service and the casino definitely 4+ star in my book. VIP guest services took great care of us Saturday night when we ventured to Marquee nightclub. This is a must! Most amazing venue - if only we were there for Kaskade (dj). We were there celebrating a birthday and Marquee made it a night we won't ever forget.

Yes, we all know it's a beautiful hotel, I cannot deny that. I was originally going to give them 1 star for the terrible customer service we were given this past weekend, I am truly disappointed in how they treat their Gold Members here; however I will mention that they have made efforts in trying to fix the problem, hence now the 2 stars. If you're going to treat me just like a normal guest, what is the incentive for me to keep staying here? I waited the whole weekend not to write this review and thought that I would feel better after the weekend, but no, I am still pissed off at their customer service. 

Let me start out by saying a group of 9 girls are here for a Bachelorette party. We booked Qty 2, double queen Terrace Suite rooms. We arrived at 9:30am in the morning, knowing check in is at 3pm, but hoping the rooms would be available in the morning anyway so that we can prep 1 of the rooms for the Bride-to-be's arrival. No rooms were available. They even had the reservations incorrect, as the system said that I had only booked 1-king bed room, and another double queen bed room. [We had booked this many months prior to our arrival] When I showed them my confirmation email, they had acknowledged that they had it wrong in the system and will change it to reflect the correct rooms. They also told me check-out is at 11am so most likely there wasn't going to be any rooms available until at least check-out when they could clean some rooms for us. I had mentioned that we would prefer to have adjoining rooms however understood that it can't be guaranteed, but we at least wanted the rooms to be on the same floor for convenience. Ok...so we left to do other things but continued to keep checking in throughout the day. Nothing was available, not even at 3pm, which is the regular check-in time. NOT EVEN 1 ROOM. Really? You're telling me, that check out was at 11am. And that not even 1 room had checked out, and was cleaned by 3pm?? We had been waiting around at the Vesper bar where the waitress had walked past us probably at least 20 times and noticed we had been there practically the whole day. When she asked the situation, she must've felt bad for us, and told us that when we finally do check into our room, to let her know what the room number it is, so that she can send up some champagne for the inconvenience and for it also being a Bachelorette party.  [Fast Forward: When we finally were able to check into the room, we did give her the room number...and guess what....no champagne ever came - great intention but don't promise something you can't keep!] By 330pm I had had enough, and complained about how we have been waiting around [for what felt like forever] and please just to find us 1 room so we can get checked in and relaxed. They said they were able to get us 1 room (it wasn't going to be adjoining rooms - but by that time, that was fine) So excited to get into our 1 room while we continued to wait for our 2nd room to be available. We get in....and it's a 1-King Size bed room, for 9 girls. Lovely, just lovely. We finally called on the phone and asked to speak with a manager to get us into a double queen room, in which she [I think Emily] kept saying that there was no other rooms available at the moment and that she WASNT EVEN SURE if there will be one available for us TODAY at all. They even tried to tell us that we could use the Sleeper Pull Out Sofa in the meantime.... OK 1 king size bed and 1 sleeper pull-out [which was uncomfortable as hell] FOR 9 GIRLS?! Really? I can't even believe this was suggested. Finally, after being put on hold multiple times and them trying to find the 2nd room for us, they came with this solution: We would stay in that current 1 king size bed room, and they got another double queen room for us (for that night) and the next day, they would look for 2 double queen bed rooms for us but it wasn't guaranteed that it would be on the same floor. I was so pissed, but exhausted from this whole experience, we just had to take what was available. It was upsetting and embarrassing [for the bride to be - her first time really getting to enjoy a vegas trip and it started horribly] They offered a $100 food\/drink credit to be used inside their hotel which was useless to us. 

The next day, they were able to get us the 2 double queen rooms we were looking for, not adjoining rooms but on the same floor - which was fine. They sent us up some chocolates and a hand written note, that was a nice gesture but could never make up for the experience. This also doesn't make up for booking for Qty 2 double queen rooms and having to pay that same price but getting only 1 king bed on the first night [they should have credited the bill proportionate to the 1 king size room for that room for that night to keep a repeat customer] Sad to say, that I can never ever stay here again.",15,12,7

PROS:
+ If the main lobby is busy, they'll open a second registration desk on the 4th floor to check-in. Total check-in time was about 15 minutes from the time I stepped foot in the main lobby to the time I had the keys in hand and headed up to my room.
+ Balconies, balconies, balconies! Great views of the strip, especially if you're facing the Bellagio or Planet Hollywood. We got stuck facing Aria and it still wasn't a bad view.
+ Free wifi
+ No resort fee
+ Standard room (terrace studio) is spacious and well designed
+ Large, spacious shower
+ Staff was very nice
+ Plenty of parking
+ Easy to get in and out of the casino from Harmon Ave
+ Decent room rates w\/ my Marriott hook up ($130 for a Sunday night)
+ Heated pool on 14th floor by the spa
+ Free lounge act at the Book and Stage (def. not your typical old school Vegas lounge)
+ Good places to chill and drink and people watch -- Bond and Chandelier

- Several random hairs in the tub and around the bathroom
- Open bottle of wine in the fridge from previous guest

I stayed in the one bedroom terrance suite (610 sq feet) and it was spacious and clean. OHHH I forgot which tower I stayed in, I think the east tower and there was construction going on outside. Starts at 9am, very loud. Check to make sure you're on the opposite side of that. I checked in 3 hours prior to normal check-in time and they had rooms available. I know it depends on the weekend but it's always worth a try to get in earlier. 

The room had a freezer (no refrigerator?? am I blind? I seriously could not find it.), a microwave, a sturdy office desk with lots of tech plugins, and lots of artsy books as decor. Minor wear throughout the room. 

I would think this room could comfortable fit 2 on the bed and at least 4 people on the floor. 

Bathroom: 

CO Bigelow shampoo, conditioner, body wash, + mouth wash. Glass separating the shower and bedroom area but there are curtains you can pull down. Japanese soaking tub with a beautiful strip of the view. (A Japanese soaking tub is a square tub that's pretty deep, you sit in it rather than lie down). However, there is no glass separating this area so if you're gonna get naked, your friends get to see you naked! 

Bed: 

Clean sheets, mattress is on the softer side, and a plethora of pillows. 

Terrace: 

Has one lounge chair with a stool so you could technically sit two. There's also a table so I guess someone could sit on that too.

Unfortunately like other reward programs the reward program recent adjustments don't get their top 5% loyal customers much of anything now a days.  Profit driven corporations including the Marriott program which includes the Autograph Collection (The Cosmopolitan Of Las Vegas). Platinum members are offered 500 rewards points or a $10.00 credit towards food or beverages purchased during their stay. No longer offered are the complimentary brunches at Wicked Spoon, welcome gifts of adult libations or hors d'oeuvre. Upgrades on the rooms are honored IF available and during this stay the Electronic Daisy Carnival was in town so  these were non existent.  Even the valet check in and just getting around the hotel was a challenge - it was so overwhelmingly busy I opted to avoid dinning in house or hanging out due to the excess crowds and waiting. 

Another con was booking my stay here via the Marriott website which promoted three nights for the price of two & a deposit up front. The nightly fee of the room didn't include the resort fee or nightly tax which was not disclosed on the confirmation. The website doesn't disclose the nightly rate is the discounted rate per night up front and the third night was not deducted at checkout as usual.  In addition, all three resort fees and taxes were added. I thought this was deceiving and feel they impr disclosing this up front. 

As for the room all was good except with the bathroom hardware handle which continued to fall off when accessed to shut or open the sliding door.

The wicked spoon is good in there. the mins are higher than other places and the shopping wasn't that great. I wish they had more normal store. The room with balconies def made up for it in general and there is access to everything else on the strip so not bad. marquee is also there along with 2 more pools.,3,0,2

It is a very expensive hotel, especially on the weekend, but not a big deal it was a special occasion.

But, the level of douchery at this place is unprecedented.  I am not by any means an old man, but this place was like a bad college party with privileged scumbags.

The service is fair, not how a resort of this price point should be.

Our room was nice... It was nice.  It was also $429\/night not including the wonderful ""resort fee""

I liked the shower, and I liked our view of the strip, but that was about it.

Has everything you need to keep you on the property: outstanding food and drink options, large\/clean\/newer hotel rooms with great views of the Bellagio Fountains and strip, multiple swimming pools, etc. The rooms and property as a whole are full of unique pieces of artwork and show attention to detail. At this point, I cant imagine staying somewhere else.

Even the most basic rooms are good size...larger than your typical hotel rooms. We were offered an upgrade (Marriott Gold), but it would have been to a one bedroom suite without a Fountain View, so we declined in favor of watching the fountains from our balcony.

My only complaint was that table minimums here were consistently higher than all other places on the strip. Even when I went down to the casino at 6 am, the single craps table that was open was a $25 minimum and nobody was playing. I was fully ready to play some $15 tables, but nothing was available...craps, blackjack, or otherwise, and the casino was very slow at that point. I ended up doing most of my gambling at other casinos. I'm a $10 - $15 table guy.

We were also there during one of the spring break weeks, and this is definitely the place that the college kids hang out at.

A few tips about being a Marriott Rewards member, because I had no idea: as mentioned above, I asked at check in if we could be upgraded as a Marriott Gold member, and they obliged, but we declined the room type. Also, there is a VIP lounge just to the left of the back entrance that we could have used to check in, rather than standing in the regular line. Unfortunately, we didn't find out about this until we waited about 15 minutes in the lobby to check in. Lastly, you can convert your Identity Rewards points to Marriott points after your stay. I haven't done this yet, but you can do it through the Marriott Rewards website.

We cant wait until our next trip back to the Cosmopolitan!",4,0,0

Awesome customer service from the staff (registration, Identity desk, dealers, etc).  My Casino Host offered to send a car to pick me up from the airport...  

Except for the base City Room, I believe all rooms have balconies.  Not many hotels on the strip have balconies for their rooms--at least, not the affordable rooms...

My players membership comes with 2 free wifi connections.  I get wifi all over cosmo and am not limited to just in my room as in most other casinos...

The Marquee night club is the best night club in Vegas and, in some reviews, best in the USA.  Update:  I tried the Day club during the 2012 Labor Day weekend.  I loved it.  Great layout with the covered areas, dance floor, bed, and DJ.  Also fabulous & friendly staff!

IMO, the Cosmo Wicked Spoon Buffet is the 2nd best buffet in Vegas, following Bellagio's (the M casino offers a wide selection of food but the quality of the food is OK). 

The pizza at Secret Pizza is really good.  I usually have a slice to close out the night.

The people that stay at the Cosmo is from the younger generation so the chicks that walk around the casino are hot!  

The Boulevard and Bamboo pools are cozy to hang around at.

The Chandelier Bar has to be the best pure bar on the strip.

I luckily got to stay here twice on two different occasions and both times were the BEST! Depending on what time and day you're checking in, you can snag yourself a room with the best view you can have staying on the Vegas strip.

Not only is Cosmo visually appealing on the outside, but inside is a whole another story. From the Chandelier bar to Marquee, you can totally tell that Cosmo definitely has some of the best decor. 

I always have a great time whenever I'm at Cosmo. They have great restaurants from burgers from Holsteins to steak from STK, or even dim sum from China Poblano or even pizza from Secret Pizza! They have a wide variety of eateries to choose from. If you can't decide on what to eat, just go to Wicked Spoon buffet and you can have a little bit of everything! 

The casino is not as big as others I've seen on the strip but is a decent size to play in. It's always packed with people and fun to play in.

The best thing about Cosmo is definitely the ROOMS! Each room has a balcony and every view is a good view. You can either have the strip view, Aria view, Vdara view, or the best Bellagio (fountains) view. Luckily, I've been situated with fountain viewsand strip views!

I've never gotten dressed up and really done a ""night on the town"" here, but it's still really fun for a quick trip inside.

As many have mentioned, the casino itself is beautiful. Even a ride up and down the escalator is made more exciting with the chandeliers and excellent people watching. My personal favorite? The girls wearing short, sequined club attire who are yanking their hemlines down every few seconds and teeter-tottering around in clunky uncomfortable-looking platform pumps. Thanks, Forever21. 

I've eaten at two of the restaurants within the property, Milo's and D.O.C.G., both were excellent and not too terribly pricey, considering you're on prime Vegas property. Have experienced one of the bars, Vesper (I think?) and have even wandered up to the pool on the roof for a summertime concert. What I have not experienced yet (and probably won't anytime soon) is Marquee nightclub. As a 30-year-old who hasn't worn high heels in at least 6 months, I have to draw the line somewhere. Plus, me and Kim Kardashian don't have much in common; therefore, we shouldn't be hanging at the same places.

First of all I would like to say that when I booked the room I knew it was going to be expensive, but I was not expecting rude and incompetent staff.

I stayed on 5\/15\/11 and booked the room 2-3 weeks in advance. I get to the check-in desk and this cocky punk was checking me in and told me to sign in on the i-pad they had there. I told him I wanted a paper slip as proof. He got the paper slip but there was no reason for him to be an ass about it. I get the paper slip and put the whatever required deposit and then I was told to wait another 2 hours. As anyone in ths scenario would get a little angry and I proceeded to tell him that why would you take my info, CC, and deposit and not give me a room key. Again with the rude\/ cocky attitude he said we have to wait until a room openes up. Needless to say I go back 2 hours later and the man at the desk tells me that you will still have to wait. At least the second time I inquired to my room status I was greeted with a very helpful and polite english man [at least he looked english to me] that explained I would have to wait longer.

It as almost 6pm when I was able to check-in.

When I go to the room (WE 4605) I step into the elevator and I push the button and nothing happens. The other people in the elevator tell me to put my room key in the slot and select my number. You think the woman check-in clerk I finally got the room keys from would tell me that; but NO, they neglected to mention it.


I'm tired, and a little angry at this point but I sucked it up until I got into the room. You think wating that long to be 'ready' and clean would actually make it clean, but guess again. There was actually a woman who came to the door and brought me some new lip-balm and soaps, and towles. While the soaps and towles were actually missing; I would never use the lip balm; but I looked and the seal was broken indicating who knows where someone used it on their body.


Now you have every right to believe what you wish but every hotel I have stayed in so far [perhaps not recently with all the new rooms etc...] has always had a Gideon bible in the room. Not this one. They had other books, but no bible.  

Yes the bell man was very polite when he brought my bags; but when he offered to show me the remote controls, the televisions both did not work. He said he would send someone to take care of it but nothing happened. They even had a screw on the remote that would not even let you check the batteries. I could not even check into menu with my room bill, and changing the channels required manual adjustment that even did bearly work. A new hotel and the TV dont work ???


Perhaps the death nail for anyone would be the used birth control prevention device that was laying on the floor. Needless to say I spoke to the clerk again and demanded that my room be refunded. When he refused to do it I spoke to the magager on duty about the item I found; he said obviouisly someone did not clean the room very good. I was angry at this point (like anyone would be), and told him 'you think?' Having me wait to clean the room and I find a birth control device on the floor. To add insult to injury he would only refund half the price of the room. I Would not recommend the cosmo to anyone.


Rude and incompetent staff, ultra late check-in, water spots on the glasses, missing towles, missing soap, used lip-balm, non-fuctional televisions, and used birth control prevention devices on the ground; No THANKS!

Having said that, hands down my favorite hotel is the Cosmo. Why? Let me explain.  Yeah sure, it's beautiful. Really truly a gorgeous hotel. But that's not enough to warrant 5 stars.  What makes the Cosmo special is they seem to have worked with their staff to go out of their way each and every time.  Here's what I experienced the last 2 times I stayed:

1.  The front desk person upgraded me for just $100 to a MASSIVE suite with 2 bathrooms and a giant wrap around porch.  The room was free to start with, so for $50 a night to experience that, it was like living like a king.  

2. When you play craps for example, I walk up to the table and the dealer actually shook my hand! Usually the dealers don't even look at you at other casino's and certainly are not allowed to touch you.  The dealers even said ""if there is anything we can do for you, anything at all, let us know"". 

3. The craps dealer noticed my friend was totally new at the game, and went out of his way to give him a lesson during the game. Really patient, friendly and a nice man. This would be Nick, if you are at the table say hi and he will make you feel like they really appreciate you being there. He's the guy that looks like Bruce Willis (bald). 

So, if I were to assess what's going on here, they're growing loyallty by having a ""can do"" attitude. They had the massive suites available, so why not make a cheapo regular happy?   Why not be super nice at the craps table?  

As a contrast, Caesar's the hotel of the unwashed masses, gives us free rooms but nickel and dimes us to death, and everything is a ""nope, can't do it"".  We booked a room there months in advance in the Augustus tower, and found out we were pushed out of the tower because they had to accomodate certain people flying from far far away. I wouldn't stay there again if it was free. 

Another tip  for Cosmo... on the second floor is the  ""secret pizza place"" which is simply secret because it's down a dark hallway and not marked.  The white pizza with ricotta is to DIE FOR!",1,0,0

And with good reason: the Cosmopolitan is a beautiful, modern hotel, second only to Wynn\/Encore as the nicest on the Strip.

The biggest feather is Cosmo's hat is Marquee Las Vegas, the most impressive nightclub I've seen and one that will give XS a run for its money. With 3 levels ranging from a house mega-floor to a attic library, the venue has only small echoes of the boutique feel of its sister property at 11th Ave & W. 27th St. If the 2nd and 3rd tier clubs around City Center are smart, they'll set their sights on the spillover crowd from Marquee. Besides building a beautiful indoor\/outdoor day\/night haven, the Tao team have done a nice job of dovetailing with the casual living room-esque whimsy that Cosmo as a whole -- with pool tables scattered around, for instance -- is aiming for.

If you come, ask for a room overlooking the Bellagio fountains. 

Cosmo will be getting the wrinkles out over the next few weeks:
- Customer service lines that ring off the hook and reps who have no clue what they're doing
- Bathtub knobs that fall off
- TV remotes that don't work
- Dealers who have trouble cutting decks
- Showers that won't get hot
- A loyalty website that's broken
- Bartenders who push alcohol of people they know don't drink (unconscionable)
- Dealers who push gaming on people they know don't gamble (unconscionable)
- Front desk printers that don't, well, print

Mostly everything is painted a slick black, with accents and dimly lit lights. It is *the* hotel and casino to visit at night, especially because of its stellar (mostly affordable) dining and drinking options. It is also the place you will come across the most interesting-looking people, from a fashion standpoint. It is my favorite hotel and casino on the strip.
The Cosmo houses many great bars and lounges, such as Bond, Vesper, the Chandelier, and Beauty & Essex. 
Bond can be found on the first floor at the front entrance facing the Bellagio, and is completely open, with its only wall consisting completely of Windows. Onlookers can view the strip from here. There is a glass case with the bar name on it, and you might see someone hired to dance in there occasionally. 
Vesper, meaning evening, evening prayer, or evening star, embodies all possible definitions. Also found on the first floor, but near the registration desk and video embedded pillars, Vesper bar is another open lounge with comfortable seats. 
The Chandelier is probably the most interesting bar and lounge in the Cosmo. The entrance can be found on the second floor, but the lounge is two floors tall. You can walk down a short flight of steps which take you to the second floor, which rests halfway between the first and second floors of the Cosmo. This lounge is difficult to miss, as it is entirely incased in crystals in the shape of a giant chandelier. If you don't go for drinks, at least go to marvel in the design you will only find here. 
Beauty & Essex was in my bookmarks to visit, but I didn't get around to it. It can be found on the third floor, and looks unassuming from the entrance. I can only imagine it to be an illusion, because from outside the Cosmo you can see the protrusion of the lounge, with walls made of only windows. I am sure the view is great, and am looking forward to trying it when I return.
The Cosmo also houses diverse dining options, such as Secret Pizza, China Poblano, Jaleo, é by Jose Andres, Holsteins Shakes and Buns, Eggslut, Wicked Spoon, and Rose, Rabbit, Lie.

The various restaurants although expensive were very good.  The buffet is disgusting and a joke, would never go back.  The Pablano restaurant is super yum but the portions are small.  The burger place is also very good with yummy milkshakes.

Mid way through our stay we upgraded to a view of the Bellagio fountains and that way fun!  We got to watch the show and watch people.  Only bummer was that room was slightly dirtier and the patio was pretty gross (needed to be clean- used q-tips were out there, etc) and the phone didn't work by the bed.  We told the front desk about it and they seem unconcerned.

All in all we would most definitely stay here again.",2,0,1

Pros:
- We stayed in a Fountain View Room, and it was worth it.  The view of Bellagio fountain show and the strip was probably the best view we've had at a Vegas hotel.
- Great location.  It's central, and it's not too hard to walk around the strip if you'd like.
- Great restaurants.  We had E by Jose Andres, Eggslut, Holsteins, and the fact that Momofuku is opening in 2016?  Awesome!  When it's 110 degrees outside, it's super nice to not have to set your foot outside.
- Their rewards program called Identity, which saved us some money when we were checking out. 
- Hotel is part of Marriott collection if you participate in Marriott rewards.

Cons:
- Our room had some issues with cleanliness and drainage (shower).  To be honest, I should've called the front desk, but we ended up just leaving a note for the maid.  It should've never happened at such a nice hotel in the first place.
- Decor is definitely interesting.  Kinda weird mix of modern and coziness.  If you're going for modern, go all out.  If you're not, the different patterns on the floor and walls don't look that nice.
- Check in\/check out took a loooong time.  Not sure how they can fix this, but there were multiple lines and it took forever.
- Asked for late check out (which I've always been able to get as a Marriott Rewards participant) and got denied.  Nowadays 11am is the check out, I didn't know that.

Because of the cleanliness issue, I was going to give low rating, but during check out when I addressed this, the lady that was helping me (her name was Sherry) was super helpful and apologetic.  She helped us get the most out of our Identity program, addressed the issues we had, and overall gave me a much better impression of the hotel than what I was leaving with.  I wanted to give her a shout out since she made our experience so much better at the end.  Thank you Sherry!

tip:  I prefer the East tower since it's close to Eggslut, Holsteins, Secret Pizza, Jaleo, STK.  West tower has closer lobby and Wicked Spoon.
tip:  There are 3 pools altogether.  One is Marquee day club, one is in West tower and one is in East tower.  

Keep in mind resort fee of about $30\/day.  Wifi is included in the resort fee.  Free parking for either valet or self park.",11,3,5

Visited this hotel\/casino numerous times during my visit to Vegas. Their retail\/restaurant mix is quite eclectic. They have tons of glamorous hotel bars with good decor. The ones here put many of the ones nearby to shame. This hotel has a nice nightlife vibe to it. I think the fact that they name a couple of the bars using James Bond movie references speaks for itself.

Even the public art in the hotels is quite interesting. They have a number of public art displays including these large dogs and huge high heels sculptures that I came across in one of the common areas.

I stayed at NY NY during my visit here, which was nice. But left feeling like staying at the Cosmopolitan would have been even better due to the location and the vibe here. I would definitely consider the Cosmopolitan on my list of places to stay next time I am in Vegas.",4,2,3

The Rooms: are stunning and HUGE and sexy. It is true that the East Tower is loud at night, so request West Tower or bring earplugs if you are there on a Friday, Saturday, or Monday night. 

The Staff: with the exception of the Boulevard pool staff, all the other staff were extremely friendly and approachable, especially the waiters and waitresses at the various restaurants. We chatted with a bouncer at Marquee for about 30 minutes. 

The Spa: my husband had the balance and harmony massage and love it. I had the vitality and vigor transformation and I think it was customized because we were in a couples room and some of the transformation elements could have been disturbing, so it was not as 'transformative' as I might have liked but it was a good massage. Definitely go with the couples suite, it has a steam shower, true rain shower, and soaking tub and you get 30 minutes of alone time after your services. 

The Restaurants: were superb. The grilled fish and charred octopus at Milos was amazing. Jaleo was so much fun and I loved the homemade 'olives'. China Poblano seems like a crazy idea but it was fantastic. The Beijing Glass noodles, the Viva China taco, and the Mango Sticky Rice (with sticky rice foam and mango granite) were my favorites. Golden Spoon is the best buffet in Vegas, no question. Hofsteins was perfect.

We normally stay at Harrah's properties for free but decided to switch it up when I got a comp offer for Cosmo which included a free room, $300 in food and $400 in free play.  Was not a huge fan of this place, even though the property itself is nice.  

We had a resv for a terrace suite with 2 queen beds.  The lady who checked us in told me she was ""upgrading"" me to a terrace suite with a king bed.  Well, when I told her I should already have a terrace suite but with two queens (and I showed her the resv on paper from their resv dept) she told me that was impossible because the room didn't exist with queen beds.  I was very confused how that could happen and asked lots of questions!  A king bed with a pullout bed was not going to work for us ladies (I had just been to the chiropractor for a bad back\/neck - wasn't sleeping on a pullout bed!!).  She kept insisting that there is not a terrace suite with 2 queen beds and then finally admitted that ""ok,...there ARE terrace suites with queen beds, but there are none available right now"".  Ok, well that's a different story!  So we ended up in a ""regular"" room, no terrace with a city view.  That was fine, although we were looking forward to the terrace suite and the experience.  Our room overlooked the Bellagio water show and was ok.   

Ordered room service on our first AM in the room and the service was spectacular.  My friend had a hangover and mentioned it to the woman who set up our room service and she said she would take care of it with the bell desk.  Soon after, the bell desk called us and double checked we wanted some aspirin from the gift shop and indeed it was delivered like magic soon thereafter.  Very nice!

This place is THE place for the clubbers and those in the 20 something age category,   So if this fits your likes, you are going to LOVE Cosmo.  I am not a clubber and beyond that age by 20 years now.  :-)  So on the weekend we saw lots of girls that looked like they had made their way over to this place in their hoochie mama dresses and stripper heels on fake id's.  That was interesting to walk through as we made our way to\/from the casino and to\/from our room.  Somewhat entertaining....

We didn't get to experience much of this place, outside of the gift shop, lobby bar and some slot machines.  Not enough time during St. Patty's Day weekend.  It's definitely a beautiful place but I felt out of my ""vibe"" there.  I'll probably go back to staying elsewhere, upon my Vegas return.",5,3,1

The hotel is located in city center and smack dab in the middle of the three-and-a-half-mile-long stretch of hotel-casinos known as the Strip. The big spectacles grab your attention first. The three-story chandelier with a multilevel bar and the rotating video panels on the lobby columns are immediate focal points. Pay attention to the smaller details as well: the restored cigarette machines that dispense packs of art instead of smokes; the banquettes in the lobby of tufted velvet with a working phone; the wall of album covers leading to the ""hidden"" pizza place, I never found. It's like staying in a museum with gaming tables. I was really impressed by the video pillars which I think make a great first impression, they change from library books to people trapped inside and one could easily fixate on these features for quite some time. 


Up on the 32nd floor, I discovered an incredible view as I opened our Terrace View Studio Suite door. I think I would have to say this was the best of any room I've ever stayed in Las Vegas. The best thing about the room, besides the view of the Bellagio Fountains was the electrical outlets. These days I often travel with multiple gadgets so the more outlets the better! The Cosmopolitan gets it right with multiple outlets on each side of the bed, plus more on the walls and in the bathroom. I took a dozen photos out on the terrace and even invited some friends to watch the Fountain show with us. The technology in the room is also top notch; the television is intended to provide voicemail messages, a trip itinerary and access to room service, plus you can shut the lights off, change the room temp and check the weather report all from your bedside phone. The bed will have you struggling to get up in the morning, it was so comfortable. It's the details in the room that will win you over.",4,0,0

We got a decent flight schedule that did not cost all too much and it made way for getting a room at the cosmopolitan. Initially, I did not care if we stayed at a hotel that was fairly decent, near the strip and had good options for dining. However, since my friend was all in he decides to get a suite with a chance for a great upgrade. 

Once you get  to the hotel, you immediately notice how different it is from all the other Vegas hotels. A bright white  sign flashes once you drive in and upbeat music plays in the driveway where all the cabs and cars drive through.

The check in area is very nice and simple. There is three pillars that have animation while you wait for your turn to check in or make a reservation. The hosts are nice people and make you feel at home.

We happened to get an upgrade for a good price. The room was a suite upgrade that included a mini bar(that we did not touch), a  kitchen with a microwave, two walk in closets, one queen sized bed. Two lazy boy chairs, one master bathroom with a bathtub and a regular bathroom. The room had a view of the Bellagio water show and the strip which was beautiful during the night. It also had two big screen LCD TV sets as well.

The highlight of the hotel is the dining options. We were rewarded a resort card that was good enough to use at any of the restaurants. Another highlight is the casino. Although very smokey and obviously loud, it's a very nice casino that accentuates the hotel.

- Rooms are spacious and beautiful. I love the modern decor and the overall ambience is very chic and sophisticated. 
- Great shopping and dining options both within the Hotel itself, as well as just a short walk over the pedestrian bridge (to the Mile shops, Bellagio, and rest of the Strip). 
- Overall location on the Strip is fantastic.
- Fantastic views if you have a room with a balcony.

Cons: 
- Checking in on a Thursday night at midnight took over half an hour, which is significantly longer than any other check-ins I've done even at peak hours. 
- A few of the lights in our room didn't work, and the jacuzzi jets would turn on at random times for no apparent reason. 
- We would request Housekeeping to come at a certain time but on two occasions, they never showed up...

-Wifi supposed to be free, didn't work well without upgrading

Check -in is a little different but it worked. At check-in, after they ask your name - they ask if you want to upgrade for an additional fee. Huh...why do we have to pay for an upgrade? Why wouldn't you just put a customer in a good room. Happy customers come back AND tell their friends! 

The upgraded room (I was charged $40 dollars) on top of my $189.00 per night charge was spacious, beautiful and had a balcony which had a view of Paris and Ceasars Palace.

I checked in around 4:00 p.m., and my room was ready at the time.  I assume my Marriott Platinum status got me my upgrade to a Terrace Suite.

PROS:
- (If you're able to get the right room) The view of the Bellagio fountains.
- Location on The Strip, not far from everything.
- Well thought-out lighting system in the room.   Love the ability to change the climate control and\/or switch all of the lights on or off from inside the bed through the phone unit or the TV remote.
- Wicked Spoon, the buffet, was pretty darn good (and for $32, it should be).  For whatever reason, the wi-fi in Wicked Spoon (using my iPhone) was the fastest I have ever seen hotel wi-fi do.
- Secret Pizza Place has great pizza.   There are no signs in the hotel that firect you to this place, you have to ask for directions.   Definitely worth it, feels like an old Jersey-style pizza place, down to the old video games and the cheap sign displaying the menu.
- The parking system, where you can easily see which spot is available or not from a distance.
- Fast elevators.

CONS:
- E-mailed the concierge folks at the address given when my reservation was confirmed, no reply to two messages sent (questions about show tickets).
- Thought the pools were awfully small for such size of hotel.  Boulevard pool was filled with college-age kids trying to pick each other up (has a bar there).   Bamboo Pool was more about everyday people (with no bar).
- In-room wi-fi was okay during the day, in the evenings, the speed sometimes was at a crawl.
- Even after being out for four hours, they didn't freshen up my room (which makes sense, given other posters talking about rooms not being ready).
- All the signs to the Boulevard Pool said 4th Floor, but when you got there an outsourced security guard said that we have to go one floor down and go up the escalator to enter.   Uh, okay.

OTHER:
- I didn't play there, but the Casino was more ""there"" than it was a big thing. 
- The clubs Chandelier and Marquee are hot.   I didn't go into either, but the amount of people said they're hot.
- This hotel is more geared towards college-age kids trying to impress each other.
- As mentioned before, I was in a Terrace Suite, so I don't know if if every room has this.....my room had a refrigerator that was full of the usual, overpriced mini-bar stuff.   The refrigerator part had the weight sensors below the goodies, so you really couldn't move anything around.   Freezer was there for whatever you want.

They label this place as a resort.  not so sure about that.....had its fair share of amenities, but I have been in other places with just as much, if not more, and was not labeled a ""resort.""

Beautiful 4 billion dollar hotel, contemporary, high end finishes, feels smaller than it is...

The woman at check-in was my second staff impression after a very courteous doorman held the door and welcomed me to the Cosmo.

This front desk staffer was robotic & soulless, the human equivalent of an ATM. I tried my best to engage her, after all I was in Las Vegas to enjoy myself and excited to experience all the Cosmo had to offer. 

She could care less, no welcome, no explanation of the hotel or it's vast amenities, she looked down continuously, minimized eye contact, and rushed me through the check-in process. What was the rush? Her colleagues were standing around because the front desk was so slow, no one was waiting. In the end she mumbled something about a premium view and our room not being ready. 

Clearly the wrong person for the job. She would be better suited in a behind the scenes position with zero guest interaction.  

After check-in, things improved... We ate breakfast at The Henry, food was a 7, service was an 8, cocktails we're a 10. Then off to the LV Convention Center to attend an event.

When we returned early evening, the front desk staff was very accommodating. Our Terrace Studio Suite was excellent. The view of the Bellagio Fountains and Las Vegas Strip rocked. Comfy bed with European bedding, sleek furnishings, 2 LED, HDTVs, luxurious bath, shower & soaking tub, efficiency with microwave, dishwasher & Sub-Zero, outstanding private terrace with lounger.

My only interaction with the housekeeper assigned was poor. Her overall demeanor was unresponsive, like she had the life sucked out of her. Later I had a housekeeping issue so I called guest services, it was resolved by another staff member within 20 minutes. 

Dined at Holsteins, Kobe beef burger was amazing, mac & cheese appetizer was poor, booze-infused shakes were delicious. Overall food and service was a respectable 8.

Tried the pizzeria late night after seeing Holly Madison's Peep Show at Planet Hollywood. The staff was upbeat and accommodating, the pizza, mediocre. Food a 6, service gets a 9.

The Cosmopolitan is located right in the heart of the strip, you can walk to anywhere you'd want to go. The Miracle Mile Shops are right across the street, and the Bellagio is right next door with Caesar's Palace on the other side of it.  We stayed in a Terrace Studio Room with a Fountain view on the 28th floor. The view from our balcony was honestly one of my favorite parts of the trip. It had an amazing view of the strip! 

The actual room felt spacious to me. Nice big shower AND there's also a pretty big jacuzzi tub! I made it a point to walk down the strip to Lush to get a few bath bombs to enjoy in it during our stay! So nice! There's a living room area that has a big couch, sofa chair, desk, and its own television. The bedroom area has it's own tv and the most comfortable king size bed! Even the pillows felt like a dream! 

If you stay here, or if you're close by, you should check out Eggslut on the 2nd floor! I'm not even a huge fan of breakfast foods, but we ate here twice while in Vegas! There will probably be a line, but it moves fast and is worth it! It was so convenient having a place to get an awesome breakfast right inside our hotel!

One of these does not belong and I'm sure you can guess which. My recent stay at the Cosmopolitan was as mixed of a bag of emotions as my obese aunts stay at the local fat farm. 

The Good: The room was incredible. There were large bathrooms and a very comfortable King bed. We also had a balcony with a stunning view of the Bellagio fountains. The casino was also fun. Chandelier bar is a must visit and Holsteins had phenomenal burgers although their drinks are a bit stingy.

The Bad: The hallways are not 5 star worthy. I know you guys have a lot of floors to cover but you really could invest in a few lamps or chairs here and there. The ceilings in the rooms and hallways were a bit low and kind of were an extension of the outdated American Airlines terminal at Laguardia. Think DMV designed by Home Goods.

There's lots of restaurants and bars to discover (I especially liked The Vesper bar and Secret Pizza) and of course more slot machines and gaming tables than you could ever possibly need, but what I loved the most about this hotel was the Art.

One of our friends, who was over 21, did not plan to drink, and so did not bring her ID to the bar. But the female server asked for an ID - which is of course fine. That's the law. She's required to do that.

The problem was her attitude. That bitchy attitude of playing down the customers to feel better about herself. She basically KICKED OUT the whole group because of ONE person, who did not even order drinks.

The funny thing is that she did not even ask for IDs to other people. Which is why I think my argument that her attitude is so disconcerting is totally valid.

If she had asked us to leave in a more polite way, it would have been fine. She did not even come to take orders for more than 15 minutes.

Besides, the signs in the whole hotel don't even indicate where the restrooms are. This is something really basic and I wonder how this hotel got early raves.

This is a pretty new hotel and I would first get the staff educated before spending all the revenue on countless chandeliers. The fact that they don't even have a number for customer service on their website just shows how careless they are about their staff education and the feedback of their customers.

This hotel is NICE!!! It's by far my favorite hotel that I've ever stayed in! It's one of the newer hotels, and is just overall really nice. I've been coming to Vegas practically every year or every other year since the 90's, and this is just my favorite. The staff is overall friendly and gave extraordinary service. Not a single member of the staff showed signs of unhappiness or grumpiness. Everyone was happy and extremely helpful. Our check-in person even bumped our room closer to the top of the hotel just because. We had an awesome view of the strip, and even watched the Bellagio fountain show from our room. Also, idk if it's always like this, but registered guest get complimentary admission to Marquee. So, that was really cool.

Only down side is that the doors to the rooms (or at least the room I stayed in and the ice room for the floor) has HEAVY doors that swing and slam the last few inches towards the doorframe. I was readjusting the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door, and right before it closed it slammed on my finger.

The hotel is beautiful, sexy and modern with great contemporary art throughout the property. Even though it was busy because of the weekend we never had a problem waiting or dealing with crowds. We stayed in a terrace one-bedroom in early October, which is a perfect time to visit Las Vegas - not too hot but plenty of sunshine. This was especially important because I was hellbent on enjoying the pool. The last time we visited LV was early November and the Cosmo pools were closed.

I booked the trip through an airline vacation website and called a few days before arrival to confirm the reservation. The woman I spoke with made note that we'd be checking in early (10 am, coming straight from the airport) instead of the normal 3 pm check in time. This worked out well - when my group arrived at the hotel our rooms were ready for us and the guy at the check in desk was very nice and accommodating.

We skipped the Boulevard Pool, which is more of a club atmosphere (and crowded) and headed straight for the Bamboo Pool on the 14th floor of the West Tower. This pool has more a relaxed vibe. The layout is great and when we arrived around 11 am were able to snag a group of recliners. Make sure you get there early, since the Cosmo pools are smaller than other resorts and the recliners go quickly. We basically camped out there for the day and ordered plenty of food and drinks (warning: not cheap). Side note: the shadows of the other hotels surrounding the pool pass over the pool area in the afternoon, but if you wait 20 minutes you'll be back in the sunshine in no time.

Our room on the 55th floor was fantastic. You can't beat a terrace overlooking the Bellagio fountains, and the bathroom was huge with a Japanese soaking tub looking out over the Strip. If you can spring for a terrace room with a view, go for it.  Not many hotels offer that experience.

He also refused to transfer me to someone working the area or security claiming there were no direct lines. I called back directly to security and was given an attitude by him also.

We were greeted at the valet a couple hours before actual check-in time, and they took our luggage to the bell desk.  We were greeted at the door by one of the staff and escorted to the lobby.  When we learned that check-in was going to be an hour or two still, we were giving a personal tour of the casino by another staffmember.  Very personable.  
    One thing that stands out is how friendly EVERY person was.  Not only friendly, but each person would look you in the eye as they spoke to you.  
     Our room was going to take longer than expected to be ready ( they were having touble with the computer system, which is why I did'nt  give a 5 star rating), so we were hungry and the only place serving food was The Henry cafe.

     We got to the room, and it was very nice.  Since it was going to be condos originally, the room had microwave, sink, fridge, even a dishwasher.  The rooms at the Palazzo and Wynn are a little larger, but these are very comfortable, with a seperate living room area, bedroom and bathroom.  And as for the bathroom, twin sinks, decent counter space, and HUGE shower\/tub.  While in either the tub( which was a deep square design) or the shower, you have a great view outside.
      Each room also has a terrace which was great to sit outside and look at the traffic down below.  Very relaxing.
      We went to the opening night tasting on the 2nd & 3rd floor, which was cool.  Then went and played.  We each won a couple hundred on video poker then lost it at blackjack.

     All in all, very nice evening.

Look The Cosmo is a beautiful, hip, fun hotel and I feel like in a year they could be a really great place to stay. The rooms are beautiful and big (we were ""staying"" in a one bedroom suite). The shops (ALL SAINTS!!!!), restaurants, and art is great\/cool. They play fantastic music everywhere you are at. 

However, they really need to pull their shit together. We got there at 3 and stood in a line for 35-45 minutes to check in. (A little excessive for a sunday if you ask me, but whatever we are stoked for the cool hotel we are staying in.) Then we get up to the front desk, and a lovely girl let us know our room isn't ready. No big deal, we got a identity card, loaded our stuff back into the car, and headed for the pool. After checking out a few pools we decided on the quieter pool and proceeded to soak in the lovely weather. 

After an hour we started staring at the phone. Do we have service? *CHECKS PHONE* It's been a little long. (I've never waited longer than 30 mins for a room in vegas) Ok, let's order a drink. *CHECKS PHONE* YAY. A tasty drink later I started to get nervous. Ok, lets go to the hot tub.... *CHECKS PHONE*

.... Well, TWO AND HALF HOURS LATER our room was ready. Which they were awfully lucky cause if after changing out of my suit after being sufficiently pruned we were going to leave and find another hotel. OVER FOUR HOURS TO WAIT FOR A ROOM IS A BIT EXCESSIVE, COSMO. 

So we get up to the concierge desk and the man behind that desk had obviously been dealing with pissed off, insane people all day. (well at least i hope so.) Cause he was a total jerk to us. Look I wasn't happy with the wait, but I also wasn't a raging lunatic about it either. We calmly expressed our unhappiness and there was NO APOLOGY, NO COMPS, NOTHING. We asked for a possible extended check out time so we could enjoy the room a little longer and there was nothing he could do about that. The worst part was this guys attitude, I kind of feel like since we weren't total jerks he could have changed his tune a little. But he didn't. Just tightened up his jerk tie a little more. 

So back down to the car and up to the room. YAY our room. Clean, fun, big, and very hip. 

Maybe we had our hopes up too high from friends who stayed here a few weeks back. They really raved about the place. But I think they got a much different experience than we did. 

In short: I don't think I'll be returning to The Cosmopolitan anytime soon. I feel like they need to grow up a bit and get their shit together. And hopefully by that time the dick at the concierge desk can get some manners. CUSTOMER SERVICE is a good thing. Any other hotel in vegas would have done something about the ridiculous wait.

Can't complain about my last few times I stayed, beds were comfortable, even though i was hungover whatever they were pumping to ventilate the casino and lobby made me feel a lot less nauseous.  They also offer a good selection of restaurant on level 2 across marquee (burger place. asian\/mexican place (think its called poblano) and there always the wicked spoon buffet that is delicious has a great dessert selection in case you need to bribe your girlfriend to it with you.

God their burgers soups omelettes, buffalo wing. i f.. with them all and the delivery is usually pretty cool and all the maids def seem happy and enjoying their job.

for nightlife you have marquee for day and night clubbing. Hit up my boy Brian T. Marquee on fb or on here, dude will take care of you better than a guy friend taking care of a newly single girl he always had a thing for while trying to break out of the friend zone. (he need not ask me to help him add there but hey with everything he's done for me the least I can do)

some other things that comes to my mind is getting around the hotel is quite easy finding the bj roulette table are pretty straightfoward and there is a sports book upstairs to the right of marquee. if you go there and look at the carpet you can see closely the number of tears I dropped when I lost 8k on the mil\/flo over 8.

Def will be back as everytime I'm on the west end towers terrace looking up you literally feel the calm before the storm, add to mention the taxi line moves quick and never seem too crazy (post-club lines as you know can be long as F). Thanks for the past few trips that were awesome and def lived up to par. see you guys soon.",0,0,0

The wrap around suite was very spacious, with a functional kitchen, dining area, living area, bedroom, and two bathrooms. Two large TVs were in the unit. The balcony was expansive, with a corner view, the L-shaped space offered seating and views of the happenings on the strip. The only issue I had with the room was that the pillows were very soft and flat, which made sleeping a little uncomfortable.

The Cosmopolitan has ample dining options, from sushi to pizza, to steak, to Italian, and small plates. I enjoyed pizza from Secret Pizza and a filet at STK. LA's Grand Central Market breakfast hot spot - Eggslut - is also there. Soon Momofuku and Milk Bar will open on the 3rd floor as well. The gym was well-equipped and clean. The meeting space was comfortable and the hotel catering was good.

As are many on the strip, this is a beautiful hotel and the location is excellent.",17,9,13

The single star is purely for the reason that it is a very pretty hotel. We arrived right at check-in time which is 3:00. The man helping us at the front desk informs us that our room is not ready yet but he will call us when it is, with no indication of when that would be. An hour later we grew concerned since we did have a 5:00 dinner reservation at Comme Ca. Once were able to get ahold of someone that actually had some knowledge about our situation, they said our room was still not ready and they had no idea when it would be, but they could put us in a downgraded room right away. The room we had previously requested and paid for was a suite with a king size bed, pull-out sofa, and Japanese soaking tub. The room we ended up in had two double beds and was significantly smaller. My sister who has works in customer service, went downstairs to see if the hotel was willing to do anything for us since we did not get the room we originally paid for and the one hour wait time for our room. The front desk said they were only able give us back the $10 price difference between the rooms. We were welcome to wait for the manager but there were already 5 parties ahead of us waiting to speak with him. I wonder why? Luckily we were able to push back our reservation so that we had more time to get ready for our dinner.

The next thing that happened was very weird... We had requested an 8:00am wake-up call in order to request a late check-out, because that was they way we were told it had to be done. At 8:00am we received our wake-up call and asked for the late check out, which we were granted. 30mins later hotel staff and security were pounding on our hotel door, then proceeded to open our door and say that since we never answered our wake-up call they needed to make sure we were all right. What?!?!? 

Upon our late check-out at 1:00, my friend was asked how our stay was. She explained everything that had happened and the man on the other end was very sympathetic and told her that he would give us a $100 gift card to use at any of the restaurants in the hotel. The gift card would be waiting for her at the concierge. When she went down to the concierge they had no idea what she was talking about and they had to call the man that offered her the gift card. My friend was then asked for her i.d. and credit card. Assuming that they just needed a confirmation that she was staying in the hotel she gave it to them. After already using the ""free"" gift card for lunch, she discovered that they had actually charged her for it. After some very frustrating phone calls to customer service, where the man who had offered her the gift card in the first place was no where to be found, my friend will be getting her money refunded to her. Hopefully. 

Granted that this hotel has only been open two months, some mistakes are to be expected but this was a little out of control.",11,2,1

Room prices were jacked up ($1.8K for three nights!!) and almost completely booked, but we managed to snag one with a great view of the strip and Bellagio fountain show (34-49).  

The Cosmo is a very nice hotel; modern, chic, and definitely geared towards the 20s and 30s crowd.  This is a party hotel, so those looking for a more serene (hah!) experience should stay at the Palazzo or Wynn (also favorites of mine).    

Loved the convenience of partying at Marquee Dayclub and Nightclub without having to leave the hotel.  Highlight of my stay here was seeing Armin Van Buuren spin at Marquee Dayclub on Saturday, May 4th; he was awesome!  I've been to Marquee Nightclub many times and enjoy the ambiance; however, still scratching my head over the seemingly endless stairs women have to trek down in order to exit the place!  

Ordered room service for the girls Saturday night and was quoted 1.5 hours, but food arrived within half an hour...pleasant surprise.  The spinach dip with crab and buffalo chicken wings arrived hot, and were pretty tasty - the chips were warm and crispy.  Didn't try the garden salad, but it looked fresh.  

Only restaurant we had a chance to eat at here was China Poblano, and only because it was next to the Marquee Nightclub and we needed to kill time.  We ordered several dishes to share, including the twenty-vegetable fried rice, siu mai, Open Sesame noodles, and the ""Don't be Jealous"" hot and sour soup.  Well, I ain't jealous of the hot and sour soup; a lot left to be desired.  The Open Sesame noodles were chilled and tasted bland.  The siu mai I didn't try, but my friends claimed it was good.  The highlight of the meal was the fried rice, yes, fried rice!  What made it special was the baby veggies included in the rice, but the rice was pretty flavorful too.  The portions were small, but I'd say the $20 spent on the fried rice was worth it.  It was a bit distracting trying to eat with Marquee's club music blasting our ears, but hey, part of the ""ambiance"".  

Love, love, love the Chandelier bar, especially the second floor, which serves my favorite drink - the Verbena!  It's a tequila based drink, but the special touch is the edible flower bud you eat before you sip your drink.  It's like pop-rocks in your mouth, and your mouth becomes numb for a few minutes, but it totally enhances the flavor of the drink!  I highly recommend this drink!

Staff we encountered during our stay were professional and accommodating - no complaints.  This trip was my first time staying at Cosmo, but I'd definitely stay here again.",2,0,1

""Just the right amount of wrong""

My gf and I tend to go to Vegas often because it's a quick and easy trip and the hotels are top notch for competitive prices. We booked our stay 2 months in advance and it came with $100 dining credit. We got the terrace suite with a balcony facing the bellagio fountains with the japanese washing tubs and it was an awesome experience. As for our room, it was huge! We could have easily fitted 15 people in our room because we had 3 sections, the bed room, the dressing room area and the living room area. Additionally, when one of our fridges broke down, they came right away with another mini fridge so we ended up having two fridges during our stay. :). 

The service here is top notch from top to bottom. The concierges here are super helpful and they respond instantly. My gf loved all of our concierges because they were all feisty and fabulous. Oh dear. XD. The valet system here is crazy because you just scan your code into a system and you sit in a lounge area while they pull up your car. Definitely beats Vdara and Aria's valet system. Moreover, I don't usually care about the bath room products too much but Cosmo soaps are amazing. I love peppermint soap! When we called for extra soap they were like ""how many do you want!""

The amenities here are endless, from dining, clubbing and shopping.

For you night animals, if you stay here on any days from Monday to Friday, you get comp access to Marquee which is a deal because they have awesome djs all the time like Kaskade and Dash Berlin. Pretty sweet because I would hate to pay the $50 to get in. 

As for dining, we used our credit to eat at secret pizza, Holsteins and Wicked Spoon and all of them provided top notch quality food for us. You can read my reviews of each spot separately.

Also, during the summer time. They have movies playing at the pool which is really cool. Sitting on a water foam bed while watching classics like jurassic park and ET!

Additionally, the gym's view was amazing. I usually don't care about the gyms but the treadmill's view is the freaking bellagio fountains! They give free earphones and apples here as well.

As for shopping, they have plenty of options and if you want more high end shopping, you can walk over to the city center. That's the thing I love about the cosmo is it's location, it's in the middle of the strip and you get the best possible view of the strip here.

Overall, our experience here was top notch. My gf fell in love with the cosmo and she adores the bellagio fountain and strip views from this location.

We had 2 televisions. There's a microwave in the bedroom. It is spacious. Room temperature was great! The pool area closes at 8pm. On Mondays they have movie night. You can see the strip from the pool area. There are bars to order food & drinks. The staff was friendly. Expect long lines upon arriving. It was summer time when most families are traveling. The hotel is beautiful. This hotel is right in the middle of the strip. I would advise if your flying like we did. You can pay a shuttle from airport or use Lyft. They are cheaper and better. The casinos are all available there for your use. We were given only one free breakfast for 2 on first stay. Everyday thereafter we payed for our breakfast somewhere else.

The following morning after I had yelped about my dirty room, I received 2 calls one from Zahra, guest services and Brian, resort manager.  They both apologized and expressed concerns that my room was not up to the standards I expected and immediate worked together to rectify my situation.  They pleasantly offered to upgrade me but I was already unpacked for my convention week and really didn't want to got through the hassle of repacking my clothes, work docs, computer and essentials to move to another floor and room.  I just wanted my room to be clean and vacuumed when I returned - that's all.   They reassured me that they would address my concerns with the head of housekeeping and make sure that my room was to the standards that I was expecting for a 4-5 star hotel.

I have to tell you, when I walked into my room that evening - you could SMELL how clean the room was and yes, my room got vacuumed, the shower stall got scrubbed out thoroughly, there were no more dust bunnies anywhere and no spot stains on the bathroom counter\/mirror.  On top of that, Brian and Zahra sent up a fruit bowl, gift basket and enough toiletries for me and my roommate to share.  (We weren't able to use it all and are donating them to a local Women's Shelter)  Evening housekeeping was thoughtful to empty out my trashcan, straighten up the room while I was away for dinner and put out my robe\/house slippers which I used every night.  

There were other extra touches that Brian provided which I truly appreciated and made my stay even more enjoyable.  The Cosmo definitely turned around my opinion of their housekeeping standards and I will return again for a personal stay with my husband for our anniversary month in January - he's looking forward to it as I told him it was the nicest hotel I've stayed in, in Las Vegas!  

I also want to say that The Wicket Spoon Buffet was so good I went back for a total of 3 times, twice for dinner and the last morning before I checked out, I went to their breakfast buffet thanks to my youngest son who recommended me to go there.  Well worth it!

Thank you Brian and Zahra for giving me the best customer service and experience, making my stay comfortable and pleasurable, taking great care to provide me the 5 Star experience I heard so much about!

The parking entrance to property is kind of awkward and cramped. 
BUT the parking garage is cool, they have electronics counters which tells you at every turns of how many available parking spaces, even the handicap space availability is listed. You can look to the ceiling and see if there is a green light above a space on any isles, it is available. :)) 

The interior is modern, European look and feel. Although it seems a little cramp and busy looking, we were very impress with, the sparkling chandelier that mimic curtains, as well as partitions, and also as an actual decorating chandelier encompassing the escalators that leads to different area of the casino, bars and restaurants area. 

Went to the buffet, way over staff and not enough people eating. But that is usually how it is in the beginning for most of these hotels. But also, being that it is a slow time for Vegas also. That was not a problem for us. 
THE FOOD- nothing was labeled yet, so we had to ask the chef for everything that we could not recognized. They have really good specialty salads, made with goat cheese or fresh mozzarella's. um mm. 
Also have a selections of sushi rolls, couple of noodles style. Various fish and or seafood dishes. But mainly it seems to be lots of chicken and lamb cooked in different ways. They also have middle eastern selections also with hummus and gyros also. And then the typical buffet stuff, cows, clams, and shrimps. And dessert off course. 

As we were leaving we were attracted to the sound of the music that was being played, we checked it out. It was right around the escalator area that was an open lounge. Booths full of people and 2 female dj, dress in winter white, spinning the tunes. Mostly dance\/ techno music. Made me wanted to grab a booth and hanged out longer.

But...THAT'S NOT THE CASE AT ALL! Never once was I made to feel I didn't belong.... everyone I encountered during my stay from concierge, to room service and spa staff were friendly and helpful. 

My boyfriend (at the time) and I booked a Terrace Suite facing the Bellagio fountains using a 20% promotional discount for booking a 3+ night stay.  The room was gorgeous and spacious. It featured two TV's (one in the living area, another in the bedroom area), a Japanese soaking tub, his+her sinks, large shower and a private balcony.  Another thing I loved about the room was the hello and goodbye feature that turned on and off all the lights in the room with one touch. I also enjoyed buying over priced coffee in the mornings and sitting outside on the balcony soaking up the strip.

There isn't much privacy separating the bedroom and bathroom area, so I probably wouldn't book this room if I were staying during a girls trip.  Accccctually, I probably would.  Who needs privacy in Vegas? Something to consider, though. 

My infatuation with this hotel might be slightly biased.  My boyfriend (at the time) actually became my fiance on this trip.  He proposed outside on the private balcony during a fountain show.  He had arranged ahead of time to have champagne delivered via room service at a specific time, and they were right on time.  It was perfect.",4,2,6

My scheduled flight came into Vegas in the morning so we were just wanting to check in our bags and pray for an early check in.  What is is awesome about this hotel is that you can check in at anytime!  You'll get a inactive key and when your room is ready they can call or text you your room number and like magic your key works!  No room was available at the time, but they said they would try to get us one as soon as they can!  Both the front desk staff and the bell staff were so nice!

To kill time we headed over to Wicked Spoon to get our breakfast feast on!  Look for my review on that eatery later, but some quick notes: Staff is good, but we had a coupon and I'm not sure I'd pay full price.  After out pig out session we were happy to hear my phone get a text to let us know our room was ready.  We told the bell staff we would take our bags up, but they offered to deliver it to us.  We were tired, so we accepted.  When we got to our rooms we were blown away!  We had ordered the King Bed standard room.  We had a small lounge area, desk, 2 TVs, a large tub and separate shower, microwave, bar sink and more.  I was a fan of this hotel instantly.  I've had comp rooms in other hotels, but I don't think I'll want to stay anywhere else! The bed was plush and inviting.  

After a well deserved nap, we headed down to gamble a bit, this isn't the largest casino on the strip, but it has most things that you would want.  Their table prices are pretty standard for being on the strip.  I like to play the slots, and there are tons of those.  If you like a big sports book, this isn't were you'd want to go.

We didn't get to use the fitness center nor the pools but took a quick look at them, and the fitness center is small.  The pools are pretty nice, nothing too big, this does not include the Day Club, as I didn't want to pay or had the time to go.  

If you're hungry for some pizza late at night, there is Secret Pizza!  That place is so randomly fun.

Overall, I loved my experience here.  Staff was friendly, and I loved my room.

Their attention to detail, the clean lines and the contemporary feel are very conducive to a pleasant asthetic.  Either that or the oxygen level is just realllly high here :). It's definitely a younger crowd and some people may sway one way or the other on that fact, but I think that was also a pro for me.

The staff is very courteous and attentive, and they worked to fix a minor issue we had during check in.  The pool areas are great, Marquee is trendy, hip and fun just like you would expect from the newest and largest day & night club, and the restaurant choices are a nice addition to the strip.

While the hotel is large, and navigation could sometimes be difficult, we all got where we were supposed to be when we were supposed to be there.

I handled booking for our team and had positive interactions with staff pre-conference. They were helpful, friendly, and efficient in helping me book about 20 rooms and make sure all the credit card charges were in order. 

We did have two incidents. One staff member found her room hadn't been cleaned when she checked in, but the hotel promptly cleaned it and were very apologetic. Another staff member had an unpleasant encounter with a rude attendant at Marquee; the hotel apparently runs the nightclub through a third-party service provider, so they couldn't help much with that.

I personally had a great experience -- the room was huge, the balcony had a fun view of the Bellagio pool, and service was prompt and friendly. Also, when I injured myself off-property, the front-desk staffer I spoke to (hi Bryce!) went out of his way to help me out, finding me a clinic and getting me into a cab to get there. The next day he called to check up on me, too. 

We ate in the hotel several times -- at Wicked Spoon, China Poblano, and Holstein. Wicked Spoon's buffet was awesome and Holstein had great burgers; China Poblano had good food but super-creepy decor. The buffets at the conference, catered by the hotel, were tasty too.

Time taken to check us in was nice and not rushed.

*Views - so great you feel bad for all the people staying at the hotels you can see so far off. Private terrace to enjoy the Belagio fountains all day and all night.
*Pools - plentiful, creative layouts & maximized space. Not all pools offer pool-side wait service, not all pools offer ""all sun"" seats and ALL pools fill up before 10am, so get there early!
*Restaurants - okay, but not really competitive to the others in the area

Biggest bummer about this place is the cost. We were blessed to stay for free (there on business), but requested to extend our stay and were told it would be $675 for ONE NIGHT. Not worth it at all! You can get the same square footage, amenities, view and strip location for a lot less at surrounding hotels).

It was great while it lasted.",3,0,0

Our only interaction with staff was our check in and the gentleman was nice and professional. 
We enjoyed gambling here and the restaurants were pretty good so we didn't have to go far. 
I will admit I was a bit worried in the hallway because the lobby is so grand, but every time we arrived at our floor and stepped out of the elevator, it looked more like a hotel 6 until we opened the door to our room. It was strange that everything else was lovely except for the hallways. Parking was ok once we figured out if we needed the East or West elevators and it's pretty centrally located for walking the strip. We would definitely return.",8,3,8

Not every corner of the hotel looks the same, but it's not inharmoniously  done. 

The two levels above the casino floor where actually a continuation of the hotel, not just big lobbies made for conventions and weddings.

We gravitated toward the Chandelier bar to have a drink and then made plans that our next Vegas trip we will be staying at the Cosmo.  Since then we have stayed here four times and each time the experience has been wonderful. 
This trip during Labor Day weekend, we stayed in the wraparound terrace suite on the 50th floor in the West tower which was luxury all the way. The suite had great views of the city facing the strip. The only negative was that we were on the Marquee club side so we heard loud thumping music all day every time we stepped out on the balcony.

As always, the staff provided exceptional service. If there are any issues, they are quick to find resolution.

Normally I always go on Vegas trips with large groups of friends and stay at Elara (formerly PH towers) but this time around, it was just my boyfriend and I out there attending a coworkers wedding and wanted to experience a different hotel. We booked the hotel through a Southwest package and got a decent deal for a City Room.

The hotel itself is gorgeous, love the decor! Check in wasn't until 3pm but they were able to accommodate us and allow us to do early check-in. There were several people in front of us but the front desk personnel worked fairly quickly to get us taken care of. We didn't know that the ""City Room"" only comes with 2 Queen beds as a standard. The front desk clerk then made some calls and checked the system and was able to get us a Terrence One-Bedroom Suite as a complementary upgrade. I seriously was not expecting that but it totally made our experience at the hotel THAT much better. (Might I add, it was Nascar weekend and they had a convention going on at their hotel as well.)

The Terrance One-Bedroom suite was HUGE for just two people. Tons of mirrors for us girls to get ready in front of. It had a nice Japanese soaking tub, which we really didnt use but i guess it was nice to have. The wallpaper in the toilet room however made me feel a little claustrophobic. We stayed in the East tower which our balcony looked out towards Aria and over Marquee Nightclub. I thought it was going to be loud but surprisingly it wasnt too bad at all. We were on the 38th floor so I'm not sure how the noise level is for other people on the lower floors.

The only weird thing i found which was mentioned in some of the other reviews was that there's a peeping tom window? Well more like a peeping tom wall that has blinds that can only be controlled on the other side of the shower which is in the bedroom. I don't know about other people but I'm pretty creeped out the possibility of anyone being able to watch me shower. 

I would say that this isn't quite the hotel that is good for large groups or sharing with a bunch of friends just cause of how the bathroom\/shower layout is but it would definitely be a hotel to experience for a couple. 

I seriously don't think the location can get in better than at the Cosmo. You're literally upstairs from one of the most popular nightclubs in Vegas at the moment. I can vouch for a lot of girls, the shorter the walking distance in those outrageous heels, the better. There's a Walgreens that's a 4 minute walk from your room (i timed it), 5 minutes away from a 24 hour McDonalds for late night munchies and right next door to the Bellagio water fountains.",2,1,0

The Cosmo is right NEXT to the Bellagio which also means... it's definitely right at the center of the strip.  They've got almost every type of meal you'd want to eat on the second and third levels of the Cosmopolitan... and well, they've also got every type of person playing every type of game you'd want on the first level!  

On top of that... on almost every level, there's an awesome seating area to chill out and relax.  You dont even need to be staying at the hotel to chill out in the hotel.  It has an awesome club\/lounge vibe that is... unbelievable.

The parking garage is ridiculous -- super luxurious and well... the driveway was dressed up to not even look like cement!  Picking your car up from the Vallet was also super cool because no one was there to greet you, all you needed to do was scan your ticket and wait in one of the comfortable seats that they have in the perfectly decorated waiting room. 

There's a SCARPETTA in the Cosmo -- That's Scott Conant's restaurant.  My favorite restaurant here in NYC. 

BAH.  Make sure you stay here!  I was willing to extend my stay just to come back here for the weekend to enjoy the facilities!

From the Casino floor to the Boulevard Pool. Marquee Day Club and Night Club. The center of Las Vegas Blvd. has shifted. Set right next to the Bellagio, my friends and I were here when the place opened on New Years 2011. Later that year we stayed at the hotel for my friend Chris' bachelor's party. We got him the wraparound room and this room is amazing. and the word amazing doesn't do this room justice. We were able to watch the Bellagio fountain show from about 34 stories up looking over the lit up Las Vegas Strip. If you want to do Vegas right make sure you go to Marquee Night club but if you want to do Vegas BIG. Stay at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. The wraparound is huge and very spacious with a full kitchen and washing machine. Not many hotels on the strip provide an amenity like this. The interior is very modernized and hipster like. 

One of the more enjoyable amenity to this place is the pool area. If you can, get a cabana when the pool is open during the spring-summer time. If you don't there are plenty of places for you to lounge at. Plenty of lounge chairs all around to bath in the sun. There's also a table tennis and pool table poolside. Full bar close by. They also have a huge jacuzzi by far the largest one I've ever seen. You could literally swim in it its that big. 

Also, if you stay at the Cosmo, one room card can get you and another person into Marquee on Thursday, Friday and Monday.

If you are looking for a quiet hotel though, do not stay here. Both towers are loud in terms of being able to hear the music from Marquee. Better off staying at City Center if you want something more quiet. Also, if you cannot read signage don't stay here. lol Their towers and elevators are not logical, so if you get in one elevator, and are trying to go to the 18th floor, you might not be able to. ;) We learned that the hard way a few drinks in. 

 However, being a new hotel, they should do some more maintenance on it (in terms of the rooms), ie. the remotes to the tv slow response time, not being able to turn the room down below 65, some sink handles loose, closet door handles loose..

Oh , if you like to workout on vacation (I know that's tough lol), be ready to pay the hotel $15 to use it, even though you're already staying there... weird. Only upside to that is they do offer classes and have a boxing ring (you can only shadow box.)

Casino: not large at all. Better off going next door to gamble ;) 

Marquee: girls, there is a separate line for girls only guest list on the 4.5 floor (lol no idea), so don't be overwhelmed by the line in front of Marquee on the 2nd floor. I suggest trying to meet the right promoter. :)

Pros: everything is luxury, from food (make reservations for the popular restaurants) to the decor throughout the hotel. So many great details (pics to come). I've gone to China Poblano (Mexican and Chinese), The Henry (good casual lunch place), Va Bene Caffe and Estiatorio Milos (Greek). Reviews to come. Everything is pricey though, so not for the budget conscious. 

Cons: Staff is still learning, and often times have to ""check"" on many questions that they should know. I did lose an item in the room and they already checked in another guest and claimed they didn't find the item. It was plugged in the wall, but what can you do.  I was pretty much told have to wait til those guests leave or check with lost and found. I suggested they leave a message w\/the guest, but never heard back. Also they lost my credit card on the reservation, which was annoying, but they took care of it for me at 2 am after a  night out, so no biggie. 

Rewards program: don't know what benefits I will reap yet, but your hotel card is used for everything. Gambling, eating etc. etc.

1. Parking:  As an out-of-towner with a rental car, I found it very easy (and free) to self park. That's not true of all the casinos.

2. Walking:  At the MGM Grand and a few other casinos, the properties are so huge that it feels as though there's a twenty-minute walk from the front desk to your room.  That's NOT true at The Cosmo, which has a more convenient floor plan.  The elevator to my room was just steps from the front desk.  

3.  Check-in:  Onlly a short wait.  The person who helped us was friendly and funny.

4.  Lunch\/Dinner:  I'm a fan of STK, and we enjoyed China Pablano so much we went back twice in the same trip.  I also liked Holsteins.  Didn't make it to Wicked Spoon or Rose, Rabbit, Lie, which seems to be a restaurant in decline according to Yelp.

5.  Socializing:  We didn't make it to the Marquee, but we had fun at Bond, inside the Chandelier, and a few of the other bars.  There are beautiful people everywhere. 

6.  Pools:  I was there in early Novemer, when it was still just warm enough to go the pool.  I had a nice experience, but because it was November I wasn't confronted by crowds or a line -- I can't imagine how crowded it gets in the summer

7:  The Scene:  Compared to some of the other higher-end casinos on the strip, The Cosmopolitan had a vibe that was more fun, more hip, and the whole place had an energy that made me not want to leave.  By comparison, the Wynn, another pricey place to stay, has an older, stodgier crowd, and just can't compete with The Cosmopolitan.  

8.  The Location:  Perfect.  Our room overlooked the Bellagio fountains.  And it's close to a CVS, several other casinos and the shopping at Caesar's Palace.

The drawback:  it isn't cheap!  But if it's in your budget, IT'S WAY MORE FUN THAN THE WYNN\/ENCORE OR THE VENETIAN\/PALAZZO.  I wrote that in all caps, so you know it must be true.",2,0,1

Ok so what did you expect from the hottest and newest hotel\/casino on the strip. At night time 85% of people in the casino will be dressed to impress. 85% of people in the casino at night time on a weekend will be from 21-35 years old. This is kind of a young and hip type of spot. I've always been more of a bar guy compared to doing the whole nightclub scene but this place has both of those scenes done very well. The bars have smooth old school type bands playing. If you go outside Marquee nightclub at night, there will almost always be a line and tons of hot girls standing around. Just really love the vibe here. Only reason I give this place 4 stars is that though I love the rooms, I'm not really into gambling there for too long. My last trip to cosmo in December I gambled there for about 2 hours. That's the most I can really do there haha. Like I said...the place is snobby and really I can only put up with so much of it before I head to a more casual spot. That's not Cosmo's fault though...more mine.

It's convenient to Marquee and restaurants such as STK. The lobby and casino are very modern and avant garde. I was expecting this decor to extend to the hotel rooms but I was mistaken.

First the hallway to our hotel room smelled of ongoing construction. The ice room also had a horrible stench. The hotel room itself was spacious but the decor seemed totally random, as if everything was an after thought. The rooms were decorated with 70's inspired patterns (think Jonathan Adler \/ Palm Springs). It looks nice now but could become obsolete within a matter of years. 

The bathroom was big, but the lighting was poor. The shower also is exposed to the bedroom, which was really awkward. There's a shade that covers the length of the shower window but can only be drawn or pulled down by the outside (i.e. not by the person showering). Awkward. 

The main reason why my friends and I wanted to stay at Cosmo was that we wanted to be conveniently close to Marquee. As hotel guests, we expected to get comped entrances into the club but apparently it doesn't matter if you're a hotel guest. We got into the club for free because we were on the guest list, but we had no additional advantage by staying at the hotel. 

Overall, I'm glad to have added this hotel to my checklist of hotels I've stayed at in Vegas, but I'm not compelled to stay here again. Pick it up, Cosmo.",2,0,0

The room was huge. Nicest room I've stayed in around vegas. Nice balcony overlooking the day club and pools, as well as a good view of the strip.

Went there on a friday night to hit up the bars\/clubs at this hotel, and it was a dead scene. I thought it could be a dead week to be in Vegas, but it really wasn't. I went to check out the roulette table, and found that the tables were ridiculously priced, and a lot of people not playing. I think they have set the standard a bit too high, and from what I saw the demand wasn't there. The crowds were plenty at the MGM and at Wynn and Encore. The hotel is gorgeous, but it seems that Marque might be the only thing that is really attracting any crowd to that hotel.",0,0,0

I recently stayed at this hotel for a bachelorette party in the 2 bedroom city suite. The pictures of this hotel do not do it justice!! The room was absolutely ineradicable and on the 45th floor!! So large and had the floor to ceiling windows with views of the Bellagio fountains. The walk in showers were fantastic and the beds were very comfortable. The TVs even have XM radio! The room surprisingly came with a pull out couch which was perfect, all of our guests were able to get a bed. The mini fridge comes fully stocked so there really was no room for our own drinks unless you take everything out. 

The Boulevard pool was a great, but hard to find with the two towers. We ended up getting buckets of beer (5 per bucket) for about $37 which I felt was very reasonable. They also have small cubbies along the edge of the pool to put belongings in since all of the chairs were always full. The pool its self was deeper then I expected but they have ledges all the way around to sit on.

All of their employees were so helpful which made checking in and out so easy. This hotel is by far my favorite in Vegas. May be pricey, but well worth it. I cant wait to return!!",0,0,0

So planned to stay at this hotel with a large group using a promo code.  I planned to stay one night and called to book about 2 weeks before the stay.  They informed me, I was 2 days late and my promo-code had expired.  My room was supposed to cost $160 for the night.  The receptionist said sorry, the room will now be $350.  I called our ""party manager Carrie Gonlag"" who was the hotel employee in charge of booking groups.  She was completely inflexible and also offered me nothing.  I then spoke with a ""resort  manager"" who said she couldn't do anything, but with her ""special deals"" she could offer me a room for $400.  Somehow even with her ""special deals"" the price went up in the 2 hour window? I then checked online and a room appeared for $325.  

So moral of my review.  1) Don't stay at Cosmopolitan with a large group.  As most people know, anything with a large group requires flexibility and this hotel certainly does not offer that.  Stay anywhere else, but not here.  And if you speak with Carrie Gonlag, just hang up the phone.  You will not be helped in anyway.  

I plan to leave this review on a few more travel websites as well as I feel very strongly about this.  Customer service is what drives business especially in the competitive Las Vegas market.  Would helping one person who got caught up in the holidays spending time with family and missed a reservation date really have hurt Hotel Cosmopolitan?  Probably not.

I chose to stay at this hotel as the prices was decent especially since I came during the week.  I loved this hotel, the decor was beautiful and the atmosphere was truly nice.  I loved my room, the CITY room.  The bathroom was small but still nice and loved the shampoo and soaps especially since it was CG BIGELOW.. The showers do have a see through window out to the bedroom but you can pull the covers if you're with friends, but with your partner by all means leave it open  the restaurants are super nice and the hotel is in the middle of the strip so I got to go to miracle mile for shopping and looked around at the crystal shops.  Definitely convienent if you want to go to belllagio which is right next door for their yummy gelato and my favorite restaurant the Olives.  The pool on the 4 th floor is awesome.  I loved it there are buildings surrounding it by the time it's 430 shades start coming in.  But it's super hot at 9 am and great to go at that time or earlier to secure a spot.  Pool has chaise lounges in it you lay in it with the water and have drinks it's nice and relaxing.  Great service.  No complaints at all staff really super nice I totally go again..

Terrible traffic on the 15, you think that leaving at 1pm one would avoid traffic. We came here to attend EDC (Electrical Daisy Carnival). Us guys shared the room it was $420 per night so it didn't come cheap. 

Marquee pool party was the best everybody was chilled and fun. The only casual fast food available were Pizza, Chinese, and Mexican place. If you wanted wonton noodle soup you won't get it here. I think the Chinese place only offer four items, a few dim sum items.Clearly Cosmo doesn't want to highlight ""food court"" area. We did run into a few celeb which was cool since I'm a bit a of a sports fan. We saw Cam Newton. Russell Westbrook walked into my elevator and I recited his average game stats. He was impressed. On the way back from EDC we ran into Gus Hanson and we waved hello to him. We met many cool people and laugh the entire time.

The only place open 24 hours was ""The Henry"" we went both nights. I ordered braised short ribs with Hollandaise sauce. It came with a demiglace sauce... borlandaise sauce? It was overly reduced and too salty.  

Hotel was loud so this is not for a quite couple, but if you're sassy and roll with deep pocket you'll have tons of fun.

No, I've never stayed in the hotel much less even seen one of their rooms.
What I have come to love about this property is the ambiance and the amount of varied food options.  There are actually several quality restaurants located in this one casino, with new ones being added most recently.

-You want buffet action?  WICKED SPOON has that AllYouCanFeast option covered.
-Italian food?  Both DOCG (get the Braised Short Ribs) and SCARPETTA (get the Spaghetti) will fit the bill.
-Greek food?  ESTIATORIO MILOS has the Mediterranean fare you seek.  I highly recommend the Milos Special which is a signature dish here with fried zucchini, eggplant tzatziki, and kefalograviera cheese:  opa!
-A not-so-secret food stand?  SECRET PIZZA is the spot for a slice or two.
-Burgers and boozy shakes?  HOLSTEIN'S has the beef.
-An excellent chocolate chip cookie?  EGGSLUT actually has one of my favorites of all time with its Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie.  Really.  Get it warmed up.  They also have eggsellent egg sandwiches.
-Fried items served in a hiking shoe?  JALEO serves tasty Croquetas de Pollo just this way as well as other Spanish food from Chef José Andrés.  Check out their $25 ""Lunch Like a Spaniard"" option where diners can order 3 different tapas dishes.
-Chinese and Mexican food can be found in one spot at another José Andrés restaurant, CHINA POBLANO.  The Salt Air Margaritas here are light and refreshing.
-Dessert?  Just-opened MILK BAR offers their delicious cereal milk soft serve among other items.  I've had the Fruity Cereal Milk ice cream and love the cornflake crunch at the bottom. 
-Asian food is a brand-new option at MOMOFUKU, but I haven't eaten there yet.

With all of these choices, there's something for everyone here.  I almost forget that it's actually not one giant upscale food court instead of a hotel and casino.  And, for now, parking is still free.  Kudos to the Cosmo for its carnival of culinary spots and for keeping me and my stomach happy :)",15,8,14

Now, almost 3 yrs later and more than a dozen visits to this joint, I can say that it's my #1 place to visit when I go back to Vegas.  Besides all of the points I've already made in my prior review, here's why:

+ We've dined at several restaurants (Secret Pizza, Holsteins, Comme Ca, STK, Jaleo, Wicked Spoon, The Henry) and all of them are awesome.

+ The Chandelier Bar is our place to meet up friends and colleagues to get our night started.  The 3 level bar is great for meeting groups of people, having drinks, and people watching.  The 1st level is especially good for people watching.

+ Speaking of people watching....park yourself at Bond, like we do and you can watch the shenanigans on the Strip from your comfortable chair\/sofa while having drinks and listening to great music.

+ FREE WiFi throughout the property...yes, FREE with no strings attached.

+ Marquee Nightclub is one of my favorite in town.  Their VIP Cabanas are an awesome place to hang out.


+ The rooms are amazing.  Get one overlooking the Bellagio Fountains, it's one of the most spectacular views in Vegas.

+ The artwork around the property is awesome, there's tons of fun things you will spot if you look carefully enough.

Overall, this place is simply amazing.  If you've never been, you have to put it on your 'to do' list if you're coming to Vegas.

They said that they could clean the current room so we could stay in there. We said fine. We sat there waiting for a half hour (starved and needing to go the bathroom) for cleaning services to show up. One guy finally showed up with ONLY a plastic bag.

Checking in took forever, waited in a long line and it was kind of chaotic... Just to find out the room wasn't ready at 4... Had to wait in the lobby bar for another hour just to get the text that it was ready, go up to our floor and then find out the keys wouldn't work. Had to go back down and wait in a long line again... Very frustrating. Despite all that the front desk people were friendly and apologetic. The hotel is decorated amazing and all the sparkles and chandeliers are lovely. Finally get into our room and it's nice. Nice balcony despite some trash left out there from the former guests. Good view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip. Decent bed and sexy window to the shower. However, it just never got below 74 degrees in the room. We kept trying to turn it lower and nothing. It's pretty warm out side this time of year and a nice cold room is what I like to come back to. Made a request to have it looked at and never heard back about it. First night we come back to our room and all we could hear is the whirring and clunking of the elevators going up and down! It was insane. It took me forever to fall asleep. Thought about asking to change rooms but was told the day before they were all booked up. Figured we'd get used to it. Tried the Chelsea pool one afternoon. Very busy, not enough shade and the pool was murky and gross. There was hair and stuff all over in it. Didn't go back. Also, the elevators down from our room took 10 minutes of waiting a few times...

We checked in on a Wednesday afternoon, very quick and efficient. I had reserved a Terrace Suite and was offered a Wraparound Suite for $50.00 per night more, sure why not. We checked into the room and it was 1200 sf beautiful. We were in the west tower, 25 th floor overlooking both the Bellagio fountains and the Marquee pool. 

A Important note here .... There are very few rooms in the Cosmopolitan that you will not hear the music from the Marquee Day\/ Night Club..... 50% of the rooms a lot noise, 25 % of the rooms quite a bit, 25 % of the rooms some. Please keep this in mind when booking here. If you want a dead quite sleep with no noise from people enjoying the Vegas nightlife, then stay at the Trump or Mandarin Oriental, no clubs there. 
If your in town to enjoy the late night activities, this is the place to stay. 
Now back to the review. 

To us it was obvious they have been working on customer service. Everyone was friendly, a few mornings we slept in very late and a phone call to the "" Beck and Call"" desk had the room cleaned in a couple of hours with a follow up call asking if all was done as requested. 
The dealers were friendly and helpful using our names once we gave them our Cosmo Identity players cards. 
We enjoyed several restaurants and the Boulevard Pool, reviews to follow, and service was good at all. We did not have any key card issues, in fact they added lighted instructions to the elevator panels showing where to insert your card for floor access. 

a few minor issues 
Housekeeping... did not replace the dirty towels they took on two occasions, a call took care of that in about 20 minutes each time. and the trash can under the sink did not get emptied unless we set it on the kitchen floor. 
Gambling. They raise the minimum bet at some of the tables to $50 or $100 in the evenings. These stay empty while the $15 and $25 tables are busy. 

Check in and Check out. Not a problem for us during the week, but walking by the front desk on Fri, Sat and Sunday ..long lines....especially bag storage on Sunday morning. 

We were reminded again why we like the vibe of this place when we visited the Wynn\/Encore resort. The Wynn is very large and seemed smokier. We like the smaller more sexy feel of the Cosmopolitan.
All in All a great stay and we will stay here again. 

Final Note : Based on my last stay and what I was told by several Cosmopolitan people, the safest way to get a quieter room is to book a Terrace Suite. All of these are in the West Tower and do not face the Marquee Pool\/Club.",2,1,1

I stayed at Paris during my last trip and in spite of telling numerous people via phone and email I needed a handicapped room because my mom has walking issues and I was in a sling, and after being assured they would make a note for a room close to the elevators (which I know can't be guaranteed and that's ok), when I checked in I was told ALL handicap rooms are at the end of the hallways. What? 

So during our stay we decided to go to the Cosmopolitan during the day, we hadn't been there before, and the minute we walked inside we both fell in love with the place. First and something we will always stay there from now on for....ALMOST NO SMOKE SMELL!! It was such a relief to be able to breathe in a casino. Then from the lady who signed us up for the Identity card, to the staff at Wicked Spoon, even the helpfulness of a lady who was cleaning the bathroom, was superior. I've never been treated so nice in a casino. 

So I wanted to take my Mom to Vegas in the coming months to thank her for helping me with surgery, etc so I contacted Resort Services and I couldn't believe how helpful they were, Maria T. was amazing. Due to my mom's walking issues I had many questions on room types, where they are located, etc and she didn't just answer what was asked, she elaborated on each answer so that I got a full understanding. She let me know of some other services we'd enjoy and absolutely went above and beyond. That meant so much because my mom put her life on hold this last year to help me recover from a bad shoulder injury and with the help of Maria and The Cosmopolitan they have made my mom, and me, extremely happy. Can't wait for our trip! 

Plus, due to the outstanding customer service we received, we both decided that all future trips to Vegas (about 2-3 times a year from now on) will be at The Cosmopolitan. They have great comps, far better than we ever rec'd at the Caesars or MGM properties, and what you do pay for is more than worth every single penny.",0,0,0

The reasons behind the 4 stars instead of the full 5: I feel like the bar areas are much more accommodating to older people. It makes sense, that's where most of the money is, I guess. But I'm a paying customer, too!
Asking my friends to give up seats for an impatient mid-life crisis crowd was just tacky.
Also during check-in I felt like the concierge was questioning whether I was breaking the law a little much. I was there for my 21st birthday\/New Year's and I put the room on my card, my friend signed since I technically wasn't 21 for a few more hours. Maybe it was his Arizona residence and my California residence that confused her. By her tone and word choice, I felt like she thought I picked him up from the street so that he could sign for my room.
That was all while waiting for our room to be ready. We arrived New Year's Eve and it was ready by 3:30pm. After that all 4 of my room keys didn't seem to work. A few security people were very helpful and fixed the problem as they welcomed us into our room. The comfort quickly changed our sour feeling. No problems whatsoever upon entering and thereafter!

We both just took new positions within our companies and knew a month long trip wasn't realistic at this time so we decided on a few days of fun in Las Vegas. We were greeted shortly after walking into the Cosmopolitan by Michael who was WONDERFUL! He was so kind and friendly and made us feel awesome. We ended up upgrading from a great room to a spectacular room! Our room was on the 65th floor and was facing the Bellagio and Planet Hollywood. It had a HUGE balcony and was exquisite in every way!! My husband and I could not have had a better experience. The following day Michael called our room around noon to make sure we were happy and ask if the newlyweds needed anything else. We couldn't believe the professionalism and courtesy that was shown to us.. We have only amazing and wonderful things to say about the Cosmopolitan and this is the only hotel we will stay in from now on when we visit Vegas. Even at checkout we got stellar service which was quick and wonderful.Thank you! Thank you! Thank you to the staff of the Cosmo :) We will be back!!,0,0,0

The Cosmo is pleasantly modern and definitely has a young more chic vibe than the Wynn which is showing its age.  The location is great, and there is walk way access over the strip to the Plane Hollywood and it's shops and restaurants.  Another walkway crosses over to Crystals through which Aria can be accessed as well.  We stayed in a wrap-around balcony room with great views of the Bellagio fountains and the strip.  The room was very spacious compared to what we get at the Encore for a similar price - we had a washer and dryer, kitchen, as well as a separate bedroom and 2 baths.  Self-parking was easy to use.  The was plenty of live music, and the casino is just the right size.  All the staff members we came in contact with were fantastic.  There are several pools to choose from.  We ate in two restaurants at the Cosmo (the Overlook cafe and Holsteins) - both were very good.  The fish tacos at Overlook and the mini-lobster tails in hotdog buns with sweet potato fries at Holsteins were awesome.",1,0,0

Pros:  The room was fantastic; exactly what we were looking for with a view of a significant portion of the strip, including the fountains at the Bellagio next door.  Two spacious showers, large televisions, and a well furnished and comfortable balcony.   The hotel itself is exceptional.  Excellent pools, very clean casino, good floor staff, and a good layout.  Cleaning staff was friendly and in-and-out of our room the moment we would leave.  Security was awesome - our keys turned off on the last night and security was up to help us within three minutes (timed it).

Cons: Check-in staff was abysmal.  First, the booking was duplicated in their system with the wrong room type and duration.  After correcting the tenure of the stay, we were promptly checked in to the wrong room.  More confusion from the staff, and then a very competent manager was able to resolve the issue in five minutes (after we played around with the regular staff forever) and get us the right room.  When we went by to get our luggage from the bellhop, they suggested we just give them the room number and they'd have it right up.  Two hours and three phone calls later, we just went back down and grabbed it up ourselves.  Conversations with other guests revealed similar experiences and the supposition that they were just overwhelmed that day.

Neutral:  As mentioned in other reviews, there is a significant population of young party people which I assume is this hotel's target demo.  No one was too crazy while we were there, and they were all pretty respectful of the other guests - this was not a spring break type crowd.  Oddly, there was a large amount of noise from the parties in the pools areas that sort of carried straight upward (to the 53rd floor), but this is to be expected in Vegas on the strip so not a big deal.

Overall:  Very happy with the hotel and accommodations.  Would be five stars if I could wish away that check-in.",1,0,0

stayed in a terrace studio room complete with a balcony view of the strip. the only minor complaint about my stay is that we were on the 28th floor and could still hear a lot of noise coming from the strip. stumbling into the room at 3am, i had no trouble sleeping haha but it did make taking a nap in the middle of the day a bit troublesome haha...other than that, loved everything else about the room - comfy bed with fluffy sheets, awesome spacious shower, lots of seating to entertain guests, cool coffee table books scattered around the room and really cool shower tile and wallpaper haha. didnt have any issue with housekeeping either - as soon as we left the room and called down for turndown service, we came back an hour later and it was done. also def recommend staying in the east tower since the elevators will drop you off in the middle of the casino or on the 2nd floor near all the restaurants and marquee. staying at the cosmo makes going to marquee really convenient too. get into the club early, get your re-entry stamp and head up to the room for more pre-partying haha

Booked one of the Terrace One Bedroom rooms through Travelocity.  When I checked in they upgraded me to one with a view of the Bellagio fountains (Which actually cost more than those with a view towards City Center).  We were on the 37th floor and our view was EPIC!  Every night we would chill out on the balcony and watch the fountains while enjoying the view.  You could actually hear the music from the fountains in our room.  I paid roughly $200\/night for the room and felt like it was an absolute steal!  These particular rooms have all the same amenities that you would find in most $1200\/night suites.  To name a few:  living room with large flat screen, kitchenette, huge closet and dressing area with leather bench, private toilet closet, nice vanity area, wet room with Japanese soaking tub and shower (also has a full window over tub that looks out over the Strip), separate bedroom with large flat screen, and huge balcony with glass railing and lounge chair.  It was pretty ridiculous!

I've been to many casinos and this has a little bit different vibe than the rest.  You get the sense that gambling is like the fifth most important thing here.  Wonderful selection of restaurants, Jaleo by Jose Andres being my favorite.  What can I say, I'm a sucker for tapas and ""Empanadillas de brandada de bacalao!""  Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night wondering if they will ship these to Mississippi.

The location of the resort is also a huge plus.  You really feel like you're in the middle of everything.  With Bellagio and Caesars to one side and City Center to the other, you're saved from super long walks and the hassle of hailing cabs.

My sole complaint about the Cosmo is the spa.  Now this is a small complaint, not even enough for me to lose a star in my rating.  The spa was a bit of a let down.  Not in the quality of the facility and staff, but in the layout of it.  If you're looking for a day at the spa with someone of the opposite sex, be prepared to be quarantined from one another.  The only coed lounge is on a separate floor and you have to be escorted there by one of the staff.  The wet areas are also a little on the small side.  Again, this is my only beef and seeing as how nice and helpful the staff was not enough to lose a star.",1,0,0

All I wanted was something to be done about the situation so that this doesn't happen to anyone else. What was taken wasn't very valuable (I'm glad it wasn't) , but what I was more concerned about was our privacy was violated. Lesson learned.

I will focus this review on my only complaint which is the lack of Marriott Rewards Elite recognition by the property.  I booked this property via Marriott and expected typical Elite treatment: Room Upgrade, Exec Lounge, Free Breakfast, etc...  The Cosmopolitan offers none of these amenities to Marriott elite members.  The only real benefit to staying here is receiving Marriott Points.

I do like this property but the typical ""Marriott Loyalty"" does not pull me to this property.  For someone that stays 75+ nights per year in Marriott properties, a big reason to continue staying at Marriott properties is the upgrades and perks.  I received none here so the next time that I am in Vegas I will likely stay somewhere else.",3,1,0

I'm very particular about hotels, and the Cosmo did not disappoint. Everything in the room was relatively new considering that it has been open for at least two years(?). Upkeep here is phenomenal, and their service staff is on point. I checked out of the room at 10:30AM, and someone was at the door at 10:35am to ensure the room was empty. Crazy!

Check in can be a bit cray around 3pm, so I suggest trying to check in as soon as you arrive. The front desk will remotely activate your key and text you the room information - I've never seen that done at another hotel.

Amenities (CO Bigelow) were a nice touch and a good size. Note that the lotion does contain mineral oil - clogs your pores!

The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are nice but a list of problems ended up turning our experience into a most unpleasant one and we will not be staying at this hotel again.  For the money we paid over the weekend, we shouldn't have experienced any problems like this.  

We started by noticing that we had a dirty towel and washcloth in the bathroom.  I don't know if they were dirty or just really stained but either way it was unpleasant.  Saturday night, we hung out our food order (well before the 2am deadline) for breakfast Sunday morning at 8am.  A little after 8am, we realized no one was bringing us food and I looked outside our room and notice the order was still hanging on the door.  We called room service, and after being on hold for at least 5-10 minutes, ordered breakfast which by the time it got to the room was 10am.  I called to complain but the wait times on the phone were too long.  It didn't matter if we called the front desk or room service we were on hold for too long every time.  If we really needed something (like champagne glasses), and had a lot of time, we called and put the phone on speaker so we could do other things while being on hold.    

When we checked out I wanted to speak to a manager about my concerns but the lines were so long and moving so slow that I just checked out on my phone and have decided that we will either go back to the Aria or Mandalay Bay (Four Seasons?).  Once again the hotel is beautiful and we loved our balcony overlooking the Bellagio fountains, but so many little problems made this a hotel we will not be staying at again (especially for the cost!). We've already encouraged several friends to stay elsewhere (even cancelled their reservations). There are too many hotels in Vegas for this experience at this price unfortunately.",6,5,2

Cons- terrible service, lack of communication between departments and even within individual departments.  The room was dirty!  Gum mashed into the carpet, sticky items on the desk.  When checking in we spent forever getting our reservations sorted then when we got new keys it was like everything we did during check in didn't happen.  My friend left her key in the room and the front desk manager kept on contradicting himself saying that her husband could call to add her name then said he couldn't because they can't verify anything.  The manager was rude and condescending, he apologized but it was an empty apology because you could tell he was just saying it and didn't mean it.  We asked for housekeeping to come when we worked out and they didn't, then when we called to request it again they tried to blame us saying we had a DND on the door which we didn't.  Of all the possibilities out here for hotels you would think they would try to retain guests for future stays but I guess not.  I felt like just a number even though we brought 10+ rooms here and spent 7k at the club on property plus rooms revenue and food revenue.  Bad service, me and all my friends will never return here when we can go right next door to the aria or mandarin and actually be treated as a valued guest!!",0,0,0

As a Platinum member of Marriott, it is nice to have a Marriott property to stay at on the strip. To clarify, it is my understanding that it is not a Marriott property but rather affiliated with the Marriott rewards program - either way I got all my Platinum freebies.

I got a great rate, found a special on the internet for like $160. I understand the rooms are usually much more then that. In fact we almost stayed there on the Saturday as well, that was going to $260.

The room we had was large, clean and well decorated. I really enjoyed the smart portion of the room i.e. how everything was networked. I especially enjoyed the phone control system - that was pretty cool.

The bathroom was nice albeit a little odd with having a large picture window as a wall for the shower. The tub, a soaker tub which was very deep, was nice but hard to get in and out of. I was surprised there were no hand rails and nonskid pads - seemed a bit dangerous.

We had a view of the Aria, not bad, but the balcony was nice. I can see this being a big draw if it is nice outside.

Instead of Marriott points I opted for the breakfast for two at The Wicked Spoon, that was a good decision. This is one of the most awesome buffet I have been to, very well done. However, they do not open until 8am? Really? Also, they only have one guy cooking made to order eggs. The line got really long fast.

We also ate at the Sushi restaurant on the third floor, great sushi but WAY overpriced. It costs three of us about $250 for sushi and drinks.

I'm not saying that those who paid for a cabana should get more attention, well, actually at an included 30% gratuity, yes, that is exactly what I am saying!

On our way down The Strip my boyfriend and I decided to walk through here since it was raining.  I actually didn't even realize it was a casino because I hadn't received any offers to play here.  Well, it is a casino and the reason I wasn't notified is because it's independently owned and not part of the other clubs where I'm a member (i.e. M Life).

That didn't last very long because I'm a member now.  They had some great offers to sign up including one where they gave you $100 after you lost $100 on slots.  Coincidentally, I had just won $100 next door at Aria... and no, I didn't lose it here. I decided to make the low risk choice of providing my email address for $10 in free play.

It was a good decision because we ended up getting some decent play out of it. My only complaint (and I didn't even take a star off) was that the drink ladies never came by to offer beverages.  We weren't even in a drinking mood, but some water would have been lovely.  We even told the attendant who signed me up for their club that we wanted some water.

Everything was clean and modern and greatly exceeded my expectations. My only complaint is that the kitchenette doesn't actually have a fridge, as it is all reserved for mini-bar type items, and to rent a stand alone is $25. The only open space is in the freezer. 

We spent most of our time at the Bamboo pool. I found a nice shaded spot with a cool mist raining down on us most of the day, which was pretty amazing given the temperature. The water temperature was actually cool enough to make the pool a really nice escape from the heat and the lounge seats in the shallow water are fabulous. 

We don't gamble and were really there to just chill out and get a break from the kids, try some new restaurants, and see a few shows. We arrived very early Tuesday morning and will make a point of arriving early in the week on our next visit as well.

I'm drawn to more modern, quirky hotels and this definitely is. From the changing video graphics in the lobby and elevators, to the clean and hip hotel rooms this place fits the bill for me. Oh yeah... the bill. Not the cheapest option, but not the most expensive either. I definitely thought I got my money's worth.

I heard that this hotel was originally supposed to be apartments. I'm not sure how much they changed the layout, but we lucked out with a suite, and we didn't even upgrade. I had friends who also stayed here in another room with two beds and they didn't have a suite like we did. Our room even had two bathrooms... which, let me tell you, was amazing! The one bathroom alone was big, but then the other bathroom was huge with a large walk in shower, separate toilet room and double sink. Then there was a small dining room table, large screen TV and lounger couch. The bed was comfy and I was super happy with the room in general. 

This trip, we specifically went to a hotel with an open and heated pool. In November that's a hard one. When I looked quickly, there were only about 4 hotels that offer that. While the pool that's open is small, it was perfect for what we wanted. Plus, there was a decent sized hot tub for the cooler days. 

I think a lot of casino's can seem dingy, even in a well maintained hotel. Maybe it's the lighting or decor, but it didn't feel dingy to me. It was also easy to navigate, which I don't think some hotel casino's are because they're so massive. This casino isn't large, but it offers what you need if you like to gamble.

I also enjoy a lot of the restaurant options. I've actually dined here on another trip, so I've hit up a fair share of restaurants in here and all of them have been great. I went to Scarpetta and Holstein's prior to my stay and enjoyed them. This time around I also ate at the Juice Standard and Eggslut. LOVED Eggslut and actually went twice because it was so good. The Juice Standard was the only miss, pretty bland smoothie. I loved Rose. Rabbit. Lie. It was hidden bar\/speakeasy in the back of the conference floor, but well worth the find. 

This was honestly the first time we stayed at the hotel complex most of the time, instead of hotel\/casino hopping. We ate, drank and lounged here most of the weekend, with a few jaunts out. I think that's why I like this hotel the most, because I felt like everything that was available to use was top notch. I honestly think if I come to Vegas again I'd stay here instead of hopping around again.",11,4,9

We asked for an upgrade and we got one! We got upgraded to the Terrance Suite over looking the fountain! 
    King-size bed
    910 sq. ft., 1 bedroom
    160 sq. ft. terrace with panoramic views
    2 bathrooms with master bubbler tub
    Telescoping doors separate living area from bedroom area
    Modern kitchenette with microwave and refrigerator

The room was F'en amazing.. from the entry to the kitchen to the bedroom to the terrace back to the bathroom. The bed was super comfy my body just melted right into it. The decor was super fab and inviting. 

The view from the terrace over looked the water show so you can only imagine what it was like when night fall set in and the waters came out to play..  My GF and I sat outside the terrace for one of the water shows, sipping our wine, looking at each other and then at the view and just laughed it up.  

Oh I almost forgot!! They have a washer\/dryer in the suite! Dirty the sheets.. lol you can wash it! ;) 

It is pricey to stay here and the Cosmo does not have a ""late check-out"" policy so make sure you check out on time.. otherwise be ready to pay a hefty price!

Cons: THE STAFF. I put in all caps because they are just that bad. Wanted a romantic weekend in Vegas with my boyfriend, so I booked a suite with a king bed. When we got there, we were told there were no clean rooms with king beds. I said we would wait. The woman checking us in then replied in a very snotty, stuck up way ""King bed is an option, its not guaranteed. All we have are rooms with two queens."" I asked if I could pay the upgrade and get a 1 bedroom suite. She said there were none of those with king beds either. Aparently there were no available rooms in the entire 60 floor hotel with a king bed.

Now, I don't know about you, but rooms with two queen beds remind me of family road trips, the least sexy thing I can think of. For what I paid for the room, I would think they could at least send a staff member to clean a room with a king bed for us. 

They did give us a $50 food credit, but in this hotel that won't even cover a good steak and a cocktail. I wouldn't have minded as much if I felt like the woman checking us in had tried even a little bit to accomodate me, but she was just terrible, acting like I was inconveniencing her.

Also, if you expect the waitresses in the bars to serve you, you'd better be prepared to start flashing your cash, because they completely ignored us while there were 3 of them serving a party of 5 nearby, who must have been tipping large or something.

Now I move onto the Marquis Nightclub - There was barf in the line that no one cleaned up throughout the entire hour we were waiting. Gross.

The line made me excited for the club because there were a lot of glamorous young people waiting. However, when we got to the front, we saw we had been waiting because they kept letting in huge groups of fat, poorly dressed bald men. Seriously they were wearing sweatshirts and old loafers, not even attempting to dress up. Obvoiusly not rich or anything. Later we learned that there was some kind of video game convention in town that they were catering to, but still, on the main floor the ratio had to be at least 5 to 1 fat bald men to hot girls. The boombox was much better ratio wise, but not nearly as cool as the main room as far as decor. 

Moral of the story:
1. If you want a sexy grown up king-bed room, don't count on one here.
2. If you want the waitresses in the bars to serve you, start flashing your benjamins.
3. If you want to go to a club that is not full of ugly fat men, make sure there is not a video game convention in town.",1,1,1

But its service is hit and miss. The valet was fast and very friendly, the friendliest employees we met all weekend. Front desk was fine, not overly friendly but not rude, either. Our room overlooked the Bellagio fountain for a $25 charge and the room itself was gorgeous. However, we were charged $5 for a soda we didn't even drink, it was already missing when we came to the room. Our bathroom light was burned out and the air stayed at 75 degrees and wouldn't change when we tried lowering it. We told them about it and no one came to fix it. The weirdest thing was someone knocking on our door like a madman at 9am and then using their key to come in WITHOUT saying that they were housekeeping or anything. Luckily, we had the additional door lock on so that they couldn't open the door completely, but instead of wait 30 seconds for us to get to the door, they just left. I still don't know if it was someone who worked for the hotel or some random person who had a key to the room! 

I also sent an email asking to fix an account issue with my Identity membership. It took them five days to respond and they said they didn't see any problem, but I logged in and it was still there. I loved the view and look of the Cosmo, but service was extremely disappointing considering there are so many other places to stay on the Strip with excellent service.",0,0,0

Nothing particularly egregious; however, a few issues with the room and found the resort to be a bit of a bore compared to others I've stayed at over the last 2+ decades (yeah, I'm ""old""). 

First visit recap: Fast check-in, friendly staff, upgraded to junior Terrace Suite with amazing views of Bellagio fountains...walked onto wet carpets and a not so clean room. The carpets had been cleaned the day of my expected arrival - why? Called front desk - no room to switch me to, so walked on damp rug for the 6 day stay (dried by the end of course). 

Second visit: When booking my Sin City trip this year, and trying to figure out where to stay...hmm...my husband reminded me that the Cosmo Senior Guest Service Manager had sent me an email last year requesting that I contact her prior to my next stay so she could personally handle the reservation. Yay husband!  

Sent a short email. Was contacted via phone and was hooked up. Bawler style - straight up!!!  

Upon arrival, was personally escorted to the 910 sq ft Terrace Suite; separate bedroom; master en suite bathroom with huge standup shower, double vanity, ""bubble' tub, and water closet; complete kitchen with full-size fridge, microwave, and stove (in case you need that - wink); dining area; second full bath (aka, the hubby's toilet); and sprawling 160 sq ft terrace with doors that opened from LR and BR overlooking amazing views of the Strip and the Fountains. Woot woot! We have arrived. The room ain't cheap ladies and gents (peak season in June when we stayed rates were $600-850 a night!); no joke. 

As if the room upgrade wasn't enough, they also provided us with a $100 room and restaurant credit AND delivered a box of hi-end chocolate bars and a ""thank you"" card to our room on the day of departure. 5 star customer service indeed!!! 

Ventured from ""Secret Pizza"" and ate at The Henry twice. Not bad, not bad at all. The ""lazy"" Bamboo Pool was actually viewed as a retreat - I guess one year can make a big difference between wanting a party pool to just loving a little R&R. Also, attended a private party in what I can only guess is their largest room; two stories, complete with private elevator and a billiard room. Lastly, the location can't be beat - right in heart of it all. And, the views, the views - be certain to ALWAYS ask and pay for the Bellagio Views - it's worth it. 

Overall: Great stay! ...expect the Casino is still small and not very generous. I typically take X amount of $ that I expect to lose. This time, I failed to leave my ATM card at home (yikes!) and dropped XXXX at the Cosmopolitan's tables and slots. Sadly, I seemingly paid them back for any and everything that was comped and then some. But, I still had a great time and cannot speak highly enough about how important the Cosmo views the happiness of its guests. I doubt I'll ever choose to pay full price to stay in their Terrace Suite in 
the future or drop as much dough while gambling, but it was fun while it lasted! Viva Las Vegas!  

Outstanding Guest Service.

I wasn't staying there, but I had wanted to go check it out. I made a vow on that day that I would come back and stay there. I made good on that promise last week. I had originally planned to go for my 40th birthday, but that fell through and I went this year for my 41st. Also, my friend who I traveled with is getting married in September, so it was a mini bachelorette getaway too.

We were greeted upon arrival by the enthusiastic (but not annoyingly so) and helpful (and cute) Derek, who helped us get checked in. I had asked for a handicapped accessible city room and because there were no city rooms with accessibility available, we were upgraded to a terrace room at no extra cost. Pretty sweet. Here's a word of warning that I would've liked to have known beforehand: like many hotels, the Cosmopolitan does charge a hold to your credit card for incidentals. You will get this back 3-5 business days after your stay, but know that they charge $150 per night. For us, that ended up being $600. Thankfully, one of us had that to play with, otherwise, our trip would've been greatly curtailed.

But back to the fun. After checking in, I stopped at the bell desk to rent a scooter (the mobility kind, not a Vespa). That went smoothly and quick and we were off to our room. The room was pretty great. There was a sitting area, with a foldout bed and TV, a refrigerator (which in our case seemed to want to make everything freeze, but it was still nice to have), a microwave, sink, and dishwasher. The main bedroom had a king size bed, another TV, and the sliding door to the terrace. Our terrace overlooked the Bamboo Pool and had views of MGM Grand and Crystals, as well as mountains in the distance. The bathroom had a shower stall and Japanese soaking tub, plus dual sinks and toiletries from C.O. Bigelow. 

We explored the hotel that night and really, it's just gorgeous at every turn. There are columns in the lobby with screens that change imagery every few minutes from fashion to flowers to slightly naughty silhouettes to books. The music is great and usually changes to match the images. Once in the casino, there is a tremendous chandelier, which extends across most of the floor and up to the 2 nd floor. There music there was a nice mix of new wave, post punk, and even a little garage rock. I'll review the restaurants and shops I went to on their own, but I do recommend the Henry and China Poblano.

At the end of our stay, we were able to check out by phone (or TV) in our room, which was a great convenience.

I'm so glad I got to stay at the Cosmopolitan. There is a level of glamour there, that, even on the Las Vegas strip, is unsurpassed. Frankly, the other luxury hotels in that area of the Strip look a bit chintzy by comparison. If you are looking for a splurge, the Cosmopolitan is for you.",1,1,0

Customer Service is TERRIBLE.  Everything takes WAY too long. I have stayed in MANY hotels in MANY cities and this has to be one of the most over-rated hotels yet.  It is pretty.  I will give them that much but how about a little attention to detail.   

The first room we stayed in was on the 26th floor.  The club downstairs was so loud, you could hear the pounding through the walls from 10:30am-6pm and then again from 10:00pm to 4:30am....  HORRENDOUS!  Granted most people staying in the hotel are here on vacation but we were here for work and it was miserable to sleep here or spend anytime in the hotel during the day.  The remotes did not work and the TV wouldn't play the movies you ordered.... The light in that bathroom and shower were out... We called for them to be replaced 3 times, 2 days later... we no longer had to pee in the dark.  

Our second room was on the 53rd floor.  Thank god the club noise was no longer an issue.  The movie system still did not play the movies we ordered- we had to have them removed from the bill.  The two times we requested room service they quoted 1.5 hours! We only ordered once.  The quote was correct. 

On top of all this...  The hotel held over $3,300 on our card for incidentals...  ""due to the length of our stay""

$3,300 !!!  Are you kidding me?!?!?!  That is ridiculous!

Cosmo is jaw-dropping design and decor.  Try to keep your mouth closed as you look up at three stories of Chandelier Bar bling.  Its absolutely breathtaking...and what still shocks me is that every time we go, Saturday nights or whenever, we can get a seat in here.  And, extra points for white glove bar service, but prices I can get with ($10 for a pineapple & goose?).

Cosmo is nothing but A-list eye candy.  Do NOT half step when you come out here, you will be embarrassed.  Bring your Louboutins.   Sorry to be harsh, but if you are a 6 or less, go somewhere else...you will get your feelings hurt.

Marquee gets a huge YAY for being legit about letting local ladies in for free without a ridiculous wait.  The nightclub is absolutely gorgeous.  It literally spills out onto the pool area... so forget about table service...cabana anyone?  Only in Vegas can you end up in a Jacuzzi in January in a 5 star nightclub.  I LOVE this town.

1. LOCATION: I must say that Cosmopolitan is still the only hotel on the strip that you dont have to leave for ANYTHING. You have everything from the beautiful spa to clubs and fine dining restaurants. I stayed here for a period of 3 days and I did not leave once. Also for anyone who has to be in the center of the strip this is the best option hands down. You are right in the smack of everything! 

2: ROOMS: I enjoy my stay here every time especially if you get the Bellagio fountain view with a balcony this is by far the best sight around. Any issues that have risen have been addressed right away. 

3. PROMO: I am now a gold member and believe me its worth it. You do really get a lot of benefits and staff actually recognizes you from you previous visits. The VIP check in\/out alone is a blessing during big events or conventions.

4. FUN: Whether you are here to shake that booty or relax in the steam room this hotel offers it ALL & and its not some middle of the mall spa, clubs, restaurants or swimming pools either. You have a selection of few pools that are designed to separate animals that have not slept in 3 days from families with children that are just chilling in the sun. They also offer day club for the younger crowds that can't wait for the sun to set to party.

5. DINING: Just look it up. From Holsteins and Henry to STK and Blue Ribbon this hotel has it all. The buffet is not the biggest but has everything that you might want out of a buffet experience.

6. GAMBLING: Everything is good except no Poker room :( But with that being said I ALSO have NEVER seen so many $3k+ vouchers cashed from the high limit slots in one day in my entire life. A friend of mine literally went back to back like this: 10k - 3600 - 2000 - 3500 - 4000
He started with $700 in the machine each time. I also bow to the positive attitude and patience of the roulette dealers. Always a nice chat and quick drink service.

It's sleek, luscious, luxurious, gorgeous, fresh, and sooooo stylishly detailed. 

The pools are fabulous - the Boulevard pool is a sweet spot to hang out with your friends - and it doubles as a SICK venue for music events. 

The restaurants are awesome, and the bars just make you FEEL so sexy with their ambiance! My favorite was definitely the Chandelier bar. It drips with luxury and ""fresh"".... 

I love the little loung-ee spots everywhere too... you feel invited to sit a spell and just enjoy yourself nearly everywhere you look.

He told me I could choose the room and I didn't wanna kill our wallet too much so I chose the *Terrace One Bedroom Fountain View* because the Japanese soaking tub caught my attention and you can't beat a fountain view. There are 2 towers and we stayed in the Chelsea tower on the 18th floor.

PROS:
-Location! Basically the middle of the strip. Nothing is TOO far
-Check in was an easy and friendly process
-Our room was the first one in the left side of the hallway from the elevator (definitely happy about this since our shins\/calves wanted to die from walking and running)
-Beautiful, clean hotel room
-Pretty good view of the Bellagio fountain 
-Comfy slippers and robes in the closet
-Good water pressure\/blow dryer (I have very thick hair)
-The freezer is very cold! Froze our water and sodas pretty fast
-Canister on the sink had cotton balls and swabs 
-TV had the Netflix app! 
-Good size walkway thru the casino area
-Quick check out and friendly staff at the bell desk
-Designated area for rideshare pickup\/drop off 

CONS:
-Hard to ventilate the room when using the shower 
-Some down feathers coming out from the bedding making the bed and window by the tub kind of dusty
-The buttons on the lamp on my side of the bed were not working properly

TIP: 
DONT LEAVE SILVER JEWELRY ON THE CANISTER! When we checked out, we were gonna meet my cousins for lunch and when we were on the connecting bridge to Crystals, I realized I left my ring and bolted to the ""Keys\/Information"" line and received a temporary key to the room. The woman at the desk said I can just leave the key in the room. Thankfully the room was already open and they hadn't started cleaning the bathroom yet and I got my ring back since it was still sitting on the canister! 

Well, hopefully I didn't forget anything... but I will be writing an awesome review for The Henry which is located in the hotel. 

Can't wait to return the Cosmo!",4,0,1

They had 100% occupancy rate for several consecutive days and we had to wait for 1.5 hours for our room to be ready. Traveling with a toddler this wasn't easy, but we hung out in a fantastic corner suite with our friends until the issue was resolved.

We didn't like the room they gave us. It was right above a nightclub pool and a concert stage and they upgraded us to a suite overlooking the Bellagio fountain. I've heard from other guests that it pays to complain if you have a valid issue.

The experience was very good. The rooms are great, views are great, the east tower has balconies in every room. The staff is very friendly and if you're into partying it's a total mob scene at night. There is no permanent show at The Cosmopolitan but the bars and the pool areas are top notch. The interior design and video installation at the reception area are very cool.

Pros: location, style, comfort, balconies, nice beds, awesome walk in shower, tubs with a view
Cons: weekend crowd, bad parking garage (even the staff can't figure out the parking row indexing), minor annoyances (low water pressure in one faucet), poor menu system on the room TVs, OSD misidentifying actual channels on TV, overfilled down pillows.",0,0,0

I just left the Cosmopolitan which was an unbelievable experience.  This is by far my new favorite...I'll break it down to give you a better idea:

1) Check In:  Honestly, this is probably the only thing that needs improvement.  I didn't arrive till around 10pm so there were few people checking in.  The problem is if there was, it would be very confusing as to where your supposed to stand.  Regardless, check in was smooth and gives you your first taste of the unbelievable technology this hotel has...by signing you in on an iPad.

2) Room:  So super slick!  Comfy beds, huge bathroom, very cool decor.  The best part is the technology.  From lighting, temperature, reservations, etc..  It can all be done on your TV.  This really needs to be experienced to believe it.  If you have difficulty using an ATM, or avoid self-checkout registers, stay away from this hotel.

3)  Restaurants:  I ate at Holsteins, Comme Ca, and Blue Ribbon Sushi.  I'll eventually write reviews for them all, but I can assure you they all get at least 4 stars.

4) Casino Atmosphere:  There is a bar for every mood here and they spared no expense...from ultra LED lounges, to swank Chandelier laden bars...you've got your choice!

I will be staying at Cosmopolitan for all future visits to Vegas!",2,0,0

We booked Terrace suite for 4 nights, I figured since it was cool, we weren't really gonna sit on terrace much, so no need for wraparound terrace suite. The bathroom photo on the hotel website looked nice too, open tub facing windows. Got up to our suite, it was much smaller than wraparound terrace, still one bedroom with terrace facing Bellagio lake and strip, views were amazing. Hubby got me surprise flowers, they were beautiful, everything was looking good until I went to the bathroom, that was when I freaked out! The bathroom was not facing windows, the tub was not an open tub, it has 3 walls around it! It's claustrophobic! I can't take a bath in there?! After we had our luggages delivered to our suite, we went down to look for someone to deal with this matter.The lobby manager ( I think ) Angelo saw us, greeted us and asked if we needed any help, hubby told him the suite was not what we expected, we wanted to change to another suite. He responded very friendly, and started to look into getting us another suite, but it was a long weekend, all rooms were booked, he told us to look for him the next day, he would happily take care of this matter for us. Ok... I could stay there for one night I guess.... But NO more! 

Hubby got a phone call in the morning the next day, it was Angelo, he told us he had made arrangement to change our suite to wraparound terrace, we could start to pack, and bell service would come up to pick our luggages to deliver to our new suite! Aww!!!! I was so happy! How efficient of him taking care of our issues, very very professional! We went down to thank him, he was happy that I was finally satisfied with our new suite. It was one of the nicest suites on west side tower, wraparound terrace facing the entire Bellagio, fountains, lake and strip! Beautiful! The open tub was right in the middle of the bathroom, I took a few bubble bath each day! Soooo relaxing. And thanks a million times to Angelo! He remembered to take care of our request, and made sure everything was fine with us, great Job! 

Another little drama, after we checked out, I left my Criss Angel bunny in our suite, had to run back to get it, a house keeper kept it in her cleaning cart, and gave it back to me, she didn't even want our tips for appreciation, how sweet! All the staffs were very very friendly, service was as good as Mandarin Oriental! Just the hotel is not as over the top luxury as Mandarin, but it's a more affordable luxury hotel for longer days stay. Wraparound Terrace suite cost $550 ish average per night for a long weekend, the same rate as a studio suite at Mandarin Oriental, so it's much better deal to stay at the cosmopolitan for longer days. They have nightly resort fee for $25 per room.  

There are some very good restaurants in this hotel, we have tried most of them, except the wicked spoon buffet and that pizza place, seriously where is that pizza place? I never found it?  Comme ca French cuisine is my favorite, Jaleo Spanish tapas, STK steak house, Holsteins for burgers, The Henry opens 24 hours, and 2 Italian restaurants, a Greek cuisine, Chinese and Japanese restaurant, pretty much everything for everybody. 

Two bar and lounge areas located on west and east side corners, Vesper and the Bond bar, very tasty drinks at reasonable prices, $13-16. Chandelier bar in the middle, Marguee nightclub on second floor, No cover for hotel guests on Thursdays, or before10 on fridays and saturdays. Two bridges to city center, Aria, Planet Hollywood and the strip. Very convenient location, even though we didn't drive, still could walk short distances to lots of places. Most restaurants and shops are on second and third floors. 

The Cosmopolitan is still one of my favorite hotels in Vegas! 

Ps. Love their indoor valet, perfect temperatures in winter and summer! Check out the cool statues and arts on third floor convention center area! So beautiful!",4,0,4

Thanks for ruinin my big 2-1 
Checkin was a bit slow and they told us that we don't get a deal for marquee even though we stayed there btw it was a lie cause I got in for free

Stayed at the wraparound suite and yeah it was pretty but everything was dusty 
The bath I wouldn't even want to dip my feet in there
So got to the room the remote control for the television hardly even worked 
Checked the fridge and there was already a yoohoo gone
The dining table was sticky it looked like someone threw up in the bathroom area

For the whole weekend I had the do not disturb sign out and on Saturday they came in anyways talk about rude and invasion of privacy

Their plumbing sucks too.. I peed.. wiped my down there ...flushed once and it clogged... Seriously? I peed and it clogged 
After we called for the plumber to come they fixed it after 30 minutes

During check out guess what? They charged us $250 for damages.. Really? Come on your a resort in Vegas and youre going to charge $250 for using a plunger I could've just paid $2.00 for my own plunger at cvs not only that they charged 56. Something for using the minibar and i did not remove anything or touched it 

After calling the Lobby a guy supervisor said that they wouldn't charge for the minibar and that the housekeeping supervisor would come and check for the damages 

After coming the supervisor said everything was clear and that she would call and tell them not to charge 

So.. I thought I wasn't going to be chafed anything and saw $250 on my transaction and the next day $56 on it they didnt even take anything off

After calling many times I finally got through 
The first time I called they told me that it was because we damaged something 
I told them that the housekeeping supervisor called them that it was clear they told me that they didn't receive a call which angered me they forwarded the call to the person who made the report and they didn't pick up (not a surprise) I left a voicemail to tell them to call me back never got a call back (a week later still no call) 
yeah called again and now they tell me that it was a housekeeping charge really now who has ever gotten charged for house keeping when you had a do not disturb sign out -.-
Kept fighting and they told me that they were going to get to supervisor which would call on Friday and still no call
This is some bs charging me 300+ and ignoring and also making different charges and so far I still have the charges 
And yes they still didn't call me back time to call the AGAIN -.-


This is a warning don't ever come to this resort

and just repeating thanks... for ruing my 21st birthday",17,9,3

We dined at Scarpetta, had cocktails at Beauty and Essex and ate at Blue Ribbon Sushi twice during our stay. Oh, cannot forget the Chandelier Bar.

Accommodations here are very modern, location on the Strip is pretty central, and they have great eats (I can vouch for the Wicked Spoon buffet and the actually slightly hidden Secret Pizza). If possible, get a room with the Bellagio fountain view. Very well worth it. You may not hear the music, but you get a spectacular view of the fountains + the Eiffel Tower and High Roller backdrop. One tip: Floor 16 is not high enough to see anything, but floor 30 should be decent.

They charge a $33 resort fee, which covers useless things like local calls, and somewhat important amenities like wifi and fitness center access. They have two fitness centers, one of which is 24 hours (though it is the smaller of the two facilities). They also have three pool areas, one of which is the Marquee dayclub pool.

Oh yea, casino is pretty well ventilated, which I love (my breathing and cigarette smoke still don't get along too well). I never have too much luck with the slots here, but they are entertaining.

I was a bit worried after reading several reviews about bad service, late check-ins, stolen items, etc, but we had no problems in that area. 
Note that the safe in the one bedroom terrace fits a 15"" laptop. 

It being the Thursday before Memorial day weekend, we were worried that the hotel would be packed and our room wouldn't be ready, but that was not the case. 
We showed up right at check-in time, 3pm, and there was little to no line at the front desk.  Our room was ready immediately.  
The iPads embedded in the front desk are pretty cool, btw.  
The lobby has several columns which are covered with displays that continuously loop video art.  This was particularly stunning.  I could sit at Vespers all day and just watch those.

The idea of sitting in the tub and enjoying the view was novel, however in practice from our vantage point you can't really see much of the 
strip if you are sitting the the tub. We'd have to stand up a bit to see street level.

The rest of the hotel is gorgeous.  We went to the secret pizza place (Nico's), the Marquee, Wicked Spoon, Bond, Vespers, the Chandelier bar, and Holsteins and I have nothing but positive things to say about them.  I might write up separate reviews later. 
We also enjoyed room service for breakfast.  I had the eggs benedict, which was perfect.  The english muffin was still warm and soft and toasted perfectly, and there was plenty of hollandaise. 

Minor ding: I called to get a late check out for noon, and they wouldn't give it to me.   I understand why they couldn't, given that it was the Friday of Memorial day weekend, but yaknow, I have to say something negative here.

My rating of the 1 bedroom suite I stayed in for two days: 4 stars.
*Large Patio. SO VALUABLE on a summer day and night in Vegas. No one else on the strip has them. Pop champagne, toast, relax. Watch the lights and the crowds of people! 
*Usable freezer and big microwave (useful for restaurant leftovers or uneaten pizza from ""The Secret Pizza Place"" on the 3rd floor!- MUST TRY the ""White"" pizza slice!)
*2-seater Bath w\/ clear views of the Bellagio fountains and Vegas skyline. Amazing.
*Room-like shower.  
*Cool wallpaper and design elements 
*Cool art books and mini library in room

Note: As I have stayed in many different Vegas resorts, I can lend these suggestions happily:
*Room needs a ""Master"" remote that controls everything in the room- including the shades
*The mattress could have been more comfortable

My rating of hotel environment, ambiance, and design: 5+ stars! 
*This is THE most ""beautiful"" casino on the strip. The Cosmo hotel is the most aesthetically pleasing location you will find. I never ran into any kind of mess or trash of any kind. The check-in area- WOW! Very cool, alive, and creative. Everything on site was spotless and sleek at ALL times. Pretty impressive. Saying that the Cosmo lent much attention to detail doesn't lend much respect to the designers, so let me just say you have to see it to appreciate it!

We originally booked 2 adjoining City Rooms but we got both rooms upgrades to the Terrace Studios. Since we flew in on 2 different flights and the name of the person on the room was on the second flight, Cosmo let us switch cards on file while maintaining the price we originally booked (which was a steal compared to other hotels). The lady checking us in automatically asked if we wanted late check, which is at 2pm. We ended up on the 47th floor with a balcony and our view was awesome at night. 

We liked that it was close by to a Walgreens, so we stopped there to pick up drinks, cups and some food for our room. It was a short walk away! 

Went to Marquee one of the nights we were there, so loved that we didn't even have to leave the hotel. Definitely stop by the Secret Pizza place nearby when you're leaving Marquee! 

On the last day, a friend and I decided to check out the pool area even though it wasn't too warm up. I definitely would come back when it's warmer. The pool area looked like it could be a lot of fun. Check out the pics other people have posted on here!

Also, if you ever go wandering around, there are plenty of photo ops on the many floors!

The only con I have is their security\/lost-and-found. My friend left her jacket in her room so she called security\/lost-and-found, told them what it looked like. They said they found it and would hold it for us. Since she had already left on her flight, she gave my name so that I could pick it up for her. When I tried to pick it up, the security guy said there was nothing in lost and found from either rooms and that we would just have to call back tomorrow during the first shift since the second shift guys knew nothing about it.

Hotel rooms- Very comfortable.  I've heard from some that high winds rattle the window and whistle down the air shafts, keeping them awake at night; but I faced the other side and didn't have that problem (Still heard it, though). My view was of the Bellagio fountain display, which I highly recommend asking for.  I must add:  the water quality here is TERRIBLE, and the body lotion set in your room is basically water.  If you are staying for any length of time, bring your own industrial strength moisturizer.

Casino.  Very generous.  If you know when to stop, many of my coworkers won nicely.  Also, doesn't have that 'I'm in tourist land' feel that most places struggle with.

Conference rooms.  Spacious, tasteful.  Some issue with maintaining a comfortable temperature.  My biggest complaint is with the food.  Do you like starch?   Then you're in luck.  But if fruits and veggies are part of your food pyramid you might want to bring your own.  

Decor.  It grew on me.  You'll love the elevator moving pictures.  Lots of sparkle throughout.

Unfortunately, for what we typically do in LV, a hotel in this price range is not practical. One critique of the hotel that I have us the check in desk.

It was fairly busy upon arrival and the check in lines were long but went fairly quick. Our check in clerk was really friendly but professional. He did however accept my $20 tip and I was upgraded from the standard Terrace One Bedroom to the same room but on the 28th floor overlooking the fountains (a ~$40 a night upgrade on their website). This made me HAPPY.

The room was immaculate. Classy and actually had its own style other than the generic modern style that MGM properties all have now and many other casinos are copying. I liked the blue instead of all the drab earth tones. Flat screen tv with lots of channels that were actually in HD! 

The bed. JFC this is the most comfortable bed in the world. No matter which way I plopped down on it I never moved. It was supremely comfortable. I would wake up in the exact same spot I fell asleep in, never having moved. 

The balconies are just awesome. I smoke and my girlfriend doesn't, we had the best of both worlds. The view of the Bellagio fountain and the strip is beyond incredible. Really makes you feel like a baller. And it should for upwards of two hundred bucks a night! 

The bathrooms are pretty awesome too but having to walk through the shower area to get to the tub is kind of odd. The tub is a good size for two people though and there is a window that provides the same view as your balcony. Great place to sit and relax after walking four thousand miles up and down the strip all day.

I'm still giving five stars but there were some negatives. Most are just my personal opinions and preferences. You definitely may feel differently. 

The entire casino\/clubs\/bars and everything in here, including the people, are just a little too damn cool for me. I feel like I'm in the middle of a modeling convention or something. Its just too much for me. If you are super cool and trendy then you will probably love it. I wear basketball shorts every day. I felt out of place.

Everything is ridiculously expensive. They gotta pay for it somehow. $14 drinks are the norm. Can I just get a $5 whiskey and coke somewhere please? I realize its Vegas but a happy hour or something would be nice. 

The only restaurant I ate at was China Poblano. I was under the impression it was the type of place I could just pop in for a quick taco. They looked at me like I had two heads and the whole experience was really awkward. My $6 two-bite taco was not good at all. Like really not good. Greasy and gross. Tortilla sucked.

All in all this place is awesome. I would definitely stay here again because of the rooms\/beds and especially the balcony. I would spend even less of my time in the casino or at the bars though. Its just not for me.",0,1,0

I cannot say how disappointed I was with my stay at the Cosmopolitan. I booked it for a bachelorette party and I wish we hadn't. 

First, when we checked in the room that we were given was filthy, the beds were made (which was disturbing) but the carpets had bloodstains,  the bathrooms had NOT been cleaned and there was trash around the room. 

I was then put on hold for 45 minutes before anyone even apologized for the situation, and it was a pathetic apology at that. We had to wait an hour wandering around the hotel, till they gave us another room. 

Thankfully, this room was actually clean and the view was very nice, but it took a total of 3 hours for them to rectify the situation and everyone that we dealt with was RUDE!

A front desk manager, Chaz, seemed nice and offered use a free bottle of champagne, which was a nice gesture and told us he would take care of any other problems that we had. So when I called down 45 minutes later to see where our bottle of champagne was and I found out that he'd left I was not even surprised. 

Finally, at 8pm (6 hours later) when I was once again on hold, I was finally able to speak to a hotel manager who apologized. 

Anything, that they tried to do to make up for the situation turned out to be a bigger fiasco! Upon looking at my bill they charged me for the champagne!!!!

It's Monday and I am still on the phone with them trying to figure this out. Currently, on hold.

When coming to this new venue for a close friend's Bachelorette Party, I was thrilled by the decor and the set up of the rooms. That is the reason for the one star. Otherwise, I would have given it zero.

The check in was a nightmare. They were disorganized, rude, would not add anyone else's name to the reservation of 7 girls (which we had disclosed to them upon booking the room) without begging at the front.

The parking is confusing and not easily accessible.

The casino is cold and doing its best to mirror a spa with horribly snobby attendants. This is a casino. We are here to play games (the cheapest table was $25, but that's fine since this is the image they are going with) so please stop acting like you are doing us a favor. It's our money that we are OPENLY giving over to you. Not even The Wynn has this much attitude.

Then, came the situation that I have discussed with a lawyer and about which I am still unsure of what to do. We had purchased tickets for a Fat Boy Slim concert on their roof during this Labor Day weekend celebration. The lines, as you can imagine, were insane and everyone was trying to get in. We had tickets, so we tried to find the difference between tickets and no tickets. When I attempted to ask the bouncer (whose name escapes me but he has a tattoo on his arm with his anniversary and looks almost identical to Steve-O) where we needed to stand, he literally turned his back to me and would not answer my question. I thought he didn't hear me, so I said, ""Excuse me, can you please tell me..."" and before I could finish he put his finger inches from my nose and said, ""I'm busy and will deal with you later."" then walked away. We thought fine, we'll just wait here.

After awhile, we got in our correct line and waited. It was divided into two sections to keep a pathway clear for other guests (which makes total sense, again I'm a reasonable human). When we walked (as instructed by another equally angry bouncer) to the other part of the line, Steve-O waited for us to get to the other side and then yelled, ""You dumb (expletive) need to get in the right line. The end of the line is back there."" I replied, ""The other bouncer just told us to go here. We have tickets. Why are you talking to us like this?"" He then ran to me and got inches from my face. He screamed he was going to kick me out and raised his hand like he was going to strike me. I was terrified and everyone in line was just staring, confused. I responded with, ""You are being incredibly aggressive and if you are kicking me out, you need to decide that, but your tone and aggression are unnecessary."" Seeing as how I was right and he had created a seen, he huffed and puffed and walked away. Others in line said, ""Oh, he just did that to me too. I am trying to sell my ticket."" They were always females saying this. It was a disgusting experience and was, by the definition of the word, assault.

I will never return here. When I attempted to report this while there, I was ignored and told that a separate company hires out these people and they can't speak to it. I paid to stay at that hotel for 3 nights. Why would you not at least direct me to the person with whom I could file this report?

Throughout the weekend, I heard, ""We are only 7 months old"" from a lot of employees. That's completely understandable that there will be hic-ups and mistakes! But, so much aggression from one employee, I was shaking and had to return to my room?! Then, to have no one wanting to help me at least report it?! I am not good at confrontation, so I let it go. But, for any and all people that are nice and want to experience Vegas in the fun, light-hearted way most trips there are intended to be, do NOT stay in this hotel. You are not safe, it is very expensive, and the staff is rude beyond anything I have ever experienced.

I was simply left without words. From the valet, to the maintenance people - no one appears to be happy working here. You can get a high class, well respected experience (and I speak from having had them) at the Wynn and Mandalay Bay. Do not give them your money or your sense of security. Disgusting",7,3,0

After my best friend's bachelorette group was told our room was not ready almost 2 hrs AFTER check-in...we amused ourselves at the bar for another 2 hours until we finally got into our Wraparound Terrace Suite  - luckily we were all in good spirits and happy to start off our wonderful weekend in this glam hotel.

After I pulled back the drapes to gasp in pleasure at the ""panoramic views of the Vegas skyline"" that we have been anticipating for months..watching hundreds of youtube videos and oogling the video gallery on the website...I choked on whatever good spirits I had just consumed as I stared at a full wall on one side and some rooftop of a parking structure with the freeway on the other side of this ""expansive wraparound private terrace."" 

Never mind that we upgraded from the regular terrace suite just for this wraparound terrace and its views...never mind that when we booked the room and requested for the ""best view"" we were told that ALL the Wraparound Terrace Suites have the best views. Never mind that ""this suite boasts a sleek, modern kitchen featuring sycamore cabinetry with a sub-zero refrigerator, microwave and stove"" but NO plates, NO eating utensils, NO cups? Were we suppose to pack our own coffee maker, too?!? Never mind that we didn't have a trash can in our bathroom or in the kitchen. They weren't kidding when they say this suite has ""amenities not found in your typical Las Vegas hotel room."" Never mind that we were ensured to be moved out of this excuse of a janitor's closet and into a better room the next day..then told no by a manager the next morning and that we should have never been promised that.

What really got me is when the bride-to-be, my best friend, spoke with this manager and expressed to him how disappointed she was because of all-of-the-above...his response was ""So what are you really complaining about?"" 
Cosmopolitan..if you can't accommodate guests efficiently on a regular weekend, if you can't provide what is advertised through your website\/staff, and if you can't hire management that actually care and respect those who walk through your door...SHAME ON YOU AND SHUT IT DOWN!!! 

ADVICE...DO NOT STAY IN THE WRAPAROUND TERRACE SUITE 1889 EASTSIDE TOWERS just for the ""panoramic views of the Vegas skyline"" ...THERE IS NONE.",16,9,4

Don't get me wrong, the Cosmo is more hip and fun and I can walk quickly over to PH for a great sammich at Earl's, however, after catching the fountain show over three straight hours from every possible location around Bellagio, including during dinner on the balcony, Bellagio is still the total package and quintessential Vegas weekend destination... Cosmo is a great interlude though... more of a what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas place.

This Hotel looks beautiful from the outside and the rooms advertised were beautiful. So Let me tell you all about my stay in the wrap around terrace suite on the 62nd floor. 1) made to wait because our room wasn't ready (booked room 4 months prior) until roughly 5pm. Room we got was not clean. I found poker chips and broken glass under the sofa, master bathroom wasn't clean. Friday night I was kept out of my room by hotel security that refused to let me inside the hotel even though I paid a couple thousand to stay the weekend. Then on the next day we got forced to remain locked inside our hotel room unable to get any food or beverage, room service or house keeping to complete the job they didnt do the night before. When we finally were released from captivity in our hotel room, there was no thankyou, accomidations or comps, nothing  their general hospitality very very lacking and anyone that stayed though this disastrous Friday and Saturday should be given a free 2 night stay to make up for it.and by the way,  the Odor when you get off elevators on Blvd tower is horrendous...then as I read some of the reviews after mine.

The hotel lobby was decked out with sick flat screen columns that looked like wall paper, but changed throughout the day. The check-in counters used iPads (with a stylus?!?), though it seemed like a fairly frivolous addition. 

Service at this relatively new hotel was extremely rough. We had a block of rooms reserved together before we arrived, however at check-in that information was lost and people were checked into rooms all over the place. The staff worked hard to get us rooms in the same tower at least and ended up comping us each for one night and giving us half off the second night (a few of us were stuck room-less for 3 hours). In addition to the check-in mishap there was a ""cleaning"" problem in one of the rooms. I won't get into the details, but it needed immediate attention, which unfortunately had to be requested multiple times. Also on Sunday morning I ordered room service that never arrived, when I called to check on it they suggested I go to the buffet instead.

My suite had a great view of the Bellagio fountain. Decor was attractive and it felt spacious enough for one. The bachelor got a massive bungalow (he was majorly upgraded due to our many service issues). It had a private entrance to the hot new club: Marquee as well as 3 floors, views of the club, and an outdoor hot tub. Unfortunately the lack of sound insulation meant he couldn't sleep until the music stopped (after 5am). Also the fancy stereo system wasn't working on the main floor so we couldn't pipe in any music. Furnishings in the bungalow (like the couch) seemed designed more for ease of cleaning than style.

While it's a cool looking hotel for now, I suspect the heavy use of technology means it won't look or feel modern for all that long unless they have a big budget for frequent upgrades. In my mind... Encore remains the Vegas champ.",35,14,20

They had rooms for $200 a night which is not much more than a basic courtyard that we were staying at in Phoenix.  Upon check in due to my Gold Marriott Status they upgraded us for free.  We paid another slight upgrade of $30 for a bellagio view.  We ended up on the top floor and the view was better than any other I had seen on any other visit I had to Vegas.

The amenities were great.  It had lots of free parking in their garage.  The garage has the update lights so you don't have to circle endlessly.  You know if there is an available spot via the green light.

From rooms to customer service to dining- it just doesn't get better.  

In the 4 yrs I've lived in Las Vegas I have spent many many of my best nights at the Cosmo & made countless memories here. 
Cosmo was the first hotel my boyfriend & I ever stayed at on the Vegas strip & since we're moving away from Vegas in 4 days we decided to make it the last hotel we stay in before moving; what a lovely night!
Rooms aren't super cheap here so when I found one for under $200 I knew it was meant to be but after telling Jesse at the registration desk how we were celebrating our final days in Vegas he made a call & upgraded our room to a tower-king-suite with a fountain view as a parting gift from them (: 
The first time we ever stayed here I paid big money for a similar room, we were celebrating Valentine's Day, & we were put on one of their highest floors.  
The beds are cozy, balconies are fun & beautiful, rooms are clean,  & tubs\/showers are neat! 
The Boulevard Pool is awesome (""dive-in movies"" on Mondays thru the summer-so fun)! Try the nutella croissant at the coffee shop  (omg-yum), & Secret Pizza is unique (you gotta search for it,  it's a secret so they don't make it easy(, Milo's is delicious,  Beauty & Essex is fancy shmancy, STK is fun with a clubby steak house kinda vibe, the amazing Chandelier Bar, & of course there's the classic over-the-top Marquee Night Club!

We had two rooms. One was a Lanai Suite for the birthday boy, the other a standard city room for the rest of us. I was disappointed that there was no room with a balcony for the city room, but thats nit-picky. 

The building, its casino, its restaurants, clubs, access to the strip are all incredibly fantastic, and the layout and flow of traffic was clearly well thought out and executed extremely well. 

After staying here, I won't stay anywhere else. And I've stayed at just about all the other ""nice"" places on the strip. 

The pros: Great rooms with fantastic beds. The beds they have are the best I've ever slept on in Vegas. The bathroom, even in the basic room, was large and terrific, with the window between the shower and the bedroom. Great TV, room was big enough, stylish and well appointed. Definitely did the trick. 

The cons: Service was totally hit or miss. The front desk employees and especially room service representatives were AMAZING. Like bend over backwards kind of people. However, calling the concierge (which is the only department you can reach to get general help) takes forever. We'd call for something and the phone rings, and rings, and rings. Over and over again. That was irritating beyond belief when you are delaying your plans by waiting for the concierge to answer. We didn't have a TV remote in our room upon check in, and it took 3 calls to get one delivered. 

Also, we partied all night, and slept much of the day. As such, we put the Do Not Disturb sign on the door and skipped the daytime housekeeping. We called each night around 8pm asking for housekeeping to come sometime between 8pm-2am, and they never came, even after we were told it would be no problem. The room never got cleaned the whole time we stayed, that was upsetting. 

The first Lanai Suite we had, the heater was broken on the Jacuzzi. Maintenance came up to fix it, and deemed it fixed when they left. It never got hot. The front desk manager came up and was kind enough to discount one night's rate and move us to a better room. That was fantastic service.

THE ROOMS are designed for modern comfort. Sleek, modern interiors with high ceilings and mirrored walls; brilliant character wall papers; glass showers and double sinks; and digitally synced controlled heating, lighting, room service guide and Sirius music through the wide screen HDTV. Everything was better than expected, except that there was no iPod player (Cord to be purchased for $20). 

THE POOLS are incredible. The Bamboo Pool is the 'loungy' pool (ideal for relaxing\/swimming - families). The Boulevard Pool has tables and cabanas right along the foot-high water; a pool and TV area and jacuzza (ideal for tanning\/hanging out - younger crowd). Marquee Day Club pool has the beach parties and the DJs spinning all day (ideal for dancing\/drinking - party crowd). 

THE CLUB - Marquee is absolutely breathtaking. Huge dancefloor with high ceilings and opens up to a lit-up palm tree walkway and poolside. One of the best I've ever experienced. 

THE RESTAURANTS offer something for everyone. We tried Jaleo (a trendy tapas restaurant - good for girls) and Hosteins (a trendy burger spot - good for everyone, recommend!)

SAHRA SPA & HAMMAM offers full luxury. When booking a service, you're entitled to use the private pool, showers and steams and fitness facility all day. With the Swedish massages we had and all the extra perks, I've never felt so pampered!

This is obviously to keep the intoxicated masses (potentially drunk and disorderly hotel guests) from throwing impromptu pool parties. Which means the other people staying here who would like to lounge by the pool and have a cocktail after 7 are out of luck. Moving on. Everything you want to buy on hotel premises is a shameless 3 to 4X's the price it would normally be. I spent more $ on incidentals and bottled water from the convenience store as I did at the bar. Rooms: Small as you would expect. Bed: fine not exceptional. Toiletries: Bigelow, not worth the price of the room! Mini Bar: don't move a thing because you will be charged. (This means you cannot use the fridge and get charged for one if you want an extra which is supposed to go where in your closet of a room?)

Yep, that's about it. I will never be back here. DO go talk to the concierge people before you leave to avoid having random sh#$% show up on your credit card bill when you arrive back at home. Nice. Do not bring children here. What is the point? The staff is nice I feel bad for them having to deal with the attitude of many of the patrons that stay here.",0,1,0

Wicked Spoon is also my favorite lunch buffet.  The foods are packed with flavor and is presented in cute miniature baskets.  I would highly recommend checking out wicked spoon and I definitely want to try it out for dinner soon.

The casino at Cosmo is WELL ventilated and does not smell like smoke all the time and isn't suffocating which I am really appreciative of.

And that word isn't meant to reflect the cleanliness of the rooms there--although when my party and I attempted to check into our VIP Suite on 8\/6\/17, we were told our room wasn't ready due to a stain on the carpet (vomit? feces?) and had to wait. 

No, when I say 'disgusting,' I'm simply referencing how I witnessed staff treat a woman there as well as the way they in turn treated me. 

Sunday night, my boyfriend and I had the pleasure of going out to one of Vegas' many clubs, and we came back to the hotel around 3 AM for a drink. We sat down near the bar that's closest to check in, chatting until I had to go to the bathroom. I went to the public restroom and while inside, met a woman who revealed to me that she was a prostitute. I, like many other people, thought this was fascinating. I told her I'd love to learn more and offered to buy her a drink, making it clear that's all I was interested in. 

We got to the bar, and almost immediately, three security guards came up and surrounded her. Three! Look, I get it. While prostitution may be legal in parts, soliciting prostitution in hotels is definitely not okay, and I totally support adhering to those rules and kicking her out. What I don't support is surrounding a 120 lb. woman with three 200+ lb. guys who threaten her, act like she is the scum of the earth and then take her away to another part of the hotel to do ???. 

I got nervous, and I followed them. I witnessed them yelling at her and grabbing her arms. When she left, they saw me watching and called me over. I obliged. 

That's where the fun begins. They started asking a lot of questions, which my answers they didn't believe. They refused to believe me that I was staying there (since we had so many in our party, my name wasn't on the guest list). They refused to believe that I didn't know this woman beforehand. They refused to believe that I wanted to make sure she was okay due to their power-tripping, aggressive behavior. And they refused to believe that I wasn't a prostitute.  

One of my favorite exchanges: 
Guard: ""Who are you texting?""
Me: ""My boyfriend.""
Guard: ""Yeah, I'm sure YOU have one of those.""

The dehumanizing, patronizing comments go on and on, but what matters here is two-fold: 1. I'm a guest at a hotel and your staff is treating me like less than human, and 2. Even if I WERE a prostitute, YOU. DON'T. TREAT. PEOPLE. THAT. WAY. 

For the next ~30 minutes, three guards berated me and looked down their noses at me because they thought I was something (not SOMEONE) beneath them. It's not until my boyfriend located me and verified that I was staying there, and he was staying there, that they let me go. 

As we left, all I got was a sarcastic ""Sorry for the misunderstanding"" from the overweight, beady eyed guard wearing glasses. (I can't for the life of me understand why he despises prostitutes as I assume with his looks and personality, hiring them is the only way someone touches him. But that's just a petty side note.)

I'm not ashamed to say I cried afterwards. I cried for how it made me feel, like less than nothing, like I'd be doing the world a favor if I disappeared, but I mostly cried knowing that this is probably something that happens way more often than I've realized because of how privileged of a life I've been born into.

I will accept fault for what I did wrong in this scenario: not being on the guest list, and well, being pretty fucking angry. I will not accept fault for making friends or caring about a stranger--although I'm sure those concepts are foreign to the abhorrent security guards at The Cosmopolitan. And I will not accept fault for how humiliated and scared they made me (at a point, I even texted my boyfriend that I was afraid they'd hit me). 

I'm not sure how those three ""men"" feel proud of the career they've created when they spend their time throwing their power around to make others feel inferior. All I know is that EVERYONE deserves better, and you won't be getting another dollar from me. 

And, to the three security guards...I promise you that that night, in that hotel, the lowest scum of the earth certainly wasn't wearing heels.",11,1,2

I'm not a girl that stays in hotels much, but Cosmo of LV was by far one of the best hotels I have reserved to date. 

The best thing about Cosmo was the Wicked Spoon buffet. Wow, what great food. I had Red Velvet pancakes, great brunch, and awesome desserts section. My boss had to go again before she left ti was just so good. 

My room was large. I was a bit disappointed to get a double when I reserved a single, but nevertheless, the stay was great. I slept well everyday. I loved the decor of the rooms, the cool bathroom with the see-thru view (hubba-hubba!). I liked the great toiletries (which I still have them). Improvements for the room would include free coffee, what a let down as a conference hotel. 

Speaking of conferencing, Cosmo had a great continental breakfast each day at conference. They was much to choice from with both hot and cold breakfast. The wait staff was also present and attentive. Cosmo also had great pens for conference.

Another I loved doing within Cosmo was exploring the art. I loved art displayed that they had around the building. I wanted to make sure I say all of them. Speaking of great art, the one piece of art was the Chandelier Room; the prettiest place I have ever seen. You make me feel like a Barbie!

Cosmo also had a great pool and food overall good at and surround the pool. Lastly, my boss loved the card service (for rewards), that she went back to Cosmo a few months later to vacation!

Sitting area with TV. King Bed with TV. Large terrace with an amazing view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. 

3 stars for the valet bell service area. Took a long time for our poor valet to find a bell hop.... But all were friendly.  Valet was complementary... So add a another star for that. 

We're Marriott Rewards Members Gold Elite. The Cosmopolitan doesn't honor the benefits as advertised on the Rewards Details site.  I think that's fine given the high cost of the area, but it bothers me that you are expecting this and find yourself disappointed when you get here and find out.  The main thing that I found upsetting was that they DO honor the benefits for Platinum Members.  Why honor the benefits for one but not the other?  Again, it'd be better if we were not expecting what was outlined on the rewards. 

What we did receive as gold members was access to the concierge VIP check in, juice and coffee (also in that lounge) in the morning, enhanced wifi.  No upgrade was available but they did check and we would have received that if available.  What they don't honor is the concierge lounge access or breakfast or points. They don't have a concierge lounge. Only platinum members receive a ten dollar credit for breakfast.  Again, they should mention their exception on the rewards website.  

The counter clerk was a little young and tended to mumble and appear a little disinterested.  The bell hops were slow but very nice.

The check in: lukewarm. They have iPads at every check-in location, you would think that they would train their check-in clerks how to use computers. The check-in process took forever. But it could be that I was bad luck... and just got the slow clerk. But really IT WAS REALLY SLOW. After a long day on the road... It would be nice if they made the check in process less painful. 

Room service: We called for room service twice (for two separate requests), each time it took them more than 1 hour to show up? Really? 5 star hotel... come on. 

Room itself: GORGEOUS. We stayed in the 1-Bedroom (high up floor) with an amazing view of the Bellagio Fountain. It was just amazing. The rooms were trendy, high quality and nothing short of world class experience. I LOVED LOVED LOVED it.

I would say it's probably a one time thing but our friends were also staying at the hotel and had the same issue that Sunday. I doubt this incident would sway my decision to stay again, but when spending allot of money on a room every detail is important.

Most recent stay was over New Years week 2015\/16 (Arrived on December 30th, departed on Jan 4th).  Service was great from the Concierge and other employees we encountered, as it always has been.  The housekeeping staff was polite and friendly, leaving a couple extra towels at my request and remembering to do so on each service for the duration of our stay.

My removal of one star after this visit is due to the cleaning of the rooms.  This was a last-minute trip for us, and the rooms we normally would book were already taken for our arrival date.  No big deal, we took what they had and dealt with it.  

The first room (City Room) just seemed kind of ""grimy"".  Not really dirty, but certainly not as clean as we normally find upon arriving at The Cosmo... and our friends were in the adjoining room, so that was nice to be so close since they hadnt stayed here before.

Then we got our friends moved into a Terrace Suite so they could see a variety of the rooms offered here (and have a little more room to move about while in).  Again, it just wasnt as clean as our past visits have brought us to expect when arriving here.  

For our last night we were moved into the adjoining room (again) of our friends in the Terrace Suite.  There was dried puke splatter on the wall in the bathroom, the shower heads were coated and plugged with calcium\/hard water particles, among a few other things that were simply unexpected at a place I have stayed so many times at and raved about the cleanliness and service to my friends at home.

Having read some of the reviews, I will dispense with the usual raves and mention some of the things that I did not read about yet I think worth mentioning.  If you're a gambler, then you'll appreciate the subtle nuances.  

One is the fact that their table rules are a lot less restrictive.  They don't mind you showing your cards to your friends sitting next to you and offering, asking for, advice about how to play.  All the dealers, in my expericence.  seems to be a lot more relaxed and easy going.  Walking through the pits?  Not a problem either. 

Slot play?  It seems that I was more lucky there than any other in recent years.  They also have a portion of machine rounds that are slightly sectioned off by floor to ceiling beaded curtains that give it somewhat of a ""private"" feel.  Some card tables in that section are like that as well although I never did see those tables in play.

The spa & fitness centers are very impressive.  The spa, beautifully done, with the entry hallway reminiscent to cave-like walls complete with waterfall-like feature at the end.  Generous ammenities in both the shower and sitting room with a separate room with sleeper seats for relaxing.

The fitness center very well equipped with every machine you need and dumbells at least to 80lbs.  Spacious enough that you don't feel crowded either.   The fact that there's never really all that many people working out, makes it feel like your own private gym.

Their players card works pretty much the same as ""M Life"", or ""TotalRewards"" being able to use it for comps at various venues with the ability to add points to from purchasing meals or products.  One difference is that your room key doubles as your players card so that if you misplaced your players card somewhere, then you can use it instead.

Valet and bell service pretty decent as well.  Fairly quick and always friendly.  

Now for the Cons:  Least important was the buffet ""Wicked Spoon"".  The first time I was quite impressed.  After that however, I felt that there could definitely be a wider variety of choices.  The one item that impressed me the most was the ""Kalbi beef"".  Very delicious flavor and abundant supply to pick from and the Sushi, albiet small in size, was made in front of you as well.  There was also a nice ""Italian Ice"" bar for dessert.  Otherwise, there could've been a wider variety of other selections.

What disturbed me the most was the VIP lounge.  If you utilize it then be forewarned.  In their defense, It's been awhile since I've been there last so hopefully they've improved.  First was that in the same visit, the refrigerator with refreshments was moved from being accessible in the lounge area to behind the desk.  Even the Luxor VIP lounge has thier refrigerator easily accessed.  Worse was the incompetence of the staff.  Although friendly enough, there were a couple of incidents that perturbed me.  Even tho my hosts always sets up the limos, I always verify with the VIP desk before checkout.  I verified more than once only find out in the end that the time was incorrect.  Another was having told that a charge was to be taken off, only to find out that it wasn't at checkout.  

In short, it seemed communication and follow thru was a problem at the time.  Frustrating because it was never corrected even after having questioned said discrepancies and having been told that it was.  I wasn't the only one with a problem either.  While waiting my turn, I witnessed other unhappy exchanges.  If anything, the VIP staff should be the most competent, and obviously it wasn't.

Overall, great experience, if not for a few bumps in the road.",3,0,0

This place is astethically pleasing, but the staff are so incredibly rude. The gorgeous ambiance of the hotel (why it's getting 2 stars instead of 1) seems to effect the staff in that they are snobby, arrogant and the ""best of the best"".... in Vegas hotels means you are simply commonfolk and should appreciate and kiss their feet that you get the privilege to stay there. I was incredibly polite throughout my stay and did not deserve the way I was treated: 

I booked four standard city rooms for a Bachelorette party. I requested on the reservation that I made 6 MONTHS PRIOR to arriving that they be connected. Ok, I get that your hotel is busy, but really? How hard can that be when I made the reservation 6 months prior? I have plenty of friends that work in busy, ritzy hotels.. IT'S NOT THAT HARD. So all 15 of us hung out in the hotel for the day while we waited for our rooms to be ready. When I checked back at 5pm to see if they were ready, the staff informed me that because I made a request the rooms be connected, ""the room may be ready at 6pm... or 11pm tonight.. you never know, you ARE staying at the cosmopolitan, so we never know what time your rooms will be ready."" WTF? I didn't pay for four hotel rooms to be available at 11pm tonight and the attitude was completely unnecessary. The rooms became available at 7pm and they were split up all over the hotel. Awesome. 

The rooms - they were nice and clean, what you would expect. The food tray with the sensors (my favorite) on the tiny little table.. if you tap it, it sets all of the items off, so expect to pay for ALL OF THEM even if they aren't eaten\/used. I called down to have the tray removed due to this, and they told me that sending up a technician to remove it would be $30. Oh, and if you want a cord to hook-up your ipod? That technician is $25. Oh, and when you call down to customer service to deal with these issues? Expect the staff to also be rude and condescending; THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT does not apply to this hotel. 

For a special occasion, some hotels treat you better than their normal customers because someone is celebrating something special. Forget it here. This hotel is beautiful and I will come in to dine, go to the pool and the nightclub... but I will NEVER stay here again.",2,1,1

Every single person I interacted with at the Cosmo during my stay (receptionist, housekeeping staff, concierge, guest services, waitresses, lounge maître d', etc) was professional, courteous, and accommodating.

I do not have a single complaint from my numerous interactions with the personnel at the Cosmo.

The rooms were clean upon check-in (I checked all the nooks and crannies) and they were cleaned well every day of our stay.

I do not know if I had a renovated room, but the furnishings were all clean and in good condition.

I loved the views of the Bellagio fountain and the Strip; the spacious balcony is something I wished every hotel room should have.

The room itself is very large and has a kitchen with a full sized fridge.

The master bathroom had a roomy layout with a separate shower stall and bath tub.

The Chandelier Bar was amazing - you really feel like you're in the middle of a chandelier.  Great atmosphere, tasty drinks, waitresses in skimpy clothes - what more could you want in a Vegas casino bar?  Only issue: a few of my friends are cigar smokers and could only do so on level one.

The rooms are amazing.  My friend and I had a 2-queen room that was decorated beautifully and had a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  On a Thursday we were able to check in early at around 11AM no problem.  however a friend was staying in one of the more popular 1-bedroom suite rooms and that one didn't offer any early check in.  The suite was to die for beautiful though.  Private terrace patio, a deep soaking tub with a terrific window view.  It even had a dishwasher (not sure if that's standard or not).  My only complaint about the rooms is that they had a coffee machine, but you had to pay for the coffee from the minibar.

Ate lunch at Holstein's - great burgers and milkshakes (I had a burger called the Longhorn that had BBQ brisket on top of it - amazing!).   Had a yummy brunch at Henry's - the Cinnamon Roll French Toast was to die for!

The only reason I'm giving the Cosmo 4 stars instead of 5 is that gambling was definitely more expensive here than at other casinos (we went to Bellagio and Planet Hollywood to gamble).  Table minimums were mostly $25 and up, with tons of tables even higher - $50 and up.  But if you're a high roller or a non-gambler, that won't be a problem.

What kills me is that we were asked upon check-in if we wanted east or west tower room. WTF, the young lady who checked us in could have mentioned that the music would be blaring all night long (very unprofessional in my opinion). The Cosmo should provide all guests staying on the East side facing the pool an Ambien at the least ;) 

It is RIDICULOUS that the Cosmo assumes that guests would be okay with the blaring music all night long.

The bad? Very first time stayed at this property, the hotel management was still working out the quirks. They changed the room key when I was still staying in the property and thus I got locked out.

Gaming - 1 star
They just don't know how to treat their players. One instance the bet was made and the pitboss straight up waived off the bet AFTER I won. Complained, talked to the managers and nothing happened.

It had two queen beds, a couch, a huge bathroom, large space balcony with couches outside for you to sit on, and a little counter with kitchen amenities (sink, microwave, dish washer, fridge). We were able to fit two people per bed, one on the couch, and one on a blow up mattress we brought and were able to fit in this large space by the balcony in front of the beds. Even with the blow up mattress, we still had a lot of space to walk! So you can only imagine how big this room is! Stayed for 5 nights and ended up paying about $390 a person at the end of the stay. Not bad for a weekend which usually has higher hotel rates! We stayed at Caesar last year for EDC for the same number of nights and paid more for only half the amount of space, tiny bathroom, and no kitchen area... so we are definitely more satisfied with our selection of the cosmopolitan this time around! 

The Cosmo is very conveniently located in the middle of the strip, and right across the street from planet Hollywood and Walgreens!! Very useful for when you need supplies. They don't have a food court inside the Cosmo like they do at Caesars for you to go to whenever you're hungry, but there's a food court in planet hollywood so still nicely located across the street! Cosmo has a lot of restaurants inside though. So if you don't want quick pick me ups at food courts, there's definitely plenty of sit down restaurants for you to try inside the Cosmo. 

We ended up having no space for our food\/drinks in the fridge (half the fridge is filled with hotel snacks and drinks, don't touch them or you'll get charged hefty prices!) so we were given an option to either have everything in the fridge that belonged to the hotel removed for $25 (one time charge, not daily charge :] ) or be given a brand new fridge for $25 (one time charge, not daily charge :] ). That's pretty awesome! So of course we ordered a second fridge. 

Our balcony was facing the non-strip view and on the 57th floor. And we loved it! Because after a day of partying, coming back to a nice quiet room with an awesome view was definitely a must. Staying on the strip side gets quite noisy, and when you finally want to sleep you won't be able to since you'll hear the continuous late night partying from the street. So definitely pick non-strip view if you'd like some quiet by the end of your night! It's cheaper too!

There are two swimming pools at the cosmopolitan. The ""bamboo pool"" which is smaller, quieter, and more for families, is located on the 4th floor of the west end tower where we stayed. They have two bars there and I ordered one of their specialty drinks, a berry mojito. REALLY good, definitely try that! It was really strong, gave me a good buzz, but you couldn't taste the alcohol at all! The second pool is called the ""boulevard pool"", located in the east side tower of the Cosmo. This pool is more ""vegas like""... Faces the strip. Huge and fancy! With music playing, a restaurant beside it, pool tables, large multi TV screen sitting area, open glass balconies that look out over the strip, and two bars. This is definitely a better pool for younger ppl that enjoy the Vegas party atmosphere. Don't forget your hotel key because you need it to access this pool.

Didn't have time to find the secret 24 hour pizza place inside the Cosmo, but know that it exists! And that apparently the pizza is really good! :)",2,1,2

One thing I really like about this hotel is that they have a giant LED screen outside the hotel that shows you all the main events going on live and Girl Talk was no exception.

The entire hotel is VERY swanky and has so much art and other cool stuff to stupidly gawk at (ie: the three story Chandelier Bar which is made with $30 million worth of real crystals. No wonder everybody complains about Vegas' economy-maybe you shouldn't spend that much building a bar lol). The location is also very awesome. My only gripe is that this place is definitely way out of my budget (probably to help pay for that bar haha). Good luck trying to find a table for less than $50 on the weekends.

I felt like such a grown-up staying at this hotel but I mean that in the best possible way. The Cosmo has it going on when it comes to great service and minding all the details! The casino located on the main floor is sprawling with a nice variety of games. They do make an effort to keep the riff raff out which is nice.  The 2nd floor has all the stores which are the typical hotel-boutiquey stores. There are very unique stores tho which was a nice change. The third floor is where all the restaurants are and if you are good at exploring, you'll find the Secret Pizza place! :) The Wicked Spoon buffet is one of the most amazing buffets I've ever been to. 

Now for the rooms. Our room was so posh and beautiful. Lush fabrics, super soft pillows, a fabulous sitting area, and jets in the bath tub. A-Maz-Ing! We had a beautiful view of the strip from our room and my favorite part was how quiet it was at night. It was a busy weekend in Vegas but you'd never know with the quality of the noise reducing walls and doors! 

The staff was so friendly and genuinely nice. Such a nice change from other Vegas hotels where the staff barely looks at you. They truly made you feel at home in the hotel and no request was too big.

Let me preface this by saying the only reason I could afford to stay here was scoring a killer deal with Marriott's ""Look no further gurantee"". It ended up being cheaper than the Monte Carlo.

Fom the moment I checked in until I got in the cab to go home, the service here was impeccable. Every single staff member was incredibly nice. The hotel is gorgeous, had everything I needed for amenities, and the shops & restaurants are very well curated to serve upscale but younger clientele. I think it's a good fit for the post-college, young professional, not-The Hangover-wannabe crowd. (of course, the nightclub & pool party kids are a difference scene. I wouldn't judge the hotel based on that.) I could've stayed in the resort the entire time and would've been perfectly happy.

You can find tons of information about the cool rooms, so I won't get into that. But everyone mentions the peek-a-boo shower and forgets to add that there are optional blinds to cover it up. I want to point that out just in case you are going with friends and are nervous about that. My room was on the ""57th"" floor (does this hotel really have 75 stories?) and I didn't have any problems with the elevator that other people mentioned. 

Everything was perfect. Quick tips: 1) Use the Marriott ""Look No Further"" guarantee if you can. 2) Sign up for the Identity membership because for every $100 you spend in the hotel, you earn $5 back. Plus there are sign-up bonuses. I got a $15 zappos gc!",5,0,0

My mom received a free room to stay at Cosmo Hotel this past weekend and decided to give the room to me instead because when she started to play, she didn't feel comfy and it felt the gambling vibe wasn't on her side.  I was like SCORE!

When you walk inside, it looks like a million bucks.  Everything looks over the top. When we got into the room, it was like wow, this is cool.  Not as big as Palazzo but still big.  The view is AMAZING from the balcony.  It has a microwave, small fridge and dishwasher along with 2 TVs.  Its like a great place to have a party.

SKANKY OR KINKY PART:
From the bedroom side, there are blinds you can lift to see a person showering or taking a bath.  You cannot even lock the blinds.  So note, if you are coming here for a bachelor\/bachelorette party, there will be some type of skanky photos of you taken if you take a shower or bath. Or if you plan on filming a porno, this spot is for you.  Not great for groups but great for 2 people celebrating or if you plan on filming a porno or sex tape. HAHAHA 

Their buffet for brunch is fab and tasty.  No crab legs though. $23 for weekend brunch.

Cheap eats, there is a pizzeria on the 3rd floor on the East end next to the sushi restaurant, $3 for a slice of cheese pizza.

The purple and silver glitzy tones really captured my eyes and I loved the way the hotel looked at night. We ate at the Henry just for breakfast one day- good food. We utilized the Boulevard pool- fabulous! I was absolutely not a fan of Marquee pool. The bartender Damian was excellent at the Marquee pool party. The drinks were delicious. I didn't like that there was limited seating if you didn't purchase table service. We didn't select bottles because the weather was not cooperating. Now the cons- very quiet casino. Too much euro trash. I know that's not too nice but I felt like I was in the Gannsevort and being from NYC I was looking to avoid that exact meatpacking crowd. Nothing was remotely inexpensive as far as quick eats. No place just to grab a quick bagel. Egg sandwich at Va Bene 13 bucks. Insanity. Definitely recommend eating in Aria instead if you're looking to party all day. The hotel should also open a Illy coffee stand similar to some of the big hotels. I'm pretty sure Caesar's had several quick grab and go places for food and within a reasonable price point.  The other cons- I seen several rowdy disgusting vomit episodes once in the elevator bank and once outside the normal pool. Yuck. Security should look to diminish that scene more. Also 17.25 at Vesper bar for a martini is absolutely insane. I live in NYC drinks are not that pricey here. I feel like I shouldn't focus on the money aspect, but it was cheaper at STK to have a martini. However, I kept going back to Vesper because it was the best martini I ever drank in my life. So I spent 3 days at that bar. Amazing bartenders, but it truly lacks in other areas. I wouldn't stay there again but I would do a visit for a nice calm night\/lounge atmosphere.

The casino has nothing but good vibes, which is why I also enjoy gambling there. Other than that, I enjoy their Book & Stage area. FREE concerts!

There is a kitchenette stocked with a microwave and refrigerator\/freezer. There is a ""guest"" bathroom with a shower. There is a living area with a tv. Then there's a room with a king sized bed and a huge bathroom with shower and tub.  The rooms are well kept. They stock you with C.O. Bigelow toiletries.  What I don't get about this room is that it's 1 bed with 2 bathrooms. The sofa is not a pullout. 

You have access to the balcony through the bedroom or living area. I can watch the Bellagio water show all day. Apparently there's twenty something different shows.

I had room service a couple of times. The cheeseburger and fries were so good!  It's pricey but worth it. We even called the hotel as we were walking back from Bellagio so that we wouldn't have to wait long when we got to the room.  Gratuity is included in the bill. 

Overall, I think the hotel and rooms are nice and clean. 

The casino itself isn't too bad. There is a good variety of slot machine games. Table minimums are a bit high.  The cocktail waitresses are slow here. It takes forever to get drinks.

Awesome luxury and modern hotel for the ultra cool and hip. The Cosmo has become my favorite hotel on the Vegas strip. It even beats out the Bellagio that I stayed in couple of years ago.

The design of this hotel is just amazing and it will tantalize all your senses. The most noticeable aspect is The Chandelier Lounge and bar as it covers the lobby with a giant crystal curtain, which creates a sense of an inhabited chandelier. The location is perfect sitting in the middle of the strip. The views from most of the suites are unbeatable as you get a perfect spot to watch the Bellagio fountains and front of the Paris hotel. It has a top notch club, Marquee; awesome Lounge, Bond; and one of the best buffets, Wicked Spoon. Need I say more?

The service is excellent from check-in to check-out. As we entered the lobby to check-in , I saw long lines. But, I was immediately greeted by a very young and attractive lady in a tight black dress offering complimentary bottles of water, nice move Cosmo! Moments later some dude with a cool ipad took our info to expediated the check-in process. All the staff was friendly and helpful.

We had the standard suite and didn't bother to upgrade to the ones with the balconies and kitchenettes. I love the touch screen phone that can control the climate conditions, LCD, music, alarm, and all lights. They even have a ""pillow butler"" that will provide you with a down,memory foam, gel, ergonomic or body pillow. One unusual thing I noticed in the room was a large window between the shower and bedroom with a curtain controlled on the bedroom side. I guess it could be a little weird if you were sharing a room with just a ""friend"" but you could easily get your freak on if you were with someone more then a friend.

I highly recommended eating at the Secret Pizza and Wicked Spoon buffet in this hotel and check out the sexy go-go dancers at The Bond lounge at night.

I'll definitely come back here next time unless they make a better hotel in the future. It would have been perfect if they offered free wifi instead of paying $15 for 24 hour access. 

Top notch friendly service and ultra cool atmosphere deserves 5 stars.",16,10,12

Booking a wraparound terrace suite and a connecting one bedroom suite with the Bellagio view seemed like a very good way to experience Vegas for the first time. 

Checking in was quite a story because they had me shuffle around my cards and put the deposit I had back into my bank account for no apparent reason. We finally got our room keys on the 61st floor. The one bedroom suite was available and we were waiting on the connecting wraparound terrace suite. I received a text message that the room was ready but on the 17th floor. I was a bit confused with being on the 61st and the 17th floor when I booked and reserved connecting suites. Get this it wasn't even the Bellagio view that we paid for four months in advance.

I called the front desk to see what was going on and was notified that we can switch from the 61st floor to the 18th and the 17th floor. That was the best they can do, so I took the offer and started gathering my things. I get a phone call in our room about two minutes later saying that we can have both the wraparound terrace suite and the one bedroom suite on the same floor, the 18th. But the the problem still was that we did not have the connecting suites and did not have the Bellagio view we booked four months in advance. 

I spoke to the Supervisor of the front desk and told me that this was the best thing he can do and only take $40 a night off our bill. No amenities or anything to accommodate that we were hustling around The Cosmopolitan from floor to floor and we didn't get what we reserved and paid for.

I went here to spend my 21st birthday (it is a MUST) here with some friends and family and I have to say, staying at the Cosmo was the best choice ever.

It didn't start off smoothly though, they placed me in the Terrace One Bedroom without the premium view and switched me to another one facing the City Center. One problem - the room wasn't entirely clean.

Called the front desk and got transferred over to a lovely young lady (whose name I wil not state) who upgraded me to the TWO BEDROOM SUITE THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR REGULAR GUESTS.

That room is the size of an apartment if not LARGER. I almost wanted to spend my entire 3 days there in my suite but of course, I didn't. 

The rooms alone just FEEL fresh. It is nice to know you are sleeping in a bed that hasn't been there for over a year. 

The staff is friendly and consistently called to ensure that everything in my room was right seeing that I was switched a total of 3 times.

To make the trip even better they sent 2 complementary mojitos and chocolate covered strawberries up to my suite :] Talk about amazing customer service!

If you're going to go to Vegas, you must go big or go home. With that being said, everything in the Cosmopolitan is more expensive than in other hotels I have stayed at. 

Room service, restaurants, you name it, it'll seem a bit more pricy; however, this is the newest hotel on the strip with the best chic looking casino floor anyone can imagine.

A word about Marquee, IT IS A MUST. Arrive early and get on the guest list.

I don't know how it would feel if I were standing in that ridiculous line, but I can imagine you wouldn't be buzzed by the time you get in. Lucky for us, we had the connections and went straight in :]

Decor\/vibe 
The decor is Great Gatsby meets a modern sleek and chic aesthetic. You can see the 1920's inspiration in the lobby bar, antique phones and stylistic patterns which is discrete between the gigantic led displays, glittering fixtures and interesting shiny objects. Like most things in Vegas it's one bedazzle away from a tacky Liberace nightmare but The Comsopolitan pulls it off making for a hip, fun and very chic vibe. It's perfect for an upscale but party-focused vacation. 

The Rooms
**tip**. The rooms facing the pool on the east side tower provide for a perfect viewing spot for concerts. From our 22nd floor balcony with had a perfect view of Haim. Even better we got to watch them rehearse which was like a free private show! This was all of our favorite feature of the hotel and the trip. The rooms themselves are of average size and decorated in an eccentric but chic fashion. The bathroom was very cool with a view outside the hotel and a hot tub and large shower. This being said the bathroom is not ideal for groups of women getting ready as the counter space is limited and there is a only a glass door separating the shower from the sink area. Full length mirrors are outside the bathroom so your can get ready in that area. 

Service
The service was impeccable. We got a free room upgrade and checking in was a breeze. They brought up several items requested with no fees. Even better upon checkout there were some incorrect minibar charges as we rearranged the fridge. It took less than 2 minutes for me to get the charges removed and checked out. 

Pool
This is the most disappointing feature of the hotel. The first pool on the westside was insanely packed. The larger pool, restricted to guests was also quite busy and we had a hard time finding 3 spots even on a weekday. The look is very chic and modern and unlike other Vegas pools I saw no women in bikinis and heels (who does that?) and no super obnoxious bro-fests. The cool in water lounge chairs were a wonderful novelty.

Food
We had lunch at the Henry which had unreal sandwiches, literally one of the best Rubens ever. We had dinner at Scarpetta which was pretty good but I'm sure there are better in Vegas.  While I didn't get to eat at Jose Andres restaurants here, I love the Jaleo outpost in DC and his very upscale lounge barmini had the best drinks\/snacks of my life so I'm sure e would be insanely delicious.

It was very beautiful inside, loved the silver look and how even the outside building glistened in the sun perfectly.  
I stayed around the Race and Book area, but didn't bet on horse racing or anything. The Canucks-Bruins game was about to come on and one of the big TV screens was about to come down but there was actually some kind of rock group playing at the time before 5 pm Vegas time.

***This hotel and casino area did smell really good too for some reason, haha. I know that is something funny to say but it is true. I doubt I would even stay here, I bet it is very pricey to get a room.  Maybe just visit Marquee the club next time, day or night.

  I don't know why but I never did get the time to head back here the rest of my trip.  I did love all the beautiful ladies I saw here as well.  They were dressed up very fashionable and all, they also seemed like they were hotel guests here just playing in the poker area and also by the Race and Book Area.
I hope to see this place again next time I come back to the area. I wanna see the hotness and beauty again. It sucks too I did not get to meet up with one of my twitter buddies. She works at the place I guess as a chef.  We didn't get to co-ordinate anything and would've been cool to catch up for a bit IRL, I guess. Not in NY I guess.",1,0,0

Felt like a million dollars walking through this place.  You can definitely tell this place is a step above all the other hotels.

(For those that aren't so lucky, you can check your bags at the bell desk.) I really, really enjoyed my stay here, from the room itself to the rest of the hotel. From our room, we had a view of the Bellagio water fountains and caught the water show during the afternoon with some rainbows coming through -- gorgeous. The beds were super comfy (including the pillows, which I usually have complaints about at other hotels), as was the shower -- loved the shower head. Modern, artsy interior. And the rest of the hotel had a lot to offer too -- several bars and lounges, Marquee nightclub, 3 pools (though there is an $80 minimum to have any chair at the Marquee dayclub), restaurants (burgers at Holsteins were delicious), and shops. I see a lot of complaints on service from other reviewers, but I had no problems (I also only dealt with staff while checking in though).",0,0,0

When it's 4am and I have to walk to the Bellagio to play some poker, I'd rather head back to the room and play poke her.


Yeah, I may be over reacting a bit but if you're supposedly a 5-star hotel\/casino you should act like one. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the decor and feel of the hotel and would head back to visit, but the casino left me wanting more.

It's located on the strip at the beautiful City Center next to Aria and Vdara, across from Planet Hollywood and opposite of Bellagio. (Depending on where your room is, you could also see the Bellagio fountains!)  This hotel is swanky and modern, and definitely the most beautiful hotel on the strip (so far).  From crystal chandeliers to artwork to drapery, the decor throughout the hotel and casino is simply gorgeous.  If you plan to club at Marquee Dayclub or Nightclub, it's located on the 3rd floor of the hotel.

The rooms are actual rooms (vs. some hotels whose smallest room is a suite), but you get of amenities for what you pay for!  We stayed in a City Room which had a huge bathroom, comfortable bed, and the softest bathrooms and slippers -- ever!  As for the casino, it's a bit smaller than other casinos, but I (surprisingly) didn't spend a lot of time on the floor during this trip so I didn't mind.

The service throughout our stay was friendly and efficient, housekeeping definitely took care of our rooms for us when we were gone, and the room service food was tasty.  There's a ton of dining and drinking options available throughout the hotel as well.  The only negative was the $28\/night resort fee (such an odd number) which we didn't really benefit out of because we were too hungover to go to the gym or pool most days.

Bottom Line - The hotel and amenities are slightly below par with the rest of the Strip hotels of the supposedly same caliber.  I would say that the issues we discuss below drive the rating far below the expectations.  

Issue 1: Booking Information - During the booking process we were given 6 variations of details regarding the pool situation.  Our intent was to determine the type and access to all of the pools, including the Marquee.  The information varied from an adult topless pool availability, to pay only access on the weekends.  With other hotels we have typically been comped and\/or pool access is included.  This confusion almost led to our room cancellation, and ultimately required a lengthy conversation in person with the concierge.  We were finally comped access, but after much grief.

Issue 2: Security Timeliness - I knew I would be traveling with a firearm and called ahead to verify security would be able to store the weapon during my stay. Upon my arrival it took nearly 30 minutes for the front staff to determine the right course of action for storing my firearm. One security was notified it took nearly 45 minutes for an individual to meet me at the front desk in order to check my firearm into the safe. Again upon retrieval of my firearm following the completion of our stay I called ahead 30 minutes to ensure security would meet me at the front counter at precisely 0900 since we were on a tight timeline for departure; no one arrived. After waiting an additional 10 minutes I had to prompt the front staff to call security and verify that they were on their way with my firearm further delaying our departure.

Issue 3: Luggage Damage\/Smoke Damage - during our departure we requested a bellhop, who was very timely and attentive to our needs, to gather our luggage and transfer it to our vehicle.following the return of my firearm we probably received our luggage and loaded into the vehicle to continue on our 12 hour drive to Colorado.  It wasn't until about a half hour into our drive that my wife, who is severely allergic to smoke, noted a distinct smell  coming from our luggage. For the next 11 1\/2 hours we had to deal with sneezing and congestion on  our drive home, a medical hardship that has continued for more than five days now. To top off our concerns we now have to have our luggage and vehicle decontaminated for the smoke that continues to linger, to include replacement of the vehicle air filtration system.

We have made contact with a representative of the hotel but have not heard back yet; we would love to hear back from a senior manager to further discuss our issues.",0,0,0

The hotel staff is more than great. One of our friends left a watch behind after we checked out, and by the time she realized she may have possibly left her watch, it was about an hour later and we checked out already. We called lost and found, and they said we can come to the hotel and speak to front desk to get another key. For some strange reason, the concierge didn't know that the maid service cleaned our room and reissued another key for us to check. We went inside and saw that it was already made up but found a couple of ladies In the hall who helped us. They were able to confirm there was a watch, and after showing them proof (picture) what her watch looked like, they have it to us right away. It was stored in a large ziplock bag to bring to security. We were so grateful because the lady was so honest, and that speaks volumes about her character. She could have easily said we didn't leave any watches behind and how could we confirm that? My friend wasn't really sure where she last seen it. 

In general, the hotel staff was courteous and very friendly. The rooms were very clean and the bed was comfortable. We also had a beautiful room overlooking the city on the 49th floor. While the ""basic"" rooms are much smaller than the Palazzo suites, I felt like the Cosmo hotel was really modern and beautiful, and in a much busier part of the strip. It felt a lot more intimate and cozy, with nicer views and nice bath products. The hotel is much more trendy and has a very upscale feel. There is a lot of different restaurants and a really pretty casino. People here seem a bit more younger, like in their 20s and 30s while other hotels seem to have a much older crowd.

Poop! Poop under the bed!!!!! 
We walked in the room only to find the mattress sliding off the bedframe, with a brownish mark trailing down to the floor - and there goes the POOP. I am attaching a picture of it. 
Here's what made everything worse:
-Called to complain, and all they did was to change our room to the same one on a different floor
-I said I wanted to discuss this further but the lady on the phone said ""sorry we are having a lot of complaints being called in at this moment"" .. 
-No assistance in moving our belongings whatsoever, when our room was located in the very end of the corner and we had to go down to the lobby and change the elevator because they have different elevators for different floors..and the room they reassigned us to was further into the corner than the original one.. 
-I asked if I could talk to the manager. They say he will be waiting for us at our new room. It's been 2 hours since.. Okay..
Anyhow, POOP under the hotel bed is NOT AT ALL acceptable. And the mattress was moved too! Shows that they tried to clean it up but were like ehh not worth it. Really?? I would give this place negative thousand stars if I could. I don't care about its beautiful amenities. Hotel rooms are supposed to be a private space where you should feel safe, relaxed, clean.

I chose to upgrade to a terrace king room with a view of the fountains and oh man. It was totally worth it. The room was HUGE, clean, and the bathroom was just.. insane. I could have basically lived in there. The balcony was so big and we had an amazing view of the fountains at all times. The room was on the side of the building too so the sun never hit us directly to fry us.
When we first checked in, the receptionist was super friendly and gave us a map. Which let's be real, the place is huge and we still got lost multiple times.
I'm not really into gambling but being able to go down the elevator and into the casino right away (a really nice looking one too) is just so convenient. 
The crowd is definitely more on the trendy\/classier side. Which I'm completely okay with thank you very much. I think we spent most of our weekend hitting all the bars and restaurants just in the hotel. And we were just fine with that.

Service:
Baggage service and room service were exceptional (BTW, the room service food is super delicious). Employees were friendly and welcoming. I didn't have any interaction with the front desk workers.

Room:
Beautiful rooms with massive and luxurious bathrooms. Beds were on cushy and on point. My favorite part about the room? The balcony and the view. Can't.Be.Beat. 

Hotel:
Prime location on the Strip! Marquee is right downstairs and so is the yummy yummy Wicked Spoon buffet. I also love the interior decorations throughout the Cosmo, like that one giant gorgeous chandelier that hangs over a bar, or those dog statues. Lol.

Overall:
Awesome hotel. I feel like it is definitely suited towards a more younger and 'hip' crowd (i.e. compared to the Palazzo - see my review!) though it is still great for people of all ages.

My flight to Vegas got cancelled, and I went from an itinerary of arriving at 1pm to 10pm. Upon check in I was put in room 1533 of the west end tower. Exhausted from multiple airplane changes from Oakland to Ontario to Vegas, I was very happy to finally arrive in my room (bonus points for having ambient music playing). 

As far as price goes, I had very high expectations for this room considering I booked in low season and still spent around $1000 (maybe more) for the weekend stay. This room met those expectations and I cannot complain. This is quite possibly one of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in. The bed was extremely comfortable (granted I only spent 6hrs on it the whole weekend) and the room size was superb (bar area, separate living room, 2 full bathrooms, and a balcony with a great view). 

We had a party of 10 people staying all over the strip and this room was the perfect spot for everyone to meet in. The seperate living room \/ open bar area gave plenty of space for everyone in our group to be seated and get comfortable. The tv's have auxiliary inputs so you can hook up your own music. Have a big party and need a place to meet? This is the room. Need a place to pregame without people feeling cramped? This is the room. Need a good night's sleep? C'mon, you're in Vegas, no one sleeps in this place. 

It's the little things that we take for granted that seperate this hotel from any other. From personalized key cards and tv greetings to auxiliary cords for your music.

We stayed at the terrace suite which was very pleasant. The rooms are elegantly designed, but still have the contemporary feel. And the balcony view of the strip was definitely the best part. The only downside was that we were stuck on the 24th floor of a 50+ floor building. 

Guest services was excellent. Every time we requested towels, room cleaning, etc, they arrived in no time. They were also really nice and didn't sit around awkwardly expecting to receive tips (though we did tip them!). The only time they messed up was when we left the room a bit messy and they didn't clean it up completely.. they probably assumed we didn't want our stuff moved around, but still should have tidied up the place more. The front desk staff was also pretty good.. Had terrible issues with marquee nightclub, and the resort manager tried to help the best she could, but couldn't bc they are an outsourced company. 

The casino could use a bit of work. Many dealers weren't the most friendly, and the floor staff wasn't so helpful when you try to ask for directions and what not. Note: there is NO poker room.

First, we checked into our first room at 1:30! Yay, one room was ready! and our 2nd room was suppose to be the connecting room next door, but.. that didn't end up happening. :( our 2nd room was not ready until 6:15pm and wasn't even the connecting room! 

And in our 2nd room we didn't have shampoo or conditioner!! So I had to call for them to bring it up but it took them 1 hour to do so because the runner was all backed up! Aye mi. That was just the beginning... Then we called to go to Marque and the concierge put us down, but later we found out from a promoter the club wasn't even open that night! (Thursday on 4th of July!) only one of the rooms (Boombox, which isn't the main one) was open! The concierge failed to tell us that! 

Anyways, I don't want to keep complaining BUT I will say for a luxury hotel, their staff from the receptionist desk to the concierge, to the security that didn't know where things was or how much the buffet cost all need some training. On the job training is NOT enough! I think for this price, the room and staff definitely could have been better. I would stay at an older but more experienced hotel.

Hope this helps!",10,3,3

Pros:
1) The rooms are big and the view of the Bellagio fountain and strip from the terrace studio that we got, was truly sensational. 
2) The shower and bathroom are very spacious and well-designed. 
3) The Marquee nightclub is one of the trendiest and Wicked Spoon buffet is top notch as well. The chandelier bar is quite exquisite as well.
4) Pink's Hotdogs and a fully-stocked Walgreen's situated right across the strip.
Cons:
1) Self-Park at this hotel: We could not have gone wrong with the price (self-parking in every casino on the Vegas strip is free). However, the design of the garage itself is what is a complete disaster. It is a labyrinthine maze with blind and narrow mini intersections every 10 yards and traffic coming from both directions. This place is just begging for a fender bender to happen. We drove to practically every casino on the strip and none of the garages came close to this.      
2) No coffee maker in the room. This was a big thumbs down honestly.
3) Service was super-slow. We asked for two coffee cups and it took room service about two hours to show up.
4) Other top casinos (such as Venetian, Mirage, Bellagio and even Aria) usually have some freebee attractions for the public. Cosmopolitan seems to have attached a price tag to everything.

A few years ago I traveled to California with some girl friends and one guy. We all stayed in the same room. He'd told us he was gay which turned out to be a lie. He was straight and just wanted to sneak some peeks at us in the nude. Brian, if you are still pulling that stunt then this is the hotel for you.

When the sliding bathroom door is rolled shut, it is made so there is a big gap and someone on the outside of the door can peer in and get a full view of anyone sitting on the toilet. Worse, there is a big bay glass window in the bathroom which looks out into the rest of the room. There is also a a set of window blinds. However, the blinds are on the outside of the bathroom so anyone in the bedroom area can open them (or peek beneath the slats) and get a full view of everything... the toilet, shower and whirlpool tub. Maybe you all don't have a buddy like I did but many have friends and family members who like to snap indiscreet photos or videos and post them online so BEWARE!

This also isn't a room for kids. There is a stocked mini-fridge that has mechanisms where if you move an item for more than 30 seconds it is charged to your room. There is also the same mechanism on the counter where the same thing happens if you move one of the many snacks. It would be too easy for little hands to grab a number of treats in no time at all. 

Another reason these rooms are absolutely horrible for kids is because of one of the nicest features... the open balcony we had overlooking the strip with lounge chairs where you can relax and take in an incredible view. There are some bars set along the balcony's wall, I assume so a tipsy adult won't topple over or to impede the same thing from happening to even a sober person leaning over too far trying to take a photo. But those bars are like a jungle gym to a kid and one could easily and quickly climb up and over.

It's a beautiful hotel and room, the whirlpool tub was quiet even though it had powerful jets, and the bed was incredibly comfortable but some of the staff seemed dull. The free wi-fi didn't work nor did the helpdesk number. When I called the front desk about this the girl kept saying ""uhhhhh"" and finally said she'd send maintenance up who probably couldn't have helped if they'd even shown up which they didn't.

5 Stars if you want to play sexy peek-a-boo games from your room into the bathroom (funny... looking out across the balcony at Planet Hollywood  there is a gigantic mural of Holly Madison promoting Peep Show).

5 Stars if you want to peer in on someone in the bathroom without them knowing.

5 Stars if you like to be leered at while in the bathroom and pretend you don't know anyone is looking.

4 Stars if you want to stay in a beautiful trendy hotel with luxurious accommodations and a walk-on balcony with an excellent view of the strip...to hell with the cost.

1 Star if you relish privacy in your room from the other occupants.

0 Stars for kids (not safe).",5,5,1

The design of The Cosmopolitan is fantastic, and the layout works well, very well situated in the center of the strip and I had a great view from my 56th floor terrace.  

Overall it's certainly on the upper end of Vegas hotels.  I loved the Bond bar, very comfortable and great for people watching, and all of the lounges are very comfortable.  I didn't go to Marque, I'm not a ""clubber"" but I did see a lot of very attractive young ladies dressed in very provocative outfits standing in line for the club, so I'm sure it's a very class place.  Or they were all hookers.  Either way, good times.

Having said that, there were a few things that just seemed odd about the hotel that didn't really bother me (I'm not high maintenance), but for what is supposed to be a high end hotel, it just seemed weird that:

- the bedroom TV didn't work
- there was a light out in the bathroom
- one day housekeeping didn't make the bed
- they didn't replenish the shampoo and soap bottles until we asked
- the wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling off
- the shower water didn't get very hot and cooled off very quickly

Again, minor things, just seemed weird for such a high class place.  I'd probably overall give it 3.5 stars, and since we can't do half stars on Yelp (minus a star for you Yelp) I'd lean towards 3 stars, HOWEVER, I'll kick it up to 4 stars because....

The Sahra spa is EXQUISITE.  It's absolutely fantastic, one of the best I've ever been to.  I had a facial and a Hamman body treatment and my therapist for the Hamman treatment, Dawn, was awesome.  Just a flawless facility, great jaccuzi, steam room, sauna, the Hamman room was great, a very relaxing and comfortable spa experience.  Plenty of space, never too crowded in the locker room or any of the areas. 

All in all a good experience at The Cosmopolitan, it's not up to the level of say, the Wynn\/Encore or The Palazzo or Ceasar's, or The Bellagio, but a nice place.",2,3,2

Great, diverse selection...from Korean food to Pho to pork\/sweet potato hash comfort food Americana. Just really good food. Bloody Mary's (an extra cost) were worth it - our server was really nice and made it double spicy as I had requested. Great dessert options too. I can't say enough good things about the buffet at Wicked Spoon. 

Only thing I did not like was the whole Identity thing. My boyfriend won $10 credit with our free spin but when we sat down at the slots, it took all the credits without us doing anything...

The place tries to be hip. And it succeeds, without being too posy or too fake-feeling. It feels like a young, hip, modern, ultra-cool hotel for young professionals, grown-up hipsters and just people with a really cool vibe. I saw a lot of kinda-skinny jeans on the guys here BUT it was done in a tasteful way. 

The place also gets a thumbs up for having Hendricks Gin - my favorite. The Chandelier Bar was also pretty cool. I really liked that the Canton Gaming had Rugby Sevens games listed, and the supervisor changed one of the big screens to show the rugby games at our request. It wasn't too packed and the employees at the gaming place were so nice and accommodating - they asked us questions about rugby and rules - just trying to learn more about the sport. They were very, very nice to us...and it was genuine, not 'oh-let's-be-nice-so-we-can-get-tipped' business that's prevalent in other places!

We did well on the slots and on roulette so I can't complain about the customer service. The dealers were all very nice.

Although, they recently changed a few small things in their rooms. This hotel still feels new  and is a perfect example of a modern Las Vegas hotel. The first time I stayed here was a year within the opening of the hotel. Cosmo had awesome gizmos throughout the hotel and even the rooms. Some of the rooms now don't have the controls of lights and room temp on the hotel room phone hub anymore though, maybe  it was just damaged in the that room( possibly the hotel decided to take them out but those were pretty awesome). 

The hotel does not smell like old Vegas hotels with cigarette stench. The staff and concierge are amazing. The hotel buffet is also a must when you're trying to nurse a hangover from the night before! The pool can definitely also help with that.

This is unfortunate, because I really want to like this hotel, as it is beautiful and has a lot going for it.  This hotel has an irresistable allure and charm, but no allure or charm could make up for the bad experiences that came with them.  Everything here was so varied, and overall so disturbing, that I would really need to hear that things have changed before ever considering staying here again.  

The bad is so ridiculously bad that I have to mention it first.  The Marque day\/night-club were both impossible to get into and yet impossible to avoid...  I was staying on the 40th floor of the East tower and I could hear and literally feel the music loud and clear from my room any time it was playing, with my door shut.  I understand that this is more of a party hotel, and I understand and like good loud music in this environment.  But the hotel ROOM needs to be a solace if I want it to be.  No exceptions at $350+\/night.  The part making this truly unbearable is that the music started at 9:30 in the MORNING.  Apparently such is the norm there.  I wouldn't even mind if it went to 4am, but starting right back up again at 9:30 is just stupid.  Start with something ambient, or more low-key.  It's the morning, and I am flabbergasted that any DJ really believes that playing electro\/trance at that volume in the morning is really the right thing to do, vegas or not.  The worst part is that looking over the balcony at that hour wondering what was happening, I was shocked to see that nobody but employees were even there.  It was all for ME..  I think that the hotel allowing this is stupid, trashy, and highly ignorant.

On the other hand, as I mentioned, it was impossible (for me) to get into the actual club.  This was because I was wearing what appeared to be sneakers to a clueless bouncer who I would venture to say had more of a problem with my sexual orientation than a respect for the dress code.  My partner and I were at first literally 'shooed' (no pun intended) away by the man working at the guest entrance because he didn't feel like we belonged at this club.  This made me furious, because my shoes were $400 and definitely NOT sneakers.  And, by the way, other people getting in were wearing much grungier shoes than mine.  I was so angry that I had to leave the hotel before I made matters worse.  This kind of seemingly sexist (all girls got in) and rude treatment is NOT something I deserve after shelling out GOOD MONEY to stay here as a guest.  It is simply UNACCEPTABLE.  I have never been treated like this at any club anywhere.  

These two things really disappointed me.  But furthermore, the overall organization of the hotel seemed amature, which many others on this site have reflected.  I could have overlooked small quirks in their new system, but my major issues kept me awake and aggravated for a large part of my stay.  

Don't expect quick service, don't expect kind service, don't expect to get in the nightclub....  Don't expect anything here except to spend lots of money.  Though some people are quick, nice, and helpful, it was not consistent at all.

Finally, a little good.  

The blackjack dealers I played with were super wonderful people.  Truly a great pick, so kudos to them.  And the blackjack tables offered were fairly priced and had reasonable odds.  I can't comment on the other table games, but my partner NEVER won anything at the slots, whereas he did consistently in every other hotel.  We were highly suspicious of this, and not sure just how much this new hotel might have tilted the odds a bit higher in their favor than average.

The room was nice, especially the soaking tub.  I wish all hotels had this deep soaking tub, and it was my favorite part of our entire stay.  The linens were TERRIBLE.  Not soft at all, and actually quite a bit itchier than any other hotel sheets I've slept in, including motels along the interstate.  There were stains on the couch, but that's probably because there have been big parties in the room; all that's needed for such a party is to open the door to the balcony and you'll be part of the nightclub.

The 'mall' stores were a refreshing change from the Dior and Prada of every other hotel, and included stores that I might actually buy something from, being in my 20s and not a millionaire.  
 
The restaurant I ate at, China Poblano, was really good.  The nutella stuffed french toast was incredible.  I wanted to try more but after my experiences decided against it.

I don't like giving this hotel only one star, nor do I want to, but I have to.  They need to get their act together.  They need to tell people they will need earplugs to sleep in the East Tower when facing the pool.  They need to single out and fire the bigots that don't know how to treat paying guests with respect.  The manager was 'understanding', but he didn't win me over.  Get to work, Cosmopolitan!",12,1,1

We signed up for their Identity Club, which gives you $5 in free slot play and did well on the slots here. We also enjoyed a hearty breakfast at Eggslut. The lines were long, but it was totally worth waiting for the hearty breakfast sandwich featuring turkey sausage, cheese and eggs on a brioche bun. 

I also asked questions of their Concierge a number of times. Each time the Concierge was super friendly- even when I disclosed that I wasn't staying at the hotel.

Like any great hotel there, you have your shops, casino, and yummy restaurants (like Wicked Spoon gourmet buffet). But, unlike other hotels, the ginormous, yet lovely Chandelier in the center of the hotel adds the extra Pizzazz to make you really feel like you're 'livin it up' in Vegas! And of course, it's the center of the strip for easy come and go access.

But one of the top features that I love best is that there are 3 pools!
One pool is Marquee, fun, but only if you get your private table in the wading pool- away from the floating tanning oil-topped large pool.

The second pool is for hotel guests only- must show your room key. It is a huge wading pool with pool showers, many lounge chairs, a DJ, a hot tub, and a Game room with foosball and televisions! I love this pool the most. It is the 'middle ground' when you want to take a day off from a packed day pool\/club.

Lastly, the third pool is small and quiet- for the 50+ yr olds\/families.

At Cosmopolitan you'll find design rooms, still a bit to earth colored for me and not as fancy as you know from other ""design"" places, but contemporary and neat looking. It's 2011 and not 1998.
Positive:
I had a wrap-around suite, East Tower, great balcony view, nice rooms, large bathroom, kitchen (useless but cool), washing machine, flat screens etc. All in all perfect for a deluxe stay.
Negative: 
The Marquee night\/day club is most annoying. Sure, we like to party hard, but the outside soundsystem hammers the building really loud with full bass power from 10am until 4am in the morning. Even if you don't have a light sleep, this can give you a hard night. So I agree with the folks, who complained here.
It also happened, that a daily soap was shot at one of the pools and, if you liked to stay, you were forced to sign an approval to give away your picture rights. Some people might like this attention, but I preferred to move to the West Tower pool. I expect getting paid if somebody takes my picture for tv!
Quality management would help, as you pay a high price for your room at The Cosmopolitan. Earplugs from the service team are definetly the wrong way.
Wi-fi is slooow, but free, what is not normal in Vegas hotels.
Check-in took a while - but it was labor day weekend. Check out easy per TV from the room
All in all, I'll try another one next time.",3,0,0

I loved stepping into this hotel, it was refreshing, weird huh? But you didn't feel like you just bathed in 5 pounds of second hand smoke and that you had to push your way through the ""air"", it smelled new, clean, crisp! My advice hurry and get there to enjoy this rarity , ""clean air,"" in Vegas, just kidding, sort of. 

It's a place that overstimulates your eyes no matter where you are, your trying to take everything in all at once. Love the modern tech savvy pillars in the check-in\/lobby area. It's pure entertainment watching the scenes on High Def screens changing, which leads me to the elevators, clean crisp and again HD screens installed with vivid vibrant images of pure randomness (flowers, insects,etc...). So hey stand in the lobby for a bit, especially when sobering up or ride the elevator up and down a few times, mind you though you can only go so far on an elevator ride floor wise without a room key.

Speaking of the which the rooms are amazing, we had the view of the Bellagio Fountain, and much of the other parts of the strip. The bathroom was a girls dream, huge, especially with three woman sharing. Could also be a guys dream given the fact the shower had a window into the main room quarters and the blinds were controlled from the outside, a little in house peep show of your own perhaps? 

My girls and I were lucky enough to dabble in a lot of what The Cosmo had to offer, so other reviews will follow regarding The Marquee night club, The Chandelier (this bar is absolutely amazing, so chic I just have to say that now and later), China Poblano's (When Pig's Fly pork buns & a Lychee sour, I want more!), The Neapolitan (adult popsicles who can resist), and The Boulevard pool (beautiful views of the strip from up here).

::Entertainment::
~Check out the Marquee Club.  They have day and night events.
~On the Top Floor (maybe 3rd floor) there is a pool table you can play for free.  The que sticks and tips are not in good shape but you can still hit the balls with it; people take turns.

Valet Parking was full but one of the staff still took the car; awesome!!  Picking up the car is downstairs.  Scan your valvet ticket at the self service kiosk. 

::Checking In::
One of the staff showed my friends and I to the check-in line.  She offered us bottled of water too.  We checked in with Carl, he was professional and friendly.

::The Room::
My friends and I got the Studio Suite.  It has a hallway entrance, dinning room, full kitchen, living room, balcony (living room and bedroom), two flat screen television, and a view of the Bellagio Water Fountain Show!! The room was amazing!! The only dissapointment was the smell of cigarettes in the room and it was a non smoking room.

Our group booked 3 rooms for 12 girls.  Tons of fun!  The hotel itself is very chic and classy and quite centrally located in the middle of the Vegas strip.  It's near plenty of other great hotels\/casinos - it's right next to Aria (there's a walkway that goes between the two), Bellagio, Caesars Palace, Venetian, Paris, etc.  The decor of the hotel is very chic and it has tons of nice restaurants and bars (more on that below).

We liked our stay overall with one caveat - we were staying there the weekend one of the hotel's pool areas caught on fire.  It was a very big fire and made national news.  Our group couldn't access our hotel rooms for several hours.  They didn't make any attempt to make us whole except to give people free water bottles - undoubtedly to help with the smoke inhalation.  My friend (the bachelorette) had to talk to them before they gave us a $600 voucher.  The voucher was definitely nice, but I feel like it should have been offered from the get-go after guests could not access or use their hotel rooms for half the day.  

Other than that, the hotel was great.  Our room was very comfortably shared by the 4 of us girls.  The shower and bathroom are big and there is plenty of closet space.  My only qualm with the room is the awkward shower curtain situation.  The curtain closes on the outside of the glass door to the shower, so anyone can look into the shower from the outside if they open the curtain from the outside.  Also, it would make more sense if there weren't glass doors between the shower and bathroom and sink area, so more people than just 1 could be using the bathroom at once.  Other than that, it was a nice and clean hotel.

And the Cosmopolitan also has plenty of things to do!  We went to their nightclub, Marquee, on the first night of our stay and had lots of fun.  Since we were a large group of girls and staying at the hotel, we got to stand in a much shorter line (took us less than 5 minutes to get in) and not have to pay a cover at all.  SWEET!

The hotel also has some great restaurants.  The ones I visited and will review separately are: Wicked Spoon (the hotel's buffet, and undoubtedly one of the best buffets on the Vegas strip), Blue Ribbon Sushi, Jaleo by Jose Andres (tapas; I've been to two Jaleo restaurants in the DC area in the past), Holsteins (yum, burgers!), Va Bene Caffe Duo (the hotel's cafe, located on floors 1 and 2), and the ""secret"" pizza restaurant located next to Jaleo.

My friend also told me that they allow pets where they even have a floor where its like fake grass and you can walk your dog there and let them play etc. She also mentioned that they have a babysitter service as well, so great if youre just going to a show or something (better not be goin to a club if you got a baby waitin for ya!!! shame shame).

Background- Carole and I try to go away for Christmas. If we don't go anywhere, we try to do a staycation and check into a hotel somewhere in Chicago. Well, I have a dog. He's ten pounds and extremely well-traveled, having been on a car ride from Chicago to New York and back, having flown in airplanes from New York to Chicago and also from Chicago to Vegas and back. He also takes part in these family vacations. As such, I specifically called the hotel upon booking our Terrace One Bedroom with the view of the Bellagio Fountains, I asked what the pet policy was. I also asked what I needed to bring and was told the hotel had everything, crates, blankets, dishes, etc...all I needed to bring was the dog, his food and treats and be prepared to pay a $250 refundable deposit...oh how wrong they were. This hotel gets one star for several reasons.

1) Check-In and Check-Out Process: I wish I was exaggerating, but Carole and I got in the line to check in shortly after three pm. After waiting more than an hour and fifteen minutes in the longest line to check in that I've ever been in my entire life...we get to check in. Daniela, the staffer who checked us in, was obviously new and not aware of any of the amenities for the dog...and presented us with an entire list of do's and don'ts for the dog. Tired and exhausted, we get upstairs at 4:45 and crash.

2) Concierge Services: One of the aforementioned rules in regards to us having the dog was that he couldn't stay in the room alone and uncrated. I'm a reasonable person, and it makes sense because of housekeeping coming in and out of the room...no one wants to get bit by an overprotective animal. However, when the hotel told me not to bring anything because they 'had it all' and I specifically asked about how I'd keep Jackson out of the way of housekeeping, i asked about crates.  I was told they had crates. However, when I called down to request one, i was told there were no crates. Great...so that means I have to stop my vacation to track down a pet store, go to said pet store and purchase a crate (if they hopefully carry any). Call down to the concierge to get an address and find that the nearest pet store is a bit away...explain the situation and the concierge tells me they will give us a credit (the first of many) and have a car take us, at no cost. Great! We get downstairs and to said address to discover the pet store doesn't exist in that location. Concierge didn't even call to check on it and this was Christmas Eve. So now, we're two out of towners and a dog riding around in a courtesy limo trying to locate a pet store. Had we done what the first concierge told us and hopped in a cab, we would have been screwed. Almost two hours later, we get a crate and return back to the hotel. It never should have taken that long.

3) Housekeeping: The hotel management told us that when we stepped in the room, it was supposed to feel like no one had ever stayed in that room before us. Yeahhhh......not the case at all. There were soap scum stains on the shower door, the microwave above the wet bar in the room was filled with grease and sauce stains from someone heating up something in there, and the glasses along the bar were grossly covered in fingerprints and who knows what else. Ordinarily, you could call down, ask them to give your room a thorough clean and all that would be eliminated, right? Yeah, we did that. Didn't happen. Twice.

4) Lines: Since this hotel is fairly new, it was built to have lots of guests frequenting the different areas of the hotels. However, it lacks the staff and management to actually handle the amount of people. Even the elevators, while many, cannot handle all the foot traffic of guests, visitors and other frequenters of the hotel and its facilities. Makes no sense that I have to wait over a half hour for an elevator to go down to the main lobby area, and makes even less sense that the only way to even find a place on the elevator is to ride it all the way up, and then down. 

5) Dog Area: While in pictures it is cute and adorable, the policy about picking up after your animal was not enforced and the area kept running out of poop bags. Also, to get to the poop bags, you have to step into the actual area where the dogs urinate and poop, so if you aren't careful (and it does get dark late at night) you could end up stepping in the poop of an animal. The area often smelled as if it hadn't been cleaned properly, and when security got too tired or called away, the doors out to the area were locked and any pooches needing to potty were out of luck,",5,1,0

To be fair, this suite was amazing and would have been worth every penny had they stuck to their word. But when I arrive home I find a charge for $504...$125 to $504? Turns out they charged us $125 times 3 nights (we stayed 2, and they promised it was $125 for the weekend, NOT per night) and the resort fees. Good thing I looked at my statement otherwise I'd be out $300. WOW! But whatever, things happen, at least it should be an easy fix, right?

I call and get transferred to accounting expecting a quick and easy call. I received a copy of the paperwork clearly stating a one time charge of $125 and the resort fees. Me: I've been overcharged. Cosmo: I'm looking at what you signed and you have not been overcharged $504 is correct, I'll send you what we have. ... they send me the same exact thing I had. It showed a one time upgrade charge of $125 with recurring charges of $40 for resort fees. However you want to slice it this does not add up to $504 for 2 nights...""things happen"" is starting to shift to straight up theft. 

I bring this up on my next call...now 60+ minutes into an ordeal that never should have happened in the first place. This next representative is now 100% backing the previous rep without so much as looking at the documents. Unbelievable.. apparently the customer is always.. wrong?? For whatever reason I tried to use logic and reason to explain that $125x2 which still wasn't what I signed or agreed to, doesn't equal $504. Unreal. After far too much time wasted I finally explain that I'm going to social media unless I get fairly compensated.

MAGIC. 

I get a voicemail after just 15 minutes. My charge has been reduced. I was right all along. No apology, just a thank you for ""understanding"". Amazing.

So after all of that, how do you think they repaid me for the inconvenience? Yep. You guessed right. Going with the common theme here: I went through hell just so I could pay the price I was told I'd be paying. Not even an apology. Fun...I don't think so.",6,3,1

I miss the smell at the Cosmo the most. We booked a terrace one bedroom and we loved it. The room was very spacious and the bed was divine. 

Service is just so so. It really depends on their staff. Some staff have very good customer service and others are just not on their game. We had some issues with our lights and it was fixed within a day. Our room had 2 TVs but only 1 remote control was in the room so we requested another one and it came within 30 minutes. Some minor issues mostly.

Housekeeping was very good except on the first day. Some rags were left on the chair and the toiletries were not refilled. All the other days it was impeccable.

We tried 2 restaurants at the Cosmopolitan. Wicked Spoon and Comme Ca. We loved both! Wicked Spoon in my opinion was better than the Wynn. And we only went to Wicked Spoon for brunch (but we went to Wynn for dinner). Service at Comme Ca was spot on. Our server was very attentive and very knowledgeable. We enjoyed it a lot.

I hear great things about Aria, but I haven't yet had the pleasure.  I really don't feel strongly compelled to find out, however, because I'm THAT in love with The Cosmopolitan.  

There's so much to look at and to interact with here, it's on another level.  The room was huge, and filled with interesting objects that made it feel like a classier, funkier version of home.  Plenty of places to charge your phone and other electronic devices.  There was a pretty cup filled with colored pencils on the desk, interesting light fixtures, and thought-provoking and beautiful books, sandwiched by neat, artsy book ends.  The shower was awesome.  The view was incredible - my room looked right out over the Bellagio fountains.  The patio had super comfortable, clean furniture, and it was so nice to just sit and read a book while enjoying the breeze, high above the chaos of the strip.  I would have loved to just spend a week hanging out in my hotel room and enjoying their pool deck.

Speaking of which... nobody compares when it comes to the view from the pool.  Looking one way, you see the strip.  Looking the other way, you can see the snow-capped mountains in the distance.  

The service from the employees that work in the shops is top notch - everyone I spoke with was friendly, upbeat, and great at their jobs.  The restaurants here are excellent as well - I highly recommend China Poblano as well as Wicked Spoon.  And the Art-O-Mat machines!  Definitely don't miss those.

It's hip, chic and currently, the place to be.  Its huge, well appointed rooms don't disappoint, and the generous terrace is something which you quickly learn you can't live without... especially if you are lucky enough to get one of the rooms with the view of the Bellagio fountains.  

The Cosmo also boasts my favorite NYC restaurants, including STK, Milos and Blue Ribbon, as well Marquee, the hottest club in Vegas (as of 3\/11).  The Chandelier is also a great meeting point and a terrific lounge if you're not feeling like the ""chica chica boom"" of the nightclub scene.  Oh, and then there's the brand new spa, with all the bells and whistles you never even dared to dream.  Ladies, if you're over 30, try the IS Clinical Age Defying Facial.  Not only will you leave there all glowy, tight-pored and beautiful, but it will be the most relaxing 65 minutes of your life (after the peel part is over).  All in all, you never have to leave the premises, as everything a hipster could possibly want is within one building.

If there is a downside, as there always is, it's the housekeeping service.  There is no turndown service, even if you specifically ask for it.  If you're not out of your room by a certain time, don't expect it to be cleaned, regardless of how many hours the ""please clean""  sign on your door begs for service... and even if you speak with someone live, it is no guarantee that the room will be cleaned after that magic, cleaning-staff-disappearing hour.  If you are fortunate enough to have your room cleaned, there is hardly any attention to detail.  Although I never felt that the room was dirty, sometimes dirty glasses were left around, mini-bar left-overs were left over longer than necessary and to my biggest chagrin, the cleaning person confused my own hair towel (which bore no resemblance to the hotel towels except in color only, and was purposely hidden underneath the hanging robe), with the hotel towels and took it.  So the moral of the story is get out early,  hide anything that might be confusing to the staff, wash your own glasses and throw all your mini-bar left overs out yourself.  This will ensure your own 5-star review of the property.",1,0,1

The rooms have roomy balconies with comfortable patio furniture overlooking some part of the strip (an upgrade room gets you a view of the Bellagio fountain, the other side gives you a look at the airport\/mountains\/strip).  All possible amenities are available. 2 televisions, with assorted inputs for your devices. Jacuzzi\/tub. Roomy showers. Comfortable beds. 

The hotel casino is immaculate, as is the various bars around the hotel based on a James Bond theme - one is called, simply, ""Bond"" and another is called the Vesper. There's a ""chandelier bar"", assorted restaurants (including a secret pizza place!), various pool\/spa areas with good views, different sections that have been decorated with various themes (check out the lobby as well as the large hall leading to the ""Rose. Rabbit Lie."" supper club (unfortunately, it was closed when I was there). 

A few problems: Somebody needs to tell the hotel to occasionally fluff the outside cushions. As a result, a nice moth population sprung up underneath them and some of them flew inside the room. There was some kind of ozone-generating machine in our room that was going full blast, for reasons unknown. Our jacuzzi tub would occasionally turn on its air jets for no reason. And beware of Floor 66 - the place had a mildew smell when we stayed there (maybe that's why the ozone thing was running, who knows?)

*You should not touch anything that you don't want to pay for!* This includes anything out of the minibar - there's a weight system that triggers when something is removed. And yes, the sex\/lube-kit thing is funny and amusing - but please don't pick it up, otherwise you'll be paying for it when you check out (try explaining to the checkout guy that you didn't use it - honest, you didn't!)

I've never seen such a high concentration of good-looking young folks in any other Vegas hotel. It was puzzling, disorienting, somewhat damaging to the self-conscious, but certainly pleasing to the eye.

The wrap-around suites are great - undoubtedly the best I've ever come across in my stays in Vegas. There's a large balcony that wraps around the whole room, giving you astonishing views of the strip and the Bellagio fountain - especially if you're lucky enough to get a room on a high floor. Not to mention, there's a washer, dryer, and full kitchen set-up, which I can see being incredibly useful if you're staying for more than just a couple nights.

Lots of good establishments around the hotel - Chandelier Bar is, on a visual scale, my favorite bar in Las Vegas. Restaurants like Holsteins and STK make for good lunch and dinner stops. It's worth noting the casino only had $25 minimum blackjack tables - for scaredy cat gamblers like me, best to stick to the $10 MGM tables.

The front desk customer service is iffy. I've not personally had any big issues, but one couple in the group we traveled with were told their room wasn't available (despite booking weeks in advance). The front desk played it off as it would be free in a couple hours, and that they'd call back. The call never came and despite them checking in with Cosmo every couple hours, they were without a room all the way until the following day. Seeing their bad experience was pretty unsettling.",8,5,6

I would suggest booking direct 3+ nights in a row and the Cosmo gives you a 150 dollar credit that I believe is otherwise not advertised.

The resort is so different from the other hotels on the strip. Cosmo brings sophistication and edge together creating new experiences for travelers and locals!

Before even entering the resort, we were blown away with the parking garage. Yes, I said parking garage! Each floor had there own murals done by professional artists. One of my favorites was the OBEY mural. These are perfect for paparazzi shots with friends. Aside from that, which I find unique is the censored parking lights. Each stall has its own censor above showing either a red or green light. Red meaning: occupied, taken, unavailable or your shit out of luck. Green meaning: open, open... hurry its open! You get the drift. Pure brilliance. How convenient is that to not have to drive repeatedly in every row stalking people for their parking spots. Just look for a green light and thats it. However, there could be some mishaps where other cars race you to the punch. Kinda seems like a musical chairs game but in this case cars trying to get in a stall. 

The interior design inside the resort is amazing. At the registration area, there are pillars that shows video art changing from water bubbles to patterns. For gaming, I've seen some tables such as Roulette, light up on the numbers that were chosen rather than the dealer having to place an item on it.  

Now I've been to a lot of nice bars and lounges on the strip, but the 3-story Chandelier bar inside the Cosmo, blows everything else out of the water. It's centered in the casino making it like the heart of the resort. Its so beautiful. All I can just do is stare at the masterpiece. I cannot imagine the hard work put into that with all the glass beads. 

On the second level, you will find retail and a few restaurants. On the third level, it has more fine dining restaurants. One thing I love and also could be a useful tip about the third level, there is a ""game area"" for all ages to hang out at. Forget those cheesy ghetto arcades, they have board games like Monopoly, Mancala. etc. Best of all is the pool table! Seriously? That is awesome. 
 
There are a lot of unmarked places in here that needs to be reviewed so I will definitely be coming back soon. Plus, I was always a big fan of the Cosmopolitan drinks and for the name to be branched out into a resort just got even better. ""A cosmo drink in a cosmo suite!"" xD",15,8,15

Arrived on a Saturday at 3:30 pm, to about 40 people waiting to check in, and none looking very happy.  Hmmmm, not a good sign.  When we got to the desk, in 20 minutes, we were told our room wasn't ready.  Say, whaaaat?  The desk kid was very apologetic, embarassed, contrite.  All the things you'd expect after catching a puppy peeing on the floor.  

But that didn't help us with a room.  He suggested we go have some dinner and wait for our room.  'scuz me, but we just spent 8 hours in a car.  I wanted a shower, and to relax before we hit the casino and out for the night.  He told us it should be less that TWO HOURS till our room was ready.  (!!!!!)

So we headed for the closest bar and grabbed a couple drinks.  Happily, our room was ready in less than an hour.  We got to our room, called for our luggage and waited 40 more minutes for it to arrive.......

The room was nice, airy and clean.  The bath very well-appointed and comfy.  Dual shower-heads, big tub.  If you don't want to watch someone in the shower, close the blinds.

The ""kitchen"" space consists of a Nazi-style snack bar and mini-fridge, all full of stuff you'll get charged for if you fondle.  Fair enough, but what if you actually bring in your own cherished bottle of wine or Blue Label?  There's not enough room for a toothpick, much less a six-pack.

I fear that in the rush to be edgy and provocative, the management forgot that actual comfort may be welcomed.  There's a great balcony, overlooking the Bellagio and the strip.  An excellent place to relax a bit and watch the evening come up.  But there's only one small lounge to sit in.  What if you're there with another person or two, they supposed to sit on the pavement or take turns?  And, there's not a comfy chair to be had.  Sigh.

When we checked out, we called to get our bags brought down.  No one was availiable to do that - at 0800 on a Sunday?  i think we were the only ones awake then on the property.

One final thing - when we checked out, we found that a $600 charge had been put on our card as a deposit.  Without telling us.  I can see $100 or so, we may have raided the mini-bar or something, but $600?   Ridiculous.

Staff was all uniformly welcoming, helpful and professional.  Great people watching, and enough interesting stuff on-property to keep you there all weekend.  But it's a bit like hoping your screw-up of a little brother has his act together, but knowing he doesn't.

After being open over a year, the bugs should be better worked out with staffing.  It's just not a good thing to piss off your customers when they first check in.

I would definitely stay here again. They even had 2 thermostat controls and 2 flat screen TVs for the suite. The king size bed was amazing. No issues falling asleep and extremely comfortable. The mattress was company was Serta. Wifi was free and decently fast. Only issue with the place was the checkout. We couldn't checkout via the TV. 

In terms of gambling, this place lacks poker tables and it isn't really a ""hardcore"" gambling place. I would go to other places were the tables are cheaper and with more variety.

Recently stayed at the Cosmopolitan, for a family vacay and I happen to have a excellent casino discount for December 27 - 29th, those dates were packed with Vegas tourists and hardcore clubbers. My parents weren't really impressed with the Cosmopolitan and said they have stayed at other 5 star hotels that were more impressive than the Cosmo, I disagree.

The check in clerk tried to up-sell me a suite for $50 more per night, I kept declining since I was hardly in the room and was a waste of $50. Instead of staying in the, Studio Terrace Room like last time, we stayed in the City Room with 2 Queen Beds in the West Tower. The Room was clean and much better than our last room at, Caesars Palace, the part of the view was blocked off by the Polo Tower and had a small view of the Center Strip and the Polo Towers tennis court.

I just loved the kind of clientele, the Cosmopolitan attracts; young, hip, and trendy. I haven't tried most of the restaurants while I was staying there, except for the Henry (Separate Review).  

What I dislike about the Cosmopolitan:

--Unorganized Check In\/Out Lines
--Some of the table dealers were rude
--Young Drunks in the wee hours in the morning around the casino with no security controlling it
--Security guards by the elevators don't check guests for room keys

What I like about the Cosmopolitan:

+Chic decor around the casino and hotel rooms
+Hospitable hotel staff
+Location\/ Footsteps away from the strip
+Terraces in some of the hotel rooms
+The Henry, Bond Bar, Chandelier Bar, Book and Stage
+The Boulevard Pool

One thing, that was to my amazement was the parking garage, where each parking was designed to have light fixtures above each parking spot that allows you to see if a parking is available (green: open \/ red: taken)
ahhh...What a clever idea!!!!!

I like to think of this place as a museum and just enjoy the interior designed work and the overall architecture construction of the casino.  There is a handful of artwork and sculptures in the lobbies and not to mention the plenty of lounge seatings around the area.  Great backgrounds for pictures and it's the perfect place to head out to after filling your stomach with food.

I do have to try out the new night club ""Marquee"" on the 17th floor.",15,8,9

When I flew United Airlines into Las Vegas, I received a gift from United with a free Wicked buffet meal at Cosmopolitan to be redeemed at their Identity membership desk.  I waited in the long line to redeem my Wicked buffet with my 2 children ages 7 and 9.  When it was finally my turn at the Identity front desk, a very rude Cosmopolitan employee at the front desk told me that children are not allowed to be at the front desk and that they have to be several feet away from the desk.  So I asked my children to step back a few feet.  Then, the lady proceeded to scold me and say that children cannot be unattended at the casino.  So, I asked them, if they are not allowed here nor there, what do you suggest I do as I certainly do not want to wait in the long line again?  They did not offer any suggestions and the lady that was supposed to help me simply walked away from the desk to ignore me further.  Wow!  Talk about customer service!  The Cosmopolitan may be a hip and trendy place, but it certainly looks down on guests with children.  I have money to spend, but I certainly will not spend it at the Cosmopolitan in the future!",0,1,0

We were admittedly spoiled on our visit to the Cosmo. After getting chummy with the check-in girl, she upgraded us to what can only be described as a slice of heaven. Room 5915 is on the 59th floor of the rear tower, facing north. My ears popped in the elevator. But when I opened the door to the room... My jaw literally dropped.

The view cannot be described adequately. I tried to explain it to a friend who was staying at the Vdara and I even showed him a picture of it, but when he saw it in person, he gasped. GASPED. That's how incredible it was.

All the lights of Vegas stretched out beneath me, all the way to the mountains north of town. I looked down on the Bellagio and its dancing fountains. I looked down on The Mirage with its erupting volcano. I looked down on Treasure Island and the fireworks from the Sirens of TI. I looked down on The Paris and Caesar's Palace and The Flamingo. I could see Wynn and Encore, The Venetian and Palazzo and in the distance blinked the lights of the Stratosphere. 

I was God. I was the lord of Las Vegas observing my kingdom from above. I was Mufasa showing Simba everything the light touches (That shadowy place is Circus Circus - you must never go there, Simba.) 

The room was incredible: soft beds, two TVs, a sitting area, a desk, a triple-wide closet, a mini kitchen, a whirpool tub, a HUGE shower (wink wink wink), a private toilet room and ALL the lights in the room can be controlled remotely by the phone. Technology!!!

Downstairs, the Cosmo is super-modern, verging on cheesy. They'll need to renovate within the next ten years to stay current. But for now, it's ""just the right amount of wrong."" It's obviously still the place-to-be-and-be-seen on the Strip. I saw more coochie-flashing dresses and barely-buttoned Affliction shirts on one walk through the casino than I've seen collectively worldwide in the last decade.

Food and shopping options abound. The Chandelier bar wows. And I won $322 off a $20 bet on a Goldfish slot machine. I honestly, positively, absolutely CANNOT complain about the Cosmopolitan. 

Stay here.",9,11,7

The first thing that's worth noting about this hotel is that it's a Marriott property. That means if you have status with Marriott (which, fortunately I do) you'll get free wifi and (for platinum level), two free passes to the Wicked Spoon buffet for breakfast (which is amazing, but that's a topic for another review.)

The lobby sets the tone for the rest of the experience. They advertise as ""just the right amount of wrong"" and it really is. If you've ever been to The Standard hotel the Cosmopolitan will strike you as a slightly more upscale\/toned down version of that.

When you walk in through the valet entrance you're greeted by the lobby with these ""magical pillars"". I actually have no idea what they're called, but they're cool. They'll show different elevator type scenes, some of them a bit risque. You'll probably find yourself standing there watching, mesmerized, waiting for someone to release that poor trapped woman from the foggy glass room she's trapped in.

Just off of the lobby is the Vesper Bar. The bar specializes in classic cocktails and bartenders who really know their craft. In all the times I've stopped by there, which is many, I've always been very impressed with the bartenders. As for the waitresses there (and the rest of the complex for that matter), let's just say ""they hire well"" - attentive, friendly, and rather attractive - just the way you want your cocktail waitresses to be.

Past the lobby opens up into one of the nicer casinos I've seen. I must confess I haven't done much gambling there as I tend to gamble on the cheap and the limits are generally a bit too rich for my blood. But my wife does love the penny slots there.

As you meander through the casino there's a nice little sports bar on the right side. Good beer selection and a nice place to grab some greasy food to fight off the hangover from the night before. Through to the other end of the casino is the Chandelier Bar, which is enormous and breathtaking. It's built inside of a huge, well, chandelier. It's three stories tall, with a bar on each story. I have to say I much prefer the bartenders back at Vesper.

If you head upstairs you'll find a little shopping area, which did little to impress me. However, there are quite a few good restaurants around the area, including Scarpetta (do yourself a favor and try the duck foie gras ravioli. You'll thank me later) and Holstein's Shakes & Buns.

If you're lucky enough to be staying here, ask, plead and beg for a room that overlooks the Bellagio fountains. It's one of the best views in Vegas. But even if you're not fortunate to be blessed with a great view, the rooms are outstanding.

They're wired to the max. Every room I've stayed in has had a living area and a bedroom, with ample space for each. The couch in the living area is comfortable, and a perfect place to relax with a little TV or simply collapse if you don't have the energy to make it to the bed. The beds are uber comfortable. The bathrooms are huge, and depending on the room have a clear glass wall separating you from the shower area.

If you're not lucky enough to get a room with a view (either of the Bellagio, or of the shorty you brought back to your room showering), you may still be lucky enough to have a balcony. Yes - balcony. Perfect for relaxing with a nice cigar and a couple of friends swapping Vegas stories.

Having stayed here several times now I must admit I'm spoiled. I can't imagine staying anywhere else on the strip. Posh. Great rooms. Amazing atmosphere. Central strip. Great views. Remarkable staff. This is my home in Vegas.",2,0,2

They really do offer a lot here in comparison to other hotels.  Stayed in a Terrace Studio recently and I loved the room.  The room was spacious, there was a living room area with a couch, bar\/kitchen area with a microwave, dishwasher, sink, large shower, separate bath tub.  The room also had a balcony which I absolutely loved.  This stay, our room had a view of the Vegas Strip and faced Planet Hollywood directly.  Below, was a view of the Boulevard Pool.  Monday nights in the summer, the Cosmopolitan has Dive In movies.  We didn't have to go down to the Boulevard Pool to watch though since we could catch everything from the balcony of our room--pretty cool. 

The Bamboo Pool and Boulevard Pool was really relaxing during the day.  I enjoyed the food that we ordered at the pool, I had a Chicken Pita Sandwich and the edamame, both were delicious. The pool area was calming and relatively quiet unless of course you go to Marquee Dayclub.  The Boulevard Pool area has foosball tables, pool tables and better music as opposed to the Bamboo Pool.  I guess it's probably why the Boulevard Pool boasted a younger and more hip crowd.

Based on my walkthrough...

The Chandelier Bar is a stunner-- you're hanging out inside a chandelier that's three levels high. Nice.

Unlike the overly dark Aria, Cosmo has a lovely glow about it. It's filled with modern architecture that's interesting and fresh. 

The Identity rewards program is brilliant. I'm not much of a gamer (craps is my one go-to game, if the table feels hot), but Cosmo's system allows you to earn points through dining and shopping too. And since I'm quite the food monster, that works out quite nicely. :)

The young crowd was there in droves on Friday and folks had much fun.  The casino staff was very friendly and security did a great job of balancing fun and safety it seemed by letting crazy happen but scooping up the drunks as they went to zombie status or passed out on the benches.  As a zombie or two would head for a random elevator or room, a purple coat would just appear from nowhere to help guide back. 

The $25 blackjack table minimums in the middle of the day were steep.  Ouch!  With high daytime rates,  I did not even check at night.  However,  the tables were full so people were digging the vibe.  Payouts on video poker and video blackjack are some of the lowest I have see seen so overall not the place to gamble of focused on ROI.  The parking is nuts but valet service is great.  It is one of the few casinos without a well defined Uber area which is weird when targeting the young and hip crowd. 

The fun pool went off all weekend with folks having much fun.  The music was a great mix and the DJ was on point.  The music even sounded great on the 56th floor.   The quiet pool was pretty uninviting though.  The lack of shade at both pools was very disappointing especially when they have mandatory expensive resort fees and few cabanas.  Why can't everyone be offered a towel, chair, and an umbrella at a top resort pool in the middle of the f'n desert?  What does it mean anymore to be a resort?

The rooms with balconies are really unique in Vegas, awesome views everywhere. The rooms overall were beautiful, enormous, and amazingly quiet.  Our party had rooms in both towers and both are equally great.  However, house keeping is really dropping the ball in both towers.  Things are just grimy and dirty in many different areas. They would also sometimes not refill some minor things like soaps and ice bucket bags.",0,0,0

Colored pencils & art books in the room. Glitter, crystal & all things sparkly in unlikely places (walls, light fixtures, etc.) Staying at the Cosmopolitan makes you feel like a princess. I don't throw this word around casually, but our room was PHAT; balcony with a comfy seating area, huge shower, deep soaking tub, flat screen TVs (yup, plural.) 

Loved it:
-- pool on 4th floor was about 90 degrees. Pool on 14th floor was about 80 degrees. In January. At noon. I could have stayed there all day. Take a picture underneath the gigantic shower head & on the lounge chairs *in* the pool. 
-- chandelier bar: sip a cosmo at the cosmopolitan for $10 a pop. 
-- secret pizza joint: review to follow. Basically, I like anything with the word 'secret' in it. 

Unfortunately, customer service was the low point of our stay  They've only been open for 1.5 months, which might explain the hiccups, but here is a list of things that rained on my parade:
-- we were told there was a pull-out bed in the room. There wasn't. Just a (fancy) couch. A more seasoned worker would have known exactly what type of room they were giving to a customer. 
-- hold time to get anyone on the phone was LONG. Anytime we called the front desk or housekeeping, we got an automated message telling us to hold for the 'next co-star.' This is not Hollywood, this is the hospitality industry. 
-- we called for extra towels & other essentials & it took hours to get it. Housekeeping did not replenish toiletries or replace the empty tissue box. 

The bottom line: the Cosmopolitan is glitzy & glamorous, no doubt, but god forbid you need anything sent to your room-- you'll have to call several times to get it. The Cosmopolitan is like a hot girl who's bad in bed. Gorgeous, you're glad you're in it, but you hope they'll learn some tips & tricks for next time.",19,20,16

It's glamorous, chic, upscale, hip, fun and sexy sexy sexy... Wow.. From the moment I got out of the cab and walked into this property, I knew I was in for it. 

During the day, there's heavy foot traffic all over Vegas. Tourists are hitting up every spot from south strip to north strip. Cosmopolitan is the newest and hottest at the moment. The people walking throughout the casino are just regular folks, but then you start noticing that there's a slightly larger portion of physically attractive people. I'll get back to this in a bit.

So, we get into our room which is located on the East Tower. We had requested a view looking over the Bellagio Fountains, but the guy told us that we would have to wait until check-in time in order to see what they have available. But he offered a room for early check-in, which was one of the few rooms that were available right away. We took it.. It's not always easy to get a room early in a property that's normally 100% booked at 12:00 PM on day of check-in. So, my buds and I take a elevator trip (You need your keycard just to use any of the elevators leading to guest floors, awesome! Keeps the scavengers out!) We get into our room, and it's just immaculate! The rooms are gorgeous, two TVs, a balcony overlooking Aria and the Boulevard pool as well as Marquee Dayclub. Plush beds, couches, electrical outlets and USB ports everywhere. Separate bathtub, shower (If you happen meet someone, or you're with your significant other, that shower has plenty of space.. And if you're extra freaky, there's space for for about 3 more, lol, just saying). 

The service provided by Cosmo was just impeccable! We must have called them on 7 different occasions just for random things and they're always happy to provide them and even give you a service call later to see if you received everything. On top of that, they have 24 hour housekeeping so you can request a clean room any time you want! We always left a nice tip to the cleaning ladies and had rooms cleaned above and beyond with even our shoes lined up and our own personal bathroom items arranged nicely.

Within the next few days, we took advantage of the Bamboo Pool and the Boulevard Pool. This is when I noticed that almost 90% of the hot people you see walking around Cosmo are staying at Cosmo and the rest are just people walking through. I've never seen so many hot bodies in one place in my life. Beautiful women lounging and strutting their goods all over the property. I would definitely recommend the Boulevard Pool over the Bamboo Pool because it's more upbeat and you can hear all the music bumping from its own DJ or from the Marquee Dayclub. Marquee Dayclub might have the most upbeat, but there's also cover to pay, so I'd rather just take advantage of what comes free with our stay at the property. The cocktails were good, but they ran out of mint leaves so they couldn't make any Mojitos.. BOOOOOO!! But that's OK. I had plenty of other drinks to make up for one lost one, lol. 

Every single bar there is impressive, all beautiful with the glitz and glam, crystals everywhere. And of course Chandelier Bar was by far one of the most impressive sights I've laid my eyes on.

In short, my buddies were stunned by this property and we all agreed that this is the spot to be in.

On a side note.. This is a very lively property. You can hear music from Marquee in the whee hours when most normal people are trying to get shuteye... But everyone knows that Vegas is everything but normal.. The age range is mainly between 25-35, and there are definitely female beauties of all shapes, sizes and ethnicities (high maintenance as well) all over the place. The guys are a mix of frat dudes, pretty boys and a few meathead types. I mention these things because it may not be everyone's cup of tea. If you're looking for a more down-to-earth type of feel, this might not be the spot.  I like this place because it's not as boring and pretentious as Bellagio or Caesars, but it's not as as Douchebaggy as Hard Rock or Palms. This place is hip and sexy and it completely stands apart from any other property in Vegas. 

I look forward to making this place my hotel of choice on my next visit to Vegas.",6,3,5

The room also had a see through shower. LAAAVVVV IT! there is a shade though for privacy. I'm gonna need to come back and do some sexy time if you know what i mean ;)

This is a great room for girls. There are mirrors every where. I would hate when I would go to a hotel with my girls and we'd fight for a mirror to get ready. I wish the lighting was better though.",2,3,1

The room was spacious and  clean.  The mini-fridge is stocked, if you don't intent to buy anything don't even touch an item as they will try to charge you for them.  We requested an empty fridge and it was brought up no problem.  There are a wide variety of restaurants and bars and we enjoyed many of them.  It's also very convenient that there's a Starbucks on the premises since for some reason there are no coffee makers in the rooms.

Be aware that if you are staying on any side of the hotel that even remotely faces the Marquee Dayclub Pool you will not be sleeping past 11AM.  I know that this is not an issue for everyone, but hey, it's Vegas.  An afternoon nap was impossible because of this, possibly most irritating hotel feature ever imagined.

The bigger problem started Sunday afternoon when construction, I'm assuming demo work from the sound of it started DIRECTLY ABOVE US.  No big deal Sunday afternoon but we were awakened again Monday morning at 6:00AM.  6:00AM, really?!  Our last day there and we could not get out of the room fast enough.  You would not believe the noise, stomping, hammering, drilling.  I called down to complain and they said there was nothing they could do, but offered a later check out.  Why would I want to stay there any longer?  I was told a manager would call me.

Went down to check out, again, asked for a manager.  I was told that was not possible but again that someone would call me.  Well I've been home for 3 days and have yet to hear from anyone.

Bottom line, for this grade of hotel I expect much much better than renting out rooms with construction overhead.  And if this room was mistakenly rented out then someone needs to call me and make it right.",3,0,0

The check in process was strange. When I arrived at the counter the girl asked for a credit card for incidentals, which I provided. She then asked did I want to ""upgrade"" for $60? I said what do I get for $60? she said we can upgrade your room.  I said upgrade my room for $60 total? She said no, $60 a night.  After I declined she asked me to initial the box on the monitor in front of me that I agreed to pay a $28 dollar a day resort fee. I asked what does the resort fee cover? She said use of the gym and wireless internet.  I asked if it was optional, she said no. 

So why not include it in the rate? 

After I checked in I had the opportunity to walk the hotel. Its beautiful. My room was spectacular with a great view of the Bellagio. The Hotel had some cool bars in it and also a couple good restaurants. Accessing the strip was a breeze just walk through the casino and your there. The valet service was great, really friendly and knowledgeable about the city. 

Stay was good but at check out it kinda went sideways again. Front desk informs me we have mini bar charges. I'm positive I didn't and told her so and she removed them form the bill but this happened to all 11 people I was traveling with.

Literally. It's nestled right below the Cosmo, allowing you to take advantage of some of Cosmo's benefits, at a fraction of the price, especially with a group of friends. But nothing's as good as the real deal and in the case of Cosmo, this place is even better than I hoped. Booked a One Bedroom Terrace over Thanksgiving weekend. The room was pristine, from the huge bathroom complete with Japanese soaking tub, to the terrace overlooking the Strip. 

I got there at 12:30PM and my room was already all set. Check in was a breeze. Some call Cosmo's service impersonal, but I see them kind of like I see Virgin. Staff is there if you need them but if not, you never have to see them. I even checked out through the television in my room. Cool.

But the best part about Cosmo, at least from this clubgoers perspective, is Marquee. Even up on the 55th floor, Marquee is just a zip down the elevator to the 2nd and 3rd floors. Unfortunately Marquee isn't free for hotel guests on Saturdays, so your best bet is purchasing a ticket online. Every other day Marquee is open is free for guests, though.

One quick down side. An extra minibar charge showed up on my hotel bill and from what I'm reading, I'm not the only one this has happened to. 

All in all, though, this is one of the best hotels I've stayed at in my life. The style, brand and vibe of the place is as good as it gets. The variety of pools, lounges and restaurants both inside and outside also makes it possible to spend your entire Vegas stay at this one epic casino-hotel. In the winter, they've now added an ice rink where guests can put on skates in the desert for 5 bucks. From now on, Cosmo is my go to.",0,0,0

Not as ""new"" as I expected. There are scratches on the wall. Some stains on the sheet. But overall it is ok (probably not acceptable for the sake of a five stars hotel) 

Let's start with some pros first:
- huge balcony and fantastic view of the strip
- big room with dividers (our room is the Terrace One Bedroom I believe). We put the kids in the living room, close the sliding door and it becomes a private bedroom! Nice choice
- it has a Japanese tub where kids had lots of fun. You get to see the view of strip too while showering!!!
- it has sink, dish washer, and microwave. Very convenient for people with kids
- there are chinese channels in the room!
- they provide q-tips and swabs (never seen these before)

Now, some cons:
- the ""high tech"" curtain. We spent 30min on the first night trying to figure out how to roll down the curtains in the shower!!!! You have to have some wisdom to do so. (By high tech I do not mean electronics. It's just the way you roll it down is ""abnormal"")
- and then we spent another 30min trying to figure out how to turn off all the lights without shutting off the main switch in the room 
- we lived in the 63rd floor and when the cars drove by, it still sounded like it's next door. 
- the toilet was a pain. It is very nice but... It's in a closed room!!! It gives me claustrophobia seriously. And the door won't stay open so I ended up having hubby hold on to the door every time I'm in it. Weird
- the fridge was a joke: you can't put anything in it. Once you touched the sensors you are charged for $7\/drink. I tried to fit a water in it and I accidentally knocked out a whole roll. That was a catastrophe!

But overall it is a nice place to stay. I see it more as a hotel version of the timeshare. Very family friendly.

For the price of it, I think the inside can be a bit more clean!",1,0,0

Had a one bedroom suite with soaking tub. Pictures on the internet looked cool, bathroom is weird! haha. I would most def recommend that room if you are traveling as a couple or if you are into watching people shower while you lay in bed...hey, Im not judging. ha. The shower has huge windows that look into the bedroom and over the tub there is no window..just some wood blinds\/shutters. Nice sitting area with wet bar. Best part about the room was the closet area right outside the bathroom. Lots of mirrors, I like mirrors. haha. Once again, we did have an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. I don't think I could stay in a room with a south facing view, I will say it is worth the upgraded price to get a fountain view. 
The other half of our party had a huge wraparound terrace suite...eh...nice room but the largest party of the room is the entryway. Room wise, I wasn't too impressed. If you are going to get a suite, get a terrace suite (not wraparound). That room is by far my favorite set up. 

Enough about room....

Since we were celebrating a Birthday I called ahead of time to purchase an in room gift amenity. Super easy to order and the girl on the phone was really nice. I ordered the Birthday gift amenity so I wanted it to be delivered on the first night of our stay. Everything was set.
We got to the Cosmo....and of course the gift was not delivered to the room. Since it was a busy night I didn't get a chance to call down until the next morning and of course they told me that they did in fact deliver the gift. Ya, no. No gift in room. They told me they would send the gift up ASAP. Six hours later, the Birthday girl did receive her gift (which was a nice gift). All was well until the next morning when they checked their bill upon check out and noticed they were charged for the gift on their room...after I already paid for the gift two weeks prior. We had to make numerous calls to get the charges dropped off their bill and it still wasn't confirmed until after we checked out. One of the Concierge was nice enough to call and let us know the charges where finally taken off the bill.  BLAH

So ya, I still like the Cosmo..there is no place on the strip like it but there are a few things they are lacking. I have faith they can fix the small things.",1,0,1

I understood their position on it, but having prepaid and they taking my money, it would seem to me that that would be that. I instead had to get money from the ATM which charged me 30$ to do so, and thankfully I brought enough cash to cover, otherwise I would have had to turn around and drive back the 221 miles as the rest of the hotels were booked....The hotel staff didn't seem sympathetic at all, all they wanted was their money, which they already had.  My new card, was linked to the same account, same name, same everything. They could have called and verified, I was also told that I could use a different card for the incidentals when I got to the hotel. Regardless, I took the money from the ATM and paid them but told them I didn't have cash or funds for food because that was the last of my money. They gave me a 25$ food\/bev credit (ok one meal for me, and not for both of us), they also comped the resort fees (considerate, considering the pool was closed anyway and I couldn't even get in the spa if I wanted).  booked the one-bedroom terrace suite with fountain view.

Aside from that, the room was dusty, blinds for the tub didn't work (called for maintenance, they told us there were no more cranks in the hotel (why with all the hotels around being automated that that one still has cranks?), the room was really dark (didn't see the near microscopic light dimmer), and they placed us on the 22nd floor right above the fan from the Jockey Club so when you were outside, you could only hear that. The other problem was the front door, had to crank it so hard and push your whole weight into it just so itd shut. The second day, Security came by to inform us the door wasn't secure. We told them about it being stuck all the time and you had to really pull\/push to get it to shut. The mini fridge is so full of THEIR stuff that you can't even put a water or soda in there to get cold. The room layout in the living area was kinda not to my liking just because you had to tilt the television toward the couch, but it didn't go all the way so you had to sit at an angle to see it. The CAT cable for the internet didn't work, so I had to use the wifi, which wasn't that great as I could not stream anything on Hulu. The good part was the TV's were smart TV's and could connect to those apps anyway, but I didn't want to put in my info. 

The other thing, my husband picked up a can from the pressure plate, not having had to deal with being charged for moving an item in a hotel room, and not more than 3 minutes later we had someone at the door asking us what it was we had moved and that they had to check we didn't open it. Even though my husband put it back. 

The things we did like about the room was the bathtub, Japanese soaking style, and we liked the balcony, even if it was noisy. We also really loved Wicked Spoon, really best buffet in vegas. 5 Star quality food, decent price. 

I honestly don't think I will stay here again, because of the above things, the lobby smelling like someone is getting a perm, the staff, and the fact that I just wasn't that impressed. Much more impressed by the staff\/hotels of MGM. 

I was told upon check out if I emailed the manager next time they'd ""hook me up"" but I donno if itd be worth it.",0,2,0

It took two days to get staff to replace numerous burned out bulbs. We finally resorted to moving bulbs around so the loo wouldn't be in utter darkness. 

I give this hotel one star not for any of the above but for the audacity to charge our room $68.00 for the mini-bar, which we didn't use. Audacity for their flippant attitude about an accounting error they claim is common. We were told that just opening the fridge, which we used for our own goods, triggers a charge.

- The room is spacious and nice. The hotel has a modern, sexy vibe, and that carries over into the rooms as well. Perfectly place for a kid-less trip to Vegas with my wife.

- The balcony. We got a lot of use out of that balcony. In the morning I was able to sit out there with my coffee and watch the sunrise, and at night, we were able to look over the edge and catch an aerial view of the MIA concert just below us.  

- The facilities. Every place we went to (the chandelier bar, China Poblano, Scarpetta, etc.) were all fantastic.

Good: Great resaurants, fun atmosphere, newer, cool decor, hip, fun, 2 pools, decent spa, great location.

Not so good: Be sure to ask if your room faces the Boulevard pool or Marquee nightclub. If it does and there's an event, you'll hear the concert\/DJ\/pounding music until late at night\/morning (sometimes past 3 am at the Marquee). And I do mean pounding -the windows\/sliding doors shake. 
In all the times we've stayed at The Cosmo, we've NEVER had a trip where there wasn't something wrong with the room - the TV remote doesn't work, some of the lights won't turn on or off without using the master switch, a lamp is broken, stains on the couch, etc. 
Beware of their soap - it's harsh and very drying. Plus all their bath products, which are supposed to be uni-sex, smell like a man's colonge.

My husband and I love this place and it is very modern and nice hotel to stay at but our last experience was bad as they charged us extra on our credit card. We went to the hotel as my husband had a comp room offer for 2 days. We were only going to stay one night so we booked the room for Sunday night (1\/19) to checkout Monday morning (1\/20). We called and asked for a late checkout and they said we could at noon so we tried to checkout at 11:55 on computer and it would not work and we called the front desk and checked out. We were out of the hotel all together with our car from Valet by 12:30ish but we received a room charge of $336.01 on our credit card saying that we had not checked out on time and they charged us for an additional night. My husband called to ask about the charges on 1\/27 and they said that send an email to marivic.budduan@cosmopolitanlasvegas.com and he will check and refund or call and let us know. Nothing happened after about a week of waiting, I called on 2\/1 and asked about it and they said that there we no notes on our account and now the manager Pam is looking into it and will get back to me. She also mentioned that since it is Saturday, accounting is closed and so they get back to me on Monday. Of course, once again no one called or there were no refunds on my card. I called again today (2\/5) and they said there are no notes once again and not sure what has happened. I was transferred to the accounting department and the lady asked me all the same questions all over again and then put me on a 17 minute hold and then finally said that they manager is putting the credit back on my account as they see that no key was ever used on that day. I think this the worst of customer service I have seen to not get back to your customer after multiple promises.

The coolest part about the room though was the bathroom.  The shower to the right of the bathroom door was see through glass which I liked and the tub to the left of the door was right next to a window.  I can only imagine how glorious it would feel to soak in the tub, with a cold drink looking out the window just chillin.

We didnt get to hit up the Day Club, but we did hit up the pool.  The music was bumpin loud and there were a ton of people having a great time.  If you want chill and quiet, this is not where you want to be.  If you want loud and fun, this is where you want to be.  We ordered a round of drinks and we got them quickly which was nice.

Overall, this place was awesome.  I didnt give it a 5 because I didnt actually spend the night there.  I'm sure when I eventually do, I will update my rating.",3,0,1

It was my first time staying in this hotel but it had been on my bucket list for awhile. I swooped into Vegas to help out with a Yelp event and this is the hotel my boss-lady picked. As I was checking in the help desk was amazing and upon hearing that it was my first trip at that property they put me in a room facing the Bellagio Fountains. Truly the best view I've ever had in Vegas!! I totally instagramed the fountain show a couple times and even...sigh... took a couple selfies. I know. But it was such a cool room! 

The hotel staff was always helpful and friendly, including the bell desk and valet. The taxi line moved quickly each time I used it and room service was SUPER friendly and delicious. 

My room had a massive bathroom plus a sitting room, wet bar, lounge on the patio and comfy bed. Plenty of light and loved the decor... as I'm writing this I'm realizing that they might just be my new favorite place to stay! 

It's also so convenient located-on the strip, right across from the Miracle Mile shops, and exit straight to a sky walkway to cross the street. 

While I didn't love every dining outlet on site, the pool is top notch and I spent a morning there working. It seems small but there more than one on site and the sprawl out around the area into multiple corners and crannies.

My friend works here and hooked my wife and I up with a Terrace Studio with a Balcony and Fountain View.  It was awesome.  Especially because it was only $130 per night for the two nights.  She made the reservation and I called to confirm it  and to change the night because my daughter was sick.  Sure enough, the lady on the phone said the price was right and they charged my debit for the first night.

When we checked in I told the lady to switch it to my credit card.  Later that day I see a $445 charge on my debit.  What the heck?  I called the front desk and they said it would be taken care of.  Then I see a $9 charge from the mini bar because I moved a bottle.  Come on!  

The Cosmo is beautiful, blah blah blah.  Everyone knows it and we actually go here a fair amount (we just had a baby so that means once every couple months) to eat with our out of town guests.

And then we went to check out.  The fella at the desk told me I owed $332 after the $145.  What the What?  I explained the employee situation and he told me it doesn't exist.  He went onto tell me that when I changed the reservation the rates changed to $220 a night.  I explained it again, very calmly.  No go.  I got heated and let a few expletives slip.  He called his manager and they fixed it.  

Just goes to show you you don't get anywhere being nice.  I hate when people\/places try to blatantly screw you.  My friend said they do it all the time.  Will never stay here again.  I'll opt for somewhere more honest.   My house.",13,6,7

Ok now thats all cleared up. The Cosmopolitan is probably one of the most unique hotels out as of right now. From the artsy and technologically advanced parking garage, to the wrap around balcony terraces or the 3 strip view pool experiences. This place will blow you away. It's like they took the tech and style and class and made up their VERY OWN new style of Las Vegas. All with personality from the walls to the people who work there.... which easily make the hotel the most unique out there.

It's more for the young hip peeps or couples.
I've stayed here a few times in their 1 bedroom suite (kitchen, japanese soaking tub, and a huge patio with great views.)
The room is separated by a sliding door and connected to the bathroom with a direct view and access of a Japanese soaking tub.

The main room doors connected to the hallways are SO annoying.
So heavy and loud when it shuts!
Forget sleeping on the sofa sleeper or anywhere in the living area.
Sleeper quality was really lumpy and it caved in the center.
Only place you can sleep is inside the actual room since it's furthest from the main doors and the sliding door to help block out the noise.
I can't imagine how you can sleep in a normal suite.

Other than that, the bedding is nice, and the Japanese soaking tub with a view is great.
It's a very modern look with bright blues, purples and white.

They have great restaurants at Cosmo but you must try the Secret Pizza joint.
It's between a couple of restaurants and a narrow hallway that leads to you there.

In the early days, they used to make you use your card key to access your elevator to get to your rooms. It was annoying and now they don't do it anymore, but I can see why they did.

My March 2015 visit, we had an ""un-welcomed"" visitor on our floor.
Somehow a homeless person got in and was sitting in the hallway of our floor.
There was security asking him to leave politely. I was glad there was no struggle.
I felt really bad for the homeless guy.
He was REALLY homeless and looked like he was barely able to speak or even move.
Either way...this happened and yes I freaked a little but the smell was the hard part.
The smell came into our room and the hallways wreaked.
I had to call the front to see if they can do something about the smell.
Came out a couple hours later to see that it smelled beautifully...I wondered how they did it.",7,5,4

We got a pretty good rate going to Vegas mid week and the terrace room we got was gorgeous in the West tower over looking the Bellagio fountains and Paris Eiffel Tower.  The awesome $75 promotion voucher went into dinner at STK the first night which was pretty good but not the best I've had (compared to peter luger's and such in NYC). However the service and overall experience at STK was yummy.  The hidden pizzeria was, as promised, pretty darn good!  The Wicked Spoon buffet was just perfect, with tons of variety and high quality for most of the dishes.

Then we tried Marquee nightclub that Monday night, was able to get in for free and skip the line b\/c we were hotel guests. The club was SICK, great music, the expected high priced drinks, fun vibe especially around the pool area and even gambling tables.  Despite the club being on the other side of the hotel though, we heard the bumping bass til 3am. Fortunately, the nightclub was not open the other 2 nights we were there.
The Dayclub was a fun day in the sun with dance party music and pretty people, but the Boulevard pool would've been just as pleasant if not more just to relax instead.

The Chandelier bar had delicious cocktails and even a Cosmopolitan ordered at the gaming tables was great. I wish i had known to order them earlier in our stay but maybe it's good I didn't b\/c we came out even after our 4 day stay of gambling.

The check-in lobby is very neat with the ever-changing column display. It changes into a nude woman with a white background  to bookshelves, amongst other things. A very unique concept.

The rooms are very nice! We got the terrance one bedroom with a partial, but amazing, view of the strip. The king size bed was very comfy and the bed linens were fluffy and clean. This particular room was decorated very modern, eccentric, and chic. Loved that! There was a Japanese-style soaking tub along with a separate shower. I wouldn't recommend this room for folks who are expecting a bit of privacy as the bathroom\/shower is separated by glass (most city centre hotels are similar). However, I believe there was a panel that comes down for some privacy for the tub, but it was kinda tricky to figure out. Also, there are some white sliding doors that separate the bedroom from the living area, so privacy may be achieved that way if you planning on going with some friends. But please note that the lounge chair is probably not comfy to sleep in, just a heads up. 

The casino itself is gorgeous and ritzy. There's the chandelier bar and the large woman's high heel shoe that folks like to take a picture in front of. There are lots of different shops\/restaurants to explore. You can easily spend a weekend just hanging out at the hotel, but if that's not enough for you walk over to Aria and stop by the shops at crystals for some window shopping. It's mostly high-end stores so unless you've hit it big, you're more than likely going to be window shopping or passing on through. 

The table games are just OK here. You would think that there wouldn't be a difference between other casinos but, for some, there are differences. Kind of feels a little bit stuffy on the tables, I've experienced nicer and outgoing dealers at other places. 

For food, the Wicked Spoon is a good option if you like buffets. They offer mostly small, gastronomic dishes. Instead of giving you large portions like other buffets, they focus on smaller quality dishes. I happen to be a fan of it, some guys don't like it. To each their own, right? But for less than $40 buck you can't beat a buffet with bone marrow and Godiva chocolate, not to mention some of the best gelato you'll ever taste in your life. 

There is also a burger joint called Holsteins and they serve a yummy foie gras burger and this highly addictive, complimentary popcorn. They also serve up some good desserts, so save room for that. 

Overall, I would recommend this hotel for the couple that is looking to enjoy the finer things in Las Vegas (hotel, food, shops). This place probably wouldn't make economical sense for a bunch of friends looking to party in LV for the weekend, but the Marquee night club is one of the hotter clubs inside the Cosmo. If you are able to, I would check out the Marquee day club - all the pretty folks congregate there when daylight is out.


Tip: If you are feeling adventurous and happen to be craving pizza after a night of drinking, try to find the Secret Pizza hidden among the walls of this casino. Kinda hard to find so ask the staff. Pretty good New York-style pizza.

We were here for Presidents' Day weekend & Valentines, so it was just my boyfriend and I. We had booked outside of Cosmo and the woman who helped me advised that we ask if there were any rooms available with just 1 king bed.

CHECKING IN: After some confusion with which line do we stand in, we checked in :) The woman was kind & checked to see if there were rooms available with just 1 bed, for an additional $50\/night we were able to upgrade to a terrace studio. After a brief discussion, we declined since we weren't going to be in the room that much anyways. Something to be aware of -- since I booked with an outside company, (which I think a handful of consumers do to get the better rate), i was informed that the resort fee would be covered with the credit card HOLD upon check in. I even clarified this with the woman checking us in, she said yes - it is covered. This does not carry over during the remainder of our trip.

ROOM: We get up to our room, it's a city view room. But, we were facing the building and looking down at the tennis courts. Although we had declined the offer for an upgrade, we were going to be in Vegas for 4 days, we wanted to get our moneys worth. I called the room coordinator and requested another room & we got a courtesy upgrade! I wish I could remember the woman who helped me, she was so sweet! We didn't have to go back downstairs, she just told us what room to go to from where we were. Our room was amazing! We were upgraded to a terrace studio with an insane view of the bellagio fountains. It was so beautiful! The terrace studio was an incredible upgrade, we were so happy we called just to request a room switch. It had a living room, kitchenette, japanese soaking tub, and a larger shower. The view alone is worth it! The bed was comfy, i like fluffy pillows!

GYM: Boyfriend and I were super excited to check out the gym. We were in the west tower, so we were informed that's where the larger gym is. When we arrived, we were told that we had opted out of the resort fee & had to pay $20\/pp to use the gym. The woman who was working the front desk was kind & explained to us that there must have been a miscommunication and that it would be waived. We still had to $40 though to use the gym! Ridiculous. The gym itself was beautiful. All new machines and some state of the art stuff, including a boxing ring! 

FOOD: The restaurant selection was interesting - what was difficult was in the midst of walking around & wanting something quick, that didn't exist at this hotel. & it seemed as if there was always a line at the restaurants. The choice of restaurants are all impressive & I would have loved to try some of them. Hopefully next time! The concierge desk was very helpful in assisting with booking our valentines dinner. We originally had dinner booked at Encore, but the traffic on the strip was ridiculous bc of special events & we didn't want to leave our side of the strip. Since STK was fully booked, he recommended we try out SHe at Crystals and it was TO DIE! Wicked Spoon is the buffet here --- my favorite buffet on the strip, hands down. =)

CLUB\/Entertainment: Marquee is housed at Cosmo. We went to the first winter pool party & it was SO FUN! The new dome set up is pretty remarkable. If you're a guest at the hotel, you just give them your key and you have free entry. Ta da! Bruno Mars was at Cosmo the same weekend performing at the Chelsea, so we were able to see him at the After Party at Marquee. Rose.Rabbit.Lie is a new social experiment\/club\/show.. it was pretty awesome. If you're in the mood for something different and are with a group of people, I'd definitely recommend coming down to Rose Rabbit Lie at Cosmo!

HIDDEN Fees: We went downstairs after our work on the first day to figure everything out. The front desk tried to argue with me in saying that we had opted out of paying the resort fee. I explained to them that this was incorrect & that this needed to be corrected. They understood and assured me that the $40 would be credited back to us and we would be charged the hold fees as promised. Upon check out, we noticed the fees & approved them all. When we got back home we checked the damage & did notice that were a few charges we didn't see when we left.  I had to call the accounting office at Cosmo to have it all figured out & she event stated to me, ""I'm not sure why you were charged that. Are you sure it's from Cosmopolitan Las Vegas?"" I was so confused. After about 15 minutes of assuring her that the bank statement stated Cosmo we were able to figure it out & we were given credit back to our account. Had I had not called - we would have paid for fees we weren't responsible for. 

Overall - a beautiful room with a beautiful view, beautiful hotel. Some disappointment with the overall experience considering we had to speak to staff regarding all these fees popping up everywhere.",0,0,0

Loads of floating beds so you can bask in the sun, water umbrellas, cabanas, towel service, etc. my only complaint were menu prices. Good lord, $18 for two fish tacos and $36 for two glasses of margaritas (in clear plastic Dixie cups?!) If you're going to charge that much, can't you at least place them in fancy glasses? C'mon, it's the Cosmopolitan - up the serving wear.  Service at the pool was a little lackluster. They focused on groups with bottle service vs individuals trying to order.

Check in was simple and painless...though as to be expected (when you arrive at 2 PM) it was crowded. Lines seemed to pile up based on the hotels desire to up sell anyone who booked a basic room. Nothing wrong with the practice though many of the agents could stand to take a lesson from one of the guys who was more than prepared for the up sell (in that he was ready with pictures of every type of room on his phone) so that they don't hold up the lines.

Vomit in the hallway when we checked in took way too long for them to clean up (though in their defense I think it had been there and while and we were the ones who reported it so it had already started to set) and the stench of it lingered our entire stay.

We stayed in a terrace suite in the west tower and the room was plenty big enough for the two of us for the three days. We especially enjoyed having a kitchenette which offered us extra space for mixing our own drinks and re-heating leftovers from our two dinners out. Bed was super comfy...in fact we found it easy to sleep on even though we shared a wall with the service lift (if minor noises bother you stay away from the xx30s...odds are the same room on every floor have the same issue) 

One night we ordered room service ($88 (with tax, tip and fee) for two quesadillas and a bucket of Coors) and while the girls who took our order and delivered it were delightful the food was utterly lacking.

The best part of our stay was the staff at the bamboo pool...which coincidently had the fire the day before. I reckon in an attempt to convince folks all was well they offered daybeds and cabanas at a super discounted F&B minimum if there was a minimum at all. You'd think based on that coupled with the fact they're on vacation folks would lighten up but nope...not those near or around me. Folks were pissy, aggravated and just plain ol demanding over things that had nothing to do with their server (like how the pump that serviced the misters had burned down, or construction noise from the crews trying to fix it). Laura and Derrick were more than hospitable and turned what would have been a 3star review (seriously on account of the vomit and non-disclosure of the service elevator being on the same wall at check in the best they should get is three stars) into a 4 star. Avoid the crowds, cost and ridiculousness at Marquee and hang out right next door (literally they share a palm tree).

Accordingly, this review was in scope of comparison between the two.

Check-In:
SPG\/Marriott Gold members can bypass normal check-in lines via the Autograph Lounge and took less than 5 minutes.  Lounge access included complimentary coffee via new, touchscreen Starbucks machine.  Assorted flavors of tea were also available.  The Wynn\/Encore offers Tower Suites check-in with the same beverage amenities and expediency.

Advantage: Cosmo due to automatic Autograph Lounge (assuming SPG\/Marriott Gold) access regardless of the room-type you reserved.  In fairness, they never asked or verified my status.

Guest Relations:
Everyone at the Cosmo was courteous, helpful but...to be expected from a 5-star resort.  The Wynn\/Encore on the other hand, guest service seemed like an innate quality.  Only those predisposed with the highest customer service gene appears to have been hand selected by Steve Wynn.  This was and is monumental for a guest such as myself hailing from a lower socioeconomic class.  Elevates your Vegas experience.

Advantage: Wynn\/Encore

Room:
Cosmo is chic, modern.  The Terrace with 2-queens was spacious, comfortable and included a microwave, kitchen sink, 2 LCDs (even had a Netflix channel).  Bathroom offered his-and-her sinks, a bathtub with jet-streams and even auto dried.  The Wynn\/Encore interior and upholstery felt more luxurious and regal.  Wynn\/Encore Panorama rooms boasts two USB hubs built into the bedside fixtures and the ability to open and close drapes via touchpad.

Advantage: push

Views:
Stayed in the Chelsea Tower (floors 47-61) facing the Bellagio fountains and north of the Strip.  Balcony comfortably fits about 6-8 average BMI adults or roughly 12 asians.  The quintessential Vegas view.

Advantage: Cosmo

Location: Cosmo is at the heart of the Strip.  Crosswalk that takes you to the other side of the Strip (Planet Hollywood) bisects the Bellagio and Cosmo.

Advantage: Cosmo

Miscellaneous:
At the Wynn\/Encore ride share pickup is right at the main entrance.  It's nice not having to walk to a designated area even if it's only 30 yards away.

Advantage: Wynn\/Encore

Next time, I plan on staying at the Comso due to its prime location, easily navigable casino layout, Wicked Spoon brunch, quick check-in.",3,3,1

First to start off the staff was terrible. We had come early to check into the hotel at about 12 and was told our room is not ready and we will be called when it is ready. The room we had was the wraparound suite connected to the terrace one suite. So as we were waiting in the lobby one of the ""manager"" told us we can not wait there and have to go sit at the bar. When we went to the bar they told us we have to buy a drink or we can't sit there. So we had to sit outside since they wouldn't let us wait anywhere inside. I even tried to talk to him and tell him but he obviously didn't care and was very rude. So 4 came along and we didn't receive no call. We went back to front office and walked up and asked if our room is ready and they basically said no it won't be for a while but we can offer a wraparound suite and a terrace one suite on different floors? I at this point told them I specifically wanted them connected for a reason cause there was about 5 of us for my friends birthday. So all they said was ok well you're just going to have to wait. Ok, So 5 came along, then 6, then 6:30 we get a call to tell us our room is ready. They give us 4 keys and we go up to find out only one key works and it only opens the wraparound suite door. We call them they say they are going to bring up 4 keys or we can just go down and get them. So we wait for about an hour to get the 4 keys in which again only one of them is able to open the terrace suite door. We call them and tell them how bad their service has been to which they reply ok will give you a 100 dollar food comp. So we said ok that's fine. We order food service two burgers and get three cokes from the fridge and a bag of chips. Then at check out they told us we spent $234 on that we were flabbergasted. They tried to put on other charges and stuff that has been moved and we told them we had not touched anything but they swore up and down we had and they even had to send security up to check that we hadn't. The only pros about this room is that it had a great view that's it. I would never recommend anyone to stay here ever! So many more accommodating hotels instead of this over-priced, bad service, and poor management hotel. This year on memorial day I will look for a better spot.",0,0,0

I'm sitting at my desk in my 2 bedroom suite that cost me $1000 per night and I've been on hold for 15+ minutes to talk to the concierge. Today after house keeping cleaned my room they left a note on my desk to call if I wanted hand towels. 
I called for a crib and they told me they only had a ""play pen"". I asked if there was anything they can do and the person on the phone said ""we only have the playpen, do you want it or not?""

Staying here is worth every penny. I found a good deal for the Terrace Suite, and the room was amazing! This one-bedroom, two-bath hotel room was very spacious. It had a full kitchen complete with a microwave, oven, stove, refrigerator, freezer, and mini-bar area. It also had a small dining room area with a booth and a wooden table. The living room was comprised of a blue velvet sofa, flat-screen TV, and desk area. The hotel room also comes with a huge balcony which means you have a lot of space to throw a party if you wanted to. You also get a view of the Bellagio fountains. The bedroom area comes with a huge, comfortable King-sized bed and a reclining sofa. It also comes with another flat-screen TV. The larger of the two bathrooms was huge! It comes with 2 sinks, a large shower, and a large bathtub that has jacuzzi sets. Having your very own jacuzzi in your own hotel room was very relaxing! The bathrooms also comes with amenities such as shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, soap, toothpaste, and toothbrush. The room is also very high-tech. You just hit one button to turn on all of the lights and another button to turn off all of the lights in the entire hotel room. The closet also has bathrobes that you can use and complimentary slippers. 
The Cosmopolitan is also has an excellent location. It's right next to Bellagio so you can take pictures at the Conservatory. It's right across the street from Planet Hollywood. You can talk a walkway to get there and go shopping at the Miracle Mile Shops. The Cosmopolitan also has Wicket Spoon which is one of the best buffets on the Vegas Strip. It's so convenient to stay here. I would love to come back here again.
I didn't get to use any of their pools but I did take a look at them. If you want to get the Boulevard pool, you have to use the elevator at the Eastside Tower. If you want to use the Bamboo pool, you have to use the Westside Tower elevators. The entrance of the Comospolitan turns into a lounge at night with live music and dancers.

Like all offers, we do have terms and conditions as part of the offer.  The offer is valid for 30% off your next stay and is non -transferable and cannot be combined with any other offer.

We appreciate your business and hope you understand our T&C's around the special offers that we enjoy sharing with our known guests.
 
I look forward to hearing back from you by tomorrow, October 30th, 2015.  If we don't hear from you before then we will move forward with canceling all reservations over the two we are able to accommodate.


My reply....
Hello Erika,

Even after receiving your inconvenient, ridiculous and tacky email, we will still like to keep all four rooms. When I called to reserve four rooms the booking agent told me that I would have to do it online since it was an online offer but I shouldn't have any problems booking four rooms. So I did so. After my card was charged for the deposit of four rooms, I called cosmopolitan again to confirm everything went through and the agent I spoke to said yes and she would make it easier on me by having all 4 rooms attached to one reservation. In all of those times, not once was I told anything about there being a limit. Now a few weeks have gone by and I am receiving an email that only two rooms can be honored?! What kind of business is that?! I have family coming from Scotland, flights booked, reservations at rose.rabbit.lie, shows ,gambling etc. planned and you are emailing me about two rooms you cannot honor 30% discount but will give me 15% off?! With all the money we are going to be spending at the cosmopolitan you guys are worried and trying to get an extra, what, 200$?! On top of that 30$ resort fee for 4 rooms for two nights, 240$?! How tacky is that?!!! We are moving to our new home in the next week, transferring jobs, thanksgiving, Christmas, and vacations coming up and now we get this ridiculous email. How inconvenient. I have attached a screenshot of the offer I received and no where does it say anything about a limit.  I will be sending this to my friends  at AAA AND yelping your email to show how you treat your guests. Thanks again for that great email to start the holiday season!

Also, "" You have 24 hrs to answer or we will cancel all your rooms"" REALLY!?! Never have I dealt with professionalism like that... Kudos!

When I first walked in I was expecting to see something that would have me in awe from the other hotels\/casinos on the strip.  Well, it failed and I wasn't impressed with this place one bit.  

The Cosmo is nothing more than a plain old hotel dressed up with a bunch of chandeliers, mirrors, beads, and crappy wallpaper all over the place to make it look like it's all about glitz and glamour -- which it's not -- it's an eyesore.  This place looked more like it would cater to your typical douchebag hipsters or guidos from jersey trying to look hip by sipping cosmos and trying their luck at some gambling as if they were high rollers.  

Even worse, when you step outside and look at the entire left-hand side of the building from the entrance to the City Center, it looked like certain floors were still under construction while others looked like they were trashed with chairs and tables just hanging on the sides.  This place was a dump.

We thought why not? Since we never tried cosmopolitan. We arrived at cosmopolitan, jay greeted us at the lobby and took us to the front desk to check in. During checkin they had told us the rooms are comped and needed a card on file if we ever used rooms service or their minibar. We had a few friends who also came to visit from Taiwan and was staying at the Bellagio. So we checked out on the third night and the front desk had also told us the rooms are comped except we ordered room service for about $100. The next morning my friend check his bank account and found out we had been charged $1500 for both rooms. We contacted the hotel and they had told us there's nothing they can do because only jay can make changes to the account. 1) We had been told that the rooms are comped before and after our stay. 2) at hotels.com the rooms we stayed in we're only $150-$200 per night. 3) so there's no one we can file our complaint to besides jay himself who is the only person who is able to reverse our comped rooms and charge us after we leave? That's scamming. 4) so there's no manager or of more superior level than a host? Overall if not for this trickery I would recommend this hotel to anyone, but because of what happened I won't ever trust this hotel anymore. If you are planning to stay here just be careful of their hosts and their pricing.   

Update: I was contacted by my host today and he apologized for what happened. Then I spoke with *Emma* their customers relations regarding this problem. They comped 1 night for us in the end and told me we didn't rack up enough gambling points to have the last 2 nights comped. Told me I only gambled for about 2 hours and lost $2000... but I was down there for at least 8-10 hours and both me and my friend were playing $300-$2000 a hand. At our worst we were down $17,000.... we were gambling quite big even though we didn't know that we would be charged for the rooms if we didn't. I do appreciate them following up with me about my complaint so I'm giving them another star, but only after I yelped them. So I guess I should say be careful of their floor managers?

I'm a 20-something professional woman and this is perfect for girls and guys like me! It's modern, luxurious, hip and the crowd is gorgeous! No trashy white girls here getting white girl wasted (head on to Wynn or Hard Rock if that's your idea of a fun time). 

The staff is great! I love the decor of the hotel. It's flashy and hip but not in a Vegas kitschy way. If you love W Hotels, then this is the place for you. The rooms are gorgeous!

Pros:
Great Staff
Elegant Modern Decor
Good Music
Good Food
Great nightlife
Location

Cons:
Small Casino

Great for: Couples looking to party and have fun sans children. Bachelor\/Bachelorette parties, girls\/guys get away weekend. People in their 20's, 30's and maybe 40's. Great hotel for people who really want to party or lounge but not rave with 21 year old spring breakers.",5,2,2

It's located in about the center of the strip making it a reasonable walk to either end of the strip if you want to avoid a taxi everywhere and don't mind a little walking.  The view from our room on the Bellagio side was great.  The smoke control in the casino was the best of the ones we went into. We also stayed in the Venetian (even more beautiful) but the smoke in their casino was horrible!  Wish they were all smoke free like our state and many others that have done in public venues!

Good: 
-Everything from the shops, to the rooms to the day and night club says chic modern opulence.
-Good customer service, I had no real qualms with anything. All staff was friendly and gregarious. I had an issue with the TV and they sent someone up right away. One of the minibar sensors was broken, and when I called to have the charge removed, they comped me the 375ml bottle of grey goose!
-Not sure if this is for all rooms, but the junior suite I had came with a connectivity panel with audio jacks, USB ports, etc. that connected into the room's tv\/audio--something that is lacking in most hotels I've stayed at. The TV also had satellite radio! Lets you keep beats bumping all day!
--Parking and valet is included in the ~$25 daily resort fee (I think this true of all vegas hotels though)

Bad:
-Takes awhile for bellman to bring your bags up, and pick them up when you're all set.
-the ATMs in the hotel have a $6 service charge, on top of your bank's ATM fees, so don't rely on them if you don't have to.
-Marquee Day Club was probably the least fun of all the beach clubs I've been to (Daylight, Surrender, Tao). The attendees and bartenders just seemed douchier than the vegas average. Worst of all, this pool boy would constantly stalk around the pool yelling at people with drinks to move to the edge of the pool. He would go so far as to wade into the pool to yell at people that weren't paying attention to him, kicking them out if they ignored him too many times or gave him attitude. Total buzz kill. I'd dock points for their club but this is a review for the hotel so...


Side Note:
It's owned by Marriott, and this property gives pretty sweet perks to their members, so if you're platinum I really don't see any reason to stay anywhere else in Vegas.
--Your own exclusive check-in room that skips the line (I was in the regular check in line but somehow the front desk guy knew and led me to the platinum members room, woohoo for feeling important when you're on vacation.
--Choice of 500 pts or free lunch buffet for two at the Wicked Spoon.
--use of platinum member lines
--complimentary upgrades if available",1,2,1

They went out of their way this last trip to accommodate me. Their was a mistake but it was nothing bad and they made up for it and then some without me even asking them to do anything. 

There's a lot of restaurants to choose from at this place. There's even a hidden pizza place here. ;) 

They have amazing service all around. I'm sure things get crazy when they are busy and we were there 4th of July weekend. I was here for super bowl weekend this last year and march madness and went to all the parties and had a blast. 

I love that you can get a room with a balcony which we did on every trip.

They have two pools now too. One located in each tower which is way better than before when they only had one and I like what they did with the Boulevard pool. I would say if you don't have kids that this pool is more the place to be. There were fewer kids and I saw more kids at the Bamboo pool. Not that I have anything against kids. Just letting you know what I saw when I was there. Some parents want to be out of the way of people getting crazy and the other way around. ;) 

My turkey wrap was delicious too.  I was sad that half of it blew away. Drinks are like $17 but they were strong. I really loved the Daquiris. 

There are also many places to shop here too! I loved Jaleo (restaurant). The staff there was amazing and so was the food. I'll have to review them separately. There is a lot to see and do here and if you can get a room overlooking the Bellagio fountains then you have one of the best views in Vegas. Get up as high as you can too!

They all had mentioned how nice The Cosmopolitan was, but none of them had actually stayed there, just gambled, used the pool and ate there but they all loved it and assured me it was worth the price so I booked two nights there. I was extending a business trip for pleasure and had been staying at the Flamingo for a conference for the 4 days prior to my check in at the Cosmopolitan. I was so looking forward to staying in a nicer hotel since work had paid for the first part of my trip I got stuck in an older hotel. 

Upon arrival I was so excited and the man at the front desk was so sweet, but then I got to my room. It looked like someone had taken a nap in the bed, the tables were filthy and had not been wiped down and there were crumbs all over the floor worse of all the shower was disgusting, brown goo was dripping down the wall and the grout was black with mold in a lot of the places. I burst into tears because I had been waiting all week to stay in a nicer hotel only to get there and find such a disgusting mess. I immediately called down to the front desk and they sent up a house keeping manager who was nice but kept making excuses for how bad the room looked. Even the phone was filthy I didn't want to touch it. There was dust everywhere and the desk look like coffee had been split on it and no one had thought to wipe it up. 

The only good thing about this room was the view. It was BEAUTIFUL but after the housekeeping manager came to verify that the room ""was not up to standard"" She moved me to another room that was cleaner, but this room had a view of a parking lot. I was not happy. I essentially got downgraded. I had to tell her I will not take this room, the view is horrible. 

Finally she got me into a much nicer suite with a terrace. I was so exhausted by this time (it was going on two hours of trying to figure this out) I just wanted to be done and go lay by the pool. I had been in Vegas for 5 days and hadn't had a chance to lay by a pool at all because of work. By the time we had it all figured out the pool was closing. So I basically paid a 28 dollar resort fee to spend the day hoping they would get their act together. 

I honestly didn't look my new suite over that well. It had a lovely view but I had tickets to see a show at 7 so I had to get a move on. When I got back from my show I went to take a bath in their nice bathtub and there was dirt in the bottom of the tub and a ring around the tub, and to make matters worse there was black hair all over the place, at the bottom of the tub and in the drain. I took a shower instead because that looked cleaner. The vanity in the bathroom didn't look like it had been wiped down either. I wanted to puke. 

Finally I went to bed because was exhausted I fell right to sleep. In the morning when I woke up i pulled back the sheet only to find black hair all over the INSIDE of the bed. All over the sheets and pillows. The housekeeping manager stopped by later that day and had asked me how things were going and I told her about the dirt and hair and she didn't even flinch. No excuses no sorry she just told me to leave a note for the housekeeper to make sure to clean it better, but I am pretty sure that was her job not mine. I also went to have breakfast on the terrace that morning and found cigarette butts all over it and the chair did not look clean. The table had sticky goo all over the place. 

All and all I had a horrible experience. I do not understand how The Cosmopolitan gets away with having such a horrible cleanliness standards especially at a ""luxury property"" it was shocking, I've never stayed at a hotel with so many housekeeping issues. The only good thing was the employees by the bamboo pool and my view. The employees at the pool were excellent both days I was there, but it still didn't make up for the traumatic experience of actually staying at the Cosmopolitan.",4,2,1

Husband booked a room for my birthday weekend. :)

We stayed in room 1810, which has a huge bathroom, living room area, kitchenette (complete with a microwave, fridge & dishwasher!), a large bed, a balcony that overlooks City Center, two flat screen TVs and three places to hook up your phone and other jacks into the TV.  

They have buttons that say On or Off or Hello and Goodbye for the lights to turn on and off.  You can change the temperature of the room, turn on & off the lights, and set the ambiance all from the TV!  Awesome!

The downside- the shower.  Ok, with this being a handicapped room, there are extra spaces in certain areas.  I get all of that.  But when I was in the shower, there isn't a ledge to keep the water in the shower, so what we ended up with, was water all over the bathroom floor and onto the carpet in the hallway of our room.  Dang!

There were a couple things I was surprised about:
- The lightening in the bathroom sucked for putting on makeup.  Also, it doesn't have a magnified mirror.
- Calling housekeeping or the front desk was a wait time of 8 minutes last night!
- There is a coffee maker in the room.  You need ""pods"" to make coffee.  There aren't any ""pods"" in the room.
- I would have thought there might have been plastic spoons or stirrers because of the coffee- nope.
- There is a huge cut-out in the room, so when you are in the bathroom people in the living area can watch you!  There are pull down blinds, but you can still hear everything!  We had our friends up to our room to ""pre-game"" and no one wanted to use the bathroom!

Customer service is everything to me. We come there to relax and enjoy and the last few time I came there I wasn't happy at all. They don't treat you well anymore. They simply don't care! In terms of company policy to do certain things or if you had a complaint they didn't really seem to care so much. They give you a general excuse.

When we arrived, we realized that the air conditioner didn't work at all and was just recycling the hot air throughout the rooms.  We called down to have it fixed and they sent up an incredibly helpful mechanic, but hours after he worked his magic, it seemed to be back to recycling hot air again and did so for the rest of the weekend.  This wouldn't have been a huge problem if it wasn't the middle of the summer and 105 degrees outside.  We also had issues with our refrigerator, which wasn't working, and had to have it replaced...THEN we ended up waiting for an hour and a half to get linens for our pullout bed in the middle of the night.  They kept telling us that housekeeping was incredibly busy, but we didn't understand how that could possibly be the case when it was three o'clock in the morning and our entire floor was practically empty.

After the bachelorette complained to the manager, however, we were offered complimentary breakfast from the resident buffet restaurant, Wicked Spoon, which was absolutely amazing.  Best gourmet buffet brunch I have ever had by far.

You can see the pic below of the view from my room.

Everything was very luxurious, but there was food left in the microwave from the previous tenant. I called about it, and it was promptly removed by a very friendly member of their staff. They were great about the whole thing, and though I had picked up things from the mini bar (not knowing that I would get charged immediately), they removed the charges. Don't touch anything unless you want to pay for it! 

The accommodations and service were excellent. We dined at most of the restaurants and cafés in the hotel, I saw much of the conference space, and we had some drinks at the bars. It has a great central location, but the casino is definitely lacking. Just kind of blah.

For $30 more, I could upgrade me to a balcony, so I figured, why not?

O-M-G. I am such a fan of this place now. Its like, Caesar's Properties, who?

First of all, I was able to check us in via my mobile phone en route to Vegas.  I was told my room would be ready, and I could pick up my key between 12:00-4:00.

At 1:30 I went to the Audience Lounge and Michelle greeted me, verified my ID and credit card, and gave me room 2614 in the West Tower.  I knew my room wasn't going to be facing the Bellagio, but the room itself was amazing.  There was a sitting room, a divided bedroom, a grand bathroom with a sunken spa tub, a huge shower, dual vanity sinks, and lots of storage and chair space.  I also didn't have to worry about outlets, as there were plenty of plugs and USB outlets.

They provided plenty of toiletries by CC Bigelow, from mouthwash, lotion, soap, shower gel, shampoo\/conditioner, and cotton balls\/ qtips.  

The balcony was also great. A real balcony, too! Unfortunately being 100degree plus outside, we didn't take advantage of it, but it was still a nice view to have.

Overall, a great hotel.  5 stars, and the staff was excellent.  They treated me like my business was wanted, unlike Paris who treated me like my $20,000 point level was crap.

Worth every penny, including the $30 resort fee.",9,4,4

1. Marquee nightclub.  There are insane amount of people trying to get in and even for casino guests, the wait time will be 1 hour on weekend.  Once you get in, it's very crowded and one has to maneuver through traffic.  
2. The pool area is a bit small considering the size of the hotel and amount of guests staying at Cosmo
3. Self parking is a nightmare, it's not only HOT with no air flowing around during summer but also there are not enough stop signs in the parking lot, and you always see some crazy drivers (aka. casino clerks) rushing through an intersection without looking.

Access to good restaurants, Blue Ribbon was my favorite but there are a number of good ones.

There are so many pool parties and clubs to choose from on the Strip.  I recommend going to an establishment that cares about their guests.  Besides, having been to both day and night club at Marquee, my friends and I found the club to be overly packed with an OK crowd at best.  Many people left around midnight including us since we couldn't move at all.  The dance floor was also small for the top 40's music, and downstairs seemed like a rave with rude people.  Ghostbar, Rain, and Moon were so much more fun at the Palms.  Pure at Caesar's is worth checking out for the great view.   But if you still want to check out the newest club on the block, just beware you are in for a night of waiting in multiple lines (even with guest list) and being pushed around and waiting around for pricey drinks with poor management.

Below is my incident at Marquee Day Club:

My letter to the Cosmopolitan Marquee...ignored by the management :(

RE: Pool Platform Hazardous to Guest Safety

Dear Cosmopolitan Marquee Management,

I attended the Cosmopolitan Marquee day club at the pool on Friday, July 15.  Since there were music playing and fellow guests were dancing on the plastic box containers in the pool.  I decided to join in so I climbed on the clear raised platform by putting both of my knees up on the box; then I stood up on the box, which had a grid of raised squares with very sharp corners.  As I got on the platform, I felt a sudden pain on my left knee, then the crowd started to yell ""You're bleeding!""  I looked down to see blood gushing down from my knee so I hurried to get out of the pool.  

I informed the gentleman patrolling inside the pool of the sharp top of these box containers that are meant to be climbed upon.  He sent me to security by the door.  Then, a security personnel with black tattoos on both of arms came over, and I told him that the clear platform was very sharp and cut my knee.  He told me to follow him across the courtyard to get first aid.  I already wiped off the blood on my knee when I got out of the pool, but blood continued to run down my leg so I had to wipe it off again, and he made a mean remark, ""I would prefer it if you didn't use our towels, but oh well, too late now!""  Not only was the security staff inconsiderate, he was downright rude and sarcastic.  

At the first aid station, I told the Cosmopolitan\/Marquee employees that they should remove those boxes in the pool for guest safety.  The same security staff sneered and said ""Yea, I can't do anything.  People get stupid cuts like this all the time.""  I was shocked that no one cared about the danger the clear boxes pose to the safety of their guests.  

So before exiting Marquee, I tried to warn the staff about the dangerous hazard again.  I spoke with the service manager named Danny\/Denny, and he just kept saying ""We just got those boxes, and no one has ever cut themselves.""  He didn't seem to get the fact that my incident can be the first of many.  I had expected a little more consideration from the manager, but he treated me like I was just a drunk drama queen who got a small scrape.  I have attached a picture of the cut taken after the cut was band-aid; you can see that my skin was lifted off the knee by the sharp grinds on top of the clear box in the pool.  The finger in the photograph serves as reference of the size of the scrape; my skin is still raw and my knee is sore from the incident.

I am quite disappointed and shocked by the disregard and insolence of your staff.  There was no compassion or courtesy from the staff who handled this incident.  The management must be aware that the top of the boxes have a sharp top, which can easily hurt your guests.  The unsafe boxes placed inside the pool need to be removed or reconstructed to insure guest safety; it is a lawsuit waiting to happen as your staff just shrugs off the incident and disregards guests' concerns.  I hope your prestigious hotel and popular club, especially being the newest additions to the Strip, would offer your guest a safe environment on your premise and train your staff to treat guests with courtesy and respect.  Thank you for your consideration.",8,1,2

If I hadn't had an issue I'm sure I'd think this hotel was awesome, but it was once I needed the service of the staff that I realized the only thing this hotel had to offer was it's looks. 

I had an issue with booking a cabana. They tried to charge me 3x more than they originally quoted me within the same phone call and I was literally told, ""Ma'am, if you don't book at this price we can just offer the cabana to someone else who will.""

While at the pool, I witnessed a waitress agree to waiting on a group of males without them paying for a cabana in exchange for a 40% tip while the people in the cabana next to them complained because they had to spend a minimum of $3,000 for their cabana.

Also, 2 lights were out in our room and we continuously called for maintenance only to end our trip without ever getting it fixed because no one showed up!

They pride themselves on having Marquee Nightclub in their hotel and yet when an issue arose at the nightclub, suddenly they describe it as ""a separate entity."" A friend of mine had an issue at the Marquee and no one there cared to help her. So we called the hotel asking what the protocol was for dealing with situations like that which we had just experienced. The manager of The Cosmopolitan who I spoke to said, ""I'm sorry you had an unpleasant experience. That's all. What? Are you expecting me to give you a free room for the weekend to make it better? Because I'm not gonna do that!"" Mind you, I never asked for that. I guess she just got defensive because she couldn't answer my question.

Everyone is rude and had their own agenda. I'd rather stay at a hotel that has style AND OFFERS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. A cool looking hotel does not make up for horrible service. I WOULD NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN.",2,0,0

The Marquee club was very popular and it's patrons basically took over the entire 2nd floor public spaces including all the lounges. Hey if you're young an single, great but it was a tad too pretentious for this 40 year old.  Tried to get a chair by the pool at 10am, all of the poolside spots were taken and 80% were ""reserved"". A poolside bed will set you back $200, we were forced to find chairs on the second level areas, what a nice way to treat your guests! The hot tub was hijacked by obnoxious drunk douchebags by 10:00am, we left. This is a PARTY hotel, I much preferred the sophistication of the Encore.

The room itself is nice and modern and reminds me a lot of NYC hotels, however while unpacking and getting settled in the wall and ceiling lights kept flickering on and off, my bf and I eventually turned them off because it got annoying.

Besides the lighting problem while roaming the room to see all the amenities I found myself stepping on a sticky kitchen floor and touching sticky cabinets. To make matters worse as I was walking to the window of our patio I stepped on a live moth! This will be the first and last time we stay here, save your money and time!!

EDIT: I waited till the last day of staying here and it still has pros and negatives. On our second day we ordered room service for breakfast - the price was out the door for mediocre food.

I was hoping the experience would be just like everyone says it is. 'Vegas is... VEGAS! *wink wink.. hint hint*' I stayed here for 5 nights because my cousin was having her wedding in Vegas. The whole hotel experience was completely awful. The hotel receptionists were abruptly rude and incompetent. And you figure, you are paying a costly amount to stay at a place like this ($$$), you'd figure their customer service would be phenomenal.

To sum it up, every time you asked a question.. the answer varied from receptionist to receptionist with no definite answer. Their idea of professionalism seemed to be described as: it's okay to have attitude with hotel guests, it's okay to look annoyed, it's okay to be snappy, forward, and catty. 

All this hotel room dilemma didn't get solved until we spoke directly to their hotel manager. But still, after all the commotion that happened in the lobby, it basically spoiled my perception of this grand hotel. 

One thing that I did love about the hotel was definitely the entire downstairs. No hotel can compare to how 'lovely' \/ 'girly' it looks. It's beyond beautiful. I would think every lady would appreciate their decor. Their chandelier stair case is absolutely stunning! If you're having a night out with the girls, stop by and take a picture here. 

Their rooms are not as great as you would hope. (Especially not for the price you are paying) It's a simple room. Decor is blah. The best thing in the room was the wall paper in the toilet room. The only thing I liked was their balcony scenery of the strip. I would definitely come back to visit their casino\/dining\/shopping areas but will not come back and stay.",6,2,2

I wonder if they expected it to be this popular?  The casino in general was confusing to me but maybe that's because I'm never there.  It wasn't just me though; it wasn't until I asked a fourth employee that I was able to locate the will call desk for the boulevard concert venue.  In general everyone here seems helpful and having a good time and the crowd is definitely younger and more into partying.  The underground parking is a challenge.  Maybe crank up the lighting a bit...I have a feeling that's what purgatory will look like.

I saw the band New Order play outside at the pool.  I felt the show was great despite not being a huge fan of pool concerts.  The pool deck is small and cramped...there must have been 4,000+ people crammed out there.  Acoustics are marginal given the environment but the set list was epic including 4 songs from Joy Division.  Those that left early before the encore missed out...Losers!  A true fan stays until the house lights come up and the band is gone for good.  All in all it was a great experience and I had the chance to meet some cool people from Yelp for the first time.",2,3,4

When I travel I usually tend to go for the less trendy hotels and opt for cheap. But, I'm so stoked that we went ahead and got the Cosmopolitan. I wouldn't have changed it for the world. We also had a view of the Bellagio fountain without paying more for the terrace view. 

Some of the amenities I enjoyed were the Chelsea pool (located on the 14th floor). I want to check out movie night tonight but don't think I'll get the chance. But, that is located on the 3rd floor. There's a staff member there to check in your guest and has an escalator to take you to that pool. 

I would recommend eggslut for breakfast, it was good! They also have a juice bar to help you refresh. We really didn't do housekeeping because we weren't in our rooms enough. 

All and all, the crowds were my type and the decor was stunning. It is my first time in Vegas so when we came in through the entrance I was marveled for interior design.",1,0,0

Need I say more? This place is awesome! My only gripe would be how unorganized the check-in line was, but overall the decor of this place is sleek and modern, exactly what I like! They offer you bottles of water as you wait in line and all staff are friendly. The room is very comfortable and and spacious which is nice if you'll be going with a non-gambler or non-drinker and will be spending some time in your room.

We've also stayed in the Terrace Studio which does not have the Japanese-styled bathtub but in my opinion, I find the studio layout to be more cute. I personally favor staying in the studio over the one bedroom. 

One of my other favorite things here is the Secret Pizza!",0,0,0

It boasts a lot of elegance and class.  Don't be fooled though.  The nightlife brings out the horn toads.  Tonight this place was packed with men trying to hit on women, women trying to hit on other women and men trying to hit on other men :) LOL.  As pricey as this place can be, it attracts a large young crowd, making the place super hip and trendy in my eyes.  I often times hit the three story Chandelier bar, Marquee and sometimes the restaurants on the third floor.  All in all, I think the Cosmo has a lot to offer.

Everything in the room was clean and beautiful. I had s perfect view of the Bellagio fountains from my room and loved the view. The bedding and pillows were super comfy and I slept better then I did in my own bed. 

The only thing I would say that turned my five star to a four was the service. The guy that checked me in was a ""hot shot"" jerk. He almost insulted me for staying a night at the Bellagio like well we're totally better kind of thing. His approach was very demeaning, did not care for it and not a great way to start off my stay in this hotel. 

The parking lots were a little confusing because there was an east and west and I ended up on the opposite side of the building and had to walk all through the casino to find the elevators to my room. But the parking garage itself was amazing because it has lights on the top that are red or green to let you know if the spot is open or closed and right when you drive in it also says  the levels how many spots handicap and regular are available. The most ingenious thing about parking lots ever invented.",2,0,0

This is strictly a review of the Casino and the ambiance.  I was not able to partake in being a hotel guest this time around.

The atmosphere feels very posh and high end.  And whoever designed those chandeliers probably doesn't have to dust them, that looks like a full time job.  I can picture their business card now, ""Cosmopolitan Chandelier Cleaner and Expert"".  

A bunch of great bars inside and the Wicked Spoon Buffet is here as well, albeit a bit of a trek to get to, that was like a maze.  I felt like people were watching us and laughing as we had to back track multiple times.  

Casino offers lots of slot variety and although I played I did not win big.  

I would recommend the Cosmo to the younger and more youthful crowd as this seems to offer the backdrop for a fun packed evening.",5,1,2

With huge changes all over the place, one of the biggest was the completion of The Cosmopolitan. With millions of dollars invested in this hotel & casino, would the Cosmopolitan stand true as the naughtiest hotel on the Strip?

As for now, I'll be focusing mainly on the casino. I'll write an update on the rooms and bars at a later time.

DECO: 5 stars

It has to be said that if atmosphere was the sign of character, this place would be that super hot model making all the other hot models feel not so hot. Think a Megan Fox or a Tricia Helfer in a skin tight black dress with red trim around the dropping neckline. Now imagine her standing in a DMV line with the line of miserable people, and she's staring right at you, eyes locked and lips flushed. If you're getting turned on or hot & bothered, that's what the deco is at The Cosmopolitan. 

The place is like walking into a epicenter of fashion, liquor, and class. Boutiques line and hug the upper levels of the casino before you head down the escalator. The place is so plush that you'll see people taking pictures just on this level. You know why? Because from the second level, you'll notice the Cosmopolitan doesn't have just one chandelier, it has a whole population of them. Small ones, glass ones, monolithic ones, blue ones. The place is screaming with excess of class, and it strangely works. As gaudy as it might sound, it actually captures the eyes, and makes you anticipate what could be waiting downstairs.

Well, if the upper level was impressive, just wait till you actually walk to the casino floor. The place is plush, and when I say plush, I mean imagine being scurried away by your loins to a room designed by high class prostitutes and unicorns. Yeah, that's one wrong-right combo. 

The place is decked out with subtle atmospheric lights, rich hues of sensational colors, and the staff is dressed to the nines. This is the Michael Kors of casinos, the House of Ninja, the Sam Rockwell of style. This might be the first hotel & casino you step in where you'll feel under dressed if you're not dressed to impress. So make sure you impress. When you're here, you feel like somebody, and that's very hard to pull off for any casino.

PLAYER'S CARD: 4 stars

The Player's Club they have here is called ""Identity"", and I have to say it raises the bar for what player's clubs should be. The moment you enroll, you get free slot play like most casinos. The difference though is what comes after. When they email you to welcome you to your membership, they offer free incentives. Mine was a free year's subscription to Zagat. Also, they have some of the greatest incentives to come back and play. Just a little while ago they offered to pay you back up to $100 in slot money if you lost that much playing with your own money. So essentially, you get another $100 to lose. Free money = best money.

CASINO: 3 stars

With all this luxury oozing out, you have to think the casino is decadent too, right? Unfortunately, this is where they drop the ball. Maybe because the Cosmopolitan was aiming to keep that atmosphere of suave and classy, with bars throughout the floor, but the casino part of the hotel was quite small. It was probably one half the size of a casino floor like Bellagio's. On top of that, the games are all quite pricey. That standard would fit for such a bourgeois casino, but for those who are tighter on the wallet, this place will take your money quick. It's not necessarily a bad thing, since it fits the theme of the casino, it just might deject some from playing here.

CONCLUSION

For most people, we all want to walk into our high school reunion, and have all eyes looking at us with envy because we're such hot stuff. The Cosmopolitan is just that in Las Vegas. As one of the new kids on the block, the Cosmopolitan sets high standards for what a decadent Las Vegas experience should be. From the stylish and sexy faces every where you look to the personal experience the staff presents, the Cosmopolitan will no doubt rise as the ""Secret Getaways"" most taboo, and succulent, place to visit.",4,4,3

Just horrific managerial skill. I don't know how he got a job at a 5 star hotel. His superior called me back and was amazing and tried to accommodate us but we were too tired so we went to the Wynn and slept. 

To many options in Vegas to stay somewhere really expensive with dirty water.

I've been staying here for years and if you can afford it I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. For the 20 somethings to about 50 looking for some fun this is the spot. The experience here covers everything you need in Las Vegas. The interior design is chic & sexy. You will see beautiful people dressed up to go out every night. They have a decent club. Their bars and lounges are really cool. The highlight of the Cosmo has to be their room balconies over looking the strip or their endless foodie options. Every restaurant is beyond EXCELLENT. If you want the best Greek in the country eat Milos, Sushi -Zuma, NYC style Pizza- secret pizza, burgers, milkshakes, and salads- Holsteins, steak- STK, the best egg sandwich of your life- Eggslut, the list goes on. The rooms are super nice also. I'm pretty sure all have a balcony. If you are a baller stay in the penthouse with the best butlers in Las Vegas.",3,0,0

Check in was fine, but when I got to the room I noticed several things that were not up to Marriott standards for any hotel.

1. Dirty underwear and hooker cards all over the closet. Simply went to get the iron and found them all over. Gross!
2. Blood or semen stains on the shower curtain. Looks like they had been there awhile. Makes me think of a motel 6
3. Shower had poor water pressure and did not get fully hot. Also did not drain well and after the first shower had soap scum all around the floor.
4. Refrigerator already had items missing from it which I think they charged me for. Have an $11 charge on my bill for something and it doesn't even tell you what it's for.
5. Phone did not work. This is what finally prompted me to complain. Went down to the front desk and told them everything. They sent someone up to look into the phone problem and had no idea about my other complaints. The guy was mostly just making excuses for everything and said he would give me $50 off the room.

In all it wasn't the casino or restaurants that were bad, but the customer service and the room. Something I'm sure Marriott and other guests would like to hear about. There are better hotels on the strip for the money.",4,1,0

We got to our room, the woman at the desk really hyped up the room saying oh you're getting one of our most requested rooms that have a beautiful view of the bellagio fountains and the strip.  We open the door to our room and my friend instantly said it smells like a skunk in here!  And I agree it had this faint smell of a skunk or musty smell in the room.  Excited to see the view of the fountains we open the curtains to find a window so dirty on the outside you couldn't see any fountains!  I've NEVER been to a hotel with windows so dirty you cannot even see out of them!

Overall the room wasn't that clean for what we were paying.  The lighting sucked.  the bathroom light didn't work, the ceiling light bulbs were going in and out in the main area of the room.  It's kind of a more girly hotel, so to have such poor lighting in the room is very disappointing!

Also, when they cleaned our room, they actually took soap and 2 other items they provided the first day off the shelf which I definitely thought was strange, usually they give you more the next day.

I'm only giving this place 2 starts because at least the sheets were clean and the casino itself was beautiful with all the chandeliers.  But honestly it only deserves 1.5 stars, you should never have dirty windows or a smelly room.  Won't be staying here again!",1,0,1
