I love the blue sky and clouds mural on the ceilings and the light effects they do to mimic day light. The casino floor is nice, but I think Paris thinks a bit too highly of themselves because their table minimums were awfully high, and their poker tourneys were set at buy-ins that were so high that they were only filling half of the field.

However, Paris does have one little thing that sets it apart from every other place on the Strip: their breakfast buffet. This breakfast spread they have, set in a Parisian village theme, is absolutely out of control. I have never in my life seen so many different options on a breakfast buffet. At $30\/person, it's steep, but it is an experience you'll never forget. In the ""you're not going to believe this just happened to me"" Vegas-story fashion, my buddy and I are standing in this incredibly long line waiting to pay our $30 each and these two incredibly cute girls walk out of the buffet area and headed over to us. They asked us if we'd like two free coupons for the buffet; of course we took them graciously and chatted for just a minute. They had to go to the airport and weren't going to be in town to use them. They informed us we didn't have to wait in line, we could just walk in -- and walk in we did. Certain things in life are just perpetual game-changers, and Paris' breakfast buffet is one of them.

Everything you ever wanted or could dream of wanting for breakfast was there. Since that experience, it's been a tradition that every time I'm in town, I go to Paris for breakfast only. They can keep the gaming and sell that to the tourists. If I want to game, I'll go to the MGM, Rio, Caesars or the Bellagio. In fact, Paris could just close its casino as far as I'm concerned and keep the breakfast buffet open. This is also where my nickname ""Bullmoose"" originated, so it's been a great story to tell!",0,0,0

It was a time when we were both overly hungry and needed food ASAP.  The sandwich from the hotel was great the first bite and it got exponentially worse after every bite, since I was no longer starving.  Then we headed to that madeline's bakery that had just opened and ordered some eclairs.  Those eclairs looked good but the dough was gummy and soggy.  The cream tasted like Jello instant vanilla pudding and the chocolate outside tasted like Jello chocolate pudding.  All in all, everything looked pretty but didn't taste great.",0,0,0

I stayed in a standard room with my family for the first two nights, and the room was just alright. Nothing fancy or impressive about it. For our wedding night, we booked a suite and requested early check-in. When I attempted to check in that morning, the lady told me that a suite wasn't available yet and to try again later. Totally understandable since I knew that early check-in wasn't guaranteed. The thing that got me though was when I asked her to please call me when a suite became available. She replied, ""This is a big hotel. We don't do that."" WOW. I'm sorry that I'm not worth a simple phonecall, especially when I am getting married in your hotel and paying nearly $20,000 for the chapel and catering services!

Their parking garage is short walking distance similar to Montel Carlo, however be aware is been shared by Bally as well.  You had to walk by army of slow machines and tablets before you can get to the lobby or elevator.  For guess will be okay but if you are a self-parking hotel will not like that idea at all, the check-in lobby had many beautiful Chandeliers.  

One thing irony, they had dancer near the gaming tablet.  I just do not see any French Connection with that.  However, does had entertainment value and definite can cause distraction to those who play that. 

I was not that fan of their interior style, a fan like it but it does not see too impressive or most romantic.  The crowd was mostly in older 40 and higher.  I do wanted to go up the Eiffel towel in the near future.",13,12,14

We arrived well before check in time (which is 4 pm).  My room was ready, which was great, but I was told there would be a $25 or so fee for early check in.  I didn't want to deal with the bell desk holding my luggage, so I just paid it.  But, it's frustrating when the room is sitting there cleaned and ready to go and they still charge you.  I get that Caesars is a corporation and needs to make money, but I feel like more and more places in Vegas (not limited to Caesars properties, see the parking charges at MGM joints now) are nickel and diming you at every opportunity.  Very annoying.

The room is below average for comparably priced hotels on the Strip.  The center of the room has a sort of wardrobe cabinet with 2 areas for hanging clothes on either side and a small fridge in the middle.  The room safe is in there as well.  It was serviceable and got the job done, but it had clearly seen better days.  Many scuffs, scratches, dings, etc.  2 of the magnetic doors didn't work, so you had to kind of rest of the door instead of actually getting it closed.  And, it is located in the center, which means they put the TV on the wall off to the side.  Not a great location and difficult to see from certain areas of the room.

The bathroom had a lot of counter space, which was nice.  There is a small square shower and a soaking tub.  It's similar to the basic bathroom at Bellagio, but not nearly as nice, smaller, and clearly more worn.  While we were staying at Paris they were doing quite a bit of construction (which was loud at times).  I don't know if they are renovating all of the rooms, but the renovation is a good idea.  Given other options on the strip, an upgrade to the accommodations is sorely needed at Paris.

The casino is decent size with several areas for table games, including the massive forest of slots and video poker machines that populate all casino floors.  The sportsbook is on the smaller side, but we were able to get a table to ourselves to watch college football on Saturday.  At a lot of the larger books this is difficult during football season.  But, we only had a cocktail waitress for the first half, during the second half of our game we had to go to the bar to get drinks.

There are some solid restaurants at Paris, including Gordon Ramsay Steak and Mon Ami Gabi.  Additionally, you've got several quick places to get a bite, including JJ's Boulangerie and the Creperie.  The line for crepes can get long depending on the time of day.  I haven't eaten at the Paris buffet in years, but when I went I recall it being better than average.  Also, during my stay, I never saw lines that were close to the massive lines you'll see at the more popular buffets (like Bellagio or Caesars).  

I would stay at Paris again if i were offered a good deal for the room, and if I had a newly upgraded room.  For the price you pay at Paris, you can get a much nicer room at other locations on the Strip.  But, if they renovate well, I'd come back.",4,0,0

While this review is largely a gripe about the Mandara Spa at Paris, I'm making it a review of the Casino\/hotel because of the utter scam of their resort fees. I stayed in a newly renovated Burgundy Room. It is fresher, but lacking any kind of notable luxury. If you're paying for the room, they are not worth paying extra. I've stayed at both Paris and Planet Hollywood a number of times, loved these properties and was usually comped rooms. Now, even if you are comped, you must pay a resort fee of $30+ a day. They attach value to it by telling you that all guests can use the spa facilities, and that free wi-fi is included. The Wi-fi is functional, but slow. My phone data is faster. If it wasn't included, I actually wouldn't have any real reason to use it... my phone and tablet both have data plans, and I like to spend my time at a casino gambling, eating, drinking, and sleeping. It has almost no value for me. 

Likewise, if you don't pay the resort fees (and the only folk that don't are, I believe Seven Stars members), a trip to the Spa facilities is about $25\/day. This is a fee that I've gladly paid in the past to slip in a couple times a day and use the jacuzzi, steam room, and sauna, then perhaps sit and read in a chaise to relax, while enjoying some juice and water to rehydrate after the rigors of casino fun.

However, now those services are ""included"" (a clever way for you not to be able to ask for a refund of the spa fee, a thing you would certainly do, if you pay it a visit). The Spa facilities at Paris are very very tired. Beyond that, they are barely functional. I'm pretty good at overlooking small annoyances, but my trip to the spa today was an exercise in futility.

When I arrived, I was issued a locker key. They also used to offer sandals, so that you felt a bit safer walking around the wet ground that was probably crawling with micro-organisms. I changed into the robe in the locker, used the toilet (that was the only functional thing in the spa, by the way, but I have one in my room too), and prepared to shower. 

- The shower room was dim, and noticeably infested with gnats or small flies. They were probably just after the water, but their presence speaks to poor cleaning in the shower rooms. 
- The shower area was bereft of towels. I had to acquire one from the front locker area (but even then, the towels were not well-stocked).
- After showering, I turned the timer for the jacuzzi and nothing happened. I waddled out to the men's locker room reception area, and waited for the attendant to appear (there is no bell to summon them, and they're understaffed).
- He informed me that the Jacuzzi was fine, but the jets weren't working (a previous guest had hit the emergency stop button, and it needed to be reset by professionals). He said the water was hot, just not moving.
- I went back to the jacuzzi, stepped into the water, and it was only slightly warmer than room temperature, so didn't feel that there was any reason to soak. Plus, tepid water combined with no jets means ""welcome bacteria."" This tub should have been off-limits, and the debris in the bottom was alarming.
- I shrugged it off and decided to try the steam and sauna. The steam room was okay, but smelled off, like the mechanisms hadn't been cleaned properly. I stayed for a few minutes, but decided to try one last thing...
- The dry sauna. The temp there was no warmer than the less-than-tepid jacuzzi water. Surely not more than 80 degrees F. There didn't seem to be an accessible dial where it could be turned up.
- I gave up. I was dripping from the steam room, so returned to the shower to clean up, where there were still no towels. So, back to the front, get a new towel, shower with the flies, and dry off. 

Every place has bad days, but reviews of the spa are bad for a reason. This doesn't appear to be a lone case. I recently stayed at the Harrah's in Reno, NV, and had an almost identical experience at their spa facilities (also ""included"" in the resort fees). Nothing worked, everything was dingy and smelled like infection.

The problem with including services in mandatory resort fees is that you can't really ask for a refund or just avoid the services, and if you never use them, you don't realize that they aren't worth paying for, which gives Caesar's Entertainment NO REASON to fix anything. 

My tip to the stalwart: tell them you will not pay the resort fees until the services are worth the price. They very clearly state what the fees are for; if you don't need Wi-fi and don't want to spend time in a broken down spa, these fees do nothing. Refuse them.

There's not enough space for me to review the tedious ""Express Check-in"" or the under-staffed registration desk. Make this right, Caesar's! I used to love you, but get more value from Cosmopolitan, and I can gamble *anywhere.* - TR member, Platinum, formerly Diamond, probably soon gone.",3,1,0

We were upgraded to a suite on the 29th floor over looking the Eiffel Tower, the pools and the water show at the Bellagio. The room itself was lovely. We had a dining area, a living room with plasma TV, 2 bathrooms(one with a shower and one with a large jacuzzi tub) and a large bedroom w\/plasma TV. We were totally enthralled with our room and our view, but sadly, I cannot give it 5 stars for the following reasons:

-the bedding was old and getting threadbare-it kind of itched a bit at first.
-the towels were also old. Not what I would expect for a suite that can go for over 3K per night.
-no robes provided
-light switches were strangely located and the lamp set-up near the bed was less than stellar.

We ordered room service for breakfast and while some things were wonderful(they brought the requested candle in the grapefruit), most of the food was generic and not nearly as good as the breakfasts we had at the Renaissance. 

I would stay here again, especially in a suite overlooking everything again.",6,2,8
27635,nr9XYwyHilVDqHJthLYqRA,XiDBadkKO38HKd8g1olucg,ii8sAGBexBOJoYRFafF9XQ,1,2017-11-14,"We are local Las Vegas residents.  We wanted to treat our kids to a staycation with a nice night away.  We also wanted to support our community following the mass shooting.  The financial impact from the shooting has hit the strip hard and as 20 year Las Vegas locals, we thought bringing our business there was a good way to help.

We arrived and checked in.  The room was beautiful with a great view of the pool and neighboring hotels.  We ate dinner on property (Mon Ami Gabi--delicious!) and walked the strip a bit before heading to our room.  We all fell asleep around 10 but were awakened shortly thereafter by loud thumping music and someone on a loud speaker.  It turns out our room was directly under the rooftop nightclub.  For the next hour we all tried to sleep but the shaking and pounding and yelling was far too much to handle, even for a heavy sleeper like me.  We finally called the front desk around 11 and requested a new room but we were told the entire resort was sold out.  We were offered ear plugs!  We declined and begged to speak to a manager, but they refused.  Around midnight we had experienced enough.  We packed our bags, headed down to registration, checked out, and headed home.  The staff was indifferent and unconcerned.  They seemed to be reading from an old, tired script.  Clearly they have heard the same complaints for years.   

We were lucky, we live nearby and could easily go home.  I feel awful for those poor, unsuspecting visitors who travel far from home to experience a trip like ours only to be let down by an awful situation that the resort has no interest in remedying.  I suggest anyone coming to Vegas look elsewhere.  There are plenty of beautiful hotels priced within the same range that offer better customer service and don't stick unsuspecting guests directly below an all night rooftop club.",2,2,0

It's because Paris actually has redeeming qualities. Now, you won't find those qualities in the basic room, but, you will find them as soon as you get off the elevator.

Paris has some of the most fun clubs and restaurants. In particular, the dueling piano bar is a win on any given night. Good selection here, and fun crowds, but get there early. Also, Mon Ami Gabi, the strip-front French chain restaurant, is phenomenal, but that's for a different review. Another part of Paris' allure is that addicting crepe stand right outside the buffet. Mother of god.

Otherwise, Paris is a bit crammed because of all the attention it gets with visitors to the fake Eiffel Tower. The casino does not have a very winning flavor to it, although we did comfortably sit and play roulette one night for a good three hours and still finished inners. But I think that was more chance than a standard.

The other gripe about Paris is how cramped the buffet is. It simply does not have that wide-open, spacious dining room like the others. It feels more like a mini, turnpike rest stop. The food is really good, but the price is way too high and it simply isn't comfortable to navigate.

Overall, you're spending to stay here, and you're better off paying an additional $20-$30 a night to upgrade to a 4 or 5 star hotel with much better amenities.",2,1,1

We really thought the Paris was a top notch hotel prior to arrival but we're stunned with disappointment. Do yourself a favor and go down the street to the beautiful and luxurious Mandalay Bay. (It's cheaper too!) We ended up paying an extra $50 a night to upgrade to a clean room, I feel that that cost should've been waived due to the filth we experienced:( THE worst Vegas hotel I've seen. If zero stars was an option I'd rate this hotel as zero stars. Bummed

UPDATE: after the room upgrade it dawned on us that this must be a common tactic of the hotel to force their customers into paying more upon arrival.  They offered us the upgrade initially at additional cost and we declined. But upon inspecting the first room and its filth, upgrading was a must. Pretty shady business in my opinion. On the plus side the upgraded room was cleaner, but still worn down.  All of the photos I've posted are of the upgraded room! What a joke. This entire hotel needs a major renovation.

We are from California and we decided to stay at the Paris as it is centrally located across from Bellagio and a short walk to Caesars. The room we stayed was a  suite in room 729P. It was a great big room--I felt like it was a small apartment. It was comfortable and came with the bare necessities. That is just it--the bare necessities. For the price we paid, it would have been nice to have some robes like many high end hotels offer and a makeup mirror. I was excited to have a vanity,  but the lighting was poor and so I didn't use it. The  safe was on the shelf in the closet and was so high that you cant see inside of it. Not very smart to put a safe so high--what if I was very short person? What if I was elderly and couldnt reach?  I also hate having a sink in my bedroom, it makes me feel like I am staying in a motel rather than a nice hotel. I decided I don't like Parisian decor-- flowery and outdated.

We went over to Caesars and they did have good tequila--come on, not everyone drinks vodka and gin. But to be fair, the service was very good and always has been when we go to the bar at kiosk.   The workers are friendly.   The Fitness room was well equipped and had water and fresh fruit. Why we have to pay a resort fee to use it-- I don't know. They allowed one device for free WiFI--really, most people have their own device--Get with the 21st Century digital community!    Paris is expensive for what you get.

The room is pretty standard and spacious. The bathroom is pretty big, with a bath tub, standing shower, a sink and toilet. The a\/c unit works pretty well except when I try to raise the temperature over 72F, it starts giving out this burnt odor. Another thing is we were given a room that's connect to another room through a door, and whenever they're being loud, I can kind of hear. But it's not too bad considered I'm not in the room most of the time.

The location is also pretty good, consider it's like in the middle with Bellagio across the street and Cosmopolitan just diagonally across. 

There are several cafe down at the casino level, and it's nice to grab some pastry to go and head to the pool. The swimming pool here is pretty nice. I said no outside food allowed but I see everyone bring stuff in, and they're okay with it as long as it's not glass bottles and it doesn't contain alcohol. They put music on and there's a bar that serve greatttt frozen strawberry daquiri.

Also try their buffet, it's pretty good too.",1,0,1

Casino: very small and looks kinda boring. not sure if this is the place to gamble because everyone's face just looks so traumatized. either they won a lot of moolas or they just lost everything...

Upon enter the room, we discovered some thousand years old stains in the tub & bed sheets. If it's something small we can just let that go but it was so obvious! Try to get someone to assist never easy, I think it's faster if I ran down to the room service grab a bed sheet and change it myself! Will get to the power outage in a bit! 

No hot water in the shower & water pressure took a dump for three days! Nobody care to fix it neither! We checked in around 8pm on Oct 31st, 2016. Soon found out there is no hot water in the shower at 10pm. Contacted the front desk, they just gave us a run around, listening to their boring on hold music for the longest time, transferred to few different department and finally told us someone will be there within 20 minutes.. Yeah right.. Someone knock on the door 3 hours later. Without any repair done, just told us to turn on hot water in the sink and tub for 15 minutes and we will have hot water. That doesn't seems to work, the guy said he will go get parts and that was the end of it.. End up we had to shower in North Pole! 
Repeated the same cycle again on the second night.. Contact front desk, put on hold, wait for someone to show up and that was 3am! Replaced the valve and We finally can take hot shower now.. That's a yay!

Yay too soon! Next morning power outage at around 9:30am and nobody knows what's going on! Hotel staffs walking around in the pitch black hall way with the flash light from their mobile phone telling everyone to calm down. Luckily we live on the 5\/F, without any backup lighting anywhere, walking flights of stairs with only the flash light from our cell phones. No sign no indications of where the stairs lead to. Finally see the light from the emergency exit, it was the loading area in the back of the hotel or some sort. Walk around the whole building try to get to the front desk but it was all blocked off. No one can enter the hotel until further notice. We can't get our luggage until 11pm.

Clean, spacious bathroom with separate tub and shower

Cons:
Bed isn't great- you can feel the springs
Flat screen TV is to the left of the bed, so you'd have to watch it from your oh so quaint French styled couch-lol- not a big deal, but odd

(I did call ahead and someone else told me it was ok. I had an event that evening and an early flight the next day so it was not an option for me to go to the business center anyway). 

My room was on the fourth floor and the view to the tower and the pool area was obscured by a tree. Housekeeping was weak. I noticed a dirty sock (not mine) under the bed and an earplug (also not mine) which remained there during my stay despite them supposedly cleaning daily. The tissues ran out halfway through my stay and did not get replaced when housekeeping cleaned the bathroom. It made me wonder how thorough their procedures are. Obviously not very...

The room also lacked outlets. There was only one available by the desk and the other was on an open wall, so I had to set my phone on the floor while it charged. There was only one towel hook in the bathroom and it was nowhere near the shower. 

I guess if you like gambling and smoking (or breathing second hand smoke) this place would be ideal. I was there for a business event and it was frustrating walking so far to the conference center, especially with all the tourists just casually strolling around.

Besides that minor flaw, I always enjoy my stays here at Paris. One of my friends has the hook up here so this is our official residence for our annual Vegas trips. 

I think the distance from the front doors to the hotel elevators is really short and therefore convenient when you need to:

1. use the bathroom for #1 or #2 or puke 
2. pass out on the bed after a long night of partying 

On our recent trip, we had a semi suite. We had a foyer (perfect place to put a roll away) and a wet bar. There were 2 bathrooms; one with a shower and one with a huge jacuzzi. 

The dresser in the middle of the room mentioned earlier housed the TV. When I opened the dresser, I assumed the TV was a flat screen and was able to rotate so you can watch TV in the sitting area. Not the case; still had a big ol clunky set.

The location on the strip is smack dab in the middle so everything is easily accessible. You can catch the Bellagio show across the street. PH is right next door and Ceasar's is pretty close.

The patio itself is in dire need of power washing and the trash bins, particularly those for cigarettes etc., were overflowing, which was what we noticed the prior evening when we took a peek at the pool.

We did not locate one, but it would be nice to have a water fountain to fill our own bottles at no cost instead of buying bottled water which is expensive and not environmentally friendly.

The room was just OK, but if you're spending mass time sitting in your room then you shouldn't be in Vegas anyway. Maybe skip Vegas and go to your grandma's house, I'm sure she'd love to sit around and do nothing with you. Maybe she'll make you a sandwich and you can watch Murder She Wrote. 

For those who are in Vegas to actually DO Vegas, here are my highlights: 

Pro #1: LOCATION. It's right in the middle of the strip, if you're planning all kinds of debauchery across the touristy part of town you're in the right place. You are positioned perfectly for a quick cab ride or a chill walk to anywhere else on the strip. Restaurants, clubs, bars, shopping, you're right in the center. I loved THEhotel at Mandalay Bay a few weeks prior but frankly it's at the very end of the strip, those cab rides pile up quick son. 

Pro #2: The audio being played in the bathrooms. Yea that's right, go take a leak and listen carefully to what's playing in the can. It's an audio lesson that teaches you ""helpful phrases for your Vegas trip"" in French. It is Paris after all, why not learn some French right? 

Ladies, you will learn how to say helpful comments such as: 
""I shaved my legs for this?"" 
""If my husband calls, I'm not here. If the pool boy calls, I'm here."" 
""Has anyone seen my panties?"" 

Fellas, take note: 
""You know what? Your clothes would look great on my bedroom floor."" 
""How do I get this glitter off my clothes?"" 
""Oh bleep, where is my wedding ring?"" 

And many more. The phrases sound a lot sexier in French too. 

I'm not blown away by the rooms but there was a bed and a shower, all you really need. The main casino and shops are small in comparison to others in the area but they're nice, and Mon Ami Gabi is a tremendous restaurant located on site. Delicious affordable wines, fantastic food, AND it's the only friggen bar in Vegas I could find with Fernet! 

I dig it. Nothing amazing but it's positioned right where I need it to be. That plus Fernet, I'm gold.",7,10,7

We stayed for one night [stayed with friends off the strip for the rest of our trip] and when I booked the room online, my friend and travel partner called the hotel to check what kind of pillows they use. She's very allergic to goose down feathers, and they told her that those types of pillows were only provided upon request. When we checked in, she asked the front desk person the same thing and got the same answer. So we got into our room, changed and immediately went out to the strip for a few hours. 

When we got back for the night, my friend got into bed to relax and noticed ALL the pillows [except for the decorative pillows] contained goose down feathers. Not only that, but it took an attendant over an hour to remove the pillows from the room and replace them. 

We had planned on sending a strongly worded email to the higher-ups at Harrah's, but I found out our $90 room service breakfast and all of our pool drinks were comped. We figured that was fair enough.

We stayed in the red room; it was quite nice, on the 26th floor with a decent view of Bally's, the Wynn and the Encore. I loved the bathroom - full-length mirror on the door, double sinks and a separate bathtub. The beds could have been more comfortable with more blankets though. And the air in the rooms was even more dry than the air outside. 

The pool was also a lot smaller than I expected. Most Vegas resorts have bigger pools and often more than one, but they only had the one and it was a weird round shape. The water was also quite cold, even for Vegas in late May. Poolside service was good though, very prompt and they service nice big drinks in souvenir cups.

The crepe place was amazing - it was in an awkward location, but it didn't really matter because the food was super yummy. And don't bother with the giant souvenir Eiffel Tower drinks - they put a lot of cheap tequila in them and they're awkward and difficult to carry.

I did not stay at the hotel; however, I did try their buffet. I was not pleased nor did I enjoy it. I was told by word of mouth that the Paris Buffet was the best buffet. WRONG! It was small and the place seemed clustered up with the paint job and decorations. The atmosphere did not seem calming but chaotic. My sister and I couldn't wait to get out of there. The only reason we stayed to eat was because we paid for it. The only thing that tasted appetizing was the pizza and salad. If there is a line for the buffet, do not bother waiting. Just go right across to the Bellagio and your appetite will be satisfied for a few dollars more.

Casino wise, it is okay. Every time I visit the Paris for a hand of blackjack, the tables are dead. The design on the inside though is pretty nifty and I love the blue cloud like ceilings.

-- Let's start with the bad: 

Paris is a bit old. Though the hotel was built recently in the last  two decades, some room designer screwed up by putting a giant armoire in the front of the room. This person likely thought that giant fat CRT TVs would live on forever - but alas, this isn't a Motel 6. 

This person also screwed up because they thought TVs wouldn't get much larger. 

They did.

What you have, therefore, is a giant armoire with a closet on the left and right flanking the center door which now houses an out of place mini-fridge. The TV has been unceremoniously moved to the left of the furniture-piece and mounted on the wall above a writing table, putting it in direct line-of-sight with the left bed and making the person on the right bed slightly unhappier. 

Issue number two is that to give you the Paris feel, they hang many things on the wall. Unfortunately, when putting electrical on the wall, you can either conceal the wires inside a headboard for a flush, yet removable option, flush the wires inside the wall entirely, or put raceways on the wall.

You get raceways. Actually lots of raceways.

There's a raceway under the writing table and one on each side of the bed. Rather ghetto-fies the experience a bit but it's not absolutely terrible.

-- On the plus side: 

The beds are very comfortable with 3 pillows per bed. The bathrooms have marble floors and are very roomy with a nice tub and a separate stand-alone shower.

The mini-fridge, while out of place, lets you stock up on drinks without having to pay obscene  Vegas prices. 

We had views of the Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel tower and the pool. A+

Walking distance to everything on the strip and direct access to Bally's and thus direct access to the monorail.

We managed to get a decent deal on the rooms. The service was excellent, the room was okay, and the food was rather mediocre and grossly overpriced. More details on all of this below.

The main reason I'm giving the hotel such a low rating was because of the cleanliness of the hotel itself. The whole place had a little bit of an old, dark and dingy feel to it. But the room service bowl that sat outside of the door of the room next to mine for over a day, the hole in the wall in the hallway, and the rusted shower fixtures really put things over the top for me. I definitely expected more from a very prominent hotel on the strip. 

Now, onto food. Where else but Yankee Stadium can you spend $9 for two sodas? Apparently, it's Las Vegas. Specifically, the Paris hotel. I'm sure glad I ate dinner before we arrived the first night. The breakfast buffet was equally sticker shocking - nearly $50 for the two of us, and most of the food was extremely greasy. I must say, they did have a very fresh and high quality selection of fruit, when they managed to keep it stock. We also ate at the noodle and wanton bar (very tasty by the way), which also costed us almost $50 for two small entrees and an appetizer. After having dinner that night, we decided not to eat any more meals in the hotel. There are plenty of restaurants in the shopping center next door that are more reasonably priced.

On the plus side, the casino has a nice variety and my dad won $1200, which was a great thing to happen on his birthday. The service was most excellent - didn't have any issues at all there.

The bathroom was amazing.  We had a whirlpool tub, separate shower, his and her sinks, and yes...even a bidet.  

The service here was great.  Everyone went above and beyond.  When we first got to our room, the safe was locked shut.  They sent up two security guards, asked for our ID...professional and honest.  The concierge got us great tickets to Jersey Boys.  We had lost two items on our last day...a rather expensive ring of my husband's, and rather expensive sunglasses of mine.  Lost and Found, both at the Convention (ballroom), and for the hotel was extremely helpful.  They made an announcement in the convention...the ring was returned to us within a couple hours.  I left the hotel without my sunglasses, but gave her my cell number.  I had a call at the airport with the great news, and they sent my sunglasses to my home.  

We didn't get to experience much of the food here, as we like to go out and about.  I had breakfast outside at Mon Ami Gabi.  Great view and people watching, and the spinach and asparagus quiche was delish.  La Cave has wine and liquor for purchase.  Cafe Belle Madeline has some amazing desserts.  I had the Tiramisu which comes in a chocolate cup.  The Sugar Factory is a cute shop\/restaurant with anything from T-shirts to celebrity lollipops to ice cream.  They also serve food.

Paris also offers the Eiffel Tower Experience where you get to go up their replica Eiffel tower. I've never been but I heard from all my friends who got proposed there that it was worth going up especially since it offers a 360 degrees view on their observation deck. 

The dealers here are rather warm at most of the craps and card game tables with possibly an exception to the baccarat. You are better served in the the High Limit room.

Q: I heard that this is the best smelling Casino\/Resort in Las Vegas. Is this true?
A: Oh, absolutely. Between the hours of 5.00am and 11.00am, there is the glorious smell of stale cigarettes, carpet cleaner, freshly baked croissants and strong coffee. All of that surrounded by the mesmerizing din of slot machine noise. A perfect environment when you're stumbling towards your room at the Flamingo at 5.45am, hoping to God that someone is awake in the room and will open the door for you.

Q: Wow! This is the sort of classy place that I'd like to throw-up in!
A: Absolutely.

Q: I'm poor, I can't do Paris.
A: Help Las Vegas get even closer to replicating Paris by being a Street Urchin. There's lots of bread in the bread carts and the bakeries that line the ""cobble-stoned"" streets. Steal loaves of bread! Distribute them to the poor! Power to the people!

When he booked the room over the phone, they had accidentally overbooked the type of room he requested. They said they would note that in the account and give him the room (based on cancellations) or an upgraded room since they had messed up the reservation.

When we got there, the lady that checked us in was quite rude and said, ""I can get a manager but they will tell you the same thing"". She wouldn't budge and was attempting to put us in a downgraded room. The manager resolved it to the best of his ability and we enjoyed our nice room. 

Bit of advice, if you book a room with a strip view, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, you can hear night club music until 5am, they hand out ear plugs. That's not advertised at all on their website. We opted for the mountain view and glad we did!

Stayed in room #1593 (June 2013) and discovered several bites on my back, torso, and chest the morning after our first night.  Disgusting!!!  I've read on other forums that the hotel consistently denies the existence of said bed bugs by sending a ""third party"" to inspect the room.  For obvious reasons, the rooms come out ""clean.""  I have posted several photos of my bites on Paris' Yelp! page.  

The hotel as a whole has it's ups and downs:

Pros:

1.  Conveniently located in the center of the strip.  Our room the second night faced the Bellagio, which made for a nice view of their (Bellagio's) water show.

2. Parking\/hotel\/casino are fairly small, which means less walking from your car to your room.

3. Nice décor and ambiance (shops and restaurants).  It feels like the French version of Disneyland.   
  
Cons:

1. Check-in time is 4 pm.  Expect LONG LINES at this time.

2. Your reservation for a smoking\/non-smoking and queen\/king room is merely a ""request.""  You may get your ""request,"" depending on the availability.  Do not expect stellar service from the front desk.  Prepare to wait or pay extra $$$ for their up-sell of a larger\/nicer room.

3. DIRTY ROOMS!  As I've mentioned above, bed bugs.

4. Uncomfortable beds.  The first room we stayed in (#1593 with double queens) had old, uncomfortable beds.  You could feel the bed springs underneath you!  Did not get much sleep the first evening.

5. I doubt their food is truly Parisian. If you're looking for authentic, look elsewhere. 

In short, I would NOT recommend this hotel to any of my friends or family.  Next time, I'll spend the extra money to stay at the Cosmo or Bellagio.",13,4,1

De verkar inte ha något som helst samarbete med parkeringen. Vi ville sätta parkeringen på rummet men det gick tydligen inte (när vi bodde i Hollywood var det inga problem). Dessutom sa receptionisten 7USD\/dag men det var 17USD\/dag.

I have to say, this place changed my mind. 

The Paris seems to be the more chill of the hotels amongst the surrounding areas. Where there are parties and debauchery abound, Paris seems to be the more quiet place. The decor seems to hover in the Victorian. The group I was with had a Red Room, VERY PRETTY DECOR: red, plush, very comfortable. 

Lastly, I have to give props to our fellow hotel goers and security, we were pretty raucous: with the whole knocking on doors, inviting randoms to our alcohol filled awesomeness, and impromptu dj via Bose powered speakers. Security came once to see what the noise was, not about complaints, and spoke with me in calm, collected tone no intimidation.

If you can get over the fantastic ridiculousness of Vegas in general, you'll be able to take Paris's ""French"" twist with a grain of salt. Obviously this French twist involves putting ""le"" in front of every noun, and ending it with an ""e""....le craps table....le cocktaile....le ATMe....after awhile it becomes le'tarded.

Our room was clean and the bathroom is nice (separate tub and shower stall). Surprisingly, the room was actually quiet - not much hallway noise or outside noise. However, we were on the 14th floor facing Bally's so I'm unsure as to whether this is consistent throughout the hotel.

This was our first stay on The Strip - we usually stay downtown at the Nugget. Although we booked Paris as part of a package and paid a reasonable weekday rate, I couldn't help but feel like I was being financially raped at each turn. Now, granted Vegas is known for financial rape but Paris took it to a new level - financial anal rape with chalk dust. Everything had a surcharge or was insanely priced. Bottle of water? $3. Cup of coffee? $3. Internet access? $15 a day. Print out a page at the business center? $6 a page (does not include misprints) If you lift anything out of the minibar, within 45 seconds the hotel will charge your room.

Although one should expect financial anal rape from Vegas in general, in the end it just demonstrates the greatest flaw of this hotel - it is just too big to feel intimate. If you hate feeling like a number, don't stay here. 

A side note:
I don't understand why people write reviews expressing their disgust at ""The Midwesterners in fanny packs"" who think this is really Paris. Um, yeah you'll see a lot of that. Mainly because this is Vegas. Yes, you urban hipster, we all know you've been to the real Paris and boy, does it make you so much better than us philistines.

We stayed in a travel lodge hotel and motels, that were better than the room in the Paris hotel.

It is dirty and gross. On Saturday night it was very much understaffed. There were dirty ashtrays and empty glasses left on so many machines with no one cleaning up.  I was there for 3 nights and NO ONE was winning anything on those machines. Not even $200.  I saw two machines with dirt and grime in between the keys.  It was too disgusting to even play on.  Their ATM machines were so outdated they couldn't even read my ATM cards. I had to go to Cosmopolitan to get cash on more than 3 occasions.  At the ATM, I could stand in line and watch the bare assed employees walk back and forth on the bar like strippers who just didn't strip.  These girls were freaking miserable and no one was watching them except for me when I was at the ATM and the occasional pervert who was taking a quick pic to take back to his room later for when he needed a quick fix.  It's so tacky to have those girls up there.  I would not expect that from this hotel as I misunderstood this hotel to be ""classy.""  Not so.   The girls were supposed to be dancing but they had a band playing really loud 100 feet away and if you were standing at the ATM you could clearly hear the band really loud and the music the two girls were supposed to be dancing to.   It was so annoying for the patrons to have to listen to two different songs playing but it must really suck for the employees.   They also have all their female cocktail waitresses dressed ridiculously.  At times, I felt like I was a dirty strip club.  As far as the hotel, the first room we were in smelled absolutely horrible.  My 12 year old was like ""Mom, I can't handle this smell, we need to switch rooms.""  We switched rooms and the smell was gone but the room was filthy.  There was mold on the ceiling in the bathroom and near the tub. The side chair to the table had wet stains on it.   The carpets were super dirty.   I called management and was disconnected on their own hotel room phone 3 times.  I finally got through to a manager and explained I was very unimpressed with the room and hotel and that I wanted to know what my options were for checking out early.   They said they would waive the $50 early cancellation fee but they didn't care if I left negative reviews.  ""If you aren't happy, you can leave.""   My family did not want to pack up and leave, so we stayed.  I didn't fight management for comps of any kind.   They know this place is dirty and filthy and they don't care.  The walls in the hallways have huge chunks taken out of them and are just left there with a need for repair.   I asked a bartender who was not busy if I could please have a glass of water and he said you can buy a bottle of water.   I walked down to the other not busy bartender, and asked the same question and was kindly given a glass of water.   There is nothing special about the buffet at all, unless you are going to eat a bottomless pit of of crepes, then enjoy!!  Other than the crepes, I was not at all impressed with the food quality of breakfast or lunch.  (We did not have dinner there.)  If you really like crepes just get them from the restaurant across the hall from the buffet and save yourself some money and unnecessary extra calories on the food you'd eat at the buffet which isn't that good anyway.

Great location.
The Front Desk staff is less than easy to deal with. I tried to book an additional night and was unable to online and called for help and they couldn't do it either and in fact informed me I could do more online than they could. 
Use the online specials for two for one specials for shows and features. You don't need to pay more for a room with a view etc.
We saw Jersey Boys and it wasn't as good as when we saw it in Charlotte, NC and there was way more F-Bombs and crude language in the one at the Paris.
The Eiffel Tower Experience was good. You can watch the fountain show at the Bellagio hourly in the day and every 15 mins after sunset.
Food in the buffet for breakfast was superb. It was the best part of the whole stay.
Scantily clad dancers by the black jack tables was supremely tacky for a supposed high class place. I'd expect that kind of crap down on Fremont street, but not here. At least tuck it on a corner where if you desire it, it's there but not out in the middle forcing everyone to view it.

This will probably be our last stay there unless I see something different.

It's not all that at this hotel, truth be told.  They really could have done a lot better with decor and more, but it's really bland.  Our hotel room was okay, there was a part on the wall where the wallpaper was coming off, very tacky, and in the hallway as well.

A one-day gym pass costs $25, what a rip off.  

The pool is not phenomenal, although you are under the Eiffel Tower, the service poolside sucks, they forgot my drink and food.

After a 12 hour drive (which should have been an 9 hour drive, if not for a rock slide on the i70) and the awfulness of a Holiday Inn in Vail Colorado, we welcomed a nicer hotel. Not expecting much, having been cooped up in a car all day and night, we were just hoping to check in lay in a comfortable bed and knock out for the night.

The gentleman at the front desk went above and beyond and unexpectedly upgraded us to an amazing suite, even ensuring that it was in a quiet area of the hotel. We didn't even try the twenty dollar sandwich (although we did tip him later). Our room had a couches, a walk-in closet and vanity. A huuuuge bathroom with a shower and fancy bathtub and walk-in toilet with a bidet. Most importantly, it was quiet. I wanted to live in that room.

Excellent choices with great shops make this a better pick on the Strip plus it is centrally located...though the fake French stuff still makes me want to barf.

The signs say otherwise and can go with adult 12 and under.   What the hell is going on around here as my wife and kid are crying ruining my vacation.  This heavy set lady is soooo evil working at the spa and  has gotta be a racist big time.  Hates white and latin people...so obvious.    I checked out the signs inside and there is nothing that says kids are NOT allowed in spa and have PHOTOS to prove it.  I am so offended how my family has been treated after touting this hotel and coming for years.  When I check out tomorrow the manager is gonna get an earful from my wife and us.

Pros: 
-Location - it's in a great spot.  The best part of the strip.
-Price.  For it's age and decor, it's reasonably priced.
-Surprisingly good buffet.  It's nowhere near as good as Caesar's, but I'd honestly say better than the Wynn these days.
-Shower water pressure - it'll blow you away.  Nice treat for Californians.

Cons:
-VERY LONG WAIT to check in.  Their reception desk is severely understaffed.  Maddening.
-Poor wifi reception, and you're limited to two devices per room.
-The on-screen guide on the TV was consistently inaccurate.  Listed the wrong shows.

However it's visibly a step below its competition and has failed to keep up with the trend of increasingly larger and more technologically advanced rooms. Compared to the North Strip giants such as the Wynn\/Encore and Venetian\/Palazzo and the super-modern City Center hotels (Aria and the Cosmopolitan), the Paris is in an obviously lower bracket. 

That is not to say that the hotel is without its charms. The Paris theme is, for lack of a better phrase, ""tres charmant."" The staff is friendly, although they are no longer obligated to greet you with a hearty ""Bonjour."": The shopping is lackluster and located in an underground walkway to the adjoining Bally's.  The rooms are certainly on the smaller end; the standard rooms are only about 350 sq feet, half the size of the standard room at the Wynn. You can upgrade (as I did) to a Red Room which does not necessarily give you a larger room but it does come with a few nice amenities (access to a lounge, champagne reception, etc.) and is nicer appointed than the standard room. There's nothing spectacular about the rooms; were it not for a few frilly Parisian touches you could easily confuse them for a standard Marriot or Holiday Inn room. 

The nice thing about the Paris is that it is easier to navigate than some of its labyrinthine, massive counterparts (looking at you Caesars and Venetian) so getting from the casino to your room and vice-versa is only a short walk to the elevator. Moreover the restaurants are all close to each other but problematically they are also close to the buffer (one of the better buffets on the strip) and the buffet line is almost always long and loud, which can detract from the dining experience. The restaurant selection is decent, with Mon Ami Gabi (patio seating with great view) , the Buffet, and Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse (new addition so very busy) being the highlights. There's two restaurants open 24 hours - Sugar Factory and Cafe du Parc - but be aware that Sugar Factory is both supremely overrated and overpriced and Cafe du Parc is frequently inedible.  In the last year the Paris finally introduced a real club to the hotel in Chateau which can get rather crowded on the weekends and which is generally on par with equivalent offerings at most Strip hotels. It's no XS or Tryst but it's better than PURE ( in my opinion) and infinitely classier than Haze.",2,0,0

Now the location of Paris is great on The Strip.  Front and center.

Now the poor ventilation of the casino area is poor.  Smokey and smelly.  Go into casinos in hotels like The Bellagio and then come here and you will notice how the Paris needs to fix this issue first.

The ceiling was decorated as the sky with the Eiffel Tower starting out in the center of the building. There is a bridge that takes you the elevator for the towers. The music is  pretty decent, there is a competition between one of there lounge areas and the girls dancing on a table in front of the poker tables.

I think they have the perfect location right in the heart of the strip and across from the Fountains at the Bellagio. Inside of the Casino\/ mall area there are plenty of shops, a few French cafes, Gordon Ramsey's restaurant and my favorite, Mon Ami Gabi.

Only thing that gave it minus a star was again the line (i was in line for 45mins + just STUPID!!) and NO poker room. I live for poker so that was a major bummer.

I have stayed probably in more then 50 hotels around the world. But I never heard such a bullsh*** before.
We ended up paying additional 70 a night for a small suite to get a king bed non-smoking.

The room was quite ok. Except a small tube TV. Have you heard of these new cool and big flat TVs at all?
15 bucks a day for Internet?! And the two bathrooms of our had indeed only yellow lightning.

The restaurants were massively packed at lunch time. Only possible to get food at the quick and ""cheap"" cafes in the hotel.

The trip on to the top of the Eifel tower gives you a nice view over the strip. Although I'm not sure if I would pay 15 bucks again, because you can make pictures only through tinny wholes in the fence which are big enough for these little pocket cameras.

We could not get back to the room until 9:30 PM or so. And when they did let us in with a group of other guests the inside of the corridors were pitch black. No emergency lighting. The only light was from a security guard flashlight who escorted us to the room. He actually told us that we had to go to someone else's room first as we had 6 groups of guests going to different floors. A young woman in the group started to hyperventilate experiencing an anxiety attack and feeling claustrophobic.  The plan was to go to the 8th floor and wait until guests packed up all of their belongings and then together go to the next group of guests and do the same thing. Fortunately the lights went back on as we were going to go to our room.

We stayed in one of the ""newly renovated"" super sized rooms. The decor was well researched, but fairly cheap.

The hotel had a large amount of options for places to eat...and each one was different...and unique.  

The atmosphere of Paris was fun...we enjoyed...and even the casino part was great....my first time playing roulette! 

Most importantly, as Diamond members...the service they gave us was exceptionally great.  From their Diamond Lounge where we could easily grab a bite to eat at different hours...to being able to take a taxi or bypass lines by showing our diamond card.  It really showed that they value their members that spend a great deal at the casino.  We were even offered discounts with the card at many total reward participating restaurants.  

One of the ladies at the total rewards desk was nice enough to let us know that we had a few rewards that we could use while there...no one had even told us this.  We were able to see a free show, get $100 in dining credit as well as about $200 in casino credit.

However,  the ceilings are very high, an the casino and rooms have good, filtered ventilation.   I prefer cigarette smoke unmasked to the thick, oily perfumes that many of the other casino\/hotels in Vegas use.  

There may be some rooms that have not been renovated yet, but ours was very new, clean and nicely equipped with a small refrigerator.

The breakfast buffet at Paris is really nice.  They will make fresh crepes to order and the decor is so charming you don't even feel like you are in a Vegas buffet.

That's because the staff  at the registration desk made check in difficult for every member of the eight people (three other couples and two singles) who were meeting up with us at The Paris.  But the friendliness of the other staff, the general comfort of a room for which we paid only $78 (tax included) per night and the hotel's close proximity to Bellagio and The Cosmopolitan led to The Paris getting traction over the four days of our stay to result in a better rating outcome at the end.  

That said, we will not stay here again nor could we recommend it as a place to stay to others.  That is based on eight trips to Las Vegas, including this one, and experience with seven other hotels, of which we would happily recommend and return to five of them.  There are just too many other options for lodging in Las Vegas to be treated as if a hotel is doing YOU a favor by taking your discretionary lodging dollars.  As was the case with the desk staff at The Paris.

That summary experience posted, The Paris has minus and pluses.  If you're interested in the detail read on.  

FRONT DESK EXPERIENCE:  A BIG  minus.  One of our group of ten had arranged months in advance of the visit for five rooms at a rate of $78\/night (tax included) per room..  Each room had a different confirmation number.  He made sure  we all had all five of the confirmation numbers so we could check in as we arrived since he would be in as late  as midnight.  But the hotel would not let us check in.  The desk staff told us that  if the person who had reserved all five rooms was not present at check in, we would be charged $299 \/ night given they were sold out.  We suggested  that this could not be the first time a party with multiple reservations arrives over the course of several hours and the person who coordinated the reservations is the last to arrive.  No, said the staff, it is not..  So, we said there must be a solution for this.  Yes, she said, the solution is you check in at the $299 rate as that is what we'll resell them to others for tonight.   It would have been laughable for a training video on how NOT to gain customer loyalty if it had not been so obnoxious.

Ta dum.

ROOMS: Pluses and minuses. Once check in was finally achieved - it took nearly 90 minutes -  all went smoothly.  We did not receive rooms in great locations given the low rate($78 night) we were paying and the full house at the hotel.  That would be expected under the circumstances so we had no complaints.  The good news about the rooms is they were generally comfortable and very clean.  Hubby and I had a ""P"" (petite suite) room which is a bit larger than others - and included a coffee maker hooray -  and other members of our group had standard rooms. 

 In all cases the infrastructure showed wear and tear, damaged furniture and paint coming off of woodwork as example, and old technology, as in smaller tube TVs as opposed to the large screen LEDs that one finds even at mid range hotels these days and wifi is an extra $15\/day.  But with comfortable beds, an adequate supply of decent pillows and everything clean, it's hard to kvetch for the price we were paying.  If we'd been paying anywhere near the rack rate, that would have been a different perspective.  

 STAFF OTHER THAN FRONT DESK: : Dealers at the black jack tables were top notch.  The perfect nexus of professionalism and friendliness, they made playing a lot of fun.  Bell staff and parking valets were very friendly.

RESTAURANTS:  One of the advantages The Paris enjoys is a number of small, casual places to pick up something to eat...a boulangerie, a patisserie and so on.  That made it convenient to grab a fruit plate and coffee to take to the room  in the morning for those of us not eating a more formal breakfast.  The Mon Ami Gabi restaurant (reasonably priced as Las Vegas restaurants go) patio provides a nice view of the Bellagio fountains from afternoon through evening.  The Eiffel Tower restaurant, where service is great,  prices are high and tables are packed like sardines in a can (not owned by The Paris but on property) is a neat place to have a cocktail in the bar and see the stunning view.

LOCATION:  Easy walk up or down the strip or across the street to Bellagio, The Cosmopolitan (where we spent a lot of time) and City Center.

TIP:  Upgrades to strip side rooms are sometimes available for as little as $40 \/ night.  Worth it for view  but be sure you're above the 11th floor or, as in our case, you'll look out at a parking garage.  Also, rooms ending in ""P"" ( petite suite) are larger by far than regular rooms and sometimes available at no extra charge if timing is right.",3,2,2

There are many casinos to choose from which is great!  I like that Paris is walking distance to the mall shops in Planet Hollywood.

Dead center in the middle of all the action.  When we first arrived I appreciated that they have Valet service included in your stay.  Another great amenity was they are pet friendly.  When ever I can travel with my two super spoiled and adorable yorkies I love to take them with! We stayed in a pet friendly room located on a certain level.  The best part about the room was the view!!!! We were high enough to see it all from Paris down to the luxor's beaming light at the top.  

The check in process was fast and the customer service was great!  I loved how my yorkies had a place of their own outside and it was too cute seeing them walk through the casino with their sweaters on!  

Anyhow, I had to take one star away as the furniture does need a much needed update.  There were many cracks, scratches, and pain over jobs.  I wanted to make sure also that we didn't get charged for any extra bite marks left from other pets so any I discovered I let them know as soon as we explored the room.  There was also some pet hair left on the cushions of all the chairs and couch.  I understand it is a pet room but housekeeping should make sure these items are checked as my pets don't shed. We were also suppose to receive some pet goodies as that is part of their luxury pet deal but they never gave us the items so we had to call to receive them.  

The next star I took off was there was a lady in the room next to us that her dog howled for two days straight.  To be honest I did not mind the howling at all.  We spent much time outside the room and I knew the pup was small and probably had never been left crated so no biggy.  The issue I had was we got blamed for the howling one night!!! my dogs do not howl or bark and although I know the rooms were directly connected and linked it was very clear where the howling came from.  We let the front desk know it was not us but the room next door. They did apologize and I also let them know we were okay with the howling since we were right next store. we continued with leaving the room to have dinner.  When we came back there were 3 staff members walking and one of them decided to sneak over to the corner to check on the noise and spoke in Spanish about how annoying the dog was and how they put in a complaint (they did not see us coming around the corner and they jumped with surprise)  Caught red handed! But akward as we passed her to get to our room.

My wife and I were staying here for her conference as part of a package deal.  Upon arrival, our room was not ready.  It was earlier than check-in but of-course they could upgrade us for a fee.  We decided to go ahead and upgrade rather than lug around our bags for a few hours.  We did get a nice room with a great view of the strip and Bellagio fountains.  The room was basic for the price paid but it was a nice place to lay our heads.  The staff was okay.  Most of the dealers were quiet and not very welcoming.  The ""free"" drinks were few and far between with the waitresses taking forever.

Be careful if you use the gym!  I visited the gym for a workout while my wife was busy with her conference.  I found the gym located in the spa.  You have to register at the spa to use the gym.  I filled out a form with my name and room number.  I noticed on the sheet that it was a $25 charge to use the gym.  I asked the staff about the fee and they said it would be credited back upon check out as long as I was staying at Paris.  At check out, that was NOT the case.

Speaking of check out, the lady at check out was abrupt and not helpful at all!  When I tried to discuss the gym charge she simply said that it was a fee.  I explained that I was not informed properly by the spa staff.  Her reply was that the spa was seperate from the hotel.  I tell you what, that $25 cost them a future stay by me.

The bright side to this hotel was that it was home to Martorano's.  This restaurant was simply amazing and a MUST when in Vegas.  I will review that restaurant seperately.

When asked what is going on or where my car is, they would constantly tell me it is coming up the ramp after they checked my valet card, HOWEVER every single car that did, was not mine. When asked to speak to a manager, I was denied. What do you mean ""no, it is ok. just wait, it is coming now"" ????!!

Not only was I rejected, I did not receive compensation for the wait and for them to neglect my retrieval of my car when I came FIRST.

I have to admit to being a sucker for the design of the place as well. The Eiffel Tower recreation is impressive, but nothing else feels strictly ""authentic."" That's fine, as I'm a huge fan of the Disneyland design aesthetic going on in the resort. The blue sky colored ceiling, the fake cobblestone walkways winding through faux villages... it's all very fun and charming.

The pool is large and relaxing as well, and sits at one of the feet of the Eiffel Tower. Their restaurant collection is decent as well, with one of the better buffets in town and a fun and tasty French-themed burger joint\/ sports bar.

can be reasonably priced. Good location. Clean. A bit dated. Friendly staff.

When in Vegas, there is a crop of hotels you can depend on for a reasonable expectation of quality.  Paris appears just slightly higher than some but surprise!  Inside appears more dated than expected.

Older style TVs, the equipment and amenities are just shy of being obsolete but no issues are too offensive that they would take away from your stay.

Location is good, central to the strip. Walking distance to most attractions and clubs and it's easy to find.

Most other hotels at this level already have LCD tvs and things.  It feels like Paris is lagging behind, trying to stay off spending that extra budget on upgrades until the last possible moment.",0,0,0

First of all, I don't come to Vegas often and I'm with my wife for her birthday and my 5 yr old daughter.

Coming 30mins early for a reservation for Mon Ami Gabi, they could not accommodate an early arrival. Understandable as it was very busy.  We were given a pager and was told I can walk around but to stay within the hotel grounds and nearby so the pager can receive a signal.

Walking out, my daughter said she was very thirsty wanting water. Closest access was Gustavo's bar.  Feeling we should order a drink other than just asking for water for my daughter, I see an Asian bartender not busy and just eye balling us as my daughter climbed up to my arms still saying she wanted some water and asking my wife if she wanted anything. As I approached with my daughter in my arms, he says I can't serve you with your daughter in your arms and being by the bar. Ok, I put her down and told her to go to my wife several feet away from the bar. Now he says, I can't serve you with or without your daughter nearby.  I paused and thought to myself WTF?!! Ok, I get it... Casino bar, under 21, hotel\/casino policy and perhaps state law but why don't you ask\/wait what I wanted to drink first as it may be non alcoholic bev or be more clear in a more polite manner originally instead of giving me a stinkeye as I approached and for a 2nd time with another comment?!! I just wanted to get my daughter some water and thought I should at least buy a drink to get one or is the only thing you serve is alcohol based? Or if she fainted then you may reconsider?

Yes, I could've seeked a water fountain but don't know how far it would be or how far the pager would receive signal, and I was willing to spend $3-7+ for a drink and a cup of water to get to her right away.

If you only made clear initially that ""I can't serve you because you have an underage child and is based on state\/city law, etc...or a distance that's acceptable to be served and if whether that included non alcohol beverages"".  I would respect that being educated on this and comply, but giving an attitude is not acceptable as you are in the service industry and you don't know who you're servicing.

Didn't eat, drink, gamble, or stay there.  Just walked through to check the place out. And it was amazing. Absolutely gorgeous.

The ceiling of the casino is painted like a sky, giving it a different feel from every other casino I was in.

Like NY-NY, the inside of the casino is as themed as the outside - restaurants and shops sit along Parisian streets, all under the blue sky that is the ceiling casino.

There is an elevator you're invited to ride as soon as you enter the casino.  It takes you up within the Eiffel Tower, letting you out in a kitchen scene right out of Ratatouille.  Walk around the corner and you're in the most gorgeous restaurant I saw in Vegas, looking out over the best views of the city.  Didn't see a menu, but I imagine it was priced to match.

Never got a chance to eat anywhere in Paris, though I wanted to... I thought I saw a relatively inexpensive place with brick oven pizza (I love anything ovened with brick) as well as a crepe place that unfortunately didn't have anything that really piqued my interest, but even so, I can always go for a crepe.

The hotel has been around for 13-years and in that time frame, I've stayed here quite a few times but this review is from my most recent visit.  Although not quite as old as the Flamingo, Bally's, Excalibur, Harrah's or even the Mirage, Paris is starting to show it's age.

Upon arrival to the hotel, I suggest to do valet parking, as the Front Desk is literally right by the doors.  Otherwise, if you do self park, you have a long ways to walk as that hallway that connects from Bally's to Paris and the parking garage can be quite a challenge as it's usually full of people.

The guestroom decor and furnishings are original; blue carpeting, floral-esque furniture and marble tile bathrooms.  Although the room is still clean and in good shape, it certainly cannot compete to that of the Aria, Cosmopolitan, Vdara, Bellagio, Wynn, Venetian, Palazzo or even Mandalay Bay.  But I must stress, you're not in Vegas to stay in the room, you just need a bed and shower when all is said and done, right?

The Mandara Spa at Paris has also seen better days and honestly at this point, unless you're getting services or spa access comped, it's worth skipping.  Again, everything is in it's original state from when the hotel first opened and very run down.  You won't get that feel of luxury and bliss here.

There are quite a few dining options located in the main lobby area of Paris, ranging from the buffet, to a couple sit down restaurants and a few casual spots for a quick bite or a drink.  I haven't been up to the Eifel Tower Restaurant or the other restaurants.  Actually now that I think of it, I've never been up their version of the Eifel Tower but, the view is significantly better from the Stratosphere.

Gaming is pretty decent and you'll most always find your ""favorite"" slot machine as well as spots to play at a table.

But most importantly, location.  Staying at Paris guarantees that you are in the center of LV Strip, the center of all the action!  You're within steps of all the major hotels and casinos.  Better yet, if you luck out and get a LV Strip, you have front row viewing of the Fountains of Bellagio show!  But again, don't stay in the room to watch that, get out there!

Have stayed at this casino hotel at least once every year on business, and I do like the central location that the Paris offers on the strip. It is in a great location close to many of the big strip casinos, and within walking distance from them.

I like how the Paris gives off a fun and cozy feeling. It is one of the high end casinos, but a step below the Bellagio and Wynn type casinos. Rooms are nice and offer a Parisian decor. A little worn now, but not too bad. Can usually get a nice strip view if requested, or booked early enough. Nice restaurants to eat at - Cafe Ile St Louis, Le Provencal, and of course, Mon Abi Gabi which is one of my favorite places to eat. Good buffet too if that is more to your speed and waist line!

I also like how Bally's casino is connected to the Paris through a French village kind of set up. Cobblestone streets lined by shopping, bars, and restaurants. Great gaming area with plenty of tables, slots, and high roller room. Just a fun atmosphere all around.

Yup, there is also the faux Eiffel Tower that lords over the strip, and is beautifully lit up at night. As the base extends down through the casino floor into a bar area it makes for a kitschy way to enjoy some cocktails and play video poker. Also, Le Central bar located right at the opening of the lobby, casino, and walkway to Bally's is a great spot to get your drink on, watch a game, or just people watch.

Only drawback is the fitness facility. Even for hotel guests there is a $25 per day fee. The gym equipment itself is ok with cardio, benches, machines, and free weights, but nothing to write home about. This fee should be waived if you are a hotel guest, or at least lowered to length of stay for one price. 

Still, this is one of my favorite casinos to stay at. Fun theme, good restaurants, and a prime location on the strip. Eat outside at Mon Ami Gabi at night to get a great view of the Bellagio water show!",7,2,4

Cleanliness: Pretty filthy. Dust on and under every surface, dark stains splattered across the carpet, more stains on the drapes... ugh. A nightmare.

Decor: Horribly outdated. I'm sure it would have looked very spiffy in the '60s, but it's way past time for a remodel. True Paris hotels haven't looked like this in decades.

Bathroom: In a word: uncomfortable. It was small, it smelled nasty, and the water pressure was awful.

Machines: They're missing most of the newest machines (Blackjack, Poker). This is very disappointing. If all you care about is playing the cheap slots, though, then you may not mind as much.

The tickets were for open bar 9pm-12am. We got there at 8:00pm and didn't get in until after 11pm!!! And that's only because we had to argue with security to let us up in front of a party bus group that cut in front of us who had been waiting so long. 

Once inside we waited in line for the rooftop. We waited 30 minutes for the lift. Half of my party made it up. While my friend and I were just about to the front of the line the security told us that no one else was allowed up unless you had a certain color band. My band I received with my ticket was yellow and they were only letting up green bands. Many of us in the crowd were obviously upset. 

We waited hours to get in to an oversold event where the customer service was poor. When we all asked why ,the answer given by the security was that ""The rooftop is past capacity"" and ""No one else will be allowed up unless you've purchased a table"". This was a common theme we heard from Chateau as when we received our tickets from Will Call they said the event had been oversold and they were expecting over 2500 people there. 

My other half of my group was able to make it back down to us before midnight which was a good thing but we were upset to hear they had to complain in order to be let down. They tried to leave via the stairs to be told to use the elevator and then told they couldn't go down, essentially forcing them to stay up there which is illegal to not give proper exit for someone. 

The other disappointment came when I was dancing with my fiancé. Being a gay couple in Vegas you'd think it would be a safe place from discrimination, especially at a club at the Paris, however we were wrong. We were getting a bit close on the dance floor and ended up dancing against an empty couch. One could visibly see other couples doing the very same. Then a staff member came over to us and told us we couldn't be doing that. I wouldn't have minded that, if they had done that to the opposite sex couples as well, however they didn't. 

This was a horribly disappointing and very unorganized event and club. I can't stress enough to stay away. The ""open bar"" was a scam as we didn't even get in till 11:30pm and even then the bartender told us they were only serving us two drinks and we couldn't just drink there all night because of our wrist bands (which gave us open bar btw). We complained and told them ""we've waited hours to get in and purchased an open bar and we only have till midnight, so what do you mean we can't keep drinking?"" The bartender wouldn't answer and walked away. We hadn't even been intoxicated since we had been waiting to get in. 

Sadly, the only positive remark is that we did receive two drink tickets to use after midnight to compensate, however they only allowed for basic drinks and not the ones we could have received from the wrist bands.

This is my second stay at this hotel, and the Caesar Group does a good job in making your stay pretty enjoyable. The hotel is a little dated, but it works, because if you go to Paris, it's an old city. Maybe a fresh coat of paint in areas that's chipping off may be warranted, but the facilities otherwise is good as any on the strip. The decor in the room is fairly plain with mid-century type furniture and digital temperature controls. You get a roomy bathroom and a fridge. Obviously, we didn't spring for their best room, but still, was great. Everything worked, and the housekeeping did a great job. We'll deifnitely be back.

i didnt stay at the hotel...but heard about the Le Village Buffet from my brother.

we had to wait for about 30-45 minutes. but it was worth the wait, seriously.

we came in just between breakfast and lunch. (around 9:50 am or so). so we were able to enjoy a bunch of stuff!
the crepes are deeelish...

The whole theme with the Eiffel tower was beautiful and romantic.  I come to vegas alot and when my boyfriend and I stayed it was the 2nd most romantic time we had there.  The first was our first ever trip.
I felt like a princess the whole time.  Clean rooms, clean casino, the Buffet was AMAZING for Breakfast!!!  Loved the whole experience we stayed over New Years and got an upgrade to a room with a view of the strip and the Bellagio Fountains which was awesome to see from that far up.
Only complaint was Valet,  it got full fast but of course we were there at a busy time of year.  
The Eiffel tower experience was beautiful.  Highly Recommend it and the Paris!
The location on the strip is great also easy access to alot of things.

Cons: dated - the room felt old and musty and the linens and pillows could definitely use some upgrading; thin walls - we could hear our neighbor coughing up a lung the entire time, I guess we were lucky we only heard coughing ;)

Typically, I like to stay on the northern end of the strip, but because of the pleasant experiences i've had at Mon Ami Gabi and Sugar Factory, i thought the Paris hotel would be a great choice. Wrong.

The entrance and casino ambiance is inviting and pleasant to the eye. To be honest, this is why I chose the hotel. The decor won me over but due to the reasons I am about to list below, i will not be staying here again. 

1. Checking in: The employee who helped us (Corinne) did not: greet us, thank us for choosing Paris Hotel, make eye contact when speaking to us, During our 15 minute encounter she managed to over charge, then under charge us. She almost gave us money back because her math was wrong before i corrected her. She was incredibly rude to us and her surrounding employees who tried to help her because it was obvious she needed it. Tried complaining to the Manager (Fransisco), he offered $100 credit and sent us on our way.

2. The minute you leave the casino the hotel appearance dwindles before your eyes. The walls have old wall paper peeling off, the doors and baseboards are scuffed and there were two holes in the walls on my way to my room.

3. The bathroom has no lock, the furniture was old with no cushions, not enough towels, carpet is dirty, sheets were stained. It looks like a room from the 70's. 

The worst of all was the service. All employees, black jack dealers, receptionists seemed bothered, or completley clueless. Id rather stay at excalubur. Thats saying ALOT.",4,2,0

It's dead center of the strip, across from the Bellagio, with a CVS right up the street for all your alcohol and hangover needs. Vegas, in general is expensive, and Paris is no different. We ate in the hotel restaurants once, breakfast for 2 was $50. Staff were very nice and accommodating, and when there was a mix up with the price of our third night, the front desk was helpful in clearing it up. Also, there is a $40\/day resort fee, which can bring up your price, even if the room price is low. You can't avoid this fee in Vegas though--every hotel charges it. Parking was easy and $10\/day for self-park.

On our arrival at 2pm on the 8th the front desk  let us know they didn't have a room available for early check in so they asked us to come back at 4pm. Perfectly fine, this was always a possibility. At about 3:30 we got back in line as the line was at least 20min long. When we finally got to the desk they once again let us know our room was not ready and to come back in 10min....what could possibly change within 10min?

After waiting til about 4:20 they once again let us know our room was not ready. Front desk then apologized and gave us an ""upgraded room"". We arrived to our floor only to find food trays on the floor. Once again I'm optimistic. Maybe the food has just been put out. The next morning we walk out to go to the pool and food trays are still there. On out way back from pool, about 4 hours later, food is still there. 

I walk in to take a shower and notice my shower wasnt working. I called down stairs and asked someone to come check it out. I then go back into bathroom to wash my hands only to find out we HAVE NO WATER. Let me repeat NO WATER. I was all oily from sun bathing all morning and hot. I called front desk again where they tell me there was an emergency and they had no other option but to shut off water. By this time it was 2pm. I was told water would come on at 3pm. Not to mention our sink was clogged and my husband and I had to wait for the water to go down. Of course the water didn't come on at 3:00pm and When I called front desk again the manager told me he would give me a call back. Which he never did. 

In the end I was comped my resort fee and a 30 gift card which I had to fight upon check out because Chris, the manager I spoke to over phone didn't leave notes about what he promised me. The manager upfront Robert swore I got a memo in my room advising me of water shut off but we didn't. And even if we did the day before the front desk staff kept telling me it was an emergency. So then it was planned? Or was it an emergency? The staff was unprofessional, they couldn't give me any straight answers, gave me no help or alternative for a wedding I had to get ready for and lied in process.

Our room was Le Mans petite suite. The room was spacious, bathroom was amazing and bed was comfortable. it seemed clean, however the mini fridge hardly kept cool, the wet bar sink was lose,  and the trash bins were tiny.  We had requested early check in, and kept going to the front desk, our room was not ready for us until 5pm! I had hoped spending thousands on a wedding at this hotel would grant us a smoother check in, guess I was wrong. Be prepared for a 5pm check in. 

Our wedding: we did the deluxe poolside cabana package wedding. We upgraded to three cabanas, holding 25 guests. This area was fun and perfect for a casual yet pretty setting. The ceremony was short, I was disappointed that the Minister had to whip out his notes and ready them, not well prepared, but a nice guy. My husband wore a mic, but not a single guest could hear us exchange vows or anything...the audio was horrible.

Photography; our wedding photographer was a girl named Nick, she was nice, but we felt very rushed. After the wedding we met up with her the following day to pick out and view all of the pictures. It felt like being greeted by a sales person trying to make a sale, not show us our photos. This was very uncomfortable. The photos were pretty, but we were not blown away...considering we picked the Paris hotel for our wedding...not a single photo included the Eiffel Tower, even though we were right by it. This made me sad. The photos were very traditional...I recommend to speak with the photographer before the ceremony so you are able to specify what you want...we were not given this option. We did not meet the photographer or the minister until the big day, which made it hard to ask questions, and  communicate needs and expectations etc. 

Poolside Service; our cabanas were served by Stephanie, who was very nice and accommodating. It was not her fault that the Wedding Chapel had not explained enough details for us prior. I was told verbally by the Wedding Coordinator that we got bottle service with our cabanas. This was not in our contract, so I kept and open mind and asked questions. When introduced to our server, she told me the same thing so I felt safe. No one specified what additional fees this may include. Next the server took our food orders, guest ordered lunch from the pool cafe. The food took over an hour long!!! Stephanie apologized, but that was it. We requested to do separate tabs for food being that some guests had to leave at different times, we didn't want it all on our room. She was kind enough to do this, thank you Stephanie. Left on our bill was our lunch and a bottle service fee of $18 per bottle....interesting. have no idea what this was for...maybe gratuity for bottle service? I wish this had been broken down to us writing so that we knew what to expect financially prior to our event! The servers were very kind, and deserved to be tipped, I just wish we had been warned in advance in our contract of how everything would work. My mom was kind enough to handle the bill so that we wouldn't be bothered by this. Thank you Mom.

The Wedding Coordinator; Sandra Dee Valentino; very nice, very busy...hard to get a hold of. Communication and accuracy of information and timing was poor. It all worked out fine, I tried not to get bogged down by details. I did feel like I had to bug for information that should had been given to us from the beginning. This was frustrating. For example, payment; we were told upon booking our wedding in July and putting down a deposit that we would be able to pay the balance in person when we arrived for our wedding, or in a payment plan. She also explained that we would receive a detail worksheet to fill out by the end of August (music, flowers, vows etc...) By the end of the first week of September, less than four weeks until our big day, I hadn't received anything. I sent an email. Once I received the details worksheet, I had little time to fill it all out now, but got it done. Along with this she also sent us a 30-day in advance payment worksheet, that apparently is a requirement not an option. We were not informed about this at all previously. Not only was the balance due, but it was given to us less than 30 days before our wedding!  Luckily we had it in our account and were able to pay the full balance. This was annoying, and could have been a disaster!
Sandra informed us that she had been working overtime, so I imagine that the Paris Wedding Chapel may have been understaffed, but still! Get it together! On our big day she brought me a bottle of Champagne in the bridal room, thanks. She was also very patient when the guests who were in charge of our rings were a little late for our ceremony, thank you Sandra for being flexible.

Overall, it was a very special day and a fun weekend. Don't get tangled up in details, just smile :) and have another glass. I would stay here again.",1,0,0

If you just want a place to crash that is in the midst of everything, stay here. That being said, the basic room we stayed in was small and not fancy. I noticed five or so things that made it look shabby (peeling wallpaper, chipped paint, etc.) which gave an overall not-too-nice feel to the place. It reminded me of a French Holiday Inn. The bathroom was big, which is always nice, with a separate shower and tub. 
The staff was not very pleasant. The front desk staff was ok when we checked in, but we had to wait a long time which seemed ridiculous because they only had one person working. Not great management in my opinion. The housekeeping staff was rude to us a couple times. When I had to squeeze past a cart in our hallway when we were checking in, she moved the cart a tiny bit and when I said ""Excuse me! Thank you!"" and smiled at her, she just huffed. RUDE. Needless to say, I didn't tip the housekeeping staff.

* Cute gift shops and I just love the feel of the common areas of this hotel. It's very European (dooh it's Paris).

* Friendly staff from bellboys to housekeepers. 

Cons:

* I wish there are more of the general areas (more shops and entertainment).

My one complaint is that there was no floor length mirror in the room.  Annoying when you are going out and want to check yourself out.

The room itself was pretty standard - nothing nicer than a typical Comfort Inn really.  We were on the 10th floor - I'm sure some of the upgraded rooms are nicer.  The casino was nice, although nothing special compared to the rest of the Strip.  There are lots of dining options in the hotel - the buffet was FABULOUS!  There's also a creperie, a sandwich\/pizza shop, convenience store, etc.  The pool is really nice as well - really relaxed and wasn't very crowded during our stay.

I give the room itself 3 stars, and the overall experience of staying at the hotel 4 stars.  The location simply cannot be beat - you're right in the middle of all the action on the Strip.

The rooms are disgusting and the management is terrible.  The hotel is run down and has no customer service.  We checked in on the 22nd of December.  Upon entering the room, I was immediately turned off.  The carpet was old, torn and has rust stains.  The bathroom cabinet had peeling paint and was dirty.  The bathtub had a screw sticking out of it that could have been a safety issue had I allowed my child to go anywhere near the tub (I didn't notice that until the morning).  We arrived late, ran out to dinner and show and came back to the room to sleep.  The beds and pillows are awful.  We described them as low rent motel quality.  That night the television was pixellating and we couldn't even wind down to tv.  The next morning I called the front desk to let them know that I was going to move hotels.  It wasn't until I went down there and spoke with Leslie (a manager) that they told me they were going to take that room out of circulation and upgrade us into another room.  The upgrade was also not wonderful.  The beds were slightly better, the pillows still sucked.  On the morning of the 24th, I noticed that the air vent in this new 'upgraded' room was fully clogged (that explained my sneezing and respiratory issues almost immediately upon checking into the room.  I spoke with manager M. Eric Holmes, who told me he would send maintenance up to fix the issue.

The manager was rude, arrogant and exacerbated an already tense situation with his complete and utter lack of professionalism.  We ended up leaving the hotel and checked into a much nicer property.  Trust me when I tell you that Motel 6 would be a step up.

Even though they are in the middle of a renovation, they did an excellent job of shielding guests from the noise and dust. Someone at this hotel is doing a great job with customer service training. Every single person (valets, front desk, bartender, janitor, pool attendant, maintenance worker, dealers) was outstanding; pleasant, helpful, friendly. Kudos to whoever is setting organizational culture here. An example: After checking in, we left the registration area and, as in most Vegas hotels, the elevators weren't easy to find. Without having to ask, a woman carrying a broom and dustbin saw us, asked if we needed help and cheerfully directed us to the elevators. Love that kind of attention to detail.

A while back, we had an unpleasant experience at the Linq. There's a loud nightclub that goes until 4 AM that they didn't tell us about. At Paris, the front desk person saw that we were booked in a room facing their own club and asked if I wanted to move to a quieter room, which we did. Really appreciated that.

The rooms are super comfortable and spacious. The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed we've ever slept in. It prompted us to research the brand. We also rented a cabana at the pool and spent the day there. The staff is outstanding. We never had to flag someone down. They were supper nice and attentive.

The only thing keeping this from a 5-star review is that the room wasn't as clean as it should have been when we arrived and the hot water didn't work. To their credit, they sent a maintenance worker up right away to fix the water, but finding a dirty Q-tip in the bathroom was no fun.

For several years, most LV hotels have ridiculous long check-in lines. This hotel has the new electronic check-in machines. Just scan your DL, enter confirmation then comes out your card key. No more waiting. Same process for check-out. Just drop the key in the box and off you go.

The room selected for me by the machine was the red room #2560. Fantastic! I was looking at pictures online and really liked the red theme decor so I got lucky again! The modern room was spacious with a view of the dessert. The king bed was comfortable, the double armoire featured a hanging closet, dresser, mini fridge and a flat screen tv in the middle. Room also has a writing desk, loveseat, and small coffee table. Bathroom has separate shower and tub and necessary toiletries plus a blow dryer.

This hotel also offers several restaurants on the casino level including Mon Ami Gabi (good brunch), Martorano's, Gordon Ramsey Steak and casual restaurants.

I was in vegas with some friends for a concert that was taking place in Paris, so we decided to might as well stay in the hotel just to make things easier.  Usually when I come to Vegas I stay at the Venetian\/Bellagio and more recently the Palazzo. Paris can't even compare. First of all, the rooms are fairly small (~460sqft I believe in comparison to Bellagio's standard 510) and the beds were uncomfortable. Like the experiences of some previous reviewers, I also saw hairs on the bed. The sheets and\/or mattress also had an weird stench to them. Thankfully we didn't really stay in the rooms at all, and when we did, we ordered new sheets from housekeeping to lay on top of. Also, when someone called Housekeeping to ask for more blankets and pillows, they said they ran out. What kind of hotel, especially in Vegas,  runs out of blankets and pillows? We found this quite odd, and therefore, will not be staying in their rooms anymore.

The hotel itself is alright. The employees are really nice and hospitable. They do have some decent eateries like Madeline's for dessert and Cafe St. Louis for typical American fare, but there isn't much else to do besides that. I don't think the hotel does the city of Paris justice.",5,3,1

-Staff members were extremely rude. For example, we were standing by the bar waiting for drinks for 15 minutes. Not one bartender acknowledged us. So, I politely asked the bartender who was cleaning glasses, if he could help us. He told us he was busy and we should go to the other side of the bar. 
-Rarely saw a waitress in the casino. So, we had to go back to the bar and get our own drinks. Lame.
-The rooms felt like a cheap chain motel, rather than a Vegas experience. The room really wasn't clean. When we opened the armoire to watch TV and found old food and snacks. Gross! Super loud at all times of day or night. Old room service trays sat in the hallways for more than 24 hours. I even watched hotel employees walk right by the tray and do nothing about it.
- Their activities fee is lame. You pay to use their gym and pool through this fee. There is not an option to skip thee fee by not using the gym or pool. 
-Overly aggressive sales people every ten feet. After we checked in we had to walk through the casino\/shopping area to get to our room. I was hassled by this woman (who had a leathery wrinkled face) trying to sell me a makeover and her anti-wrinkle products. I said no thanks and walked away. She followed me, yelling how I should get this makeover. She just wouldn't let it go. I swear I thought she would follow me to my room.
- Their internet is a joke. It only somewhat works in the room, but mostly not. Plus, you can only use it one one device. I just used LTE. 
- Hubby got bad food poisoning from the mussels he ate at one of their restaurants (LaProvencial) . We ate and drank exactly the same things except the mussels. I was fine. Just a rotten way to end a vacation.

I also love their restaurants. Mon Ami Gabi is quite possibly my favorite Vegas restaurant. (check out my review). Their buffet is also one of my favorites. (I will try to get that review up soon). And then of course is Sugar Factory (yep, you guessed it, I reviewed it). In other words, Paris has so much going on that I love. 

Now let's talk hotel: if the Parisian style is for you, you will find a clean, modest room, and probably be happy. I, however, prefer contemporary, sleek decor, so this place isn't really for me. One thing about our room that WAS amazing, was the view. We were directly in front of the BELLAGIO fountains. One strike against Paris?  Housekeeping was pretty lax when it came to cleaning up the hallways. When you leave your room and see someone's room service trays in the hall, and come back several hours later and they are still there, that's a bit of a turn-off, and really not OK.

WI-FI:   Hotels that still do not offer free wi-fi drive me crazy! There is no excuse for it, and I see it as pure greed on their part! In fact, this bothers me so much, that I am now refusing to stay any place that does not have free wi-fi! Paris is charging, but if you go to the little cafe' in the lobby, you can get it free there. I think it's only a matter of time before most places offer free wi-fi.",1,0,1

First off the Black out from the power outage, the hotel didn't really care that it affected our trip, because we didn't have anywhere to stay. I had to beg and then get angry for them to arrange something so we would have shelter. I was promised that I will get $200 in comp for food and drinks at the hotel, also the resort fees will be taken care of. Also 2 free nights extended stay... That sounds reasonable until I try to redeem all of that. I tried to stay 2 nights longer, that was a hassle because they said they didn't promise that. Then the $200, none of my food and drinks were covered until I saw the hotel bill, and brought it up, then I had to speak to a manager (ALLEN) and waited outside in the line for 30 mins to get that resolved. Not to mention on the day of check out, my bill went up $80 on resort fees that were charged on the day of the power outage. How are you going to charge me resort fees when I couldn't have stayed there. I had to call and wait on the phone for 20 mins to get that resolved. I would've been happier if they didn't promise all of that and I just pay for it. It's about the principle. 

Oh not to mention, when we came back they assigned us a room where construction was going on from 7 IN THE MORNING. Called down to the front desk and they just say oops.... Really?!?!?

I could figure out what  was it, because the room was pretty clean. 
Later I was preparing to go to bed to sleep. I pulled out the duvet and stepped behind the bed next to the wall, and the carpet was all wet. Wow. That's why there was that smell. I don't even know what it was. Probably a sink water leakage behind the wall.
Nasty.

Perhaps I've popped in once or twice, but never have I stayed here and I have never heard much said about the place, save for the restaurants. I ended up coming here because I was having lunch with friends at Mon Ami Gabi.

I'm giving two stars because just from walking around inside the casino it was pretty ""meh"".

First off, the parking garage is horrible and is shared between Bally's and Paris. It's hard to get to, it's annoying to navigate, and it's placement is not helpful. Secondly I really dislike it when casino's parking garages push you out into a long hallway you have to walk down in order to get to the actual casino. Whoever decided it would be a great idea to put a long, cobble walkway between the garage and the casino floor... well, let's just say, not the brightest architectural genius out there. 

The signage, although cute like little street signs, makes navigation throughout the casino hard. I found myself walking all the way up to the little signs and making circles around them in order to read where they were all pointing and what they were all pointing to. The sign for Mon Ami Gabi is non-existent until you get right in front of the restaurant and by that time you've found the place out of sheer luck anyway. 

The casino itself is somewhat out-dated. I could definitely see room for improvement and renovation. I realize casinos on the strip age quickly, especially when newer ones burst onto the scene (IE: Cosmo, Aria, etc.), but that's just the way it goes. Paris should consider a new idea and get rid of the damn cobblestone flooring.",1,2,1

Overall we really enjoyed our stay here. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the walk from the garage to Registration is kind've far and not fun with bags.

The casino floor is alive with the sounds of bells and whistles, the whirl of a thousand different lights and the cheers of people from everywhere. To me, it was, really, just another pretty casino.  

I liked the attention to detail, loved how the ceiling was painted in the soft blues with the cloud cover, to appear like a spring time day.  Of course, since you can't really tell what time it is, you spend So much more money.

The slots?  Well, they weren't terribly loose, but I did fine a machine or two who liked me. I found a few more who really resented me. *chuckles.* That's Ok though, I went in with money to burn.  

I also played roulette for the first time, having been given an assingment from a friend.  When I placed my bet (Black 4, $10) One of the other players put his token there too. *grin* Saying that if I'd been told to do it, there must be something to it. Sadly, we both lost our bet. :) That's ok, I get lunch out of the deal when I get home.

What I did love is they had the card game War. My girlfriend loved that because she doesn't like card games. It was a fun way to gamble because it is literally just turning your card over, and whoever gets high card wins. The chances were pretty good. I lost a lot, but my girlfriend won a lot and so did my buddy. It all balanced out. Plus the dealer was amazing! We tipped her a whole lot.

We went with good friends. The hotel itself is beautiful. Modern, Updated, Clean ! The Casino area itself looks like the sky with cobblestone and accents of France all over. The Shoppes are great, and they have two of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. Gordon Ramsey's steakhouse and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. The Brunch there is absolutely to die for. The rooms are amazing and have a wonderful view of the strip. So many cool things to say about this place. Why then am I giving this only one star?? What they DON""T have , is good Customer Service. As a matter of fact...They have HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE ! Let me continue to lay the story our for you. One of my friends that was with me, and might I add IS a Diamond Player, and goes to Vegas no less than 4x per year, not only came with me in May but also stayed at Paris in July of 2016 with his father.   Cut to - Friday December 9th, 2016 we went to Vegas for his Wedding Renewal and his Birthday. There were 8 of us, including 1 Diamond , and 2 Platinum Players. Yeah, we're not high rollers ...but for certain drop a ton of cash at the casino several times a year. We started out at Flamingo, Bally's , and decided to head over to Paris to hit the tables. The second I set down at the Roulette table and started talking to the young lady running the table, I was greeted by a nasty uptight Pit Boss. She was  approx 50+ wearing a suit, glasses, and pissed off. She didn't smile, she didn't say ""welcome to Paris, is this your first time playing""? Nothing. If she had been listening to my conversation, with her employee, she would have clearly heard me asking questions about how to play. I was pleasant, in a good mood, and had my lovely wife by my side cheering me on. I was having a great night. This Nasty ( I'm being nice ) Pit Boss looked at me with a scowl. The only words out of her moth was "" You can't say the F word "".  Ok...for one, we are in Vegas, their was someone puking on the ground and a half naked girl in front of Paris with tassels on her breasts..I don't think anyone cares. I am not a vulgar person, I'm 45 and not a kid either. I had a few drinks and was an enjoying a celebration weekend with my friends. Is this the way your greet a guest ? You don't know anything about me. Who I am, what I have or don't have. What you should know is that there are multiple casinos in your town and most of them would love for you to keep treating people like that. It's good business for them.  I said "" no , problem"" as I am not a rude individual. I cashed in my chips and moved to the Black Jack table where my friends where playing. three of us were sitting at the table playing, laughing , winning , losing , Not Swearing, but having a great time. My friend took me into the diamond lounge to get a dink and we returned to the table. We played and were honestly having a great time. Out of nowhere over came the same Pit Boss. She walked up to the table pointed to me and said "" He's done playing"" . I still don't know what I did. Not a word , not a warning, not an explanation. They pushed my chips back to me and told me I couldn't play. Now, I had been drinking so I assumed that perhaps I looked like I had been drinking and it was their job to protect my money. However, you should at least have the courtesy to explain to someone what they did. My friend sat beside me and said ""I'll play then"" I gave her my chips - Keep in mind the rest of the table was with me with me. She looked at us and told her that "" she can't play either "" . Still no explanation on what we had done. Not only was I embarrassed , but felt like I was ruining the time for my friends. I got up and left the table with my wife. Although everyone at the table objected, she stood her ground. We all collected our chips and went back to Flamingo to let them take our money. I know for a fact that myself and my friends will never play at Paris again. That woman was more than rude. She was nasty. This is a Pit Boss, A BOSS . Shouldn't a Boss\/Manager be the shining example of customer service ? I am giving you my money !! The least you could do is greet me when you meet me for the first time, ask how I'm doing, perhaps let me down easy if you are going to ask me not to play there.  You my friend, by your actions have cost your facility thousands in lost revenue, but worse than the money , shown that you have a reputation for horrible customer service. I would not advise anyone to visit, stay , or play here. With all the Casinos in Vegas, do yourself a favor and pick any other place. You would get better service at the 7-11 slot machine attendant than you will from Paris Casion.

We ate at the steakhouse in the corner of the Casino, seated outdoor with views of the Bellagio fountains. Delightful drinks, great food. Another check!

We walked around the casino floor. Nothing to write Yelp about. 

The room could have been transplanted from a Comfort Inn or Holiday Inn or something, and I wouldn't have known the difference. Granted, I didn't splurge for the nicest room, but didn't settle for the cheapest view. My middle of the road room was slightly below expectations, but maybe my expectations were too high. This isn't the newest, most modern hotel, and it suffered from some of Las Vegas' history. The room was a little smokey even though it was non-smoking, and looked well-worn.

Our room was facing the pool and the Belagio water show. Aesthetically, it was nice but at night, we could hear the music from the club until the wee hours of the morning. Not particularly relaxing if you still want to get some sleep. This is likely due to the fact that the rooms are very old and outdated. We also used the pool and the gym which were both OK. Pool was a little murky so we didn't stay long in there. And the gym, again, needed some upgrading. 

We also had the option to valet our car each night but as you can imagine, it gets very busy on the strip, especially on weekends, so sometimes it would take 10-15 minutes for our car to be brought up. Because of this, we were late to a few of our dinner reservations. However, the valet workers were all very courteous.

They sent us an email for us to optionally get on an e-upgrade standy list.  Who doesn't want a better room, right?  However, at no time during check in were we informed that we got an upgrade - even the nightly rate card that I initialed did not indicate an updated room.  The room itself was fairly average size, double queen beds and one regular chair for a sitting area, with some obvious issues (stains on the carpets, rust in the bathtub, old soap stains in the shower, non-working TV remote, terrible view of a parking deck).  But then, during check out, we noticed that the bill had some ""upgrade fees"" totaling about $50 per night tacked on seemingly out of nowhere.   To me, this is completely DISINGENUOUS, bordering on downright  fraud.  If you're not told you're getting an upgrade, how can they charge you for an upgrade?  

Well, this experience at the check out desk totally ruined this hotel for me and I want everyone who reads this to be aware of this shady business practice.  Beware the e-upgrade!",7,0,0

We booked a 2 Queen Pet Stay room for 3 nights, checking out on June 17. We arrived late our first night, so we checked in and went straight to bed. Our second night, we woke up late given our 5 hour drive the night before. While we were getting ready, my 5 pound chihuahua threw up on the bed. She damaged the sheets and blanket, we just assumed housekeeping would take care of it so we left it as is and called housekeeping as soon as we left. We come back and the sheets were changed, no problem. While trying to shower that night, the water pressure was so low it took me longer than normal. I have no idea what thats about. The next day went as planned, everything was fine. Now our departure date, my dad went down to check out and pay the bill while we got the luggage ready for the bell desk to come pick up. He calls me screaming that they're trying to charge an extra $600 for a mattress replacement. Totaling $1,015.02, instead of $415.02. They claimed that the mattress was damaged and needed replacing. We called the front desk and asked for someone to come look at the mattress. We had Maria the floor manager come and take a look. We flipped both sides of the mattress and found nothing. She called down and told us to talk with Robert to dispute the charge, if I'm not wrong he's the assistant hotel manager. We went down and asked for him. One employee said he's not there, so a man named Michael came out (I don't remember what his position was). We told him about our situation about how the mattress has no stains and to remove the said charges. He told us the mattress had been flipped and it was possible that it had been changed before we got in, which was a blatant lie. Another man my dad spoke with said that they don't change the damaged items until after we check out. We asked for the security report, and he said ok. My mother told him that we don't have plane tickets so we can wait here as long as necessary. As he was leaving he said ""you can wait here as long as you would like"" and started laughing. I don't know if it was just bad timing, but it almost seemed as if he was ridiculing us. There's nothing funny about being charged over 2 times the rate for a nothing above average room. He made us wait about 15 minutes at the front desk. Another employee came out and told us he was picking up the security report with Robert and that he'd be back shortly. Another 10 minutes went by and the same employee approached us and said that Robert isn't in, that he would be back at 3 pm. She also added that they can't access the security report. My mother was infuriated and said well wait. No more than 5 minutes later, at around 1:45 pm, Robert came out and spoke with us, even though we were told he wouldn't be back until 3 pm. He told us that we have to get the security report from Risk Management and gave us the appropriate phone number. He also stated that this didn't happen under his shift, and the person who would know better about the situation would be Amanda, the assistant hotel manager. He kindly removed $200 as a discount. He also said that she wouldn't be back until 3. We waited considering it was only an hour. We walked around then came back and spoke with Amanda. She told us that she has not seen the security review and can't make further decisions until she has done so. She told us she would give us a call back last night, or today depending on if she could get a hold of the floor manager that assisted us, named Maria. My mother stated that this was a disgusting process, then Amanda added that its even more disgusting to sleep on bio. Which I found very offensive since we brought our own bed sheets, pillow cases, and blankets just so we don't have to sleep on their questionable mattresses. Who knows what happened on that bed before us, its definitely not sanitary. We drove back in a horrible mood and felt that our entire trip was unnecessary. It was not a pleasant feeling. We got no call yesterday. I called back this morning and spoke with Amanda and she said that she had not been able to get a hold of Maria, but spoke with another manager who confirmed that there was no stain, but that it was wet. I took pictures and videos of the entire mattress. There are other damages on there, that were present prior to our stay, we stated that and asked why it wasn't changed before. No answer. She proceeded to remove another $100. We had asked for the security report multiple times, no success. If I'm being charged for a claim, I need to see the report along with pictures. We got neither. They also said that we, as guests, can't get the full security report along with the pictures anyway. And that they will take an employees word over ours. We have been coming to Vegas for over 15 years, never had such a horrible experience like this. Definitely not coming back to this hotel.",0,0,0

Why:
- Buffet is impossible to get into. Not a big deal, but at least for breakfast would be nice.
 - Ala carte restaurants have long lines and the cafe has plenty of tables, but never enough chairs around.  After you eat a sandwich standing up, you get pretty pissed at the situation.
 - The cobblestone streets are nice, but they are tight and packed with families, taking pictures, standing around or otherwise being dumb ass tourists.  Getting through becomes a challenge, even James Bond\/ Jason Bourne would find challenging.
 - Rooms are getting somewhat dated
 - At check in, they constantly pressure you to upgrade rooms

Still ok:
 - Great location relative to other casinos on the strip
 - Great rates, especially if you can score some comps from Harrah's
 - LOVE the way elevators are layed out and ability to get to your room without GPS, like Caesars, Ballys, NYNY and most other hotels on the strip.",1,0,0

The conference was also in the hotel.  We arrived at Paris from the airport late at night, and we were quite tired.  Our non-smoking room was pre-booked and pre-paid.  However, upon arriving at the check-in counter, we were told that there were no more non-smoking rooms remaining.  When I pointed out that we had a pre-paid reservation, which was equivalent to a guaranteed sale, the woman at the counter replied, and I quote here verbatim, ""We don't necessarily honor reservations.""

Despite the time of night (and somewhat to my wife's horror), I was not going to put up with this kind of BS.  A place that does not honor reservations does not get my ""guaranteed sale"".  I asked for a full refund, and we walked down the strip to another hotel (which, I should add, was half the cost of Paris).

You should also expect to pay out the nose for food at Paris.  We ate breakfast here, because this was where the conference is, and for a coffee and a waffle, I paid $20.  A total ripoff.

From the outside the hotel looks very nice. 

Once a person waits in the long line to check in (receptionist asked me if my wife was my girlfriend-- then claimed to be joking after we stared at her) then proceeded to ask us if we were wanting to upgrade to a room with a view for an extra $40. We explained that we are celebrating our wedding anniversary, but she proceeded to try to again sell us an upgraded $40 more per night room. 

Rooms are outdated. The shower was dirty and the tile had not been cleaned. 

Rooms have a huge cabinet in the middle which is the closet and there is also a refrigerator inside. 

From the looks of the place, probably the only upgrade was putting a flat screen tv on the wall. The cable tv is so bad that words the people say don't match the moving mouths. Basically it looks like an old 70s Kung Fu movie with the moving lips and spoken words. 

Other than that, outdated. Bed = uncomfortable. 
The non upgraded view$. Roof top and back of hotel view of airport. 

I'll add that you'll hear every conversation from neighboring rooms and everyone who walks down the hall.

I did not stay in the Paris hotel. I am considering it if I ever go back though after my experience at the Venetian! I only spent about 5 hours at Paris on a Saturday night and was sad I couldn't stay longer. 

The entire vibe inside the casino here is fun! There was a dj playing great music just off the main casino area near the center bar. I actually wanted to run out there and dance (if I had more time). 

The cocktail waitresses are ALL over you getting you anything you need. They even made sure to have water on them and would offer it right up. I nearly died of thirst at Venetian! 

The casino isn't nearly as large as others on the strip but it has everything you need. I have to admit I was a little confused about the half naked girls dancing over what appeared to be the blackjack or poker tables?

What I do like about this hotel is that it is more of a boutique hotel as far as Las Vegas is concerned.  The standard rooms aren't huge. In fact, like most European hotels, the bathrooms are quite small.  If it shower only, don't worry as the tub is teeny and maybe 2 feet high.  Oh and the toilet had a small hissing sound from water running 

The room is nicely appointed.  I had a Burgundy King room. The only thing burgundy color  were the lamps.  It really doesn't feel that French other than the little door danglers which translate to French and the pictures of the Eiffel Tower on the wall.  The bed was comfy and the TV does not swivel so you must watch from bed.

But this is Vegas.  Who sits in their room?  The hotel area is very French from the boulangerie, crepes, and croissants to the decor.  If you prefer a hotel with a moderate sized casino and central to Cesar's, Cosmopolitan and Bellagio, this a great hotel.  It is very reasonably sized and you won't be overwhelmed by the large trendy hotels with all night partiers in their 20s and can escape to a quiet room

Places to check out include the Chateau night club, Napoleons dueling piano bar, Gordon Ramsey Steak, and Mon Ami Gabi which has outdoor seating where you can watch the crowds walk by on the Strip.  Get their seasonal crepes for breakfast!

If you don't want sit in the restaurant there is a creperie with sweet and savory crepes open late into the evening by JJs boulangerie.  Get any dessert crepe that includes Chantilly Creme.  Yes oh-la-la!",8,3,4

But our current visit has proven that Paris Hotel really does not care about their customers. Here are just a few examples. 

During both check-in and check-out we knew we were hitting them at their busiest times, so we were expecting to wait. But at both 4 pm Saturday and 10 am Friday Paris felt the need to have only have 3 associates supporting check out and 2 of them were dedicated to their Platinum clients. Ridiculous. When the 'mob' waiting to check in or check out start to get upset and their anger is feeding off each other it is not a good experience to start or end with. There was one of the person distributing keys, but they were dedicated to check in people that had used the automated system, which according to many people was flaky. Hey Paris, if you have only one person helping the average customer, and that associate gets bogged down by one irate customer, the line doesn't move for 15 minutes and people get pissed.

Probably what made me more disappointed than anything during our check-in\/check-out time was the reaction of management. We saw at least two managers that were aware of the problems yet I never saw them roll up their sleeves and help their customers AND THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES.

It also appeared that every single Diner or restaurant was understaffed, except of course the two most expensive. When a diner is only 1\/3 full but you have a line waiting because you only have one slow Hostess seating people, that is ridiculous. And the wait for a person to come by your table should not be measured in quarter hours.

We also paid for a cabana for one day at the pool. Here the Staffing was sufficient and pleasant, but would it have been so hard to take a leaf blower and get the crud off the ground before we arrive?

Of course there were always manned tables in the casino to take your money, and many times they had no customers sitting at them. But the rest of the staff seemed completely overworked and unenthused.

I did feel that Paris earned at least two stars, maybe a third if I'm feeling generous, because the rooms were very nice. Most of the associates were pleasant. Overall the food was very good in all the locations

Btw, if I never see another ""cobblestone"" street again it'll be too soon.  You ever try to walk in high heels on that shit?  Keerist.  I'm gonna break an ankle.  

I didn't check out the shops, so the only redeeming quality was that the slots are looser than most.   They took away my favorite slot though.  Boo.   

My friend and I were staying at Bellagio on our more recent trip, but we walked over to Paris for a visit.   After playing for a while, we stopped to have a bite in the wee hours at the 24 hour cafe.  (Le Cafe St. Louis) This turned out to be a real pain the ass.  

First of all, the food was mediocre but to add insult to injury... when I asked for bread to go with my soup I was met with an argument that they didn't have any. When I pointed out that my friend was eating a French dip sandwich so how is it that they didn't have any bread...   I was told that it was only used for sandwiches.... then after I said ""Dude.  Come on.  It's just bread."" he finally gave me some but told me to keep quiet about it.  Cheap asses... WTF?   It's bread.  Everyone gives complimentary bread.  What's wrong with you?  

Oh, and then the bread, a hunk of baguette, turned out to be hard and tasteless.   Poseurs.

I didn't like how small the shopping area was. There was like one row of stores and that was basically it. The hotel was smaller than I thought.

The drinks are very, very expensive. Also, my friend paid less than I did for one round of the same drink, then she got comped another (by a totally different bartender) while I paid $13 for mine. The bartender was cool though because she wanted something 'really hard' which we explained is called 'strong' so he created something strong and not sweet, she loved it.

The place is pretty good sized, but doesn't feel all that big when you're inside.  It's easy to find your way around without getting lost.  It's connected to Bally's inside, so you can wander back and forth between them if you like.

We rode to the top of the tower, and the view is pretty awesome.  You can get a good idea of the actual size of the Bellagio lake when you can examine it from high above.  The view is not as impressive as the view from the Stratosphere tower when it's dark, but still not to be missed.

The Paris is situated in a sought out location at the heart of the strip where most of the action happens - right across the street from the beautiful Bellagio Lake and fountains, and a hop and a skip to the Planet Hollywood, The Cosmopolitan and The Aria. 

The rooms are clean, but dated and a little worn down - same could be said about the amenities. The furniture were scratched and look like they've seen better days. The plumbing system is deteriorating and smelled like chemicals and mold when it got wet. It was rather an offensive and migraine inducing smell. I wouldn't dare take my flip flops off when walking around on the carpet, it felt hard and starchy, quite possibly dirty. I didn't want to risk it. 

House keeping did not stay on top of keeping the guest hallway floors tidy or fresh. There was an old room service orange juice glass that was stained and a nasty coffee cup filled half way, that was dried out and crusted from sitting in the hallway for 3 days straight. Very disgusting. We even saw the manager patrol the hallway and she didn't look twice at the nasty crusted cups on the floor.

The guest parking is completely hidden in the back of the casino (up a ramp). It's quite a maze to get back there, but it's our favorite place to park when we want to walk to the Bellagio or enjoy the strip. Concierge at the Paris was rather rude and quick to get rid of us. The older man with gray hair was crabby and not welcoming.

Mon Ami Gabi is one of our top places in Vegas to eat. The food there is incredible. The prices aren't too shabby either, very reasonable! The best seats are on the patio overlooking the Bellagio lake and fountain. It's a must for me to dine here frequently. Enjoy~",5,3,3

My 4th stay at Paris and each subsequent visit, the service appears to get worse. This time, we checked in where I booked a premium room and requested a strip view on a high floor. They informed me that there was an extra charge for a high floor even though I booked a premium room (it is only a request). We were ""upgraded"" to a pool view on the 5th floor which was reasonable. A prime view of the Eiffel Tower but it was hard to take a photo from the room with the background because of the amount of light and glare coming in through the window.

On our 2nd day, I got back from the pool and showered. As I prepared for the day (brushing teeth, etc), I noticed the water pressure continuously decreasing to the point there was no more water. Calling maintenance to report the problem, we were informed that there was an emergency shutdown from 11a-1:30pm to repair a leak. We should have received written notice.... NOPE!

On 3rd\/check out day, attempted to check-out via TV at 10:55am only to be told that the service was unavailable and to confirm that we are trying to check out between 5:30am-11:00am when check-out via TV is available.

Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love this casino for it's beauty both inside and out.  It is my favorite casino in all of Las Vegas and the decor is unsurpassed.  I love the Eiffel Tower outside and it should be your beacon to finding this incredible casino on the strip.  

The outside of this casino is amazing from the tower to the beautiful balloon shaped neon sign proclaiming ""Paris"" that illuminates the area.  It's really easy to find this place but it is hard to stay away.  I actually stayed at the Circus Circus but walked all the way down here nightly because I loved the casino so much.  The inside of the casino is very open and the ceiling murals really are the best in town, you'll feel like you're outside on a gorgeous day even though it might be raining cats & dogs outside and gloomy.  

But the real show stopper here is the slots.  They have the loosest slots on the strip, and I won here every time I went.  Between here and the Luxor I was able to win back more than half of my entire trip.  I ate well on my trip too so I'm not kidding when I say I won good here at the Paris.  I stuck to the same slot machine next to the entrance and just kept hitting $200 payouts continuously.  The waitresses were spot on with their service and were always ready to service me and get me new beverages etc., they even spent time talking to me and really giving me a good smiling face and being genuine people.  Not just a typical robot waiter you might find at other casinos.  Great management and customer service, on top of the most unique decor around make this my top pick for best casino experience in Las Vegas.

Good table games with friendly dealers. Unfortunately for everyone born in 1990 or more recently they do a secondary ID check and run the Ids through a machine every time you sit down or even switch tables which is a bit frustrating and time consuming because it often takes 2-3 minutes each time.

Reasons you could easily spend the entire day just in the Paris casino:

2. The cobblestone walkways take you back to France.
3. The stores at Le Boulevard (on the cobblestone walkways) have everything from provincial linens to chocolates and from soaps to handbags.

PROS-
* Location: relatively central to everything, including the caesars forum shops (YES!!!)
* Room service: pretty speedy AND they have the most delicious chicken wings ever when you're drunk. My friends and I were in awe of how meaty and crispy yet flavorful they were, even in our hyper wasted state.
* We gave the receptionist a $20 and she gave us a free upgrade to their ""red room."" It was more modern and upgraded than their basic room, but we got stuck with a handicap shower... you know, those huge wide showers that just have the shower curtain blowing around while the water sprays the bathroom floor.
* However, despite the aforementioned problem, the water pressure that came out of the shower head was pretty awesome.
* they also give you some pretty good coupons with your stay, like a free frozen hot chocolate at serendipity w\/purchase of an entree. And if you've been to serendipity, you know that the frozen hot chocolate is WHERE IT'S AT!

CONS-
* the parking structure is SO FAR from the actual hotel elevators and reception area, you have to walk through all the restaurants and shops to get there.
* the handicapped shower, like I said before.
* there are NO MIRRORS in the actual bedroom area. There was only a mirror over the sink, and a mirror on the bathroom door. This makes it very difficult for us ladies to get ready at night.
* the hotel as a whole just has an old feel to it. old interior, old people, oldass balloon outside (have you ever noticed how old and faded that thing is??)

It's easy to be lured in by the outside, thinking you'll have a charming stay in a prime location on the strip but staying here is another story. To sum it up- dingy, dated, no attention to detail. As we made our way to the elevators, were welcomed by a display case full of souvenirs, caked in dust.  In the suite bathroom we found rough, old towels full of dangling threads. Grime on the floor. The hot water in the shower took several minutes of running before it changed temp. There were sugar packets left open from previous guests in the basket by the coffee maker. And can we take a moment to discuss why there is a coffee maker in the bathroom when there is so much space in the bedroom that they could easily place it in an area where people don't normally groom themselves? So gross. The TV had a permanent vertical and horizontal line on every station. The beds, although quite comfy, where made up with ripped sheets. Most of these things could have been easily remedied if someone cared enough do something about it. When checking out, the woman behind the desk could use several classes in hospitality. She tried to argue with me about not having receipts for parking I paid for and was attempting to charge it to my room, despite having all of my bank transactions pulled up clearly describing each $10 transaction as Paris parking tolls. I spoke to another woman at the desk who simply had to call the garage and confirm the machines ran out of paper several times during Labor Day weekend and therefore could not print receipts. While being properly taken care of, I overheard the previous woman being nasty to another guest, telling him 'I already told you' when he had questions.

Sorry I daydreamed there for a bit.  Paris.  Paris in Las Vegas.  Not France.

Comforters were all less-than-fluffy white, which made it seem like there wasn't much thought put into their interior decorating.  The cabinet and wall colors were drab.  The pillows were also mismatched in softness and size.

I can hear what's going on:
-Outside our closed door
-Above us from the girls yelling through the ceiling (their floor) but they didn't realize it
-In the bathroom when someone's tinkling or doing you know what - Droppin' a deuce!

So much for privacy.  Their housekeepers are gracious though and usually greet us with warm smiles and carts full of fresh towels. 

Their room keys are tongue-in-cheek brilliant.  So there's a pair of cards - a Queen of Hearts and a Jack of Spades.   ...You'll have to see it.  Maybe I can post a picture of it.  Or not.

The pool's cool.  Wish it could be like Bellagio's, but a large round shape does the job.  Speaking of which, flanked by Planet Hollywood to the south and Bellagio across the street, it seems to be in a fantastic spot on the strip.  

It was also convenient to just go downstairs and head to the tables or grab a bite to eat.

I like the faux sacre Bleu! skies painted through le streets, but am weirded out by the awkwardness of the four legs of the Eiffel Tower jutting through the ceiling in the casino.  Eh.  I guess it helps gamblers realize where they are.  All casinos can begin to look the same after so many drinks.

Ironing board was dirty and about to fall apart.  At least the iron was working.

We ran out of toilet paper quickly.  They only supplied us with one roll?!  I bite my thumb and flick it in their general direction!  Then again maybe I shouldn't.

Our view of the backend of the hotel towards Koval or Flamingo Ave wasn't stellar.  Then again, we only need a place to crash and freshen up when in Vegas and it sufficed.  Factor in the comped room through my cousin and overall, I'd say it was a decent stay.",1,1,1

But NO....I had to order a sandwich too, what the hell was I thinking? Was I the bottomless pit. I think not...... My sandwich was a turkey with gouda and green apple and a pumpkin seed pesto on a french roll, and don't stop there it came with this killer thin crispy ""frittes"" fries. A giant cup full. If I had eaten all of that they'd needed a backhoe to get me out of my chair. I guess I should have stolen a few bites of my husbands soup, it just sounded so good and it was.... just be warned, they give you mountains of food if you are a smaller eater like me.

It's fine in the little walkway where the shops are but odd to me in the casino.  I do sort of like the layout of the casino, though - they have a lot of black jack and other tables and many of them are grouped under the little pavilion-type things, which makes them easy to locate.  They seemed to have quite a few $10 and $15 tables, which is great.  The dealers at our craps table were great, too - they were fun, funny and they interacted well with everyone.

My very first hotel was the old Imperial Palace in the early 90's. It was dingy back then and kinda low rent....but I was 21 and on a budget so I expected that. 

Since then I've stayed at various strip hotels at both ends of the spectrum price range.  

However this hotel and this trip felt odd to me.  It struck me as if they were a hotel grasping for a profit. Around every turn, I was asked if I wanted to upgrade for $___?   At check-in (on a Tuesday during the off season) I got a floor on the lovely 7th floor overlooking the rooftop of AC's and pigeons nests. I wasn't booked through a website and didn't have any discounts.  The room was nestled into the corner and blocked by the towering stories that my cell phone coverage was crappy along with my MiFi internet hotspot.  At check-in I was asked if I wanted to pay for an upgrade to a higher floor with a view?  I opted out of it as it was a work trip anyways.  I do remember before upgrades to higher floors and nicer places were standard especially if rooms were available.  The business model was give your guest a great experience and they'll return.  I guess times have changed.

The room was fair.  Older carpet.  Old wood entertainment center.  Strangely enough...where you'd normally put the TV, they put a mini fridge.  In there defense there was  nice TV mounted over the desk.  

There were no easy accessible plugs for my electronics. I had to unplug the lamp to plug in my laptop.  I had to plug my phone in on the side of the bed and put it on the floor. Kinda strange to me considering all the electronics people travel with now.   

Now....in contrast..... I went to a friends room on the 32 floor.  LIKE NIGHT AND DAY!  New carpet. New entertainment center.  The chairs even seemed more comfortable.  Plugs on the desk itself. 

I guess it's a Vegas strip room. For weekend party folks it'll probably fit the bill. Let's be honest...how much time do you really spend in your room in Vegas anyways?

P.S.....I spoke with someone after writing this and they explained to me that Caesar's Entertainment recently filed bankruptcy and was approved for $6 billion dollars.  The older lady I wast talking with stated they reduced all the jackpot payouts on the slot machines.  Sounds about right if they're in bankruptcy.

They basically thought of it all and if I had stayed here longer I probably would have found far more to do within the hotel itself than elsewhere. They have a large casino area and many $5 single deck blackjack tables! WIN for something that's on the strip where I won't get shot while playing!

The issue I really had was the attitude of the check-in staff.  We wanted to check in 2 hours early.  But, apparently, even if the room was sitting and ready, this calls for a service charge. I literally felt like I was dealing with a cold hearted stripper.  (No joke) No smile, just a demand for my credit card for services not even rendered yet. 

The toilet overflowed and we had to ask them to mop it up.  The Paris didn't even offer to pay for the items destroyed by it.  We had to insist they do something about it.  Grudgingly, they took off the service charge for arriving too early.  Gee, thanks guys.

Again, there was no apology.  What the heck?!  What kind of customer service is this?  I believe they're taking this 'French theme' to the extreme here...

Well - I don't know what the hell I was thinking.

Here's just a quick lesson in why girls LOVE going to vegas in the summer.  It ain't the sound of people's bank accts going negative, it ain't the smell of disgusting cigarettes\/cigars, and it certainly ain't the sound of those cards slapped around by those annoying men on the street passing those degrading cards out blatantly to men who are walking hand-in-hand with their gf\/wife.  Girls love vegas in the summer for the pool.  Although it's scorching hot and we end up frying ourselves out there poolside, there is nothing more fun than ordering cocktails, grubbing on buffalo chicken strips and then jumping in the pool to wash it all off our fingers & mouths.  So what could be a bigger buzz kill than some jerk-face who completely shatters the image Paris tries to uphold!  

It was hot and I was so thirsty and the now-warm Margarita next to my foot did not seem very tasty to satisfy my thirst.  I went to the bar located within the poolside lounge area.  I had just $4 cash on me and nothing else, thinking I'm sure a bottle of water cannot cost more than $4 even in vegas.  I asked the guy behind the counter (Mark) how much the aquafina (small bottle) was - he says ""$4 - I need to see an ID"".  I replied confused ""Oh, I just want water, not ordering alcohol"".  He says ""Doesn't matter - I need to see an ID"".  A little peeved at his attitude ""Well - I didn't bring my ID down with me - we came down to swim (**it's a POOL not a CLUB! - I didn't say this...but you get my point)..."" He says ""well, I need an ID"". I said - ""For a water?""....He says as he gets closer to my face ""EVEN TO SPEAK WITH ME!"".  WTF! $%#$%(&*(#&$*#^%*&^$*Q#%^&!%!!!!!!!!!!!! I could NOT believe what had just happened!!!  And I know, I know...being the bigger person, I should control my emotions and ask to speak with a manager then and there calmly at that point....well..I'm not one of those calm, collected, think-with-your-head type- I'm a Woman!  I turned around to walk away in shock...and then turned right back and said ""F%ck you!"" Very classy of me right?  But I couldn't help it - I had to have him get a piece of me somehow.  I cannot stand letting guys like that just go.  You'd think that's the end of that right? Ha - the ass-face says back ""You too!"".  Who says that to a customer??!!  I know I shouldn't have said something so harsh to him, but he deserved it cuz he wanted to card me to ""Speak with him"" inches away from my face spit just missing my nose!   Since when did ""I'm sorry maam that's our policy"" become so difficult to say?  

I went back to my sister and her bf with steam coming out of my ears and cheeks hotter than the 132 degree weather that day.  Eventually, I called the manager on site and let him have it but I know how this kind of stuff works - that assface probably still has the job and still has mental issues he needs to work out before clocking into work each day.  I am still puffing with anger and even if Paris is the only hotel with a vacant room next time I need to go, I'd rather sleep on the street than donate my hard earned money to them only so they can pay someone so disrespectful and rude as an employee.  

I work in a customer-service oriented industry myself and know it's not what we sell but how we sell it.  What job isn't customer-first?  If the customer does not stay at the hotel, eat at the restaurant, bank at the bank, and shop at the store - we would not have that nice paycheck in our acct every other week.  I told the manager I chose to stay at Paris not because I have to.  They no longer earn my business as a guest nor gambler, even if it is because of just one employee who didn't know better.",10,6,5

I have to say that from check in to check out, it was a very good experience.  Nikky, who helped with check in, was very friendly. She had such a good outlook on life and was very attentive to it being my first time.  She helped me with an upgraded room and made sure my stay was memorable.  I wish everyone could be so friendly in life.  (Helps to be friendly too, no matter how bad of a trip you are having!!)

The line was ridiculous; only 3 people were working that night and many people were cutting the line, showing no order or control as I've seen in other hotels.  

When we finally got attended, our agent was rude and abrasive offering no apologies for the wait or any kind of discount.  I didn't catch her name but she was working alongside an agent named Amber, who appeared very nice.  I overheard Amber offering her guests a voucher for breakfast as a result of the delay, that when I asked our agent she said that they don't do something like that.  Are you kidding me?  I just saw it happen, heard it happen!  And chances are you heard it too!  She then rudely told us that if she would have to give everyone some kind of voucher if she had to give one to us.....well, what's wrong with that?  It's not everyone's fault that not enough people were staffed.  Another excuse given:  There were alot of flights that got delayed hence the wait, and it isn't normally like this.

Now, for the cons.  When I threw away my trash in the bin under the desk,  I noticed that there were 2 packages of cigarette packages with ashes inside.  This was supposed to be a non-smoking room and I was very disappointed.  Called housekeeping to change the whole trash can and not just dump it out because it stinked up the whole room.  When they finally arrived hours later, housekeeping asked if I had smoked.  WTH?  Didn't I just told you that I found all these things in my trash can and want a new bin b\/c this was a non-smoking room?

The rooms are nothing special, and are kind of turning the corner between ""new"" and ""time to redecorate"", but are clean and well appointed.  The beds are nice and comfy -- not too hard, not too soft.

We did not pay for the room as my stepmom was able to get it for free. Yay for free rooms! Overall, this place was just okay, I don't think I would try to make reservations here, but if I got another free room, I would take it.

We had the Red room, which I have heard is better than the standard room. The room was cute, very modern. The bed was SUPER comfortable for me. I have back problems and usually sleeping on any bed but my own causes me to have back pain in the morning. So I came armed with my magic pills, but never needed to take them. My back felt great all weekend!

The bathroom was spacious, I liked all the counter space. The tub was nothing special. 

The A\/C didn't work too well. We like it cold when we sleep and we had it turned all the way down to 68 but there was no way it was any cooler than 78. The room had kind of a musty smell.

There is a mini fridge in the room, which we liked since we had leftovers from dinner at Craftsteak. I always hate when we eat there and have to toss the leftovers because our room doesn't have a fridge, so it was nice that we could bring them back.

The casino is okay, although pretty small. I got lucky and hit a couple jackpots this weekend (yay!) so I shouldn't really complain about that.

The ""big"" bar on the way to the elevators is actually really small and has zero ambiance. The best part is sitting near the walkway and people watching. I visited the smaller bar in the middle of the casino once and it took forever to get a bartender to help me, even though there were only three other people there.

The valet blows. Every time we took our car out we had to wait quite awhile for it. And, you know, it's freakin hot in Vegas. Well they have misters, but they are not turned on. So we were dying waiting for the car. Dropping off was also a hassle, it's like they don't have enough valet people. Maybe they all called out sick this weekend? One of the times we dropped our car off, I am not kidding, we waited 30 minutes for somebody to come take our keys. Ridiculous.

I've never stayed here, that I can remember... But it definitely has the feel of a theme park (in a good way!) I feel like Belle from Beauty and the Beast when I walk through the little town.

We like to party though.  There was some loud music coming from the Cosmopolitan across the street so I can see some early sleepers having a problem.  If you're one of those people then just ask for a room in the back.  I'm sure they will accommodate you.  

Personally I love the French theme and the French restaurants in the hotel including a crepe station, small French bistro and another French cafe.  A hamburger with foie gras and caramelized apples?  YES!  If you want to go pricey they do have the Eiffel Tower restaurant and Gordon Ramsay's.  

The good:  Right in the middle of the Vegas strip.  You can't get a better location for the price.  You're across the street from Bellagio and Caesar's for half the price.  Also you're connected to Bally's and don't even have to go outside to get there.  That is where the monorail station is and you can go from there to several other casinos without taking a cab which is excellent.  There is a mall there with any needs you might have all within a short walk from the elevator.  I ordered room service at 4am and it was there much faster than I thought it would be and they don't even include a mandatory gratuity, which was nice.  The food was great, eggs benedict and a custom burger with fries...the Vegas experience at it's best.

Another fun thing whether you stay here or not is to go up on top of the Eiffel Tower.  It's the best view of the strip you'll see.  It is a small landing on top so there is a wait sometimes, but well worth it.  It's an exact replica of the real Eiffel Tower, just half the size.  If you're freaked out by heights you may not like it but it was one of the more interesting things we did in Vegas.

The bad:  This is now one of the middle priced hotels on the strip.  I got a smoking room and the sofa had a couple of burned places on it.  There was a little scribbling on the wall in the bathroom.  It wasn't a big deal to me, but if you want perfection you might want to seek a higher end place.  The room was clean and we had a great view of the strip so that made up for any imperfections.  We really liked the decor of the hotel.  The TV was intermittent and sometimes switched channels on it's own!  We thought it might be someone next door with the same remote though.

The weekend was supposed to be a 50th birthday for a friend and turned into an unfulfilling experience.  It all began at valet, attempting to get parked after a long 4 hour drive.  The valet, whose name I cannot remember but description I can, was tall, goofy, white guy with austin powers teeth, began by telling me the the valet was full, only room for hotel guests.  I said, oh, were guests and he asked for our key...we hadn't checked in yet.  This master interrogator then told my wife and I that our stories did not match-up and he would not be taking our car...I was fuming!  I told him to move a cone and parked my car in self-park and literally ran to the valet manager.  She was nice, tried to be helpful, but only offered to park our car in VIP, where that ass would have access to it, I told her thanks but no thanks, I'll walk.  I then went to check-in and complained, hoping to get a better resolution.  That manager was nice, took my information and said he would call when he reached his boss to tell her the story...never heard a thing...I really feel like I was kicked in the balls, everybody laughed and nothing was done to the offender, and that was only at check-in!  A list of other things wrong with this hotel you say?  Well lets start with rude staff, espcially ther waiters, the hotel looks grungy inside, the room looked like a mess!

Overall:
Housekeeping, very nice.
Front Desk service= ugh...
Gordon Ramsay Steak= AMAZING
Room Service= Satisfactory
Hotel keeping your non-smoking request= not a big priority for them.

My husband and I are frequent Vegas tourists-- we usually go an average of 3 times a year for a little R&R and we usually stay 2 or 3 nights and do most of the typical Vegas tourist things.  We've stayed at a lot of places in Las Vegas and we won't be coming back here for sure.

We booked through Paris Las Vegas' website and booked two NON-SMOKING rooms for us and our friends for two nights Thursday-Saturday.  We got into town at about 8pm and got in line to check in.  The line was a bit longer, but it was fine.  We get up to the desk to check in and they were completely out of non-smoking rooms... we even had a DEPOSIT in on our rooms and they didn't do anything to make us feel better about it.  

We tried to be good sports about it and we took the smoking rooms-- they put us on a list to get a different room for the next night and that's all they would do to accommodate us.  The rooms were totally GROSS.  We woke up feeling gross and like there was smoke remnants all through our hair.  My eyes felt crusty in the morning and I totally had ash in my nose-- SUPER NASTY.  We could see the dust (or ash) floating around in the room... ugh.

The next day we came back to switch rooms... we couldn't get into the new room until 4pm the next day.  I was disappointed that they didn't offer to upgrade us to a better room with non-smoking since we had been very specific that we didn't want a smoking room.  They clearly over book the hotel for non-smoking and then they do everything on a first come, first serve basis.  This must be very common for them too because the people at the front desk almost saw this as a routine and were totally expressionless when giving us the news that we wouldn't be getting what we had reserved with our deposit.  

Once we were in the new non-smoking room, it was cleaner in the air, but it was still Paris Las Vegas... The bathroom was nice and clean, but not as glitzy or exciting like other places we've stayed.  The linens are starting to show their wear and tear and some of the towels smelled bleachy.  The bed was fine, but nothing spectacular.  The housekeeping people are nice though.  Room service is fine, but nothing amazing.  Their portions are pretty good though and they were right on time for what they quoted.

The rest of the hotel is nicer though-- Gordon Ramsay Steak was amazing and the casino is still pretty nice.  The bakery there is also very good and we enjoyed getting crepes there too.

We won't be staying here again... Booking a room here means that you'll get a room but it might not be exactly what you want.  I'd come back to eat at Gordon Ramsay Steak anytime, but that's probably the only thing that would bring me back to Paris Las Vegas.",3,1,1

What they do so well is really run with the theme of a getaway to Paris.  It was hard not to reflect on my travels to the real Paris during my stay here.  They have a beautiful pool that lies before a mock replica of the Eiffel Tower for example.  Sitting on the other side of the pool, you have a view of a fairly grand, French-style hotel.  The styling continues indoors, with all the signs being bilingual, and the accents decidedly Gaullist.  Many of the staff are French including at the gaming tables, and the several restaurants and cafes in the hotel are primarily French.  Seriously, that was quite the treat!  I was able to get a freshly baked, hot baguette, good French roast coffee, and really any French dish you can think of:  pate, roti, escargots, pain perdue, pain au chocolat, cassoulet, etc -- and they were all prepared in the French way!  The room was beautiful and a touch elegant.  I loved the marble floor in the bathroom, the separation of bath and shower, the Gilchrist and Soames toiletries, and the plush bed.  Security was decidedly lax too, making me feel like a proper guest rather than an intruder.  The concierge was always very helpful too.  

Were there any downsides to staying here?  Well, they don't have a resort fee.  That sounds like a good thing until you realize that means you have to pay for your internet access which is billed not per room, but rather per laptop -- ouch!  Also, if you want to use their rather nice fitness center, that will be $25 extra per day.  I would rather just pay the resort fee and take those things for granted.  Oh, well.  That really is the only thing I can complain about though.  The hotel is beautiful, and I really loved spending my time here.",4,2,2

First off its the end of March and the weather is windy and super cold. We came out to valet to wait for our car to find all the heaters turned off. I approached the valet window and asked if they could be turned on. The women Amber working the booth said sorry the heaters were turned off for the season. I said can I ask why, it's especially cold tonight and we've been waiting for already 8 minutes for our vehicle. Amber responded with well it was 95 out last week and if you have an issue with it you can go inside and speak with the hotel manager. I explained I didn't have time to do that and Amber said well it's not really her problem. I find it absolutely ridiculous that the 3 small heaters can't easily be turned on and off with a switch and that they are turned off for the entire season once temps reach a certain point for 1 night!?!?!?

I'll start with the pros.  
The hotel itself is in a very nice location. Right across from the Bellagio and in the center of all the action.  The standard room was actually pretty spacious.  I always judge from the edge of the bed to the TV stand.  Well the TV was mounted over the desk, but there was a armoire unit to hang clothes, drawer space and a small fridge.  But there was good enough walking space in between.  There also is a nice sitting area with Victorian like seating to go with the theme.  The bathroom was very spacious featuring a stall shower and bathtub.  Although the bathtub was small, let's face it - who actually uses it.  The stall was a good size and nice water pressure.  The whole bathroom was decorated very tastefully with marble.  Also, housekeeping was on point.  No matter what time we left our room, even if it was just to get breakfast, as soon as we got back our room was cleaned to perfection.

Outside of the room, you've got your standard casinos, restaurants, and the hotel theme featuring the Eiffel Tower and walkways modeled like Paris streets.  It did give you that Parisian type of feeling and all of the food was definitely French-like.  We ate at one of the cafe shops, Mon Ami Gabi and one of the pastry shops.  All good.  We also partied at their club, Chateau, which I think was one of the most awesome places to dance the night away.  it is essentially in the Eiffel Tower, outside.  Great music and cool ambiance.

For the cons. While the room was very nice, there was one thing that caught my attention since I could not miss it.  The full length mirror was on the inside of the bathroom door. While most of you may think - So What?  When the door was closed and you are doing your do on the ""toilette"", you get a nice view of yourself in all your glory.  Now thankfully, I am not shy, but I'd rather be focusing on something else.  However, I got a chance to see what I really look like posed in all of my glory.  I found out that I look like the statue ""The Thinker"".  So there is a pro in that con, I think??.  

In the halls too I noticed dirty glasses sitting there for days, literally.  By day 3, they were finally gone.  Room service was timely, although the food was not that great and expensive as all heck.  For the prices they were charging, I expected much better.  They also wanted to charge $14 for a pot of coffee!!  Now Las Vegas prices are ridiculous in general, but I thought that was extreme.  

Also, if you get a room facing the pool expect to hear the booming noise from the club.  The hotel staff expect that you might complain and can give you with ear plugs, but for a 4\/5 star hotel, I would expect them to better equip their rooms with sound barriers.  Last thing they could work on is making sure the hall ways and other areas are kept up with any needed repairs.  We noticed a nice hole in one of the walls in the hallways.  I'm sure they are making enough money that that could have been patched up.

Other than those cons, I still very much liked the hotel for my first visit.  I personally could deal with those cons because it did not disrupt me enjoying my trip.",3,0,0

First of all, the decor is so cute, atmosphere-ic, and has a wonderful ambience.

I love the cobble-stoned ""streets,"" fake homes, apartments, buildings, shops, streetlamps, street signs, and street performers. It's all so charming and beautiful. The ceiling is painted like a beautiful sky, and it is lovely. The fake apartments have windows over the shops that have red geraniums in the window boxes, just like in Paris. 

The rooms are a bit plain, though, and not indicative of the Parisian theme of the hotel and casino. I don't know if I'd pay such expensive prices and want such plain-o rooms. 

The casino also now has a weird smell that smells of stale cigarettes and restrooms that permeates the casino. Ugh. I hope they can get rid of that soon. I know they  just had a bunch of traveling shows and tournaments go through here, but they need to rectify the smelly situation immediately.

They have a great buffet and many great restaurants at this hotel (I like Le Cafe, Sugar Factory, and Le Provencal (I ate there 5 years ago, though, so I can't say what it's like now). I used to love Le Notre bakery, but now it's Cafe Madeleine? I haven't tried the new place yet.

It's so much fun just to take a walk down and around the hotel. 

They have the Eiffel Tower, Jr., that is to scale at exactly 1\/2 the size of the actual Eiffel Tower. There's a fake Arc de Triomphe and the hotel kind of looks like it has the same architectural design\/look as the Louvre, but I'm not sure. Either way, it's gorgeous.

There's a big circular pool (not very exciting for the kiddies) that is right under the Eiffel Tower, and it's adorable. The Paris hotel and casino is right across from the Bellagio, so it's easy to go back and forth if you cross the walkway from Bally's (next door to Paris) to Bellagio.

Centrally located on the strip and you can actually go up the Eiffel Tower. I brought my mom on a business trip with me a few weeks ago and we stayed in an Eiffel Tower view room, which also gave us a great view if the Bellagio fountains. This was one of the traditional French styled rooms, not an updated red room, but it was perfect with extra space, a table and chairs by the window, and a separate shower and bath. Great room! The casino is the perfect size for someone who wants to feel part of the Vegas hustle and bustle without needing a map to find their way around. Plus, there is a interior walkway, lined by shops, to Bally's, another Total Rewards hotel and casino. Inside Paris, we enjoyed Oysters at Mon Ami Gabi, which were wonderful. They, brought a loaf of warm bread and a amuse bouche which was delightful with the Oysters and cocktails. We also ate at the Dim Sum place inside and found it fun to try some unknown dishes. We had excellent, and I mean excellent, martinis (one gin and one vodka) with plump blue cheese stuffed olives with calamari at Martorano's Italian Restaurant. We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive. On our last morning there, we ate at Le Cafe located in the heart of the casino (great for people watching) and ordered the hash dish and a nutella crepe and shared. It was a fabulous meal from start to finish. The cafe has a facade of a street in Paris, which makes a perfect backdrop for selfies with mom. Overall, the employees were polite and respectful everywhere we went inside Paris. The staff can make or break and experience and in this case, they were the cherry on top. I called the last night for a late check out for the following morning and without any hassle or negotiations, they extended our stay two hours so we didn't have to wait around somewhere before heading to the airport. The line was long to check out, so instead, I filled out a few lines on a postcard to complete express checkout. I had a receipt emailed to me within hours.

At 10 pm we decided to settle in for the night because of an early departure time in the morning. About 30 min later we began to hear extremely loud music coming from outside, it was rattling the windows and floors so it was obviously way above an acceptable decibel level. That said, we figured ""hey, it's Vegas"", tried not to be party poopers, And tried to get to sleep. With the windows vibrating it just wasn't possible. We tossed and turned as the hours went by hoping it would end by 2am like most clubs. When it still hadn't stopped by 3am we called the front desk, who connected us to security. Security advised us that they had rented out their beer park venue (which was directly across from our room)  for a private party and that they had no control over it. They didn't know when it would end, and they could not have them decrease the sound to a legal level. We were told we weren't the only ones complaining. We called the lvpd non emergency line and were told that yes, even in Vegas noise ordnances have to be followed. They were going to send someone out when the noise FINALLY stopped. 4am on the dot. 
The next morning upon check out I go to the front desk to complain. The supervisor(who wasn't wearing a name tag) offered to refund our resort fee. I asked to have the room rate refunded too since we literally didnt sleep, and she rudely stated she couldn't do anything because it was booked through priceline. (I know this is a lie because I called priceline and they told me that hotels have the power to refund rooms if they want to). I then asked to at least have the parking comp'd since she couldn't do anything for the room and she refused rudely and insisted it wasn't their fault because it had been a private event. I told her I'm an event planner and KNOW when you rent a venue there are time and noise regulations put into the contract, so it was, in fact, the Paris hotel's responsibility. 
She rudely said ""well I'll be sure to pass that along"". 
At least when we got to valet they were kind and asked how our stay was. I told them and they were nice enough to refund the parking.

Lets be honest since the demise of the Mob's presence in Vegas themed hotels have been the allure to Vegas.  Well besides the availability to debauchery and gambling.  When you come to Vegas why would you want to stay in a regular run-of-the-mill hotel when you can be whisked away to Paris? You wouldn't.

Welcome to the Paris Hotel.  This is the premiere destination when enjoying a romantic trip to Vegas.  From arrival you are greeted by familiar landmarks that you have seen on many a postcard.  Some you have no clue what their names are but you know you've seen them.

Once inside I feel like I have been transported to France (minus the long flight and cost). At least what I imagine what France is like, I wont actually be to the real Paris until August.  The staff members are very courteous and really make your stay as pleasant as possible.  The best rooms to get are the front facing rooms, not only are the views better but they are larger.  With comfortable beds, settee's and and aroma one can assume is of Parisian allure.

Left a room at Bellagio from the weekend to come into a ""luxury suite"", which some friends had previously labeled as ""higher"" status. Stayed at the ST. TROPEZ SUITE, which is not cheap, though not ""Presidential"" either. I'd say is above mid standards, for its price. Walked into the hotel, not a long walk by the way, as soon as I got off the elevator, noticed the antiquated designs in the hallways,  didn't like that.  Although I saw the huge front doors to the rooms, already told me that the suites were going to be pretty big, which maintained me excited about it. Got in the room, and yes, it was HUGE. A living room, a dining room, 3 rooms, dresser rooms, 2 big bathrooms, especially the one by the master bed of course, a bunch of couches, sofas, TVs, etc. Beautiful view of Northside of the Strip, so far so good. However, I expected a bit more luxury, resembling French architecture and luxury that embodies charm, elegance and grace. 

However, this was unquestionably a disappointment. There is a vast difference between old style European luxury and cheap antiques, huge difference! I know French décor is characterized by ""heart and home"" lifestyle, a welcoming but luxurious at the same time. This suite, looked like it was comprised of my 90 year old neighbor's garage sale and items found at a flea market.  It did have French touches, chandeliers, wall sconces, etc., but it was just ugly. Having French décor, does not mean you have to spend a fortune, you just have to choose authentic items with care. This room looked like if it was the storage center for old unwanted items from the rest of the hotel's other rooms. I understand is ""Paris"", contemporary! if I wanted a more modern look, I should've gone to Wynn, Aria or other newer hotel, but still, you are paying for a ""luxury suite"" at a French themed resort, you would expect a ""higher end"" experience, but instead, got the opposite. It seems that the ""Red Room"" is a lot more luxurious than this suite, and A LOT cheaper too! If I would've known, I would have instead gotten the Red Room, or better yet, selected a different hotel. Another negative, was the fact that there were extra roll-over beds\/mattresses standing in the living room, stayed there for a couple of days, as if I was having too many people stay there that didn't fit in already in the 3 bedrooms. I know it is Vegas and they must be used to having a lot of people to share and over-pack the rooms when coming to town for partying purposes.

The room is old, stained, small, and fails to even remotely resemble what was advertised on the website. I complained to the front desk and was told I had gotten the correct room and not all of the Red Room Premiers resemble the one on the website. They advertised these rooms were newly or recently renovated. I asked the how long ago the renovation took place and I was told 6 years ago. This place is a dump.

Makes me seem like such an elitist, doesn't it?

It's just that I have consistently done ok at their tables (read: lost less than other places), like the feel inside (read: not so smoky), and liked the friendly dealers (read: ummm.....friendly dealers).

And though you haven't given me as much joy as your sister city, you also didn't give me a case of crabs like that 2-star near Rue de Rivoli, so I guess all other comparisons really aren't constructive.

We arrived around 11:30 am on a Weds. We knew it may be too early to check in but most hotels on the strip allow early check ins around noon. So we decided to give it a shot when we arrived. After waiting in line for nearly 20 mins (when there was only 4 people in front of us) we finally got to up to the counter. We gave our name and confirmation number and to our dismay the nice lady told us we only had reservations for one night instead of the four we booked and our name wasn't on any of the four rooms reserved for my wife's company. PLUS, there's now a $25 early check in fee!!! Our jaws dropped... We had to wait two hours for the wife's boss to arrive so he could sort out the confusion. AFTER all that was finally figured out, the nice lady proceeded to tell us that our rooms weren't ready. This being at 3:30 when regular check-in time usually is... She told us to come back after an hour to see. Needless to say an hour later (4:30 for those who can't keep track) and they still weren't. So the nice lady (sarcasm if you can't tell) personally disappeared for another 15 mins to go yell at the cleaning crew herself. A half hour later, the rooms were finally ready. We had dinner reservations with a client at 6... That left us barely an hour to get ready. Luckily we were meeting downstairs at Mon Ami Gabi. After all our hassle, the nice lady never once apologized, nor offered anything to us for all of the trouble we had checking in.

Now... the rooms, ugh. We walked in and I felt like I was teleported back to Chicago where I was walking into my Grandmother's living room. Everything was dated, the old lamps on the walls were crooked, the small living area couch looked like it was from 1935. I even thought I caught a whiff of mothballs at one point. The TV was in the ""living area"" and was hard to see from where the bed was. There was no closet in the room at all. The old spring mattress felt like 1"" thick plywood with some sheets and a comforter on top. The pillows were tiny and it was a complete nightmare to sleep. The bathroom featured a single sink, toilet, separate bathtub, and a stand alone shower.... That was about the size of the bathroom on our Southwest plane. Rushing, the wife and I turned the shower on expecting hot water to flow within a min or two. Literally 15 mins later we finally had hot water. We crammed into the shower with only 40 mins to be downstairs. The wife usually takes about 1.5 hours to get ready, so she's not happy at this point. We barely made our dinner reservations with our important client. 

When we were finally ready to leave, we had the bell hop take our bags so we could walk around for a little while longer before our shuttle arrived. He handed me our ticket to hold our bags and actually stood there with his hand out waiting for a tip. I was shocked, then after finally giving him a couple bucks he just turned and walked away without saying anything. 

I've stayed at MGM, Monte Carlo, Mirage (x2), Venetian, and TI... This by far was the worst experience I've ever had at a hotel on the strip. Pick any other hotel but this one, it's not as glamorous as it seems from the outside.",6,1,0

I find the practice of bribing the front desk clerk distasteful.  The fact that they expect to be paid under the table to give you a good room basically ruins it for those of us that are honest.

My HUGE gripe with Paris was this.  We got to the hotel around noon and checked in.  No room is yet available.  Oh, no wait, there is one for an early check-in fee.  We're very tired from packing and flying, so yeah, we'll take it.

We drag our bags up to our room, walk inside, then my wife sounding panicked says, ""There's somebody in here!""  I was panicked too.  I saw luggage on the bed, it was opened.   I hurriedly opened the door and told her to get out.  I told housekeeping and they said, go back to the front desk.  So we lugged our luggage back to the front desk, got in line AGAIN and told them what happened.

I told them that they basically put us in danger.  We could have interrupted a drug deal, or someone having an affair, or someone with lots of cash and guns.  They couldn't have been less concerned.  They didn't even give us 5% off a piece of bubble gum, no upgrade, no show tickets.  Nothing.  What they did do was tell us we'd have to wait for our room after all.  No early check-in.

I've been staying in Hotels for nearly 30 years and this has NEVER happened.  When it happens at Paris, they aren't even apologetic.  In fact we felt that we were being looked at with suspicion.  

Maybe it's a rare mistake, it might even have been forgivable.  But to be unapologetic and make no attempt to make amends looks to me like the opposite of hospitality.  

We did get to visit several other hotel\/casinos in the area and there are definitely nicer places to stay.  No need to patronize Paris or Caesar's or Planet Hollywood.... or any of the Caesar's companies in the future.

My wife was asleep when I wrote this review.  We were packing up to check out and I asked her why she slept on top of the covers for the duration of our four night stay.  She said when we checked in she pulled back the covers and there was some crispy\/crusty stuff on the sheets.  OMG, that's disgusting.  We normally pay a premium to stay in hotels that we know provide clean linens.  I'd have expected better from this hotel and for this price.  I'm completely grossed out. 

At first I felt a little bad about one star, but now I'm certain they deserve it.  Again, enjoy our money.  It wont be the last we spend on vacations and entertainment by far, but if I can help it, it will be the last we give to them.",9,2,0

Paris is generally a nice play to stay. It's very cute! It does give you a sense of Paris, that is, until you enter the casino\/gambling area. Checking in is a complete pain in the ass. Wait is long, and the lines move at a terribly slow pace. I think I waited about 30-40 minutes just to check in. Fun! 

Our rooms were decent. Aside from the view, the rooms were not anything special. I could have settled for somewhere cheaper and gotten a similar room. The pool is huge and nice! I didn't go into the water, but man the sun was ablaze. It was nice to relax by the pool.

Checking out is a lot more simple than checking in. You can pretty much fill out a card and put it into a check out box. They take care of it.

First, as we walked into the hotel to start four days of business travel, we were met by hawkers trying to get us to look at condos in return for show tickets. One of them actually took my wife by the arm and tried to lead her over to their kiosk. After dodging them, we walked a little further, and another shopkeeper stopped my wife and tried to convince her to buy eye cream. We finally got in line at registration and were happy to find only six parties in line ahead of us. After about fifteen minutes, the line had not moved. When it finally came time to register, we found out why the line moved so slowly, as we were upsold everything from Wi-Fi to spa packages. Speaking of Wi-Fi, it's $15 a day PER DEVICE, which is ridiculous considering that Vegas is a destination for many conventions...the reason for our stay. Our room was adequate..think Hampton Inn with a granite shower. Since we had been traveling for many hours and were still on Eastern time, and had to rise early for a morning meeting, we retired to bed around 9PM. At 11PM, our pictures and mirrors began shaking as a DJ at a club at the base of the Eiffel Tower about 100 yards from our room began playing Techno Dance music with subwoofers that must have been the size of a Dodge Caravan. Let me be clear, the Paris Hotel was playing loud music right outside their guests' rooms from 11PM-4AM. When we asked about this, we were told that we could request earplugs. One of the people who checked in with my company was told they could have a room with a view, but it would be loud, or, they could overlook the parking deck. I would like to have been in the business meeting where that decision was made. ""What can we do about the fact that the back of our hotel has a terrible view?"" ""How about we play loud music all night outside the rooms with a nice view just to even things out?"" ""Brilliant, Roberts! Let's implement that right away!""

We got a good deal through Hotwire, and soon found ourselves in the opulent check-in area of the Paris. It really only got better from there. Our room was clean, smelled nice, and came with toiletries that made my skin feel nice and soft in the usual dry-as-hell hotel air.

The 24-hour cafe does its job-- it's reasonably priced, and its food doesn't give you the usual creepy-crawly feeling that 24-hour cafes give you.

The buffet: FANTASTIC. For what seems to be the usual price of buffets now (a whopping $20-$25 a person... yikes!), you get a RIDICULOUSLY huge selection of food, and not just your usual buffet fare-- Great food! Steaks, crab, seafood, more pastries than you can wave a stick at... everything!

And speaking of pastries, they have what may have been the best pastry shoppe I've ever seen (yeah, yeah, I know, I've never been to the REAL Paris, so shut up.).

Service was always spectacular, even when I had some peculiar requests (such as a humidifier). Since we went through a deal website, our view, while less than amazing, was still a decent strip view. Our friends, who went through the same site, had an amazing view, to be fair. It was kind of luck of the draw.

All in all, I'd like to see this place again, and hopefully I will. 

PROS: Excelllent service, good food, decent prices, great position on the strip, clean rooms, expedient housekeeping service, comfy beds

CONS: Smallish casino floor (attached to Bally's, so that helps), the buffet is kind of pricey (but you get what you pay for).

VERDICT: Seeya again, hopefully soon, Paris!",6,1,2

Pro & Con: Registration on a Sunday afternoon was crazy busy with very long lines. We had just finished a five hour drive to get there and the line was a PIA.   Having gotten through the line, weren't we impressed that we got an upgrade to a parlor room for a standard rate room. Yay!

Pro's: Having been to Paris, France on a number of occasions we really liked all the special French touches throughout the hotel.  Look around at the ceilings and the moldings, really beautifully done.  Great lobby artwork, took us back to fond memories of prior trips.  The lobby and the halls are kept beautifully clean and free of trash and debris.  The wait for an elevator was quite impressive considering how many people stay at this hotel.

Con's: I brought all my workout gear and headed straight for the spa\/gym the first morning.  I was not happy when told use of the gym would be a $100 (for the week) added on to my room.  Needless to say, I passed on that and did lots of walking to make up for the lack of going to the gym.

Con:  There was no free wifi in the room. If you want it added, this will set you back $15.00+ p\/day. One thing you will find with Vegas in general,  is that nothing is complimentary\/free.  

Pro & Con: We can recommend the cafe called Madelines on the ground floor.  It's convenient but in the morning has very long lines (seems everywhere there are long lines to wait in).  The coffee and the pastry were very delish but also expensive.  2 medium coffee and 2 croissants were around $15.00, I think that's expensive. Note: I do pay close attention to details, I couldn't figure out how we ordered the same selection every morning and yet the total on the bill varied each morning.  What the?

Pro: Our parlor room was very spacious and as I stated earlier had beautiful French artwork on the walls.  The king sized bed was very comfortable and there was plenty, plenty of closet storage room for our clothes and luggage.  We had a seating area for snacking\/coffee in the morning, a couch area for our friends to sit on when they came to visit as well as a separate ""bar"" area for drinks and appy set ups.  The bathroom was bigger than both of our back home bathrooms.  The marble on the sinks and the shower were a light orange in color and really quite unique.  We had a state of the art flat screen TV (although we didn't use it much) offered a great picture and sound quality.  

Pro: The ride up the Eiffel Tower was so much fun at night.  Bring your camera or iPhone and have a ball.  The view up and down the strip was all lite up and magical.  As a suggestion to Paris Hotel, I understand that you never allow your paying guests to ride for free but maybe you could\/should offer a free VIP express line.  It seemed to me that as a paying guest at your hotel,  I shouldn't have to wait in line with the rest of the world to take the ride.  Just saying would have made me feel like I was ""special"" without it costing you anything. 

Pro: the pool area is big and spacious with waitress service all day.  Get there early to reserve your table and chairs as it does fill up quickly in the morning and people scramble later in the day to secure a chair.   

Pro: Gorden Ramsey's Steak restaurant is right there on premises and we had a really great meal on our last night in Vegas.

Con: don't visit the Paris on the last weekend in March as it hosts the International Karate Kids Exhibition and with it 5,000 kids, families, coaches and judges.  The actual competition happens on premises.  

Pro: Every single one of the staff members was helpful, friendly and intentionally nice.  Our needs and questions were answered swiftly and courteously and that was important to us.  Valet service was hopping and quick.  Bellman got our bags delivered  upon check in and picked up super fast when it was time to go.  

Lastly-

Pro: Paris is a pet friendly hotel.  This was a big consideration for us because we like to travel with our small dog.  There is a charge but the cost of a kennel vs a stay at the Paris was a no-brainer for us. For all of the pro's AND being pet friendly, you have our vote Paris and a promise of our repeat business.

Don't stay here unless you are either over 40 or have children. Anyone younger and single should stay elsewhere. Perhaps Aria or Venetian. Even Planet Hollywood. The casino was filled with old folk. That's fine and all, but I wanted more energy, and let's be honest-- eye candy. Rubbing elbows with elderly and kids in Vegas? Not my thing.

The pool is there so they can say they have a pool. It was filled with leaves from nearby trees. Our bathroom smelled like pee. And when we asked them to clean it again, it smelled like pee + chemical disinfectant. I wanted to puke.

Plus when we checked in, they said they only had a handicap accessible room available for the non-smokers, but they could switch our rooms tomorrow. We made our reservation weeks ago. Why would they suddenly not have a room for us? Methinks Paris is shady. We didn't switch because it was a pain in the ass. The next day the check in line was huge. I bet they just told us we could switch knowing that we wouldn't.

I wouldn't ever stay there again and certainly would't recommend it to anyone but my grandma.

If you use the self parking be prepared to walk through the shops and part of the casino to the front desk. It's definitely not a short distance.

There was rust or some black stuff on the light switch in the bathroom, mold in the shower, the wallpaper was peeling off in the room and bathroom, and the furniture was chipped up pretty badly. When I spend a lot of money on a ""5 star"" hotel I expect to see very little to no imperfections. My hotel view was ok; I could see the Bellagio lake (well some of it). 

If you have a chance check out the pool! The Eiffel Tower is in plain view and I really enjoyed it. The DJ could be better but I was getting drunk so I didn't care. There is a bar with drinks priced at Vegas prices. So I'll leave it there. 

I will say the staff was pretty nice and fabulous. The check-in agent who helped us with the keys was really helpful and even did his best to find us a suite with 2 beds when he found out we we're celebrating birthdays.

Your front desk staff ruined my stay at Vegas. I was there a month ago and I am still mad now. 

So here goes my story:
We made reservations for 2 nonsmoking rooms. My family and I arrived early, we tried to check in at 1pm but was told by the staff at Guest Services that our rooms were not ready and to come back at in 2 hours. Fair enough. We walked around for 2 hours, my mom started to feel ill, we returned to the front desk at 3pm. We were again told the rooms were not ready. We informed the front desk that one of the members of our party is not feeling well and we want to know how much longer is the wait. We were told in a very unsympathetic tone ""I don't know. Come back in half an hour."" We came back at 3:30 and was again told in a very monotone ""Your rooms are not ready."" So when can we expect our rooms? I asked. ""I don't know. It's not ready yet."" By this time, my mom was really feeling ill. The smoke in the casino was bothering her so she was literally sitting on the floor in the lobby. Which brings up another question, why are there no chairs or sitting area in your lobby? I guess that's because you want us to go and sit in the casino right? We again, informed the staff that someone is not feeling well. We have two rooms, can we check into one. We got a very unenthuastic ""Sure"". She found us a room. How long has that option been available? And then even more puzzling, she handled us one set of room keys and then a few seconds later, handed us another set of room keys. No explanation what-so-ever but apparently, we got both of our rooms. 

The next day, I decided I wanted to speak to management about this. Certain family members tried to talk me out of it saying ""Don't bother, they have our money only. They don't care. We're not high-rollers."" I thought about it but then thought it's not fair to you if we don't even give you the opportunity to make things better. So the next day, my sister and I went down to Guest Services and asked to speak with the manager who's on. We spoke with the manager. We told her what happened. She gave us a fake smile and without looking into anything said she can explain to us what happened. She states that they usually try to accomodate early check-ins but sometimes it's just not possible. I can understand that but wait, isn't the check-in time suppose to be 3pm? Apparently not, she said their check-in is at 4pm. Bellagio, MGM Grand, and many other hotels on the strip have a 3pm check-in time but at Paris it's 4pm. This was also information that we never received at the front desk. She also apparently didn't feel that our complaint of lack of communication with the front desk was justified. We were sent back and forth three times but she said rooms are constantly being turn-overed and said ""at a click of a button on the computer, things change... We might have no rooms available one second and then the next second we have tons of rooms all clean."" The tone of the manager was condescending and patronizing. I was even more upset after talking to her than before. 

Okay, so maybe I shouldn't have said anything, I'll just write you a nasty yelp review. 

I can deal with you old and smelly rooms but I cannot deal with you snotty attitude. 

So in conclusion, I am not coming back to this hotel again. There are better hotels on the Vegas strip. Apparently, the staff here thinks they are true Parisians.",3,0,0

I had to settle for a pain au chocolat (hardly the pain au chocolat you had in the real Paris, more like a Costco croissant with a squirt of dried up Hershey syrup inside) and a mocha from the ""boulagerie"" in the lobby, which was full of screaming kids and 0% BAC adults.

My dissatisfaction comes from the hotel room.  I used the frontdesktip.com to get a free upgrade from luxury to a premium.   The view of Bellagio was blocked by the eiffel tower and quality of the room was decent.  Problem is my neighbors were super noisy at 6am, I can hear everything and I kept getting mistaken phone calls at 6am from the neighbor's friend. 

Now.. after the second night of no sleep, I was really frustrated so asked the front desk if they can move us.  The clerk was a jerk and told me there's nothing available even before he looked it up.  I told him I would even pay for a suite or take a downgrade and that I just needed sleep and then he went ""Sir.. THERE.. IS.. NOTH...ING.. AVAIL.. ABLE.."" like I was a dumbass.  His sorry ass could've called the noisy neighbors or called security for me or something.

Tip : when you check in, make sure you are not next to a suite.  When you have something like #### and there is a ####P next to it, you got screwed and have them move you out that moment.

We had a very check-in staff person (Ryan) who was able to upgrade us to strip-view, with two rooms next to each other (not adjoining), but two double beds per room.

There's a club in the Eiffel Tower restaurant, and we heard house music and hip-hop on Friday night until 4am.  We were jetlagged, so hoping to get some sleep on our first night.

The rooms themselves are okay.  There's decent space and climate control.  The beds are comfortable. However, the carpets need to be replaced, and the bathrooms need a little updating. Still, for the limited time we spent in our rooms, it was average.

We had difficulty with some of the services.  On our first day, the pool was not heated to prepare for a charity polar-bear swim.

Disappointing!  The internet in the rooms was also very spotty. Although it was included in the ""resort fee"", it was slow and there was no internet on the casino floor.  They offered 1-day credit on our resort fee for the spotty internet.

The ""free breakfast"" was also a bit of a rip off.  Turns out, we were given $9 credit per person for breakfast, but we had to use it at Java Joe or Nosh, two fastfood type places at Bally's.  Java Joe had only coffee and minimal pastries.  Nosh had meals, but most of their choices (and most of the decent food) cost  more than $9. Not free, and we couldn't get meals at the nicer places within the Paris hotel.

Overall, we had a good time in Vegas and the stay at the Paris was probably worth the low price. It's a shame they haven't kept it up, or provided more high-quality services. It used to be far nicer.",1,0,0

Don't brush it off, especially if it's your first time in Vegas. It's central- which is a major plus. I also like the restaurants inside- can you say crepes!? You also can probably get a good deal here on the right day. PET FRIENDLY

Location:  Great place on the strip in my opinion. You're close to everything, and your room is right there! It's a little off from a Fat Tuesday (if anyone is obsessed like me lol) so that was kind of annoying butttt overall- yes. I personally get a little lost inside the hotel, but I think it's like that with most? I also have a Poot sense of direction so I might not be trusted in this capacity LOL

Rooms: They're straight! A little dated, but it works. I had a bad smelling room and they switched me very easily THANK GOD.

Food: Great food options both in the hotel and nearby. 

Buffet: I didn't get to try it!!! :( By the line though, I definitely have to if I come back!

Pets: They are pet friendly- I brought my dog along- but their pet fee is kind of pricey, $75? I believe.

Not a bad place to stay in Vegas.  High ceilings (painted like you're outdoor and looking up at the sky) gives it a friendly and fun environment.  The rooms are okay, no complaints but nothing special about them either.

We checked in around 4:30PM and waited about 20 minutes in line...only 3 people working the front desk. While not necessary to have all hands on deck all day, it would be nice during peak times. 

I had requested 1 king bed and they gave us a room with 2 queens. When we entered the room the carpets were wet, there appeared to be vomit stains on the floor, and there was a large commercial fan blowing in attempts to dry the floor. I have pretty severe asthma and allergies, so we had to go back down and request another room. Carrie at the front desk was very apologetic and helpful, and even noticed we had requested a room with a king sized bed and changed that as well. When we got to the room, the toilet paper holder was broken off and sitting on the sink, and it was clear housekeeping was aware of it as they had folded the bottom of the roll neatly. The room was clean and we had plenty of room and a little view of the Bellagio fountains. 

The Le Village buffet was subpar with the only decent items being the 2 kinds of Mac n cheese. The meats were fatty and rubbery, so we basically paid $35 for Mac n cheese. We paid $11.99 extra for the unlimited beer and wine, but the Blue Moon tastes skunked so we opted for a refund and had water instead. La Creperie was delicious - I got the Nutella crepe - but the line was long and the gentleman working did not seem happy to be there. The pool was nice and not too crowded on a Saturday, plenty of room in the water and lounge chairs available.

there's 2 things that you've gotta like about Paris: (1) the freaking Eiffel Tower coming up through the casino and towering above, and (2) the cute walkways, shops, and ""al fresco"" dining meant to mimic Parisian old city neighborhoods; the casino floor is surprisingly loud & vibrant, including occasional go-go dancers; I think it's a shame that the Eiffel Tower itself isn't a free tourist attraction, but you have to buy tickets or eat at the tower restaurant to go up the elevators; Mon Ami Gabi is famous for good reasonably-priced food and outdoor views of the Bellagio fountains, but a lesser-known option for the same is Sugar Factory; nice brightly lit hotel check-in area with many chandeliers; modest & uninspiring conference room hall; I'd give it 3 and 1\/2 stars overall; best craft beer bet = throughout Paris, it's a similar, modest selection; not bad, but nowhere is particularly good, with perhaps Sugar Factory being best",2,0,0

Couldn't get confirmation via email. Spent two hours trying to fix their mistake. Very little was offered in the way of restitution.

One of the guest managers, BLANCA SEM, is very rude and incompetent. Very unprofessional staff. Caesar's Entertainment has employed high school graduates in their 20's to serve in guest relations for their hotels. There are no adult, upper management professionals available. Unbelievable.",0,0,0

We checked in at 11 am, we were given a room facing a roof top. We returned to the front desk and nicely asked if a upgrade facing the strip was possible. The clerk was super nice. She said there were upgrades available. I also asked for a room away from the night club, knowing from previous reviews that it can get very loud. She said no problem, I can do that. She gave me the price I said OK, then she kept typing and said she wait here I'll give you the upgrade for $20 instead of $40. Wonderful! We agreed to wait the 2 hours to receive the keys before our upgraded room would be ready. The room was nice, the view amazing.......Until about 10:00 P.M.then BOOM, BOOM, BOOM until 3:00 A.M. The noise from the night club booming into our room. I guess the hotel isn't concerned about their guests getting any sleep. Does the $$$ from the night club trump the sleeping comfort of their guests??!! And while your laying there awake at 1:00 am you also get to smell cigarette smoke coming from somewhere. The ventilation system sucks! The location is great, but we will NOT be staying at the Paris Las Vegas Hotel again. At some point we needed to get some rest, you cannot do it at this hotel\/night club. Then it became time to checkout. We checked our balance on the TV in our room. We were charged $40 extra a night for the upgrade, not the $20 the nice clerk said she'd give us. We went down to the check out desk. Explained to the clerk that we were told $20 not $40. And I also explained that I had asked for a room away from the night club noise. The clerk said ""oh that's not possible, all rooms facing the strip have some night club noise"". Great another lie! (which at that point we had already figured out) We really didn't mind paying the $40 for a upgrade, but why tell us $20? The clerk brought out the manager, I could tell I wasn't going to get anywhere with him. I told him that I felt like we were lied to. He said he'd talk to the clerk that checked us in. What for, she won't remember us!! So make sure you get your room rate in writing, we made the mistake of trusting the clerk, about the noise and the discounted rate. If you want to party all night long, then this is the hotel for you!!! If you would also like to get some rest and do not want unwanted smoke in your room, pick another place.",2,1,1

I've been to the top of the Eiffel Tower and the views are absolutely beautiful! Overlooking the street at that height takes your Vegas experience to a whole different level. I highly suggest paying for the ride to the top and also make sure you go at night to see all of the beautiful lights. 

Now to the rooms:

Basic double bed room: It's just your typical room with the normal amentities. The only thing that stands out to me was the view that we had. We were able to see the Bellagio fountain show throughout our stay. Other than the gorgeous view, the room was pretty dated...

Suite: Not exactly sure what the suite was called, but I went inside after making some new friends at one of the clubs. The room was your basic suite with two bedrooms, kitchen, dining table, but the thing that really stood out was they had 8 bathrooms! Why must a suite need 8 bathrooms? I honestly don't have the answer to that, but I guess it can be fun going to a different bathroom throughout your stay..? Overall, thought the suite wasn't as nice as some of the other suites that I've stayed at on The Strip. It's the perfect room for a group of girls though since we all know how much girls need their space to do make-up and all that! 

Overall, Paris is a nice hotel, but it's not the best.",3,0,1

My wife and I have stayed at several different hotels in Vegas from Excalibur to Caesars so I have come to understand that you get what your pay for (e.g., the more expensive the room, the better the service and quality). 

Paris broke that rule. From the reception to the buffets, I have to say the service in this place is ridiculously sub par. Unless, as a coworker pointed out, they were going for the authentic French treatment of Americans, in which case they were spot on. 

The room was plain with a horrible view. Something I would expect from Bally's or another generic resort, but for Paris (and the price) I was very disappointed. We were on a nonsmoking floor, but could still get occasional wafts of smoke in the room. Not sure if from a floor below, but seemed strange.

We arrived late on a Friday and our room preferences were not available anymore. The room we got (smoking and queen beds, total opposite of what we asked for) was so old and gross, I couldn't believe how crappy it was. The carpet was badly worn and there were rust stains like they moved a rusty piece of furniture and of course it reeked of smoke. We were told that we would be getting an upgrade the next day so we dealt with it. The next day the lady gave me a hard time about honoring the upgrade but with a little persistence and remembering the guy who promised us the night before's name, we were moved from the 4th floor to the 30th, that room was a million times nicer so that's why I gave them 3 stars instead of 2. The weekend rates were very high, weekday rates were very good except you have to add on the rip-off resort fee every day which is to use the gym? and have wifi for one device, dumb.

The casino is pretty and the smoke isn't too bad there compared to others but I could not afford the table games there. I had no luck on the slots there and did not like their machines much. I gambled at other casinos instead.

The layout was confusing for us, we got lost several times trying to find the player's club and looking for quick serve places to eat, we ended up at Bally's somehow.

The pool was ok. It was pretty but not enough shade, one side was too much shade and the rest was extremely sunny. I heard it was $15 for a drink, so I did not even try to order anything there. You can't bring your own food or drinks as far as I understood, even water supposedly.

Le Cafe was a great place for the prix fixe chicken lunch. Best meal during our trip was here. It's in the middle of the casino under the fake clouds. 

We went up to the Eiffel Tower at night, it was amazing. I mentioned we were hotel guests and our tickets went way down in price, it was awesome. 

Mon Ami Gabi was just ok. The steak was tough and disappointing. I'd like to go sometime for breakfast and eat outside. Would not go back for lunch.

The quick breakfast place we tried was only fair. Our breakfast sandwiches were cold and the eggs tasted fake. Orange juice was like $5 and so was water.

Le Village Buffet used to be our favorite breakfast buffet but this time it was underwhelming.

I doubt I would ever stay here again. So I guess we won't always have Paris.",2,1,0

Overall, we thought the hotel had an unbeatable location, good value for the room size and quality and some of the better in hotel conveniences on the strip.  The only things we didn't like were the noise level and the high minimum bets at the casino tables but we find that to be the case at almost all the on-strip casinos.  

Room: We were upgraded free of charge to a Red room corner suite.  Red rooms are the ones featured in the photos in the lobby area with the plush red leather headboards.  Our room happened to be a corner suite with windows in two directions, including one that allowed us to see the Bellagio fountain show from the comfort of our in-room seating area.  The large marble bathroom also had a nice jacuzzi tub which we took full advantage of.  I did notice that somehow the air in the room was extremely dry and my skin was always itchy from cracking.  Not sure whether to blame the air or the bathroom products for that one but if you stay here, be sure to bring your thickest lotions and chapsticks.  I sure wish I had.  

Food:  Paris is one of the hotels that offers the buffet of buffets.  We optioned for a package that included this buffet pass for only 12 dollars extra, a huge steal if you think about it.   I found that the buffet pass helped me to eat healthier because I had access to unlimited fresh fruits and veggies at every meal.  Whenever I'm in Vegas, I find myself more drawn to fresh produce than to the meat and seafood they have so much in abundance.  Maybe its the dessert climate.  

Casino: Does it scare anyone else to put down 15 dollar minimum bets?  I'm more used to like 5 or 10.  However, the rules and odds for blackjack at least seem more favorable than at lower limit tables and seemed to make up for the high minimum.  My husband did ok here.

Noise: That Napoleon's Dueling Piano Bar and the live music stage in the middle of the casino has got to go.  It is tacky and loud and extremely annoying to come back to after a long walk on the strip.",1,1,1

En tant que bonne parisienne qui se respecte, je peux décemment pas dire que cet hôtel est représentatif de la capitale. Pourtant c'est dommage ça partait bien...

L'extérieur est très bien fait je trouve. On a une jolie Tour Eiffel, et surtout un Arc de Triomphe superbement reproduit. L'opéra Garnier, lui, est moyennement similaire a notre magnifique édifice mais bon, je trouvais que de l'extérieur, c'était assez beau. Ça laisse présager le meilleur.

Et en fait, non pas du tout. On est trop dans le cliché et la caricature, et si j'ai bien retrouve l'esprit de Venise au Venetian, je n'ai absolument pas retrouve le charme parisien au Paris. J'ai trouvé ça tout much, trop coloré, trop tout en fait.

Although the staff was as friendly and as courteous as ever, I did not appreciate being charged an early arrival fee (especially since I had paid a premium fee for my second night -- apparently there was a convention booked.) I had two meals at Ile St Louis, the sidewalk cafe-style restaurant, and was disappointed with both.  Though the duck was advertized on the menu as being accompanied by ""rosemary polenta"", rather a treat, at least to me, it arrived with mashed potatoes and a half-assed apology from the waiter.  Undaunted, the next morning I ordered the Eggs Benedict, but they were unbelievably salty, almost inedible.  (On my third morning I walked up to the Venetian for breakfast.)  I am also irritated that the ""smoking rooms"" are all on the fourth floor, with no possible chance of a view of anything.  Smokers are NOT second class citizens and should NOT be treated as such!  If things have not improved, after my next visit I will find a different hotel in which to stay.

We booked our trip through travelocity, and originally it was for 8 days @Mandalay. After 3 days at Mandalay, we called travelocity because we were miserable (see that seperate, long, review), and (travelocity has a ""happiness guarantee""  for the trips they book for you), and we begged to be released from Mandalay hell. After explaining to them that we were not happy due to their poor customer service, lack of housekeeping, etc, they agreed to re-home us at the Paris. We were SO happy!!! We re-packed our things, ran down to Burger Bar (the best thing in Mandalay) grabbed our take out order and jumped in a cab and we were OFF! Paris was wonderful. Pretty, romantic, GREAT customer service. Concierge was always polite and very helpful. Housekeeping was on it. There were soft, clean towels there everyday, beds made, glasses replenished. The AC was COLD!! Great restaurants as well- Mon Ami Gabi (see review), Le Creperie, Le Boulangerie, etc. We had an amazing strip view. We could see the pool, eiffel tower, and Bellagio fountain show from our room on the 9th floor. The room was decorated like a Parisian bed and breakfast. Very quaint and cozy. We did not have a jacuzzi in our room, but the regular tub and the standing shower sufficed. Would Def stay here again. The pool area was AWESOME! The pool is HUGE. There is never anyone on top of you, and there really werent many little kids there which was right up my alley. You can go to the pool at ANYTIME from 8am-8pm (if people are in the pool past 6, they dont kick you out till 8)... You can get a chair at the pool ANYTIME as well. They are also 2 outdoor jacuzzis, and lockers for rent for $5 should you need them. You can have as many towels as you want for the pool. They dont need to see your room key everytime, and the are not militant with the blowing whistles or stingy with towels like other hotels. (In retrospect, I probably couldve gotten my friends in to use the pool, but they were too busy gambling. Lol.) It had a very laid back feel to it. They served drinks to you IN THE POOL, and you could pay there or charge them to the room. Great souvenir cups\/sports bottles as well. They also have a cafe by the pool for breakfast\/lunch, or you can get a menu and have the food\/drinks delivered to your chair. Paris is located RIGHT on the strip. You can walk to a few nearby hotels such as Planet Hollywood, the Miracle Mile shops, and the Bellagio. The monorail stop is in Ballys and you can walk through Ballys right into Paris. Along the way, you will see some live music in Ballys, as well as the dueling pianos at Napoleans. Its free to get in, but get there early for a seat as well. Nice but not as crazy fun as pianos at Harrahs. Well worth the trip over there. Boulangerie had great French bread, sandwiches, and gelato. (coffee gelato was the BEST!) The Paris buffet was not good at all. Went there last year and waited way too long and paid waay too much and there wasnt anything good in there to eat. Skip that and go across the way to Le Creperie. Get an awesome crepe for $8 and it will fill you.Loved that place.",2,0,1

Not only was there cups around the pool but also inside the pool as well at used bandaids, napkins, plastic wrappers and so much hair it stayed wrapped around my ankles. Disgusting!!! 3. The chairs were strait out of Motel 6, plastic, white and blue stripped that probably hadn't been cleaned in years dirty and sticky on all the sides. The Paris Hotel should be ashamed of themselves!!

The porter asked if I had a room number yet and I said no, they haven't emailed me back. Mind you, I am a well educated Asian woman. The porter, when explaining to me the check in procedures, SPELLED his answers out to me as if I was illiterate. W-I-L-L WILL, THEY WILL CALL YOU WHEN THEY ARE AVAILABLE! We did online check in from the website with the hope to get in early: they clearly have the options to check in as early as  7:00 a.m. so we willingly paid $20 to get in at 9:30a.m. When we arrived the front desk lady told us they never have any room ready by 10 a.m. so I should ""try my luck later"". So asking if we want to check in as early as 7 or 8 is just false advertisement.

We booked the ""Red Room Luxury"" in October, but when we came to check in around 2pm the lady informed us that they ""didn't have any of those rooms available""....okay awesome, once again reminded of that Seinfeld episode where anyone can TAKE a reservation, but apparently nobody can HOLD the reservation. Seriously, we booked in October!!

My husband informed her that we would then be expecting an upgraded room since it wasn't our fault that they overbooked their rooms. She went back and forth with a manager for about 15 minutes and left us standing there to listen to the one after another person in the check out lines next to us being offered the opportunity to ""upgrade"" for a nominal fee, so we knew they must have plenty of places to upgrade us to. 

Finally she came back and said we had been upgraded to a room with a view. We asked her, point blank, ""but it's still a red room right? Because we want a red room for Valentine's Day, the view is of no importance to us."" She told us that it was absolutely a red room. Great. We were told to come back after 4pm to get our keys, so we checked our luggage and went off to do a few hours of exploring.

Fast forward to 4:00, we pick up our keys, go to the room, open it up and the room is....PURPLE AND GREEN. Not a trace of red in the whole thing. We were annoyed beyond control, but we DID control ourselves enough to dial down to the front desk and inform them that they had not given us the correct room. The lady on the phone was extremely rude and argumentative on the phone. She told us it was a red room....wow, that's weird since there was no red in it. She also told us that they were sold out and had nowhere else to put us. My husband was about ready to give up at that point, but that just wasn't going to happen.

We went back down to the front desk and talked to Antonio. He immediately rectified the situation, told us he knew exactly what happened (apparently that room is marked as a red room in the computer even though it isn't red) and he said he could easily move us to the exact room we booked with no problem. He was extremely friendly and helpful and 10 minutes later we were in the exact room we had booked in October. Now I ask you, if it was THAT easy, than why the F did they put us through all of that? Lie to our faces? Argue with us? Seriously? Are you kidding me?! We called a manager to thank him for Antonio's help because everyone else there were total A-holes living up to that whole French attitude even though they were all mostly Hispanic. 

Once we were in the actual room we paid for in October we were mostly pacified, but still irritated at the entire situation. The room was fine, but it wasn't great. There was definitely wear around the edges and you could tell it needs an update.

The casino is neat in there with the sky and everything and we enjoyed eating at Le Cafe (separate review). While I would consider eating there again or visiting the casino again, I will NEVER stay here again, the service was crap except Antonio...he is the only reason they get a 2 star instead of 1.

I am not a gambling man so the highlight of my LV trip usually revolves around the shows and the food.  I wouldn't compare Paris to the Cosmo or Aria because the rooms are about half the price.  I am giving Paris 5 stars because of the following reasons:

1. Food - I love Gordon Ramsay Steak because of the quality of the steak and cocktails.  I also love all the little cafes and the crepes.  

2. Staff - All of the staff I interacted with was knowledgable, professional, and courteous.  The receptionist (Fa) made excellent show recommendations and even helped arrange dinner reservations.  The luggage attendant was very courteous.   The pool cocktail waitress (Autumn) was very personable, took time to get to know us, and made excellent drink recommendations.

3. Ambiance - The Eiffel Tower and French Colonial Architecture does add an extra dose of romance to your stay.  The casino floor and shops are arranged like a French village.  We chose the room with a single king-sized bed and our room was not outdated.  The bathroom had travertine tile throughout, a bathtub, and separate shower.    The room had a vintage French couch, a refrigerator, a flat screen TV (although we only used it to checkout), and a coffee table.

To get it you need to either pay a $30 plus per day 'Resort fee' (that admittedly also gets you access to the Spa as well as the also-should-be-free gym) or pay a ridiculous WiFi only access fee.  Did I mention that said fees also only let you use two devices?  Yeah, there's that.  If you and your spouse have smartphones you better have a different plan for your laptop.  This is a particularly crude effort to gouge a few more bucks out of the guests especially in light of the way you are constantly accosted by the half naked women desperately trying to give you free booze every time you cross the casino floor.  

 'No free WiFi' is a deal breaker for me and for that reason I won't be returning for that reason.  However, in the interest of a complete review I'll continue with some further details.  Perhaps the best feature of the Paris is the décor - as you can imagine it goes much further than having a giant copy of the Eifel Tower out front.  The entire hotel is done in an opulent French style complete with copies of many famous paintings, and it's done well.  There is an 'avenue' of indoor shops that are set up like a Parisian street.  While the shops themselves are typical Vegas-Tourist setups, the visual effect is pleasing.

The room we were given was an upgrade - apparently the room we reserved wasn't available when we arrived and we got lucky - and we ended up in a semi-suite that was about two and a half to three times the size of a normal room with two separate full baths and a living room\/parlor.  The view was terrible (we were looking at rooftops and the back side of another hotel) but we weren't there for the view and I imagine if that was important to you, you could likely request a room that had a better view.  I read other reviews here that mentioned peeling wallpaper and holes in the walls; I did notice some insignificant peeling in one of the bathrooms (likely due to the presence of the shower) and I saw one hole in a wall in an outer hallway, but overall the hotel seemed to be very clean and maintained.  We did have an initial problem with the television in our room but the staff responded quickly to our report and fixed it right away.

As a final note, the check in\/check out process was atrocious.  There was a HUGE desk for check ins but I never saw more than a third of the windows staffed - even when the lines were literally wrapped back and forth and actually OUT of the reception area into a nearby hallway.  The concierge desk was great for what it's intended for, but don't expect the staff there to be able to answer any questions about the hotel itself; they couldn't even tell me when check out time was or how to get a de-magnetized room key reset.  It turns out (as reported to me by an apparently disgruntled front desk employee?) that the Paris replaced all of its in house concierge staff with a third party crew, and if so that would explain perfectly their otherwise inexplicable inability to talk about the hotel they actually worked in.

So, then, for me:  I've experienced better, and I am unlikely to go back.  If you don't care about waiting forever to check in or out, and you don't care about being gouged for basic services, then the Paris might be for you.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.",1,0,0

I explained to the manager what happened, letting him know there was something sticking out from the area where the two seat  cushions came together.  He advised that he would contact the carpenters to take a look at the booth. I could not show home as the booth was occupied at the time.  The manager asked if I needed medical attention and at the time I said no (it did not seem that bad it the time).   I mentioned this to someone within our party that I've had lunch with us and she also called her late getting out of the booth. 

Today we ate at the same restaurant and noticed that no one had come to fix the booth.  At this time the booth was an occupied so we took a close look, there is a spring\/wire sticking out.

 Totally shocked that the manager didn't seem to do anything to secure the safety of future  patrons of the restaurant from the booth.  I was going to mention it to the manager again as it was the same manager on duty today as was the day before, but he was currently in discussions with the lady who didn't seem very happy and I needed to catch a flight. 

A friend that was in our party mentioned an incident like this had occurred to another friend of hers and that friend had to be tested for AIDS and other blood born  diseases a year.
Had I known this I would have gone to the hotel front desk and pointed out the incident and the lack of any precautions taken by the restaurant management.

I had a fantastic room-- upper floor with views of the Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel Tower. Nice clean room, huge bathroom. Room service was quick, with an extensive menu, but the food was only fair. 
Beware the lines for food at the Paris-- they are huge! It is nearly impossible to get into the buffet, one of the best on the strip. I ate breakfast here-- there are endless choices, and the dining setup is really nice. 

Cocktail service was good-- got lots of drinks while playing nickle slots, surprising given this is the Strip.

The Front Desk Clerk told us that even though our room was ready we would have to pay $25 to get in before 4PM. Although....if we paid $40 to upgrade our room they would waive the Early Check In fee.  Wink wink.  We had to schlep our bags all the way outside, down the walk by the Taxi Stand to have the Bell Desk check them. THEN at 4PM we had to wait in the key pick up line, wait 30 minutes in our room for the Bellhop to bring our bags...and to add insult to injury, had to TIP the bellhop for bringing our bags. What a scam.

Of course there is the nightly Resort Fee of $20 added on top of the nightly room rate. The Resort Fee is supposed to get you free wifi, BUT only for one device. Really? My husband and I had to choose whether his phone, my phone, his work laptop or my work laptop could get on the internet each day. Forget our iPad. If we had wanted to get all 5 of our devices on the internet, it would have cost an extra $60 each day.  We finally had to cough up an extra $15 so we could both get some work done on the 3rd day.

I'm not sure what room I stayed in, but the bathroom was large, plenty of counter space to get ready and mirrors everywhere which is always a plus.  There was a king size bed, along with a decent size sitting area.

Not to be a bitch, but I noticed someone mentioned how the hotel has old TVs....  um, WHY ARE YOU WATCHING TV WHEN YOU'RE IN VEGAS?  Who chills in their room in Vegas, no one!!!  If you're looking to chill, Vegas might not be the destination of choice. 

Another thing you can't shake is the LOCATION, so central and overlooks the Bellagio, which I think is better than actually staying in the Bellagio as you can see the building and fountains from afar.  

The pool and hot tubs - I think this might be a secret but I was a huge fan.  It's not as big of a scene (there wasn't a bar) but I mean that didn't prevent me from BYOB.

I'm not a gambler, the the casino part doesn't really interest me.  This might be because I wasn't as tossed, but I feel Paris doesn't have the stigmatism and other hotels in Vegas has (such as Bellagio or Flamingo) which I dig,

Plusses:
Good midtown location;

Very reasonable rate;

(for the price) an overall pretty nice looking hotel.  It (the casino and outside) have held up well style-wise in comparison to the newer buildings that have come up in the last 12-13 years Paris has been around.  It's not cheesy like NY\/NY or Excalabur, and not 80s-looking like Monte Carlo, Mirage and TI;

No resort fee;


Meah:
Not a bad bed but not great, either.  Better than Trump and definitely better than Monte Carlo (avoid MC for that reason alone!) but not as good as PH Westgate (which is frequently one of the best overall deals on the strip);


Minuses:
While the outside and casino have held up over time, the rooms not as much.  They're not bad, (better than Excalabur and MC) but definitely a bit dated.  The shower is lame.

Pricey Internet access (but there's no resort fee, so they're gonna get you one way or another).  Their Internet fee is higher than what most places charge for the resort fee",0,0,0

It is right on the strip, so if you want to go up and down the strip to enjoy Vegas, then this is a good place to stay. The ""Little France"" thing going on is pretty cool (especially when you're taking someone special around, but it's Vegas. You shouldn't. =P ), and the overhead clear skies ceiling is great to look at when you're intoxicated. The casino floor is very clean and the shops serve their primary purpose. The swimming pool, however is almost always crowded. Not that I have a problem with that, but waiting around to get in the pool almost gave me a Wesley Snipes tan. No joke.

NOTE: A problem I have with certain hotels all over the states is that they do not provide free wireless internet. They charge you a ridiculous fee per day to use it (something in excess of 10 dollars). Luckily some casinos in Vegas have it, this one (when I went last summer) sadly did not.",0,0,0

The front desk clerk who checked us in was very nice, made sure when we switched rooms we would have a renovated one, and good thing. The suite was filthy. The chair looked like many greasy haired people had rubbed all over it, the marble table had multiple - I mean ALL OVER - drink ring marks, and some sticky substances on it, the bidet (yes, there was a bidet in the suite) had an old cup lid behind it, and the TV was small and all the way across the room, so watching in bed was impossible. 
After re-packing, going back downstairs, waiting in line, and a mix up at the front desk (the surly front desk staff couldn't find the name under which the room was reserved, even though we had checked in already), we got back up to the renovated room (after wasting a good 45 minutes of our day), on the back side of the hotel. A 50\/50 view: lots of parking lot but also some beautiful mountains (and I can only imagine much quieter than a front of hotel room). 
The pool is less than relaxing with a very loud DJ playing 80's\/early 90s' ""mash-ups"" (if that's what you can call them) and I saw a little kid puke on the steps while his drunk mom tried to catch it in her margarita cup. Classy.
The hotel\/casino area is always crowded and noisy. Maybe that's just Vegas, but they bill this place as ""Everything Is Sexier In Paris."" Guess that doesn't include the oldies in sweat pants and fanny packs. The signs all have ""Le"" in them. ""Le Car Rental?"" Give me a break. Didn't see any of the aforementioned mimes, though, thank God.
Upon checking out, the much surlier front desk staff said we were being charged $700 bucks to the credit card on file. We pre-paid through an online booking service. Um, excuse me? She disappeared to the back for about five minutes, came back out, didn't say word one to us, then handed us the bill for $15\/day of internet service (biggest rip-off in Vegas, and that's saying a LOT), and continued to look down, typing away. After we had stood there for a minute, she finally said ""oh, you're all set."" and that was that. No: ""sorry for the mix up,"" no ""thank you for staying here,"" no ""come again soon!"" I've gotten better service at Howard Johnsons in middle o' nowhere Illinois, and didn't pay nearly as much for it.
The two stars are for the renovated room and the nice front desk guy at the beginning of our visit. The location is premium for the strip, but so is the location at Ballys, Bills, and Planet Hollywood, none of which I stayed at but all had nicer casinos.

Edited to add: oh, yeah, no one ever checked room keys in this place, and the area outside the elevators was one of the busiest in the whole hotel\/casino.",2,2,2

The beverage servers and casino staff were very polite and engaging. I haven't been to a better customer service venue such as this.

The downside is the over serving of obnoxious drunks who become rude and boisterous as though common courtesy doesn't pertain to them. Forget signing up for the player's cards because the points you supposedly accrue are not worth it. It is one of the stingiest experiences we've had.

Fairly recently it looks as though Vegas in general has opted to withdraw the welcome mat for families. The sidewalks are filled with college age or a bit older youths who come to booze it up and score some drugs. Peddlers were handing out cards for strip clubs which is fairly tacky if you're walking along with your wife and\/or kids.

Location on the strip is the reason to stay here and if the price is right I'll definitely be back.

I checked in to my room before I even left my house. The Paris offers online check in and will send an email when your room is ready. You can let them know what time you'll be in and they'll let you into your room early if it's ready. Early entry is not always guaranteed.  You just need to stop by the front desk and pick up your key.  It was the fastest check in I've ever experienced and it's the best thing about staying here.
The actual room is not impressive. It's basic and verges on old. There's a giant armoire in the middle of the room and a TV to the far left. If you have a room with two queen beds then one of you isn't going to see the TV which is weird and crazy.  Upgrade to the red rooms.

My family and I stayed in this hotel for the first night of our vacation and then switched to Mandalay Bay for the remainder of our trip. So, when I realized I had forgotten my items in the hotel room, I was still in the area and returned for them the night after we'd checked out. When I first came back to retrieve my items, I thought it would be no problem. It hadn't even been 24 hours since I'd checked out of the hotel room. First, I was sent to the lost and found. They told me that no items had been found in our hotel room and that they couldn't thoroughly search the room until the guests who were currently checked into that room had checked out. This made no sense to me considering that I knew for a fact that one of the items I had lost, a bracelet, had been left on the bathroom counter and the other item had been left on the bed. So I didn't understand why they hadn't been picked up when they cleaned the room between guests. We continued asking around the hotel for more advice on how I could get my items before I left town for home and trying to figure out HOW it was possible that they cleaned the room and none of my items were small (they weren't particularly small and should've been very easy to see.) We went to the concierge desk, they sent us back to lost and found, lost and found sent us to security, security sent us to the concierge desk. Finally, we asked to speak to a manager. I was hysterical at this point. Bawling my eyes out in the middle of the hotel lobby. 
We explained the situation to the manager. I'm standing there hysterical all the while. He was completely unsympathetic and seemed annoyed to be dealing with the situation. We wanted to know how it was possible that my items weren't found. The only explanation that seemed logical was that the cleaning service had taken or thrown away my things. After speaking to what felt like half of the hotel staff, none of whom seemed to care at all about the situation, I was exhausted and resigned to leaving my name and number so that, when the guests who were then checked in to our old room had checked out and the hotel staff ""thoroughly searched"" the hotel room (supposedly,) the hotel could contact me to tell me if they found my things or not. At this point, I basically already knew that my items were gone. It seems like this might be a regular occurrence at this hotel. 
This is not the first time I've left a valuable item in a hotel room by mistake. However, this is the first time that I've had any difficulty getting them back. I lost something at a hotel in Hawaii once and the hotel contacted us and shipped it back to me free of charge. Any business that cared about their customers at all would have done the same. It's been three months since my stay at the Paris hotel and every time I think about it, I still get so upset. I can't believe the way I was treated and the way that my things were treated. By far, the worst hotel experience of my life.

The WiFi was horrible too. The Paris is a horrible, horrible place. Do not stay here. And if you do, make sure you don't let any of your valuables out of your sight.",0,0,0

I visit Vegas about 3 times a year and this is my favorite out of the Caesars properties.
The rooms are clean and some I have stayed in have been really luxurious  some obviously need to be updated but for me the room is just place to crash between gambling and eating at all the great restaurants. I love how easy it is to navigate from the rooms to the casino and the layout is easy to pick up pretty quick. Try navigating the Venetian...I think my cousin is still lost in one of the hallways there!
The restaurants here are great. Mon ami gabi. sugar factory are great for breakfast, gorden Ramsey Steak, and the Eiffel Tower are awesome for dinner. The pizza place in hallway is great for late night snack.
My daughter had her wedding here and it was fabulous. (Don't go to the hair salon but that's a different review)
Location on strip is great for me because I play at all the Caesars properties and they are all right there next door to Paris. You should book a room here and put up your clothes and go out and experience the city of sin and not worry about how old the tv is in your room!!",6,3,1

The theme of the hotel was a lot of fun and the location was good. I had a lot of fun at the hotel and would definitely stay here again.

Keep in mind that if you get  strip view room you'll have a great view of the Eiffel Tower, but you won't be able to see the Bellagio fountains very well because of it. 

You will walk A LOT if you go here as it doesn't have convenient access to the monorail (it's a long a$$ walk next door in Bally's) and everything seems like a 20 min walk. I definitely don't recommend it if you are going to a conference at the convention center. 

TIP: DO NOT get the meal plan when you make your reservation - the food sucks and is not convenient - HUGE crowds and college cafeteria taste is sure to disappoint everyone. There's no refunds 72 hours in advance either, so once you discover you don't want it you are SOL. 

I went in the winter so I didn't use the pool, but it was small and simple by Vegas standards. I also thought the casino was below average, but I'm not a gambler so I'm just basing this on appearance compared to those at Mandalay Bay, MGM, Luxor, Venetian, Bellagio, etc...",1,0,1

5 stars - Location. If you have a concert a Planet Hollywood, you could easily walk. If you have dinner or a show at Caesar's or the Bellagio, you could also walk. Go around the corner to CVS for bottled water and $5 yogurt if you want to save on yogurt and water at the hotel. 

4 stars - Renovated burgundy room is lovely. The lighting is just OK. Bathroom is a little dark for makeup application. The room lets in light in the morning so bring your night mask. Also, bring your ear plugs. On the 23rd floor facing the Bellagio, I could still hear the music blaring until 2AM and beyond. The Bellagio fountains make a startling ""boom"" each time they spout. You'll hear it! You DO get a coffee maker and a fridge in the burgundy room. You DO get a safe, an alarm, and a luggage rack. You do NOT get a robe, bottled water, or snacks. 

1 star - The pool area was as bad - if not worse - than described in other posts. I witnessed leather-skinned, 60+ year old women busting out of their bikinis who were puffing away on their cigarettes along the edges of the pool. The men here have nothing on the women. The greased back toupees on the frail frames were even more noticeable when wearing socks with black work shoes. And please, who smokes a cigar poolside? That's just rude. This was like an SNL skit. A thin, oily film coated the top of the cloudy water and people shuffled back and forth from the broken, wobbly beach chairs to the smelly, dated pool. Guests were classless and did not bother to move their beach towels to the bins once they were done using them. If you want a nice pool, DO NOT STAY HERE. 

4 stars - Service is quite good. My room was cleaned on time, as expected. From check in, to the concierge, to business services... everyone was friendly and knowledgeable. I'm dropping one star for the awkward reservation process. Once I reserved a room, I went through a strange series of phone transfers with people who were trying to upsell me on getting a tour of the property for a future hotel credit. It was bizarre.

3 stars - The salon is worth mentioning. The salon felt a little dated. The salon could have been located in Tuna Fish, Idaho. I can't remember a single detail that made it feel french. There was nothing posh about the salon. I went for makeup and a blow-out. While Cindy was a nice person, I felt like the salon could have been much more spectacular. She had a great selection of makeup and hair products, but the general feel of the salon was just.... basic. Though she did a great job on my hair and makeup, I left feeling like I had spent a lot of money of an experience that wasn't that special. 5 stars for Cindy and 3 stars for the salon itself. 

Tip: For those of you who use ""Rent the Runway"", you can return your rented items via UPS at the hotel business center located between Ballys and Paris.

I've stayed here in Las Vegas before in many different hotels and this is by far the WORST one. I mean I am talking about absolutely horrible service. The staff here is extremely rude with no customer service skills. I had called down stairs at 2 am to have a remote control delivered up to my room because it was missing one. The housekeeping staff failed to deliver one, instead, they decided to barge into my room at 6:00 AM TO GIVE ME MY REMOTE. WHAT THE ****! My mother & her friend were also staying here on the same floor a door down. Housekeeping had managed to clean my room but had not cleaned my mothers room for a full day. When my mother called down stairs for some service the housekeeping maids arrived at their room with complete attitude asking what they wanted done. FOR STARTERS... THE WHOLE ROOM WHAT ELSE?! Ridiculous! 
IT GETS WORSE! 
ONE hour later.. five security guards come knocking at my mothers friends room and demand her to leave instantly, because the maid reported that she had thrown something at her. CRAZY!!! After completely badgering my mothers friend.. She packed up her belongings and was forced to leave at 1 am in the morning. She was banned from the hotel. She was not even allowed to explain to the security department that NOTHING like that happened and the maid was probably only pissed off because they had complained to the house keeping department. My mother and her friend then left and stayed at a different hotel for the night. Worst hotel, horrible service, and rude employees. NEVER STAY HERE EVER.",0,0,0

I got a little lost trying to find my way inside the hotel. It's modeled to look like a string of shops along a street with the casino tables all around the windy roads. Nonetheless Paris is right on the strip and the 3 foot margarita that I picked up did me well :). The check in staff is great. My room key got demagnitized at 3am and the woman helping me just laughed and made sure my next one worked. She even sent someone up with me to make sure my door opened. In a place where drunk people wander and make pointless conversations with the staff I was VERY grateful to have her even want to help me out! 

I really loved the room. It's one of those rooms that I would be content with spending my whole trip in being romantic with the BF.

Came here to celebrate our 20 year anniversary and our whole stay is completely ruined because of this hotel and their terrible customer service! After checking on on the first night here my wife found several (5-6) prominent BLOOD STAINS on the sheet. Blood was not faded, clearly the sheets were never changed. HUGE HEALTH CODE VIOLATION AND LIABILITY, and not to mention completely gross! Naturally my wife was very distressed and concerned for her health, it's unfathomable that any place would have something like this happen, let alone a hotel like this. Normally would have moved out to a different hotel immediately, but it was the middle of the night and I had a business conference at the same hotel the following day so switching hotels would have been a huge inconvenience, figured I'd let their customer service take over and fix this, Huge mistake!

Alerted the front desk of the situation around 1am. Took at least half an hour for someone to actually respond and come into the room. Manager (Janise) was rightfully appalled and very apologetic, but couldn't locate anyone to actually come and change the sheets so it took 2.5 hours to get clean sheets! When asked to change rooms she said they couldn't do anything. Since it ended up taking until 4am to change the sheets (we didn't get to bed until 4:30am!) they eventually agreed to compensate us for one night, but couldn't move us to a different room.

In the morning asked again to change rooms and was told nothing can be done. Spent a while bouncing back and forth between front desk people. Then when talked to different manager (Faviola Flores) in the afternoon about what more can be done, she was very dismissive, not really apologetic, and didn't feel like the hotel had any responsibility to do anything else outside of filing a risk report. The only genuinely kind and empathetic person was the security guy who took the report (Michael), everyone else just kept brushing us off and acting like it wasn't a big deal. My wife was visibly distressed so eventually after Michael went and talked with the manager (Faviola) she begrudgingly agreed to move us into a different room but refused to do anything else until she got the results of the risk report (which will be completed in 3-5 days after we will no longer be there). She never fully acknowledged how serious this situation was or explained why it happened and what was being done to fix it, just dismissed us to write a report and said she can't comment on anything that happened the night before since she wasn't the one there. When asked to speak with someone else regarding customer service, she said there was no one else superior that we could talk to and she was the one in charge of customer service.

You would think after a HUGE mess up like this a hotel would be bending over backwards trying to do damage control and convince us that they can do better. Instead almost everyone acted like it wasn't a big deal, we got shuffled through the bare minimum protocol, got barely an apology, rude customer service, and were made to feel like, in the end, they were doing us a favor by changing the sheets and moving us to a different room. Unbelievable.

This was our first time staying at Paris but not our first visit to their casino. In the past we always loved the casino. Its so nice here. So this time we decided to actually stay in a room here. It was beautiful. The room was very nice and clean. The bed was very comfortable. I love that you have a seperate shower from the tub. But the water pressure sucks. The view was amazing. I have read in other reviews that there is a noise problem at the pool. We were right above the pool and never heard a thing after it closed, about 7-8pm I think. Maybe people were hearing the music for the fountains across the street. But that only lasts a few minutes at a time.
Great places to eat like Mon Ami Gabi. Great eggs benedict unless your gluten free, then try something else. Hexx has amazing steak and eggs for breakfast, I would say the best I ever had. The buffet was a pretty cool set up and the food was pretty good. 
The bar , Gustav's, is slow and weak drinks and expensive. I would avoid it. But if you like those frozen drinks you need to get one from the place out in front of the casino. I think its called Arc, but not certain. They make them strong and if you take your cup back you can get it refilled cheaper.

The location of the hotel is very centric. It'll only take you about 20-30 minutes to walk down to the Mandalay or up to the Palazzo. The hotel seamlessly connects to the Bally which has a walkway to the Bellagio an Caesars.

The exterior is very impressive, the Eiffel tower, the blue balloon and the arch lend it a somewhat surreal look. The theme is continued inside with three of the tower's legs coming into the casino, a fountain, faux cobblestone paths, and a bridge with red street lights that less to the elevator to go up the tower completing the scene.

There are plenty of amenities: several bars throughout the lobby and casino floors and several restaurants and shops, many on the walkway that leads to Bally.

Check in was quick and easy, the $39 daily resort fee threw us for a loop, but there was nothing to be done about that, so we put that behind us.

We originally had asked for a room with an Eiffel tower view, but after they mentioned that it can get noisy site to its proximity to the street we outed for another room, this one was right behind the arch, which still provided a decent view.

The room was pretty standard: a spacious bathroom with a small tub and small shower, a spacious room with with two queen beds, an armoire with a mini fridge, and coffee maker. I don't know how long the hotel has been operating but I'd say the rooms are starting to show their age. Still, it is all kept very clean.

But the main reason for the rating of 1 star.....I have to agree with the other reviewer that commented on the air quality.  Ever time I walked into this resort, I feel like somebody kicked me in the stomach.  The stench of the air was disgusting.  If you look at the painted ceiling in the casino, you might see pollution.  If they were to give air quality ratings to casinos similar to cities, they should tell you to wear a mask and drag and air tank with you into this joint.

No, not its namesake ...not Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron dancing along the Seine ...not Audrey Hepburn doing a fashion shoot for Fred Astaire. I think of - get this - ""Xanadu"", that circa-1980 roller disco place that coincidentally a much older Gene Kelly opened so that Olivia Newton-John could wear glitter spandex and sing with her armpits exposed. Yes, it has that same excessive, Disneyesque silliness but without the roller skaters with the fluorescent headbands. Instead, we have a condensed, miniaturized recreation of Paris' landmarks. 

But the irony is that it's a pretty nice hotel if you can get past the expansive casino with the waitresses in their push-up bras and mini-tuxedos. The discounted $100 per night room Jamie W. and I had was clean and showed surprisingly little wear for ten years. The elevators, however, show signs of a few too many revelers' enthusiastic head-banging antics. Note the chipped mirrors at eye-level. But you can still stroll under the faux-blue skies of the faux-boulevards where faux-Parisian bistros, creperies and patisseries. 

The other thing to consider about Paris Las Vegas is its central location along the Strip - just across from those dancing fountains in front of the Bellagio, down the block from all those useless Miracle Mile shops in the Planet Hollywood hotel, and prominent enough to have its own monorail stop.

The Eiffel Tower inside of the hotel is pretty neat.  The fact that it looks like day time ALL of the time makes you want to gamble & drink at all hours of the night, morning, whatever.

We went to the gym and didn't know we needed picture ID and your room key. We just brought our room key. So we went back to our room to get the ID. 
When you pick up your car you pay there and wait about 22 minutes (10am on a Monday) they then inform you that you can have only one in and out or your charged twice. No one at the hotel showed us and customer service. At check in we got there before 4pm and were told our room is ready but there is a $22 fee for early check in. So we went to the bell desk and left our 1 bag. Until we were able to check in. We return at 8pm and they was no one to assist with key pick up so we had to wait in the check in line twice.

Within 20 mins of coming into the hotel, I was regretting my choice in hotels. At the check-in counter, everything was an up-sell. The person helping us out was not even the least bit welcoming. They already lost two stars in those first 20mins. 

We made our way to our room. Now in the past, I'd stayed with friends in the luxury rooms with queen beds and that room easily rated a 4\/5. As soon as I entered our luxury room with a king bed, the dated interior looked worse than something I'd unfortunately had to put up with in the past as a student on a budget living in motels! Two more stars deducted...

And yes I would give them zero stars if I could. 

I would not recommend. If they halved the room rates, then yes, it may be worth the price paid.

It did however, move fairly quickly for how shockingly long it was.  Before entering the perilous journey, we opted not to go for valet parking and hoof our own bags in (which was actually no problem).  We made the decision only after we were in the queue because we wanted to have the car detailed; the attendant informed my partner we would be relegated to the plebeian self park area because the detailer isn't allowed in the valet area.  The actual attempt to get out of the queue and into traffic was perhaps the most emotional part about the trip, since humanity seems to have been replaced by big, fat road rage monsters driving SUVs, not letting anyone in and honking at everything as though they took a vacation to Manhattan.

We get to the counter; the woman informs me the $40 deal has me in a smoking room automatically because I didn't indicate otherwise.  I know I specifically requested non-smoking.  She tells us the only other place is facing the dance floor and we will hear the music all night... Or she can upgrade me.  For a price.  It's the Red Room in a corner.  Supposedly newly remodeled wing.  Overall she was friendly and efficient; however, thinking about a lot of this, I don't buy that my non smoking room didn't go through.  I don't believe the only other one available is on the loudest floor.  (Is there an up-sell contest going on?)

The room:
At first glance it's spacious, and the views seem ok.  We have a lovely view of the car park out both windows.  Also as we explore our room, we discover the maids seem to just make the beds and perform a cursory wipe down of the sinks.  There are hand prints on the windows, dust all over, and the bath tub is too grimey for it to be a ""recently remodeled wing"".  I've also had more comfortable pillows at a Holiday Inn.  These are lumpy and seem to be here just for show.  Not a great night's sleep.

Gambling:
Stick with bottled beer; the ""mixed drinks"" are so watered down it's not even worth it.  The gaming floor is so cold I couldn't stay on the floor to spend my money.  Isn't that the point?  Will go elsewhere to game.  I felt like it was so cold on the floor to mask a smell?  Maybe it was the smell of an old casino.

Food:
We ate at Gordon Ramsay Steak House -400$ for two not including tip
-make a reservation
-if you don't have a reservation the bar is first come, first served.

Have eaten at the Eiffel Tower Twice Before:
- 250-500$ for two before tip 
- does not participate in the total rewards card points.
- reserved over opentable.com - the first time the specific table request was honored; the second time it was not.
- the best table is the corner window. 
- amazing, rich food

Don't bother with the cafés for food.

The bad: ""Accessible"" room wasn't accessible. I was sharing a room with a friend who has a mobility disability and so we requested an accessible room. The only thing that was accessible was the bathroom which had bars and a roll-in shower with a drop-down seat. My friend does not use a wheelchair but cannot step over a tub so that was good. The room was almost the last one down the hall from the elevator, so it was a lot of extra walking for her - after a long day of fighting crowds on the strip.

Here's a quick run down: I had two roach experiences here. 1) at a restaurant (review is on here) and 2) in my parent's bed. My dad was sitting on the side and my mom threw the blanket over to make it and a roach crawled out. We thought we killed it, put it in a plastic bag and marched down to the front office. The lady, with no tact, proceeded to ask where we were from (my parents are from NY) and she asked us if we have these there (WTF?). Then she rips its head off in front of us, says its still moving and takes it in the back. She also tells us ""I don't think this is a roach"" which leads me to believe we now have some mutant bug. Gross. While my parents got an upgrade to a suite (whoopy do, for 1 night) we were all generally skeeved. Also throughout the hotel are cracks and holes in the hallway walls. 

The casino games are not very fun, and the minimum bets are way too high for this place. Ceasar was cheaper at some times and that's just crazy. I will say this, I played blackjack with my brother where the scantily clad ladies dance. Our dealer was a chick named Missy and she was amazing. Someone give her a raise. She was very talkative and fun. 

Finally - the best part of this hotel is Mon Ami Gabi. I'll write a separate review for that but the service and food are excellent.",8,3,1

Hotel\/Location: This hotel is located in the middle of the strip. Walking distance to City Center, Bellagio, and Caesars. Although it is getting old, it still has a cool vibe with the whole Paris theme. The casino is pretty small but then again, it doesn't take too long to get anywhere. 
Check-in: I arrived early for conference and was told my room was not available. I could check in online at 11:00am for $20. I did but wasn't called until 11:40am to pick up my key. However, my friend arrived at 11:15 and was given a room without having to pay $20. This does not seem fair. I had left my bags with the bellman. As I was heading upstairs, I called them to deliver my luggage and it arrived right as I got to the room.
Room: I got a premium room overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. I like the fact that the room elevators were not that far from the main casino entrance. There is only one wing so getting to your room was fairly quick. The room was a good size with a couch (not pullout). The TV was in an awkward position hanging on the wall instead of in the Cabinet that was right next to it. The bathroom was very plain. Shower pressure was kind of poor. Bathroom amenities were basic. The closet was in between the bathroom and across from a desk. It was awkward because when you open the closet doors it blocked your entrance into the bathroom. The bed was of average comfort level. Wifi offered with the resort fee was on the slow side.
Amenities: I utilized the spa (see my review) and workout facility. The workout room is located in the spa and is open at 6am. Kind of wished I could have gotten in earlier. But there are decent amounts of free weights and workout things. The spa was also decent. The workout and spa facility are part of the resort fee. So good value there.

They also gave me like five pillows versus two or maybe three. I apparently like to hoard pillows so there's that. I had a big corner room on the fifteenth floor and I loved it because it was spacious and the bathroom was wonderful with a big tub and lots of counter space around the sink area. I liked how Paris wasn't swarmed with billions of people (okay, slight exaggeration) in the lobby so every time I went downstairs I wasn't swept up with the crowds and spewed out the doors like in other hotels. I was able to get around the hotel without having to walk really far to the parking garage or really far to my room from the elevator because if you've walked around all day and spent your energy outside of the hotel then the last thing you want to do is walk another two miles from the parking garage to your room.

My check-in and out were easy and breezy. I was a little annoyed at the resort fee (something like $32 per night), but that's to be expected. I ordered room service twice and on the second time I was given a coupon to use toward the next room service order. Both times they told me about 45 minutes and both times it was definitely faster than that, which I appreciated. Oh side note: there is a station right outside the small shop by the elevators where you can use an ATM and print out boarding passes or just get online. You do have to pay for online access, which is kind of lame. Paris is right across the street from Bellagio and fairly centrally located...a plus!

When I found out that she picked Vegas for her destination, I immediately put on my thinking cap and searched for the BEST hotel (considering our budget and the location I wanted) and I am certainly glad that I picked this hotel! 
It's not that I wanted a superswanky hotel or anything, I knew that where ever we went we would have fun but from my experience, the closer to the city center, the better! I knew that I wanted to bring the girls to the Cosmopolitian, because to me, it was the ideal location for a great dinner (STK, read my review for STK Vegas) and to enjoy the beautiful ambience. But the fact was that we weren't made of money so we had to bargain for a hotel nearby. Paris was sooo ideal because of it's supercute interiors, it looks and feels (minus the casinos) like you are walking along cobblestone streets looking into small storefront shops and cafes. They def. have lots of entertainment, too. Club Chateau, which I didn't go to, but my friends who pulled an all nighter did, and they enjoyed it. They also have a stage to the side of the casino that performs live music and there's dancing. Napoleon's is a restaurant (?) or a cigar lounge that offers entertainment. I loved walking around this hotel day and night, it is such a wonderful escape from the hustle and bustle of the strip!
For food I usually got a crepe from La Crepere. SUPER YUMMY. For a source of nutrition after my alcohol frenzy, I ordered the Forestiere, which had a lovely combination of mushrooms, spinach, and an array of delicious cheeses topped with Beschemal sauce. For a light and sweet snack I ordered the Favorite, which is a crepe filled with strawberries, raspberries and blueberries. There was always a line and it was always worth the wait! The Sugar Factory is the only 24 hour restaurant in the hotel and I loved it. Good selection of food ranging from breakfast, lunch and dinner and dessert (the bakery\/gelato\/ice cream\/candy store is adjacent to the restaurant!)
Our rooms were nice, one room had a great view of the pool and Eiffel tower. At night, we even saw the Bellagio fountain show from our window!
The only complaint I have is at the pool, a ton of the lounge chairs were kind of broken. When you adjust the chair, some of the chairs had either all of the settings that hold the back of the chair completely broken off or only one setting that only let you sit one way. 
If you come with a lot of luggage it is a ways from the parking garage to check in back to the rooms. I personally would load everything at the bell desk at the front of the desk and have a friend park. 
All in all, I highly recommend this hotel as it is fun, has a great location, has delicous food, and entertainment!",0,0,0

While I don't think it's a horrible place that deserves one star, we were not impressed with this place. The check in process is pretty painless if you use the self check in stations, otherwise there are VERY long lines. The offered a sort of coupon\/card for declining maid service during our stay, but we never got that either. They also tacked on a $40\/day ""resort fee"" to our bill, which we were never told about either. I understand, all the Vegas hotels are ripping people off with these ""resort fees"", but what does it really include? Can I not use the elevator? Do I get charged extra for washing my face at night? We didn't use the pool, or the gym, or room service, or maid service. We did use the elevator though.

The room itself was okay. Nothing special. The headboard in the room was pretty messed up and had tears and slashes in it. The mattress was okay, but the pillows were awful. I couldn't even sleep on them they were so uncomfortable.

We walked around the lobby which is fun and has a nice ambiance. We tried to get a drink at the first bar after the check in which had these cool chairs that looked like a corset on the back. We sat at the bar and we were ready to kick off the evening. Right away someone came to us and said someone else would be there to help us instead. Um ok? The bar only had 3 other people at it and there were several people working behind the bar. After waiting a little over five minutes with nobody else coming by or even looking at us, we decided to leave.

We were very disappointed with Paris. Everything was very overpriced, service was awful, if it even existed, and we just felt ripped off at the end. I don't know how they have positive ratings. Maybe they're really old?

Watch out Diamond\/7 Star players! As a member one of the perks is getting the resort fee waived. So I was surprised to have been billed $14.99 per day for internet. I was liable for the that charge because the wifi is only included when you pay for the $32 resort fee. Front desk staff wasn't helpful one bit and it was ridiculous. My fellow yelpers aren't kidding. Service is REALLY RUDE here. 

I'm not going to complain too much since I had a couple days comped but It's very misleading...when I asked on how it could be possible to be charged for something that is technically ""waived""? In addition, I have never been billed for wifi only at other Total Rewards properties (Caesars, PH) Anyways..she had no answer to my question and said that it was a better deal for me to pay the $14.99 instead of the $32 resort fee. THANKS CAPTAIN OBVIOUS!

ON TOP OF THAT, it was SPOTTY WIFI...lol

Anyways...the room itself was on the small side but it was very accessible from the lobby and casino.  My strip view was hardly a view (Red Room, 25th floor) The casino itself has definitely aged and could use some upgrades (the sportsbook is super run down). Crowd tends to be in the 30s\/40s. However, location is top-notch and other major casinos are very accessible. 

Overall - The casino is definitely worth checking out if you happen to stop by for a drink or to check out some of the replicas. As mentioned customer service here STINKS and for the rates that these rooms go for, you're better off either paying less for better value on a lower end hotel (Flamingo, Linq, Harrahs) or just paying a bit more for a nicer room.

There are some great dining options as well and they range from affordable to probably only going there once, but overall there is something for anyone.

The pool is lame. It is freezing. I do mean freezing! The only time this would be nice is when it is 110+, but I was there on a 103 day and it was way too cold. We rented a cabana and were highly disappointed. They are so far away from the pool and the rest of the stuff going on that you have to take a fairly long walk. 

It is basically a tent with a concrete floor ad a ceiling fan. They advertised that you would have drinks and food included in the price of the cabana. They also advertised a waitress to get you all of these things. Well not the case. Some guy comes by and gives you a fruit basket with fruit that is about to go bad. The drinks that were included were 10 small water bottles (8oz). Also not included in the price, but charged to you when you check out is 18% gratuity. This doesn't go to the girl who comes by once every hour to check and see if you need anything for extra charge it actually goes to the guy who brought by the fruit who you see once. 

The girl who comes by every hour or less, otherwise known as your ""waitress"" asks if you need anything. She won't bring you food or drinks from the pool cafe, but she will take your money from bringing you alcoholic drinks from inside. Also, if you want food that is actual food instead of snacks you have to order from room service.

You can get very nice photos of the strip from up top. The rooms were large and clean. 

Some things I didn't like...no microwave in the room, hot water took forever to get going in the shower, and the $15 wifi fee. They had a couple of bars down in the casion area, one in particular where the live bands play, had a rude douchebag of a bartender. If you're playing the slots drinks are slow to get to you, even on nights that aren't so busy. I'm a good tipper too, so I'm not sure what the issue was. 

Like all casinos they have a rewards program. I gambled over $1,000 in two days (obviously not a high roller) and the points I earned on my card were just enough to buy me two bottled waters in the lobby on the way out. Not sure if that is status quo for Vegas, but I thought I would have earned more than $7 in points.

Throughout the night , not one server ever asked my friends if they needed a drink. However, a server claims that my friends had said something to her. I do not know what on earth she was talking about, again we never once had a server attend to us while at the casino. They all of a sudden said the we needed to leave the casino immediately.

First of all you already asked your manager \/ boss if it was acceptable (which you said it was), then all of a sudden a server which we never spoke to accused us of saying something to her(not true) , then you kick us out and threaten to arrest us. 

They threatened to arrest us because we were standing our ground and demanding an explanation. After all that we left.

There was no wait at the cashier (odd);  no wait to get seated (another oddity);  very few people sitting in the section we were sitting in;  maybe 3 of 12 tables had people (very odd).  I would say the restaurant was maybe half to two-thirds full.  

Mediocre food.  There was lots of meats in the bins but most were dried out, maybe because no on was eating it because it was sitting in the bins for so long.  You would think that the workers would see how bad the food was and replace it but that didn't happen (this is Mother's Day).  The only food that was great was the made to order crepes.  I shared three different kinds with my family.

The other bright spot was the service.  The two people picking up plates and refilling our drinks were great.  There was never any buildup of plates or empty drinks.  They were very personable with our family.  It probably helped that there were few people in their assigned area.  Nevertheless, service was great.  The food though brought the rating way down.",0,0,0

The room was very clean and as soon as we got into the room an employee brought us towels and the pet kit for the dogs and I think the dog treat in the kit was awesomely big which the dogs would have loved but sadly didn't get to try because we had dinner and then fell asleep. Even with a map the dog park was hard to find and a group of really nice people showed us where it was. The dog park was next to the parking garage exit so we were really careful but it would be nice if the Paris had a nice gated dog park, while we were headed to the dog park we walked by the casino area and I was worried that the security would be like ""no dogs"" but he didn't care and we were even stopped by a group and had a short conversation.

Paris is a casino that we often visit when we're in Las Vegas. The vibe is lively, there are a great variety of slot machines on the floor and the staff has always been friendly when we interact with them here, from Valet to Total Rewards to restaurants (especially Mon Ami Gabi and with the exception of Le Village Buffet, which is horrible). We have had great gambling luck here, but that's just luck of the draw - ANY casino can be lucky and any casino will take you off at the knees.

Located mid-Strip, this is a fantastic location that is walking distance to other properties nearby. 

Paris has some great dining going on, from Mon Ami Gabi, which I HIGHLY recommend, to a GREAT little place (huge apologies, the name escapes me at the moment) that serves pizza by the slice - PERFECT hangover food and quite tasty, to boot! Without making this a Mon Ami commercial, that is our go-to restaurant at Paris, and we love it. Sitting outside on the patio and watching the fountains of Bellagio across the Strip while enjoying a meal... absolute Heaven.

Gordon Ramsay Steak recently opened at Paris to rave reviews, but I haven't had the chance to check it out, although it is on my To Do List for a future trip!

As I mentioned, this is part of the Caesar's group, so don't forget to use your Total Rewards card when playing here.

Things started off pretty well, although they really need more than two people dealing with the check-in lineup. The wait is long.

We had a beautiful pool-view room on the 23rd floor. The first night was great, because the nightclub was closed. The second night: the bass was booming, the DJ was ""aww ya"" ing, and we were sitting awake until almost 4 in the morning.

I get that Vegas is a party city and there are clubs, but I've never had such a noise issue. This sounded like it was right outside our window. Looking at reviews on various sites this is not a new complaint. What's worse is the canned response everyone gets: ""thank you for bringing this to our attention. We appreciate your feedback so we can make changes"" type thing. 

We called down and they offered to switch rooms, so the next day we went to the front desk, got our new key cards and headed upstairs. Packed up our old rooms and arrived at a dirty room with maids just starting to clean it. By this time we'd left our old room keys and were just standing there with all our luggage. 

We called down to the front desk, who sent someone up with new cards to a new room. Someone who maybe took a lunch break before they came upstairs. No sense of urgency to fix the problem. Finally someone came up and we got our third room.

my fiancé and I typically love staying at paris. It's a prime location given it's in the center of the strip and universally walkable to anywhere you'd want to go. 

We check in on a Thursday afternoon. 

Here's the list of Shit interactions we dealt with:

The bell desk men are RUDE and expect tips for 2 seconds of their time (even just asking a question).
The front desk can be a hit or miss. 
The maids expect tips. 
The rooms are not kept up to date.
The total rewards desk is unfriendly.
And overall the manager and ""top manager"" Fabiola is disrespectful and unhelpful to their loyal customers. 

So let me go into detail because I believe in hospitality when you're on vacation. Well, we got far from it. I couldn't believe our FOUR day trip was so shitty because of them. 

So let's continue on with the day.. we check in... ya da da da. We got upgraded to a suite. Cool. We have many valuables, we always use the safe provided in rooms and if not given one, we request one. Ours wasn't working. We called down for security to come and fix it and he didn't. He ""restarted"" it and it still didn't work. He said oh well too bad. You effing kidding me right? So we said whatever we'll hide our valuables in our luggage and stuff it wasn't worth the trouble. 

and Let's fast forward to 3 days later.. 3 DAYS LATER.. Saturday night\/Sunday morning. we finally had a chance to use the bath tub at 4AM (it was a late night obviously and wanted to relax). We let the tub run until it was about almost full. Turned off the faucet. We took a bath. I went to go get changed and then walked back into the room and nearly slipped because of a huge puddle on the bathroom floor by the tub. This is like 5AM - we're tired and I just wanted to sleep and couldn't believe what was happening. We had to throw ALL of our towels and I mean 4 hand towels, 4 face towels, 2 full body towels and bed sheets to cover this flood and figured we'd call when we wake up.

So we did. We called down around 11am so to say, was able to talk to a manager. Desiree was her name I believe. She kept throwing attitude back to us saying you should've called when it happened. And we kept saying seriously? It was 5am and you're telling us we had to stay up even longer to call you? Pfft, yeah right. We had also mentioned the safe not working just so a manager knew what was up. So she offers to send up maintenance - which we have already been on the phone with her for a given 20-30 minutes, had to cancel our lunch plans with our group of friends we went to vegas with, to deal with this bullshit. So we said no, don't send someone up because our valuables are left out - we aren't in the room and we'll call back when we're back in our room bc we're wasting VACATION TIME to deal with this. And we wanted to talk to someone higher up. 

We come back later that evening. Call down, waited for a maintenance guy for like an 1.5 hours. It blows my mind because housekeeping couldn't have believed we had an issue with our tub and said they'd send someone up right away. We finally get to talk to Fabiola (eye roll) who was apparently the top of the top dogs there- we told her the issues we have dealt with, one thing after another. They insisted a room change. A downgrade from suite to a small room on our LAST night. So you're telling me, we have to take time out of our vacation because your rooms aren't held up to its standard and WE have to pack up all our things after THREE days of already being in a room? Then she kept saying how we felt unsafe and had to switch rooms. No ma'm, we didn't feel unsafe, we felt like no one wanted to take care of the issue that shouldn't have been there in the first place. She kept offering a room change as a ""solution"" but we all know it was a solution for them, and an inconvenience for us. We were late to dinner plans due to waiting for maintenance. 

This is the best part everyone. The maintenance person comes in with another guy and checks out the tub, he immoderately tells us how there had been an order on this tub and how IT HAS HAD AN ONGOING FLOODING ISSUE IN THE SYSTEM. meaning, someone has marked this tub in an unworkable condition and an ""in process"" repair has been put in for months. Those were his exact words. I couldn't have believed what I was hearing. You're telling me, they KNEW the tub could flood, they KNEW they hadn't fixed it, and when we called down they wanted to ACT LIKE they didn't know? He saw the flood and was surprised it wasn't taken care of. So you're telling me you're handing out rooms for people to stay in KNOWINGLY in the system there could be an issue? Goes to show you how much they don't care about your stay.",6,0,0

3. They higher thugs from elsewhere to manage their security system, thus, compliance and safety of guests is also non-existent.

1. At check-in we were informed we had to stay in two different rooms for the two nights because ""our stay wasn't long enough"". Not only we weren't offered any help with the process, we had to pack all the stuff to check out and re-check-in. The lady at the front desk acted like she just lost all her savings in gambling so she had to work there.

3. We needed to ship two packages to the property. Knowing they'd charge a fee to store the deliveries we made sure the packages only arrived after we checked in. We thought it would be delivered to our room because at least on the marketing materials this is supposed to be a 4star hotel. But that didn't happen. Called the biz center to check the status and was put on hold for more than a hour. The second day was a holiday and of course no one was working. Finally picked up the packages from the biz center after checking out. There was no fees mentioned. Good! But guess what, one day later Paris decided to charge $50 from my credit card without bothering to let me know why. Actually even today I'm still guessing that charge was for holding up our packages.

I filed a report with their security office, it was turned over to their Risk Management Company and we found out today our claim was DENIED.  They said they asked the hotel staff if they stole the stuff...Do you really think your staff is going to say ""Yes?""  Now, they're saying the burden of proof is on us.  Uh, apparently they don't understand how burden of proof actually works.  I proved that my stuff was stolen when I filled out the report - unless you have cameras showing me packing my backpack out of the hotel, I've proved my case.  You pay a TON of money for a room thinking that you and your stuff is secure but apparently this hotel doesn't care about you, your stuff or your security.  When we asked for the security footage, we were told they don't have security cameras in the hallways.  REALLY?!?  You think that it is safe to NOT have security cameras in the HALLWAY.  Worst customer service experience ever!  Stay here if you want their staff to rob you blind and not give a crap about you.  #terriblecustomerservice @parisvegas #dontstayhere

Oh look!  Another guest robbed: http:\/\/www.vegas.com\/resorts\/paris\/#reviews

October 14, 2014
On May of this year I was robbed the night before my husband and I checked out of the Paris Hotel and Casino. My husband and I stayed at the Paris as part of a company event. I had put my carry on away in the armoir of our room and in it i had placed my oversized purse. I had transfered a few items from my purse into a smaller purse so my license and credit card were not taken, but the carry on, oversized leather purse and other miscellaneous items were taken. We contacted the hotel security that evening and had a pending report with them. Within a few weeks a was in touch with the hotels' insurance adjuster. I had to stay in touch with this person several times after that to see what had come of my claim.3 months after the theft i was told The Paris Hotel & Casino was not at fault of any wrong doing and my claim was denied. This was after they ""received"" a report from housekeeping saying that the housekeeping staff knew nothing about this theft. I tried calling the hotel several times to talk to a manager to see what else they could do for me and nothing. I got the run-around and I also got a hotel manager who said he couldn't help and he was too busy to take care of this. I lost $600 that day. For some, it may not be much money, but for me it was money i wasn't expecting to spend on a new carry on for the next mornings' flight and replacing a $300 purse. Hotel says they have no cameras in their hotel hallways, so be careful with the cleaning staff.",9,1,0

As I was trying to think of how many times I have been to Vegas, I became shocked.  I've stayed at MGM, Mandalay Bay, Mirage, Treasure Island, NYNY, Monte Carlo, Caesar's, the Golden Nugget and Circus Circus (don't even ask about the last two).  And the Paris hotel was definitely my favorite... and not just because my boyfriend took me here just the two of us.

I gasped when I saw the room.  It was so much better than a lot of rooms I've stayed at in Las Vegas and was bright, clean, and beautiful.  The only complaint I had was that the walls were pretty thin, so I could hear loud people walking in the hallways.

Room service was incredibly fast and yuumy.  And I really liked when the room service lady called me back after submitting my order to tell me a special order I had made would cost a lot.  It was nice of her to double check, and It was definitely better than just receiving a fattty bill.

I have never been into gambling, but I got into it this trip and loved the wide selection of games and money denominations.  25 cent blackjack is now my pal.  The cocktail waitresses in the casino area were very friendly and accomodating (free alcohol rocks, btw.)

The pool was relaxing, the cocktail waitresses were fast and friendly, and I love that you look up and see the Eiffel Tower.  32oz Mojito= sunny drunken yumminess!

I had stayed there for the first time in November and had a great time so I thought it would be fun to stay again; however the service we received the entire weekend was so unacceptable that we will not only never return to Paris Las Vegas, but any Caesar's property.

When we had originally booked, there were no Classic King rooms available so we upgraded to the Burgundy Room wanting to pay a little bit more to have a king bed. A week before our trip, a friend said she noticed Classic King rooms available online and I called the hotel to see if I could change our reservation. They were able to accommodate us and we changed our reservation to a Classic Room with a King bed. 

When we arrived, we tried checking in at a kiosk so we could get to our room faster but we kept receiving an error message saying our room wasn't ready. It being 11pm at night that seemed unlikely. We waited in line and when we finally got to the counter, we received our keys and went to our room. Imagine our surprise when we opened the door and found two queens. I called the front desk expecting that they had just given us a wrong room and it would be fixed in a few minutes. They told me they were sold out of King Rooms and that they would move us first thing tomorrow. I explained that we had paid for a king room not two queens and that we weren't getting what we paid for and I asked for some sort of compensation. They said the best they could do was a $25.00 food and drink voucher -which we later found out wasn't even good at half the food and beverage locations within the hotel. When you pay a couple hundred dollars for a room, a $25.00 food voucher doesn't make a difference. 

My boyfriend went downstairs to speak to a manager, but all he was told was that it states on the reservations the room are subject to availability. Why list a room as available if it clearly is not? I called the hotel specifically to ask if a Classic King room was available; had I been told they weren't I would have gladly paid more for the Burgundy room and this issue would have never come up. I understand things happen and am generally a very easy to please customer, however I trust when I pay money for a specific item, that that is what is going to be provided to me. We were told we would be contacted the next day as soon as a room was available for us.

As I walked down the hall the next morning to visit a friend's room, a maid stopped me in the hallway and asked if she could clean our room. I said no we don't need service yet as my boyfriend was still asleep. She then told me that our other room was ready and asked if we could move so she could clean the room. I said I wasn't comfortable moving rooms without having the key and an hour later my boyfriend went down to get out new room key. He waited at the mail and keys counter as the check in line was obviously long. No one was there. I contacted the front desk from our room and said he was waiting down there and that someone needed to give him our new key. The agent on the phone said she couldn't help because she wasn't physically on site and that he would have to wait. Over half an hour later, he comes back up as they refused to give him the key since my name was on the reservation. I understand this is for safety purposes however he is the one who had spoken to a manager regarding the situation the night before. It's frustrating the necessary measures to get us our key hassle free weren't taken. Since we had lunch reservations we left and figured we would get the key when we returned. As we were leaving the same maid asked if we could move our stuff again so she could clean our room. We said we would move it as soon as we had free time.

We eventually received our key and were placed in our new room, where candy was taped to the ceiling. We only stayed two nights and our trip was completely upheaved by spending valuable time waiting, arguing and moving. The following weekend my friends had the same problem at a different hotel on the strip. However they were upgraded to a suite that fit their reservations.

I think of all the hotels and casinos on the Vegas Strip, I have to say that Paris is the most eye catching. It has a giant 1\/2 scale Eiffel Tower sitting out in front of it after all. Also, the giant, neon hot-air balloon really grabs a person's attention. 

Walking into the casino is really cool because the ceiling is painted as the sky and the legs of the Eiffel Tower are built straight up through the casino area. We had brunch one morning in Mon Ami Gabi, and it was delicious! We purchased passes to go atop to the Eiffel Tower Observation Deck. It was a great experience all it's own. 

Overall, I really like the theme and decorations! It did seem to be one of the other casinos on the older side and could use a facelift, but it is still worth checking out!",4,0,1

I have been to Paris France, arguably the most famous and interesting City in the world. This hotel is a poor travesty of that great City.

The good news: I enjoyed a glass of wine from the wine-to-go window. The barista recommended an Aussie wine, which was fine, but a surprise, in that he and I were both in a themed hotel, Paris. Wouldn't he at least feature French Burgoyne or Bordeaux wines?

Why the low review, which is uncharacteristic of me? I give every establishment I visit at least three chances to provide me with a bad opinion of it. This was the least friendly of the Las Vegas Strip hotels I visited on a two day walkabout. 

I found that many of the features of the hotel had loyalty club entrances, but if you wanted to be a normal customer, you had to hunt for that back door entrance.

Many of the employees I engaged need to work on their people skills. The vibe was negative with several of them. It seemed to me that employee moral was low and no one was really in to it. Sad, as I find hoteliers have to be enthusiastic for their business to thrive.

A place of business gets but one chance to make a good first impression. Not a big deal for me, but mentionable in that the poor attitude of this place is tangible.",6,3,0

Our room was on the 5th floor but to our surprise it was a large corner room with two windows. We even had a view of the Bellagio fountains from our room. The room was clean and came with a mini-fridge which is awesome for keeping snacks and drinks cold. The bed was comfy and the tv had a nice selection of channels.

I had a $7 crepe with almond paste in it and it was as delicious as a duck in a vat of fat (in Paris, we say ""confit...""). It really was the best crepe I've ever had, and I've had the best that inauthentic crepe places can make. The staff had French accents, and that ain't bad.",4,6,5

Wow, how things change as you get older.

The outside is nice, in a strangely tacky way with the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe and several other important Parisian landmarks I can't remember the names of all on top of each other. The inside is a claustrophobic mess. It was built in 1999 and yet if I didn't know any better I would probably think it's much older.

Anyways.
Things I've heard: Ray J likes to hang out here. Of all places on The Strip he chooses Paris.....don't ask me.
Interior and Decor: Very little space inside as already stated. Even on a non-busy traveling day and\/or weekend it's still crowded. The fake sky on the ceiling sort of implies that the Eiffel Tower is higher than the stratosphere (the actual stratosphere, not the tower).....yeah. The fake trees and plants inside are quite hilarious. 
Food: The Le Village Buffet is one of the best in town. Everything else is very French save a burger place in the back.
Miscellaneous (or in other words I don't know what category to throw everything else in): The restrooms are awkward. If I have to drain the weasel when I'm in here (and I strangely seem to be in this place a lot) I actually will walk all the way to the bridge in the back and use it in Bally's. No barriers between the urinals, and the appearance of the stalls make me feel uncomfortable. They're just weird. Also, the shopping area is also very French, and not in the Chanel sense. Le Enfants probably is a store for babies and\/or children, whatever the names of the other stores mean....your guess is as good as mine, unless you know French.

Amsterdam always seemed more appealing than Paris. Maybe I would like it better if it were an Amsterdam themed place? Oh well, at least you can get a crepe pretty much anywhere inside here.",1,2,1

Overall I was satisfied, but I think that had a lot to do with the fact that we paid a marginal amount for a room upgrade that came with the best view and a room that is bigger than my apartment itself.

The decor definitely fits the ""Paris"" theme, and you won't forget that's where you're staying. When we first arrived I was impressed with their ability to carry the theme throughout all parts of the hotel and casino. Also upon arrival, however, I was very surprised to see how antiquated their systems were. Our check-in person used a manual calculator to show us what our total would be...it didn't look like there was any way for their system to calculate the total for her. The man friend had to sign a physical piece of paper that got filed away with his credit card info on it. Just kind of strange.

The room size was great and luckily the Parisian theme kept my attention and distracted me from the fact that the furnishings were kinda old. I loved that there were two bathrooms and that the bedroom could be completely blacked out with curtains from the living room - definitely useful for some of the late Vegas nights :)

In general I would stay here again, although I likely wouldn't be willing to pay the full cost that our room would have been.

I have a lot to write so let me break it up into sections. I will do them in order of when they occurred, sorta. 

Parking\/Arriving at the hotel:
Ultimately if you know the back way into the hotel then take that way! If not you will be stuck dealing with the craziness on Las Vegas Blvd. One thing I loved was waiting at the light to turn into Paris. When I looked to my left and saw the Bellagio Fountain exploding. Once you enter the front you will be greeted by a three lane roundabout. The first two left lanes all go to the valet and front of the hotel. The far right lane goes to the back of the hotel for self parking. The walking distance for the self parking is not hard! However if you miss the turn off point for it, just continue around the circle and try again. 

Check in Process:
So now I am waking into the lobby and at the front desk. They have two options, check in with a person or on a computer. If you do the computer then they will print your keys and you will have to stop by the desk to receive them. When I arrived they were moving the line very quick! It was wonderful! The only thing I didn't understand was 3 of the 4 front desk clerks were wearing suits. The 4th one thought it was casual Friday and wore a San Francisco 49ers Jersey. I understand supporting your favorite team but at a front desk it should all match. Meaning all of them need to either wear jerseys or suits. It looks sloppy if you have a different uniform in the middle. 

The room itself:
So the elevators here are wonderful and very quick! The longest I ever waited for one was about 2 minutes. My room was all the way at the end of a hallway. Honestly even the walk to the room was not bad! It was a beautiful and short hallway. With the elevators being located in a unique way, it allows for all the rooms to be near the elevators. I was pleasantly surprised by the sheer size of the room. We had a king bed that was extremely comfortable with a beautiful view overlooking the front driveway and the aria. Overall the room was huge! My classic room had a large shower and tub. It also included so many incredible amenities. Now the decor is a little old fashioned but I enjoyed it! 

The biggest thing I gotta give this hotel is how incredible their staff is with handling all kinds of guest concerns. Leaving the hotel was a little rough because my key wasn't working to leave. So we had to call the operator to assist me with it. 

This hotel has an incredible location! It's centrally located across from the Bellagio and Caesars. Then connected to Bally's. If you head south a bit you will hit the Aria and the Cosmo which are both a 5 Minute walk away.",1,0,0

- gorgeous interior decor

- nice choice of restaurants

I called the front desk and they transfered me over to a Dan(?).  Dan asked his staff over the radio whats going on and they said that their boss ok'd the jackhammering at any cost in the buffet area.  Then I overheard that other rooms were complaining.  Then Dan said he could not do anything and hung up the phone on me.  I called again and I assume I talked to Dan again and he transferred me over to the Hotel Manager's vm.  I left a vm stating the issue that the jackhammering is going on with my cell number.  I decided to call the front desk at 8AM to talk to another manager and they told me that all managers are at the 8AM meeting.  So I asked them to write my contact to have someone explain why they had to jack hammer at 6AM.  After 24hrs, I still have no contact from them.

Even though the hotel is themed, I felt the decor was a bit dated and a bit tacky.

As for the casino areas and restaurants, it felt smaller and lacking in variety compared to the other resort casinos.  The food quality was average at the Ile St. Louis restaurant, and the crepe place offered only a few options -- come on, who doesn't have strawberry nutella crepes???  Oh, and the line into the club, Risque, looked like a sausage fest.

The taxi stand was chaotic on a Saturday night.  It was a 30 minute wait -- and we were yelled at by the valet for taking the next available cab as he was assisting the group before us into another cab.  Whatever.

- toilet wouldn't flush. Had to call twice and wait over 45 minutes. Would have been nice for them to give us an ETA so we weren't just wasting time waiting around

- pet relief area was a joke. We've been to at least four other pet friendly hotels in Vegas and none were this bad.

When arriving the bell guys were really nice and took our stuff with no problem.
Check in: We got up to the counter and the guy that was checking us in was a true PAIN IN THE ASS! Sorry this was horrible he snapped at us the entire time. He didn't explain anything to us and was trying to charge us extra for everything. We finally had to ask for the manager and by the time she arrived he was already finished and the manager didn't do anything other then let us check in 30 min before 3PM. LOL 
Room: RUNNNNNN DOWN they were not good at all it was extremely out dated and not very clean. When you go to Vegas you expect  these nice rooms but what a huge let down. 
Pool: LOL compared to the other pools on the strip this was nothing to see or even be at. It is this round pool that everyone just hangs at. BORING 
Checking bags on the way out: So my sister was waiting in the line and gave the guy one bag and I walked up with my second bag and the guy said he didn't have room for my luggage. So I had to wait in line AGAIN to check in the bags. BEYOND RUDE AND EMBARRASSING.
Checking out: OMG THE rudeness continues we apparently were being charged extra things like early check in and etc. because the guy checking us in was just an ASSHOLE. So we had to ask for a manager AGAIN.

Spent the weekend there to celebrate my birthday (which was amazing, minus the hotel). When I pulled into valet I told them the room we were already checked into (since my friends arrived before me) and we we were taking our bags with us but the other bags needed to be taken to our room. 
An hour later we still hadn't heard and called the valet and they said my stuff was still in my car and all they could do was bring my car back up front and I could get it my own or a bellboy would bring it up but I still had to go back down to valet and check in my car. Prior to hanging up I told the guy to make sure my car would be there by the time I get down there and he was so annoyed (that I was even complaining) that he said that would be fine. When I arrived down to valet my car wasn't there and no one knew who I talked to (surprise surprise) and had to scan my ticket in order to bring my car up. 
Once I got my stuff out I needed a bellboy roller to help me with my stuff. The guy was rude as I told him to just  follow me up rather than delivering it to my room. He just kept telling me to call valet from the room and ""press the VALET"" button (talking to me like I was an idiot). Still outside, I called my friend to ""press the valet button"" and gave he my ticket info so by the time I got up there it would be on its way.  Once I got to my room, my cousin had said whoever answered the phone was rude and said ""oh are you the girls who left their stuff in the car?"" (Basically blaming me for the incident) and was arguing with us about how it was our fault. Stuff finally arrived an additional 45 minutes later. Horrible customer service with that hotel. 
The cleanliness of this hotel is ridiculous. The wall paper was peeling off the wall, the carpet looked like it needed a good stain removal. My cousin wore some socks in the room for the purpose of the carpet. In 1 full day the bottom of her socks were extremely dirty! Compared to waking outside without heels dirty. The comfortable was just a blanket. Everything that I was excited for to stay in Paris for the first time and celebrating my birthday, went to crap with this hotel.

Downside might be one of the senior citizen lounge waitresses that seemed like she wanted some sort of a tip from me for bringing me a diet coke while I was on the slot machines.

Location: Paris is in the middle\/upper north part of the strip which is great. It's known for its very obvious Eiffel Tower. Right across the street from Bellagio and Cosmopolitan, Paris is definitely centered well enough so that you are in ""the middle of it all."" It's within walking distance from most of the big hotels, which is great since traffic on the strip gets really bad after a certain point in the night.

Rooms: They're not the best (compared to Aria), but they're not the worst (compared to Stratosphere). The rooms aren't tastefully done and beds are a bit uncomfortable, or hard. The bathroom is nice and pretty large; however, the shower has no certain - everything is see through. They do provide you with a bit of closet space; we had two closets, three drawers, and a night stand with three drawers as well. The TV has a lot of Spanish speaking channels, and surprisingly, Chinese channels, which played both movies and popular television shows (American Dad). The English speaking shows were limited to movies, not so popular television shows. Also, you get wifi but you can only apply it to ONE device. The rest you'll have to pay for - a bit dumb.

Casino\/Restaurants: The casino was alright. It's a bit small compared to other hotels, but it is pretty clean. I didn't try any restaurants because when I took a look inside the buffets\/restaurants\/cafe and at their menus, nothing was quite impressive. Gordon Ramsey's restaurant looked nice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $70 for a restaurant decorated with electric red lights and one steak. The crepe place give out large portions, but you are paying $11. The buffet...well, Ive definitely seen better prepared food. 

Customer Service: I had a unique experience with customer service, specifically security\/lost and found. So my friend lost her wallet and luckily for her, front desk told her that security had it. So we went down and they kindly escorted us to lost and found and gave us her wallet.

There is nothing that really would draw you to this hotel if you weren't here for a convention. The floor with the slots and tables is quite small by Vegas standards. Barely anybody working there either. Barely anybody gambling...guessed they voted with their feet. 

The rooms were okay, nothing too fancy but certainly homely. 

My biggest problem is with the employees. Rude as all hell. I had to study some papers for the next day and decided to sit at a table outside the convention room and I didn't get into 5 minutes of my work before some POS security guard kicked me out. I told him I was just there to read and make notes. He told me he was there to make threats. So offended was I by this retarded attempt at securing the hotel, I went to the front desk to let the first person who tried to help me have all my rage. She apologized and then sent me to another area that was quiet where I could work. I got kicked out of that area by another dumb security figure. Went back to the front desk and then complained a little louder and then she had to radio all the security personal to lay off the idiocy. I then went to another section and then could finally do work. Not without being harassed again by another security guard, by this time I was over it and decided to go back to the room and blow off the work. It did not work out well the next morning because I didn't do it. 

I mean, seriously, how much of a security threat is it to have someone in a small corner writing notes and reading lecture slides?

This past weekend, a bunch of friends and I stayed here and man was the service sucked at the front desk!  How in the hell can there ONLY be 2 people working on a a Friday Night as the line was so f-ing long?!  It took me about 45-60 min to finally get my room key!! One of the worst service I've got at the casino and the manager at the time was being an ass as well!

Another thing that got me pissed about Paris was that they shut down the elevator on Saturday\/Sunday morning and forced everyone to take a detour and our powers were off on our floor and room! WTF was that all about!?!  To top off that night, my friend sprained his ankle and we called the front desk for an EMT to come by and we didn't get an EMT to come by but a security person that showed up like 6 hours later saying that they can't help us but the clinic down the street can help us and they told us to go around the corner to go get ice without offering any help.  Can't believe it took them 6 hours to tell us that crap!

Besides the crappy service, the poolside is nice but kind of small compared to other casinos on the strip but it was nice though. 

I thought it was stupid that you still need to pay 8 bucks to go up the effiel tower even though I am staying there!

It's so sad when someplace that was as obviously quality as Paris was starts to get run-down.  I'm not sure what they can do to prevent it; however, they need to do something to turn it around before they're pushed down the list to the same status as Flamingo.

The casino area and shops look great and seem to run well....  If you're not looking to closely that is.  The facilities seem modern and nice..... Until you stop and take a closer look.

Our bathroom counter and shelves were aged and the veneer was warped, damaged and peeling away.   

In the quad of our floor and down our hallway, someone couldn't hold their liquor and left a trail of vomit up.  Hey, it's Vegas, so this happens, right?  Okay...  I first noticed it at 2am when getting home from the club.  At 7am, when I went for coffee, it was still there and the odor was now very strong.  I called the front desk from the hallway curtesy phone the told them about it.  At 11am it was still there, but housekeeping was just down the hall, so they'll get it, right?  I mean, you can't miss that smell....  8pm and it was STILL THERE.  I stopped a hotel employee who walked through the dried vomit without noticing and pointed it out.  On hour later, IT IS STILL THERE!  The smell is still strong!!!  I call back down to the front desk and complain.  They merely apologized and promised to get it taken care of.  6am the next day, it was finally gone.  At checkout, there was only two open counters and one counter kept letting people bypass the line which really was upsetting everyone.  When I finally was served by the other person, I pointed this conduct out and was given another empty apology.  I told the clerk about the vomit and smell in our hallway and was given another apology.  When I told her that apologies don't fix the situation, she subtracted a day's resort fee off our bill.  One day... Resort fee...  That's $35.  She then explained that next time (like there will be a next time) that I should asked to speak to the housekeeping manager directly.  I'm a guest.  Why should I have to negotiate their system to get their people to do their job????

Bottom line - Not customer focused.  Over priced!  Outdated.  Not maintained.  NOT CLEAN!  Avoid it.",4,2,0

It was a nice hotel and I would probably stay again. My mom turned 80 and my daughter turned 21. Lots of kids here - little kids and a few dogs. 

ROOM: Our room was on the 24th floor overlooking the pool. We were warned that there would be a party on Wednesday evening and we might find the music to be too loud. We did hear the music and it wasn't that bad but we appreciated the warning. We had to have housekeeping change our sheets the afternoon we arrived as when I pulled the sheets back to take a quick nap I noticed food (not ours) and hair on the sheets. We had been up since 2:00 am so I didn't appreciate having to deal with this. The carpet is light gray and easily shows dirt. It seemed dirty in spots but not crazy dirty. The carpet can be touched up, though. The decor of the room and the view were both fantastic! There is a coffee maker in the room but we didn't use it. We brought our own electric kettle to boil water for tea, coffee and oatmeal. We also had a refrigerator but it was my understanding that not all rooms have refrigerators so ask for one if you need it. There were plenty of mirrors throughout the room for 4 women which was great. The bathroom was a really nice size. The bed was comfy. 

LOCATION: The hotel is conveniently located a short walk from CVS where you can buy bottled water and snacks. The souvenirs are cheap at CVS, too!! Don't pass these up. A lot of the stores have the same items but it seems CVS has the best prices. 

FOOD: The buffet is awful. Get an Uber or Lyft and go to The Wynn for breakfast. It is cheaper and OUTSTANDING compared to Paris' buffet which is boring, cold and just a waste of money. The crepes that were made right in front of us were still cold in the middle. Hexx was really good and so was their ice cream. 

CASINO\/SHOPS: The slot machines were not generous unless you played some of the older machines. Unfortunately, I didn't figure this out until the last day. My mom plays video poker and she didn't have any luck. I know the odds are not in your favor blah blah blah but at least humor me and make the money last a little bit. Throw me a bone! I also heard this from numerous people sitting next to me at machines that they did better in the past. Not enough waitresses on the floor. You could wait up to 10 minutes to get a drink on a weekday afternoon. Most of the shops are cute but management really needs to tell the skincare shop across from Le Central bar to calm down and quit harassing people as they walk past. They were so irritating and aggressive!!! 

The lady that checked us in was really sweet. Overall a good stay but there is room for improvement.",3,0,0

While the cheesiness is never ending, , this Caesars Entertainment property is as decent as they come for mid-tier properties and just so happens to be situated mid strip.

The most impressive thing about Paris is their lifelike replica of the Eiffel Tower. It is haven for countless photo ops, a Strip landmark, and home to its very own restaurant (and very good) in the Eiffel Tower Restaurant (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/eiffel-tower-restaurant-las-vegas). I've read that Paris attracts the most honeymooners in Vegas. If you can't go to the real Pareee, I suppose the Vegas version will have to do.

There are a decent array of cafes and shops throughout Paris, none of which are outstanding enough to mention on their own.The restaurant variety is a bit on the drab side, from the 24 hour Le Cafe (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas) to the uninspiring Le Village Buffet (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/le-village-buffet-las-vegas). Asian food at Ah Sin doesn't feel very Parisian, same goes for the bland Italian at Le Provencal.

If there is a weak point, let it be the casino and their nightlife venues. With the casino, it's a labyrinth of machines, table games, and a drab high limit area. Not that it should be pleasing to the eye, but the casino Bar Central isn't a place where one can truly get drunk enough to spend those TotalReward points and no other bar really does the trick. Chateau as a night club hasn't been all its cracked up to be and isn't a heavy favorite in the weekend rotation of most frequented clubs at all. From a mild to medium standpoint on the casino hotness meter, Paris is somewhere inbetween.

My personal favorite aspect is their rooms. Most of the standard stuff is going to look antiquated with an obvious Euro feel, but the jr suites, like the Le Mans and such have a good value to them, and the comp rewards are more applicable to higher end rooms here. If Caesars Palace is the high end, Imperial is the lower end of the Caesars Entertainment totem pole, then Paris, through all it has to offer, is definitely somewhere in the middle.

First off, the atmosphere is great! It's got a true authentic Parisian flair, with a touch of the Las Vegas fun! Every time I step into the Paris Hotel and Casino I just am filled with glee. The staff is excellent and wears the cutest outfits, and the mock cobblestone flooring downstairs with the beautiful blue sky just makes for an inviting atmosphere.

I personally love the buffet at this hotel. I usually go for breakfast and it is VERY reasonably priced for what you get. Check it out!

Es ist nur unschwer am 164,6 Meter hohen Nachbau des Eiffelturms zu erkennen. Es ist neben Monte Carlo und Venedig die dritte europäische Stadt in Miniaturform am Las Vegas Boulevard.

Der Eiffelturm wurde nach alten Bauplänen mit 8.000 Tonnen Stahl dem Original nachempfunden, mit der gleichen Farbe im Maßstab 2:1. Aufgrund der Nähe zum Flughafen durfte der Eiffelturm nicht in Originalgröße gebaut werden. Ein Bein des Turmes ist witziger weise durch die Decke des Casinos gebaut worden. Darüber hinaus hat man auf dem Gelände den Triumphbogen, die Pariser Oper und den Louvres nachgebaut. 

Das Hotel verfügt über 2.916 Zimmer und bietet jeglich erdenklichen Luxus. Auf dem Dach des Casinos befindet sich ein großer Poolbereich. Im Hotel befinden sich 10 französisch gestaltete Restaurants und Cafes, wie z.B. das Eiffel Tower Restaurant, Les Artistes Steakhouse, Le Provencal, La Chine, Le Cafe ile St. Louis und Jean Jacques' Boulangerie. Auch ein Touristenbuffet, das Le Village Buffet darf nicht fehlen.

Das Casino ist mit 7.900 m² überschaubar und bietet den Spielwütigen Touristen 100 Spieltische mit Blackjack, Craps und Roulette, Sportwetten, 2.200 Slots, Videopoker und Videokeno. Darüber hinaus gibt es noch einen extra Players Club. Durch einen Durchgang ist das Paris Las Vegas mit dem Ballys verbunden.

Am besten hat mir der Shoppingbereich mit den malerischen Gassen gefallen. Hier hat man auf den Wegen Kopfsteinpflaster verarbeitet und von der Decke strahlt ein blauer Himmel. Hier befinden sich französische Boutiquen, Wein- und Käsegeschäfte, Kunstgalerien und man kann frische Croissants und Baguettes kaufen.

We got a nice room, fixed with 2 queen beds which fit 4 big (muscly) guys comfortably overlooking the high roller ferris wheel! The room was VERY clean, just wish they had a keurig coffee machines vs the crappy pos coffee maker they had. 

My only complaint about the resort was the floor table manager. He wasn't in a good mood and seems like he was hating life. He made a few sarcastic comments about how loud I was being several of time. Come on man, this is Vegas, the city that NEVER sleeps. But Johnny, the bartender from the main bar made up for the lack of customer service the manger didn't have. He was very friendly and helpful, we even shared a few comments about girls walking by! ^_^

Location: Paris is located at the ""center"" of the strip, next to Cosmo, Planet Hollywood, Bellagios and Caesars. Convenient if you want to check the different hotels and a short walk back to your hotel if you're tired. 

Rooms: The rooms are spacious and clean for the most part. The regular rooms are ""simple"" with a French decor. Not the worse and not the best.

Service: 
- Check-in was packed on a Tuesday afternoon but it moved fairly quickly which was great. The woman who checked us in was polite as per requirement of the job, but not super friendly or cheery as I would have liked :-\/ 
- Room service was fairly prompt. We got 2 desserts ($8 each) and it took right around 30 minutes. They automatically charge you a $5 service fee so I did not feel compelled to tip. It is the guy's job to bring up the food and well...you already charged me $5 for no reason....my justification for not feeling like a cheap a$$ 
- Our TV was not working when we got to the room so they sent a repair man up in the next 5 minutes and he figured out the problem and changed the tuner quickly so kudos to him and his promptness. 

Hotel:
- The hotel's shops aren't all that impressive compared to others like PH or Caesars. It is just a small lane of shops that are quite forgettable. 
- The best part of the Paris is their restaurant\/food options. Mon Ami Gabi is an awesome restaurant and Sugar Factory, while I didn't like it for breakfast, would be great for a late night dessert. I didn't go to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant (due to the lack of Benjamins) but I hear great things about it and more than just because of the view. The pizza place was good for a quick bite to eat and the pizza was solid. I wanted to try to the buffet but the line was always SO long and out the door so I guess it had to be pretty good. It is part of the Buffet of Buffets so try and get the deal of 6 buffets for $45 for 24 hrs. 
- Casino area is WAY too small for my taste. After walking around, I didn't feel the urge to gamble here. 
- The decor was neat but slightly....cheap feeling. The sky ceiling wasn't all that great, especially compared to Caesars. 
- The first thing that I noticed coming through the doors, unfortunately, was the smell of cigarette smoke. That is a problem for me that I don't think should happen. When I walk into Bellagio or PH or other hotels, I don't get that whiff of smoke.
- Valet was busy. I was told 10-15 minutes but it ended up being more like 25. Grrrr. 
- No Resort Fee, but then you have to pay for WiFi. Not that I needed it but for those that do that's a bummer. 

Room:
- Red Room Premium. No fountain view but we got a partial view of it so all was not lost. Plus its across the street so we just walked over and watched from the Bellagio side of the street. 
- Furniture is cool and the queen bed is fairly comfy. Large flat screen tv but lack of many channels when we used it for our downtime, if there is such a thing in Vegas.
- Bathroom was nice in that it had a separate shower and tub. The tub felt very shallow though. There is also only 1 sink. Red Room Premium and we only get 1 sink? C'mon now son. 

 I have definitely experienced better. The red room premium cost me $60-80 on a weekday which is great for the type of room. That being said, seeing pictures from the ""lower"" type rooms here, I wouldn't stay here unless it was at least the RRP. Personally, I'd rather pay more for a nicer room at like Aria or if you are on a budget, I'd rather stay at Luxor or Excalibur.

Rooms are ok, not the Bellagio, but better than Bally's. The sink was clogged, the shower has some cracks, but overall space and comfort wise did the job.
Ridiculously lousy soft bed and pillows.
Casino is nice, I like the street look vibe with the cobblestones. And if your not brain dead you know its inner-connected to Ballys.
They dick you with standard useless resort fee $23\/day-ish.
What I HATE about this hotel is the food. No chinese, italian, american cafe, just fake french food and crappiest buffet imaginable. Crepes shop dont do it for me. Mon Abi Gabi a complete waste of time and money (see review), and a sugar-laced sugar factory store (yeah in case you dont get enough from the sodas and iced tea\/foods\/chocolate we eat). Easily worst food quality and quantity wise. Only one cant comment on is gordon ramsays new restaurant, didnt get a chance to go there.
Not very practical food, decent rooms, decent casino (have very bad luck here on table games maybe just me)
Their pool is on the 3rd floor, and isnt all that. Its ok size but not big whatsoever. Before 12pm you will freeze your ass off in spring because sun is limited since its blocked partially coming up from being on a patio floor etc.
Service is slow, they have 2 waitresses covering whole pool, and no food menu, thats a first in an upscale vegas resort. 
AT least close to cosmopolitan, and bellagio, 2 of my fave places.
Sportsbook is average size, players club took almost 20 minutes to give my $125 comp play, they said system fucked up reservation. But they sure did take them down quick when I blew it on the tables---LMAO
I think Ballys and Paris are allergic to having blackjack tables....what happened to all the double deck, and 6 deck games? They had a couple of each in the ENTIRE casino.

That actually says a lot though. I remember all my stays at the Venetian, my stay at Mandalay Bay, and even my less than great stay at MGM, but this one? Couldn't tell ya. That's how ""bleh"" this place is. Oh wait, I do remember the margaritas in the Eiffel Tower souvenir glasses. THAT was awesome.

Went clear back down to the desk, complained, they upgraded us to a corner room. That was nice. It was huge. But for a room so large, don't make it so sparse! Give me a couch or something. Bathroom was average. Pool was nice though, but I have to ask, are ALL pools in Vegas only about 4-5 feet deep?? This was my first Vegas pool experience, so I wouldn't know, but kinda lame. I'm a swimmer. Let me swim. The buffet is supposed to be one of the best in town. Okay, it's average I think, and what they don't tell you is you have to wake up at 3am and get in line unless you want to wait AT LEAST one hour at a NORMAL time of around 8 or 9am which, for Vegas, is still too early to be awake.

The hotel was beautiful both inside and out.  Our room was clean and had an ok view of the strip.  We had a standard double non smoking.  It was a little noisy at times in the hallway and you could hear the room next door when you were in the bathroom- which was gross at times.  Also in the room there is no coffee pot, only a coffee service where you can pay for a cup of coffee to your room. There is no fridge in the room, which is annoying at times when you want a cold drink. We had trouble with our hot water in the shower - it required maintenance 2 days in a row. The maintenance came pretty quick and both men were really nice about it.

The staff was not very friendly but thankfully we did not have to deal with them too often.  I took a shuttle from the airport and they dropped me off on the side of the building. Finding the check in area was really difficult just because of where they dropped me off. 

The best thing about this hotel is the location - perfectly centered on the strip and very close to the monorail stop at Bally's. I wish the pool was open later..it is only open until 8pm. The entire pool area is great though.  We went to Mon Ami Gabi at the hotel, and it was wonderful. Also there is a pastry shop by the elevators and the cinnamon buns are amazing. The casino isn't huge, but its nice and not very crowded.

I went in expecting to dislike the rooms (having already decided, on previous visits, that the common areas were only ok), but was pleasantly surprised. Lets break it down:

Check In: Friday at 5:30pm and it was surprisingly quick and very efficient, with some friendly thrown in too.

Rooms: We ended up in a Premium Guest Room (second up from the cheapest), and it was well appointed and of good size. Our room had a mini fridge which was great, though I am not sure if all rooms have them. Beds were comfy. TV was large and of good quality. Plenty of storage space. The bathroom was very large with a nice vanity and separate tub\/shower. The shower was great - large, nice and with good water pressure. Housekeeping was very good. Wifi was approximately $14\/day should you need it.

Elevators: One thing I've noticed is how bad some elevators can be. There was never a wait for Paris. They are set up perfectly and whisk you away quickly, to or from your room. 

Location: Perfect. Across from Bellagio in the middle of the Strip, you've got Wynn as a 20 minute walk north, and NY NY the same south (with crowds). 

Casino: Average. It has all your basics, and employees are friendly enough, but nothing here is really all that special. 

Sports Book: A bit small, but still decent. Could use some more TVs though. Staff are the friendliest on the Strip in my book. 

Food: Paris really, really lacks here. You basically have French, Italian or buffet...that's it. Selection wise, this is probably the worst on the Strip. At least other places have variety.


So, I stick to the opinion that Paris has mediocre common areas. However, rooms and service here were both very good, on top of the ideal location, so I wouldn't hesitate to return.",6,1,1

I'm telling you I'm not a complainer but even when the TV was on the highest volume I couldn't hear the TV. they said there should be a note in our room saying that they are doing renovations to upgrade their hotel. a note in the room? really? how about a note when you book your room. why would anyone book a room here if they would be waking up like this every morning. definitely not fair to customers. and this will be going on for a while so my suggestion is for late 2016 or early 2017, book a room somewhere else. it is not worth the pricey rooms and expensive resort fees. I wasn't rude to the staff when I called the front desk to ask why we weren't notified of this construction. When I complained they said they would take off one nights resort fee. well just like every other review on this hotel, THEY LIED. they charged me for everything and when calling to complain, they don't care.

now for the actual rooms- I understand why they're upgrading it because so many details of the room make it feel like a cheap motel. it is clean and decent but decently older. (another reason to try somewhere else. you can stay somewhere newer for the same price). I had a king suite and there is a giant armoire directly across from you. it's just weird because the TV cabinet of the armoire is a refrigerator and your TV is way off to the side.

My initial impression of the hotel when I walked in was that it looked pretty cool. I loved the ceiling of the casino area. It's quite nice how many details are created to resemble Paris. The check in counter was beautiful with all the chandeliers. 

So why 4 stars and not 5? I felt that the hotel was disorganized in their booking system and this affected the check in process. On the night my party arrived, we went to the express machines at check-in but they weren't working. So we lined up and there weren't many counter representatives so the line was quite long. Can't really complain since I know it's Vegas and other hotels could be just as busy.

My issue with the checkin is because my room was not available ... and I arrived at 11pm which is wayyyy later than the allowed check in time so my room should already be prepared. My room was booked ahead of time online. They did not prepare a room. Why was it not ready? How can a hotel like this be so disorganized? The staff who was checking my party in had to check the system which rooms were available at the price we paid. So we waited ...  then she tells us there is a room available with one king bed. But we booked a room with TWO beds, two queen beds. She said both rooms are about the same price. But it's not about the price. This is about customer needs. We (customers) paid for a room with 2 queen beds. If they overbooked a standard room then they should offer an upgraded room with 2 queen beds, not another room with 1 bed. I'm confused why she thinks we would take that offer when we paid for a room with 2 beds. 

Anyways. She made a call to see if there were any rooms left with two queen beds (which we booked and paid for in advance) and there was. So we got our room finally.

I was disappointed how can Paris hotel not have an available room which was booked and paid for. You would expect their system is accurate and they would not have such issues.

Very clean. I like that the shower (very spacious) and tub were separate and the bathroom was much bigger than I expected.  Our friends across the hall had a great view of the pool below and the eiffel tower.  This part of my review gets 4 stars.

Now my review of the villa pool rental:
For $325 we got a private villa with A\/C room w\/ flat screen tv, table w\/ 4-5 chairs, loveseat chair and coffee table, cd player, fruit basket, and a mini fridge full of water, soda, and juice.  Outside there were 5 lounge chairs and  pool floaties that the ""regular"" pool guess do not get.  Also there were misters that we could control from the inside of the room.  My main complaint about the villa was that it wasn't clean when we arrived.  There was a cup with a rotten lime on the ground, mysterious sticky black stuff on the floor inside, and a phlegm looking thing on the side table outside.  Also the waitresses weren't around much and was slow to come back with our drinks.  This part of the review gets 2.5 stars.  I still had a great time at the pool with my friends though because of the privacy.

Now my review of the shops and cafes:
I liked that everything was in in one area and easily accessible on the way to the elevators.  The food wasn't amazing in every cafe, but was good enough to hit the spot.  This gets 4 stars.

Lastly my review of the casino itself:
I think the gaming is very small and limited.  Not many open tables and slots.  This is one casino I don't really get lost in since the gaming area is so small.  I went to the poker room to play 3-6 limit, but there was only ONE table playing no limit.  LAME. This gets 2 stars.",0,0,0

Staff is friendly and helpful. The concierge helpfully checked me into my flight and printed my itinerary for free when my iphone couldn't check me in. Very nice. (She could have easily directed me to the pay-as-you-go internet terminals nearby.)

After losing $900 @ the casino, the last thing i need is to be guilt tripped and hustled for a tip. All he does is blow a whistle, which is redundant and useless because the cabbies can see people line up and would drive up anyways if he wasnt there. Anyways, I was nursing my big losses and wasnt really paying attention, so i just got into the cab and let the driver put my bag into the back. Then the cabhop opens the door, sarcastically snarls ""WELL I HOPE EVERYONE TREATED YOU WELL HERE"", and slams the door on me...

Well, everyone did treat me well there, except for that asshole. The rooms are old (perhaps intentionally), and the internet is like $15 bucks, or $25 in one of the convention rooms, which IMO is lame and sucks a lot of ass. The tv is also from like 1983 and the remote doesnt work. Additionally, I waited in a huge ass line at the cafe outside of the elevators for a quick hot breakfast (quiche on the menu), only to find out after 20 mins of waiting that they only had pastries. In addition to that, they left my coffee out of my order, so i had to wait another 10 mins to get that..for some reason.

This casino would've started with a 3 for average accomodations, and gotten a 4 for $10 craps tables and a smokin hot raven haired cocktail waitress named Roe, but because of the previous 2 paragraphs, -2.

Paris has certainly gone through some major changes over the years, and I like the direction its going on the culinary front.  Mon Ami Gabi offers a decent French menu with views of the Strip at ground level.  Or you can go high to the Eiffel Tower restaurant with a better view.

The promenade between between Bally's and Paris now has an upscale burger joint, dim sum, sushi\/sashimi, a bakery, and an excellent crepe stand.  They also have Italian (Martorano's), which looks like an intriguing place, with the chef\/owner looking a little like a cross between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson.

The gaming area itself was okay.  I had a very hard time spotting a $10 blackjack game with 3:2 payout on blackjacks, but finally found one.  

Conclusion: Paris is probably one of the better casinos for a casual place to eat.  There seems to be more lower table limits in Bally's and Treasure Island, at least for Blackjack.",16,8,9

If you're looking for a romantic hotel, Paris Las Vegas is an obvious choice.

Le Boulevard has an array of boutiques, cafes, and dine-in restaurants with ""outdoor seating."" Dimmed lights grace the stoned path, great for a nice stroll during the day or at night. It's a very popular area, especially from those stopping by from neighboring hotels, which is why I said it can be a bit congested. Paris Las Vegas' casino is situated in the middle of an X-layout--right under the Eiffel Tower--with restaurants and bars surrounding it on all sides; it's accessible from The Strip-side entrance, as well. Compared to other casinos, it's small and a bit limited in terms of the type of games you can play.

The buffet located along the same path follows the same design and layout. However, Mon Ami Gabi is regarded as one of the more popular places to dine in the area and on the Strip overall. This French bistro is the one with the misting machines attached to the patio area that sprays outwards towards the sidewalk.

Self parking at the Paris Las Vegas is easy, and it's conveniently close to the convention area.  The food places are pretty good.  Probably the best choice is Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse.  It's expensive, but the food is oh so good.

Another plus is the ventilation system.  I find it much easier to breathe here compared to other places on the Strip.  The smoke doesn't bother me here nearly as much as elsewhere.

During the booking process, the service was excellent.  We were given a good rate and told that there would be a note on our reservation indicating our anniversary, so we should expect good service.  Upon our arrival I had high hopes for getting a good room and we were told that the room we were assigned was really nice with a view, but it wasn't ready.  We were fine with that because we wanted a nice room for our celebration - we were told to come back in two hours and our room would be cleaned by then (he said he put a rush request).

I was getting upset and clearly just wanted to plop down in a room for awhile, so the guy gave us another room with a view that was available.

The room was ok - not the red room we booked, but it had a great view of the fountains and Eiffel tower.  Unfortunately, we were next to a suite, which was really noisy.  We were really upset and asked to move rooms the next day.  The person we spoke to was rude and offered us a new room, but no apology for the nose of sewage smell in the bathroom.

Some of the pros of this hotel are that it is

-Nice views of the strip and Bellagio fountain from the rooms we stayed in. 
-Pool area is serene.
-The Eiffel tower restaurant and wedding reception dinner held there was amazing. Food 5\/5. Service equally great.
-Wedding chapel was gorgeous inside. 

Cons
-The self parking garage is a joke. You walk forever to get to the actual elevators for the rooms. Not to mention the ""directory"" signs are sparse and hard to find at all. It takes a least a day to figure out how to get around.
-Elevators are grouped for different sections. If you have family staying on different floors you have to go down, switch sides and go back up.
-NO LOCKS ON BATHROOM DOORS. This is just a horrible idea.
-The fake cobblestone walkway is slippery and uneven, if you're a woman wearing heels be careful! 
-The casino in the Paris was small. Walk over to Bally's for some variety. 
-Some of the room floors allowed smoking, when you walk through them it's hard to breathe. 
-Was worried about bed bugs the whole time after reading reviews prior to leaving. We checked everything and found no sign of them and thankfully came home rash free.
-One elevator had a puddle of urine on the floor. It smelled awful.
-Drinks by the pool have alcohol added from a gun dispenser, I watched him pour and it seemed like half an ounce IF that. This is just an easy way for them to use less and charge more. 
-Finally, the pool closes at 7 p.m. every night. Is this a joke? Not that it matters, we went in the afternoon our last day there and the water was COLD. I'm not sure how they pull that off in the middle of July.

I can't say anything about the buffets, we drove to the Gold Coast every morning. We took a handful of people and paid what it would have cost for one person at the Paris.",1,2,0

We decided to move to the paris from mandaly bay  to try something mid strip. My wife is a big fan of paris so she was very excited. We visited the restaurant the previous day so we thought since that went well the move would work out. The check in process was terrible. The clerk was the absolute rudest person I've dealt with. I could finish a question or sentence without her rudely interrupting. She was short and terrible to my wife and I. She spoke to us like we were half wits and didn't deserve to stay at the paris. I walked away appalled at how we were spoken to at a vacation resort. I let management know I needed to speak to someone asap. The assistant manager called me within the next hour and apoligized graciously. She was very nice and apologetic. She comped a few things and let us check out late for free. Every other encounter with employees at the paris was above average or even amazing. The check in clerk was an abysmal at customer service hence I couldn't give 4 stars. We will come back cause the other 90% of our stay was great. Decent rooms and fun atmosphere.,0,0,0

I've stayed here like a bajillion times. My mom loves this hotel. Its a love\/hate thing for me. It's the opportunity cost of having a great location for the cheapest price but how much cleanliness and quality are you willing to sacrifice??? Personally, this last visit did me in. Hairs all over the shower...really? Also there were tootsie roll wrappers under the bed... which is funny bc last time I stayed here I also found tootsie roll wrappers under the bed... I think Paris has tootsie roll parties in their rooms or something bc tootsie roll wrappers are all over the place lolol.. 
I'm not happy about the quality of cleanliness or standard of presentation. With that being said, I've never ran into an employee that was anything less than curtious, kind, and hospitable. But the overall ""tone"" of the hotel has some overhauling. 
They're in the process of revamping all their rooms- which is great bc this place was getting dated.

-Location:
It is very conveniently located in the heart of the strip.It is in walking distance to all the other good casinos. It's has a number of good restaurants inside.

-Room:
My room was nice but nothing fancy.I believe the rooms look a lot older now. Even though we booked a non smoking room, they gave us a smoking room. We ultimately moved to the non smoking room on the second day. If one wants a view facing the strip and bellagio, they ask for extra charge($55), so make sure to see what view you are getting when you booking the room. The room had a small fridge,ironing board, iron and flat screen.Bed was very big and comfortable.It had a couch and small table.Closet with security safe.
The bathroom had all the basic amenities and was very clean.The Wi Fi is not free.

-Staff:
Staff is very helpful right from the doorman, receptionist and manager.
They go all the way to help you out whether it's getting tickets for a show or dierctions to grand canyon.

-Hotel:
It has a really decor which tries to mimick the paris theme. There is a nice bar right next to concierge desk. There are also a couple to good restaurants.


Make sure to try the eiffel tower ride and the restaurant at the tower.  My advice to the management would be to have more counters for check in \/check out and for concierge desk. There was always a long line at all the counters and all the time.",7,2,7

First time staying here my past Vegas trip. I was expecting something like Treasure Island but their room was much better lit and didn't look old at all. We took an early flight in, got to check in early and even got the adjoining rooms we wanted woot! Quick tip, if you want adjoining rooms that actually connect by a door, then your rooms will have to be one King bed and the other with 2 queens. The lady at the front desk who helped us was wonderful and talked us through our options.

We got our rooms for a really great price from hotels dot com, Paris isn't the cheapest option out there for hotels but it has great rates without sacrificing location and too much quality. It is within walking distance of cosmopolitan and a quick cab ride to Wynn.

There aren't that many food options. A couple nicer places and a few ""10 dollars for a sandwich\/salad"" places. No food court for those on a budget but you can always walk to nearby Planet Hollywood and get a cheap 6 dollar sandwich at the much hyped over Earl of Sandwich

Once walking inside, you notice that it feels like you are still outside from the beautiful clouds drawn on the ceiling. Yes, I might add that some of the designs were out of the ordinary...but design wise was ok indoors. (Prefer looking at the outside though).  

Gambling here wasn't very lucky...more losses instead of wins. So I would suggest not to gamble here...Bad luck! 

Complementary rooms sounds nice right? We received a room for two queen sized beds...but they did offer an upgrade for $60 for a king size. No thanks. (Wouldn't want to pay for resort fees). 

Once we walked inside our room, the view was not that great...you can only see Planet Hollywood, Aria and Cosmopolitan. The air conditioning wasn't too great...had to set it a few times for it to work properly. There was a flat plasma television bolted to the wall so this was pretty nice...glad they updated. The dresser was a bit too big for the room...kind of felt cramped; however, there was a his and hers closet. The refrigerator\/freezer took awhile to cool...almost 24 hours to freeze...

The restroom was pretty big with a shower and a tub. The toilet was not bolted on correctly. The sink was nice and big, but would have liked two sinks...it's big enough to fit two. I hated the fact that the mirror to check yourself out was behind the restroom door...should be in the room...I know there is a mirror in the center of the room, but you can only see half your body.

So I had to save the best for last...the beds...Yes, I have to admit that these beds were comfortable. Although, they felt sticky...so I'm guessing it was leftover detergent residue. The sheets were all inside out or placed incorrectly. I had to use a towel on my pillow just so I wouldn't get residue or any bacteria on my face...

I was in the ""pick up your key"" line and waited almost 40 minutes.  I can't even begin to imagine how long the guests waiting in the line to check-in waited - the line went from check-in and snaked around.  People appeared to have been standing in line forever.

Hate to say it but Paris Las Vegas Hotel is worn down!  They did offer upon check-in a room upgrade to recently renovated rooms - for $25+\/night plus resort fees ... no thank you!  The rooms are already expensive enough!  Our room, 1143, was just not that clean.  There was mold {not rust} in the caulking around the bathtub and in the shower.  The doors, walls and floors were lightly cleaned - kinda like the room had a cleaning quickie.  Wallpaper is peeling off of the wall and the tp dispenser wouldn't even stay attached to the wall.  

We did let front desk know and they did come up and re-clean the room and fix the tp dispenser.  They also removed the resort fees which was appreciated.  Even though, this attention to detail should be taken care of prior to guests being checked into the room.  The tp dispenser fell of the wall on the first tug - if a housekeeper is truly cleaning that would have been noticed and addressed prior to our arrival.  

If I did stay here again I'd probably suck it up and pay for the upgraded room.  In the meaning more attention to cleaning and room detail is needed here.",0,0,0

Always had fresh towels, the maids were friendly and the room was huge. After going to the real Paris in Europe I have to say the rooms and the lifestyle in this hotel is up to par with the real deal. It has that same European feel and it is quite wonderful. 

If you don't really care what kind of room you stay in just because you most likely are here to gamble and just see the Vegas life than a good and cheaper option is just getting a cheaper option room.

I had trouble walking the narrow 'replica of a street in Paris' with the plastic-feeling floors, which seems like they would pose quite a problem for anyone walking heels. Also, the gambling floor is mostly slots.

The room was ok, but our shower was awful. The water could never get hot enough and I could barely wash my hair in the water pressure, which was extremely weak. So bad. Also, I've never actually been to a Vegas hotel that had a lock on the door - is this in case someone ODs in the bathroom or something? I don't get it. At least the room came with a mini-fridge, and the beds were an OK size.

Don't expect to get any cell reception or WiFi in this place. I felt like I was cut off from the entire world. It was awful.

I didn't dine in the hotel at all so I can't really tell you about that, but the pastries in the little cafe looked delicious. Coffee menu looked expensive and bland, they had some cheap hot chocolate machine behind the counter. I really wanted to try Mon Ami Gabi but didn't get the chance to. I can tell you that all my friends bragged about Gordon Ramsay Steak being delicious and the name of the restaurant was a running, albeit immature\/not-all-that-funny joke the entire weekend. ""Uhm, excuse-eh me, it's not 'Gordon Ramsay SteakHOUSE', it's 'Gordon Ramsay Steak'."" If you don't feel like shelling out the big bucks for some beef wellington, head on down to the conveniently located Planet Hollywood. You can have Gordon Ramsay's Burgr for reasonable prices like $14 per, if you can stomach staring at the pictures of him around the restaurant.

The concierge was very friendly and accomodating, without seeming fake.

The Good: I was working in Vegas for a while and stayed in the base room once or twice which I expected to be roughly equivalent to one of the nicer rooms at Flamingo. The decor was nice but nothing impressive, however the room was huge! Absolutely enormous - had a hallway into the bed area, then a hallway with closet and desk space leading to an enormous bathroom with a fantastic shower. 

The Bad: Spent a weekend at Paris with the gf and thought it'd be nice to upgrade to one of the higher end rooms - not the top class suite but the next highest. The Red Rooms as I recall. The room was a dump. It was tiny, the decor was no different than the base room. The bathroom was the size of a Motel 6 bathroom. And I paid more for this?! Are you kidding?!
Plus, all Caesars hotels started charging a mandatory $20 resort fee which covers the pool and health center. Hello? Maybe I don't want to use those amenities and would rather keep my $20. Why try to gouge me out of more money when you're already overcharging for this tiny room?

I always keep that separate from my purse in case someone snags my purse. Anyhow, I lost my cigarette case. I alerted Security and about two of them came to my rescue.

One Security Officer stayed by me until the other officer went to get paperwork. I was mainly worried that if I didn't find my case with my license, how was I going to get back on the plane to get home.

I went back to the security office and finished filling out the forms. The officer was advising me of solutions in case my cig. case wasn't found. The alternative was to go to the airport and go the LV Metro, which most likely they would be able to somehow help me get on the plane.

I felt reassured and very comforted while being advised by the Officer.

My family was running around wild looking for my case by to no avail, nothing was found.

That being said, when I was done with Security, I decided to go to another area which I was at and unexpectedly rolled up and seen a man holding my cig. case and talking to a worker. When the man seen me he said, that must be her.

The man had found my case at a machine and was about to turn it over to the worker when I pulled up. I thanked him and went back to Security.

Security was very happy that I received my case back so I closed out my paperwork with ""item found"".

I was very pleased with the sincerity and words given to me by Security and how concerned they were and the honest person who actually was going to turn in my cig. case.

I wish to Thank Paris Casino & the Belgium man who attempted to turn in my case when I rolled up.

We also had fun playing at Paris and will always go there to remember the honest people that play there and the warmth & caring Security staff I dealt with. This was one of my most weirdest & critical situation at hand with a very rewarding ending.

Buffet: I like the buffet at the Paris because they have a larger than average selection of food and DIFFERENT food than youll find at other buffets, Maybe thats why the line to the buffet gets long...a popular find.

Spa: The great ..and rare thing is they let hotel guests use the facility for FREE (not massage treatments). The spa itself seemed very basic, they employees were bland and didnt seem to care...... It was free so it didnt bother me,

Pool area: The Paris pool area is relaxing it has a large pool at the perfect temperature and 2 hot tubs secluded in the back.....and again I hate to point it out but the pool chairs show their age. I had a relaxing swim (Even in November).

I am going to disguise myself the entire time; and so no one finds out I am staying here. Hotel snob I am.

Turns out this hotel is midway between the ends of the strip and along the strip. Bellagio is across the street. One hotel down from the Bellagio is Caeser's Palace. On the other side you can find CVS and Walgreens to stock up on eye drops, water, and toiletries. Further down is the Monte Carlo, Mandalay Bay, and New York New York. Convenience always gets a hefty factor in my ratings book.

The hotel check-in and concierge is about 100 feet from the official entrance. The more annoying part is the hotel elevator is another 500 feet from the entrance. You have to walk past the dud Club Risque and series of shops and restaurants in order to get to the elevator inlet, which is easy to miss. Apparently that's true in every single hotel.

There are 3 series of hotel elevators. One that goes from the 15th floor and below, another that goes from the casino floor and jumps to the 15th floor to the 26th floor, and the other set that goes from the casino floor and jumps to the 26th floor and above. The best floors to reside on are the 15th and 26th floors; and so you rarely have to wait for elevators going down or wait for other people to get off on lower floors on the way up. Lucky us. We got placed on the 26th floor.

The gals got a room with 2 queen size beds. By simply playing drinking games on the bed, I konked out early on the firm and comfortable beds. There is a separate shower and bath. No fans required in the bathroom. Miraculously, the bathroom never fogged up. Although, the shower water was always lukewarm, and it took a while for the water to gradually become hot.

My two biggest complaints about the hotel, is the lack of gambling options. I did not spend a penny on gambling here. Could not find a craps or roulette table for a quick and easy thrill. The other thing that bothered me a lot was the dismal looking pool. The place was packed with 300+ hotel patrons for a mere hole in the ground. On that crowded day, only 1 of the 2 bars was open, and the kitchen was backed up for an hour. There were no pretty looking drinks made of coconut or water melon shells. The cabanas are far removed from the pool, which contributes to privacy but a trek to the water. And the stupid Eiffel Tower casts an annoying shadow. We kept having to move to flee the shade.

Besides that, I would stay at Paris Hotel again...only if I really have to. I really can not get over how a hotel in the middle of the desert can have a puny pool. If the backyard pools in my scorching hot and humid childhood Houston neighborhood were put together, the pool would have been many times larger and accommodated the same number of family members.",1,0,0

C'était fantastique de écouter Natif, Edith Piaff, des Nubians, Eartha Kitt, et plusieurs autres en faisant une promenade dans les rues artificielle dedans le casino.
I highly recommend the Village Cafe.  It is one of the best buffets for the money in all of Las Vegas.  You must arrive early for breakfast though if you don't want to wait to get in (especially when there are several conventions going on).

I don't go to Vegas all that often, and sure, it's not Wynn, the Bellagio, or the Venetian, but as hotels objectively go, the room (the Red Room) was very nice - tastefully and modernly decorated, not too theme-y, with a nice huge bathroom, comfortable beds and pillows, and shades that effectively cut out the light for sleeping off a late night (more like early morning).  My only complaint about the room?  No HBO.  But who stays in the room anyway?  (Maaaaybe people trying to watch a particular boxing match, ahem...but it worked out okay.)   Everyone who worked here was very nice and helpful, particularly the concierge and the maid staff that left us undisturbed until the mid-afternoon when we finally managed to roll out of bed.  

The casino was pretty nice too.  Yeah, there's nicer (sorry, no gold statues or taffeta chandeliers), and I did think it was a bit weird to be changing out the machines on a Saturday night, but it's clean, pleasantly and cheerfully decorated and has fun games.  And a centrally-located bar, if you can't wait for the waitress to make the rounds.  Middle of the road, and very enjoyable.  The icing on the cake?  There is a twenty-four-hour cafe that serves a really good croissant, and a friendly waiter will box one up for you with love as you stagger up to your hotel room at an indecent hour.

The customer service was the worst I've ever seen. There is a kiosk to check you in but I had a question and had to wait for over 45 min for someone to help me and there were only 2 people in front of me, no joke! When we got to the front there were notes in our file to have our room next to the other parties floor and we were at complete opposite ends of the hotel. When asked to accommodate our request as noted the manager laughed and said no. Then we ended up in a handicap room where there was absolutely no counter space and the shower head was so low on the wall we could not wash our hair. On top of that the room was extremely dark with very poor lighting. I had to sit on the floor by the wardrobe mirror with the blinds open to do my makeup. When I spoke to the manager about the handicap room he again refused to help me and told me it's still considered a standard room and did nothing. He in fact made it worse. Our friends paid for the same room and the restroom was twice the size. Check out was equally as horrific as check in! While I was complaining there were two others complaining as well at the same time. Although the grounds themselves are beautiful, the customer service is unacceptable! I guess they wanted to truly represent the French theme with the customer service. This will be my last time here. MGM is 1,000 times better!",0,0,0

I was in town for a....you guessed it, a conference. I learned from someone in the know that there were approximately 900 attendees, so not super huge, but not tiny, either. I liked the ease of finding meeting rooms at Paris. They were blocked together, so it was great not to risk missing a session start time because of walking long distances between one room and another. Paris also earned extra points for supplying towels for participants - it was a fitness\/exercise science conference. Bathrooms were clean the one and only time I used the facilities.

Paris lost points for stained carpeting. I may not have ordinarily have noticed the problem, but there were workout sessions being performed on it. Sometimes in bare feet. Ick. Another point off for tech staff. Maybe it was an off-week or perhaps budget cuts got rid of necessary bodies, but I saw a handful of problems that weren't addressed right away. The most flagrant wasn't entirely Paris' fault. One of the presenters was trying to load her Mac-based presentation on a PC. Wasn't gonna happen. Tech staff messed with her presentation for, no joke, 15-20 minutes, 10-15 of which session goers witnessed because everything they tried was illuminated on the screen. If *I* know something technology-related is not going to work before IT staff can figure it out, that's just sad. But, seriously, the presenter should have brought her Mac\/iPad with her to connect with the projector.

All told, points added and removed will figure into an average rating. Good job, Paris. And oopsy, Paris.",2,1,2

While the Paris is generally a nice looking hotel with decent rooms, they tacked on this suspicious ""resort fee"" to my last bill after I had already paid the initial bill. Essentially, in addition to the rate that they charge for the room, they charged me an extra $25\/night to pay for amenities that I never used or asked for (eg: wireless, spa, etc.).

Apparently, resort fees are a growing practice these days, and it's despicable that the Paris participates in this. I would much prefer that they simply folded this fee into the final room price instead of being dishonest about the real cost of lodging there.",0,0,0

They booked us rooms at the Paris, and it was beautiful!  All the hotels and buildings had lots of stone tile floors, which I'm a fan of, but there's not much of it out here on the East Coast where I am.  

My wife and I got there at 10 am, Vegas time, and weren't due to check in until much later that day...but for $10 we were able to check in early.  The entire check in\/out process and the stay went super smooth, part of it may have been because of the time of day.  When you have a hotel that big, I can imagine that it would create a line during peak hours.

The decor was beautiful.  Some call it dated, but I thought it was pretty tasteful.  Some of the other hotels we hit while out seeing sights bordered on downright garish.

We scored a pretty great rate on a ""blue"" luxury room, which concerned me a little since it was Spring Break week and I had heard that some of the rooms are a little small.  Nothing to worry about at all!  Our room was lovely and quite large.  I loved that the bath and shower were separate.  I thought the beds\/pillows were really comfortable (although, I agree that the sheets were a bit rough).  We could barley hear our neighbors.  Our view was incredible!  We overlooked the pool\/Tower\/Bellaggio fountains.  The location was so perfect.  We could walk anywhere we needed to get and we were in the little section of the Strip that I like best any way.  We did take some trips out of the Strip area, so we did the valet.  They were really quick!  Much quicker than walking to the free lot, so we only parked in that once.  It was really big an easy to get a spot though.  

I am not a fan of casinos (I know, I know... it is Vegas), so I was happy that ours was smaller and not really loud.  I also liked that we could scoot around it when we went up to our room, so we didn't smell from the smokers.  Sorry, I think it is just gross.  Our concierge was great and very helpful.  We also got the text message discounts and took full advantage of them!  

Mon Ami Gabi is lovely.  I am a fan of the one in Chicago, so I was happy to have it as a hotel restaurant option during our trip.  One the first morning, we stopped to grab coffee at one of the stands and the server gave us a tip that the crepe stand makes coffee with Bailey's for $5 -- delicious!  We only got to enjoy the pool once (Santa Ana winds -- grrr!), but it was lovely.  We made the mistake of ordering the super syrupy sweet frozen drinks.  Really expensive and really weak.  As we settled into our pool chaises though, a waitress came by and told us it was happy hour.  That was a much better value!

I've stayed many times at this moderately priced hotel right on the Strip, usually on business.

It's much less smoky than other casinos and the hotel has features that make it friendly for both business and leisure travelers: fast check-in, restaurants at varying price points, super fast valet and room service and a very polite, service-oriented staff.

The rooms aren't dated and are clean. I received a room upgrade with a fantastic view of both the Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio fountains. My little boy loved it.

They have a few budget-friendly restaurant options in the main hall including the Creperie. The crepes were excellent and its view of the kitchen offered entertainment while we waited so my little boy could watch the cooks hustle and build savory and sweet plates.

Even though you can't call down for your car from your room, the valets hustled and our car was up in about 5 minutes, impressive.
 
Though we only stayed one night, traveling back through town after seeing the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam, we did head to Paris' Mon Ami Gabi for dinner two nights later. I had that dining destination on our itinerary and made sure we got there.

To begin my trip, I had requested a limo to pick my friends and myself up at the airport at 12:30 PM.  My flight actually got in at 11:30 AM but my cousin from Sidney Australia was landing at 12:30 PM so I was OK waiting for her so she could ride to the hotel with us.  So when I landed, to my surpries there was a driver at baggage claim waiting for me and I had notified him he was early but he said he never received that request and that they just tracked the flight info.  Honest mistake and I was OK with that.  When I asked him if we could wait he told me he would have to charge another hour of service (to me personally).  So rather than wait the hour I decided to just go to our hotel and have a host help me out.  When I arrived at the hotel there was a host there to greet me, JASON GRANDE.  He was pleasant at first and I explained to him what had happened and he could care less.  When I informed him that my cousin was expecting to ride with us to the hotel he said it wasn't his fault.  I acknowledged it wasn't his fault and rather was asking for his help to get another car to pick her up since an error had been made.  My limo driver was waiting because I was going to ride back to the airport with him to pick her up.  Finally the limo driver said he had to leave because he was on the clock and Jason was OK with it.  After some back and forth, Jason became rude and condescending at which point I just walked away and proceeded to check into my room.  The front desk people were extremely kind and empathized with my situation while Jason went back to his desk without a care in the world and did NOTHING to try and rectify the situation.  I checked into my old room with a view of the back of the hotel (i.e. nothing) and some air conditioners on top of the roof.  I was always told they would upgrade Seven Stars players to the ""best available room"" and this was the worst room I had stayed in out of 6 TR properties.

The first time, my parents were guests of Harrah and got us a room. Little did I know that we were upgraded to a suite (Jr suite, I think). This room was very nice.

The next time we came back, we had a free stay voucher given to us as a present. What a big difference. This was the normal room. First off, we had reserved a room with a king bed, when we arrived, there were no king beds available. I asked what was the point of having a reservation then? The clerk replied that it was because of our ""late check-in."" It was 8 pm. Anyway, the bedding was obviously old, and really, all that needs to be said is and will illustrate the type of room it is...it was an old, non-flat screen TV. Seriously? Even La Quinta has flat screens in all their rooms.

Anyway, the staff was hit and miss. Some really knew what they were tlaking about and others acted like it was their first day.

I agree with whoever it was that said the food selection isnt that great here. Although, I will say, the crepes are pretty good.

If you have time, check out the dueling piano bar. Very entertaining.

So, I guess my recommendation would be...it depends on if youre getting a good deal or not. If it is a good price, then stay here, but we looked at adding a day (Sunday) to our gift stay and it was a little over $200 a night. We stayed at the 5 star Palazzo for less. And yes, Palazzo is my favorite...now that is a nice hotel.

Depending on the time of day you arrive, every hotel in Vegas can potentially have long waits. It's Vegas you dumb S...!

Ok, got that off  my chest. 

The Paris Hotel for me was a delightful stay. Previously I had stayed at Harrah's which is also in the Cesar's group, but it's clear the Paris is on a much higher plane. I stayed on the 30th floor in the non-smoking section of the hotel which I think offers an additional benefit: once the elevator passes the third floor, it won't stop again until reaching the 22nd. So your travels to and from your room are quite fast. The room itself was quite spacious, more than enough for my needs. 

By the way, I had a great, funny conversation with Tamura at the front desk. So a shout out to her.

Unlike Monte Carlo, it seems like they actually put some thought into this hotel.  It actually offers a variety of decent dining options, creatively designed Casino decor, and of course the replica of the Eiffel Tower.  This is why I think it is cut above the cheaper hotels.

On the ground floor, there is Mon Ami Gabi, a classic French restaurant that offers a view of the Bellagio fountain show.  I heard that it shares the same kitchen as the restaurant up on the Eiffel Tower, but don't quote me on it.  Also, the Paris Village Buffet is one of the better buffets in the $26~$29 range.  

The hotel rooms are quite disappointing to say the least, especially at the price they are charging.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that they charge a lot, but for the quality of the room, I would expect something in the $80s rather than $120s.  Of course, prices can also go up to $200 on some nights.  One thing I really did not like about the room is it's ugly yellow wall paper.  I don't know if it's supposed to be some classic French design or what not, but my god was it ugly.  Cleanliness of the room, meh, mediocre.

I actually liked the Casino, well the décor, not the fact that I lost most of my money here.  It tries to imitate a classic outdoor French street with blue sky ceilings and street signs.  Not bad.  Now they just need to work on improving the odds of winning.

Our room was 1992 on the 19th floor with a spectacular view of the pool, eiffle tower and Bellagio. Could not ask for a better view. The room was nice although the decor wasn't my taste at all. I am extremely picky when it comes to clean carpet as it is the first thing I look at when I walk into a room..it was clean without stains, so no need to switch rooms! The beds were so soft and comfortable, we both slept great. The only problem was that the fridge did not work at all. After calling it was fixed the same day, but we could hear it running. Also, hot water in the shower was a hit or miss. Better than, Luxor where I always had a cold shower.

The pool was huge, but 3'.5"" everywhere. Plenty of lounge chairs, but they were not the most comfortable. Alcohol drinks were $15 at the pool. You could take your own drinks, as long as it was not alcohol.

The casino was very smoky, and the shop keepers were annoying always trying to get you to come in with a sample. 

I would stay here again, only if I got the same view or better. Customer service was not good. Will quickly mention the key to the room did not work when we arrived.

I was here years ago when Paris LV opened and it was fresh and new. Being originally from Montreal, my French is more than passable, and then it was fun and cool to come into the Paris lobby and speak French to anyone working here. Now, they have no idea what I'm saying as none of the staff I tried to converse with spoke or understood the language. The décor is still adorable and tres Parisienne, with nods to the Art Nouveau metro signs, faux outdoor cabarets, and the adorable patisseries and boutiques along les faux rues Francais. I was disappointed in the drinks my mother and I had at a ""café"" in the lobby; they were overpriced and small (even for Vegas standards). The gal serving us was nice but clad in super-short Daisy Duke shorts that barely covered her nether regions and was about as French as Honey Boo Boo. I was a little surprised - not in a good way - to see pseudo-strippers in thongs and bra-like tops gyrating to music atop an elongated table in the center of the lobby (I know this is Vegas, but STILL!). I swear, I'm no prude, but the atmosphere just seemed....seedier here than in the other major hotel casinos we visited. 

I must make note of the bathrooms, too. The women's facilities were dingy, and some of the enameled ceramic pedestal sinks were cracked. Some of the bathroom stalls were dirty, and some doors had  graffiti carvings on them (at least, mine did). They didn't appear to be maintained well. 

The replicas of the Eiffel Tower and l'Arc du Triomphe were awesome landmarks, and we took a few photos by them. And the few folks we talked to who worked here were friendly. All in all, this is a cutesy place to check out, take some photos in, and then leave.",3,0,1

We found a good deal on hotels.com for Paris. It's a little cheesy to some because of the cobblestone floors and decor, but I liked it. I think it's cute that when inside, it looks like you are outside in Paris. From the lamp posts, to the windows with hanging plants, to the ""messieurs"" instead of ""men"" for the bathroom, it's all very sweet. The staff at Paris  was also friendly and helpful.

We had a ""Luxury"" room which is their standard room. To me, it was one of the nicest hotel rooms I've stayed in!

It was very spacious, comfortable, and pretty. We had two large windows, two chairs, the bed, and a cute little lounge padded bench. There is a ton of storage space: two closets that are a part of the TV stand\/case\/whatever you'd call it, and one large closet on the way to the bathroom. The bathroom was especially wonderful. They was a huge mirror above the sink, and a full length large mirror on the back of the door (we ladies appreciate that especially). There was a tub AND stand up shower (all glass, so it's fun to watch your partner shower, haha). I made sure to utilize both for bathing, just cause.

The few things I'd like to see improved on are:
- the pool temperature. It's a nice pool but the water was a bit chilly.
- the shower water temperature. It DOES warm up, but for some reason it takes a good three minutes before it finally does. Oddly, the tub did not have the same issue.

The casino mentality is to cater to only the top 1 percent player. Mediocre players, those not at the 7 star level, need not apply. 
 
Why when your only regular cashier window is occupied by a credit transaction, what do you do, yes open more 7 star only cashiers and let us stand  for an extra 20 minutes just to cash in chips.  
 
Valet parking follows the same principal, 7 stars get cars and regular folk sit for at least 30 minutes, in the heat, waiting for their cars.

Until the management do something about simple stuff like fixing the splash guard at the bottom of the shower so that water will not be running into the whole bathroom area which is unsafe for guests or staff that is cleaning the rooms, I will not be returning here.

First was check in being so late at 4 the line was huge...so we checked our luggage with the hotel and walked around for an hour. After the drive the last thing we want to do is stand in line. I had over 1000 worth of product from Sephora and snacks and water in my luggage. When they arrived at the room they were hot. Why the HELL would a hotel in Vegas leave the luggage in a room that has no AC or outside!?!?!? my snacks melted and my water was piping hot...luckily none of my make up was destroyed. After that, it was nothing too crazy to be so upset at but the stay got worse.Secondly, my bf was mistaken about the dining credit being for two days and a manager overheard and said no well  honor $50 credit. So we went to Monami Gabi and got pizza. Well they only honored $25 and not the $50. Real nice. The worst was the last morning i woke up with a HUGE spider bite on my foot- fang marks broke my skin and other bites all over my arms. i'm assuming BED BUGS. Calling to complain was the worst experience. The first lady we talked to at Paris who was a manager (what a joke) was a total B. She was so rude and talked over me put me on hold abruptly. Then the manager CHRIS said he would sort out the dining credit issue and give a refund...yeah that never happened either. epic fail Paris, epic fail. Never again.",2,2,1

The look and feel of the room is nothing that I would have imagined of a 4+ star rated hotel according to most travel sites.  The room is very dated, smells of mildew, and to top it off the bathroom is old-dirty and has mildew growing in the corners of the shower.  I will be requesting a bottle of bleach from housekeeping because this is pretty disgusting.
 
I contacted the front desk to inform them of these issues along with my level of dissatisfaction and was told that the hotel is booked solid and no room changes can be made at this time.  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, please look elsewhere when you are looking to book a hotel room in Vegas.",0,0,0

My father who lives in Vegas booked a basic room for us and then I called and had them upgrade not only the room, but they added a package where you can have breakfast (7a-11am) and a manager's reception (5pm-8pm) everyday in the lounge which is located on the 31st floor. The breakfast was the basic continental stuff, but for some reason the OJ tasted soooo good here. The evening reception was nice. They had all you can eat shrimp, and a few good hot apps. Each time you can have 2-free drinks per person. If you have over 2 then they are $4.00 per drink. They had liquor there as well in the evening, so you could make your own drinks. However strong you wanted. 
The hotel - I called right when we landed which was at 9am to see if they just happened to have anything ready. Luz at the front desk said they did have something on the 10th floor ready, but to call back around 11am to see if anything better opened up. I called back and they had a room on the 21st floor which we opted for. We ended up in room 2198P. The room was nice, but nothing SUPER. The bed was comfy, from what I remember. We had a few chairs and a couch. No flat screen, but a vanity area for the wife. The bathroom had shower and bathtub. Out of one window we could see the pool and the Eiffel Tower and from the other window we could see and hear the Bellagio Fountains which was cool. 
We did eat at the buffet which i will review separately. Overall everyone we talked to at the hotel was nice and helped us out with anything we needed. Oh and just so you know, if you want a late check out and they are sold out the night you check out they will charge you $400.00 to check out late. Since we had family taking us to the airport we just checked out on time and brought out bags to the Bell Desk for them to hold for a few hours. As we were walking to the Bell Desk we noticed that there was a hell-a line to check out. With my wife and I traveling a lot, we opted to check out through the TV in the room. We checked our bill and check out in a matter of 5 minutes. If your bill is correct, I would just check out through the TV rather than standing in line forever. 
We would stay here again, but only if we get the same upgrade with the food. It was well worth it.",2,0,1

I also really enjoy how close the main entrance doors are to the elevators to the hotel. It's so much more convenient than some other hotels where you have to walk through half the casino and get lost figuring out where the elevators are. 
The room we had was clean and everything seemed to be in working order. The bedside lamp had extra plugs and usb ports to charge all the electronic devices. 
My main issue was with the shower water pressure. I felt like I couldn't get clean with the amount of water trickling out of the spout...it also didn't help that the shower head is the one stuck to the wall so you cant adjust it.

I gambling my mother's retirement away so I can move up into Diamond Status. Well now, Paris Hotel Casino in Las Vegas is in one great location. Next to Bally's and Planet Hollywood (formerly Aladdin) and across the street from both Bellagio and Caesars Palace.

Now the rooms are decent and pretty well sized. The whole place is well taken care of. You don't have to wait forever for an elevator. There's a great toiletries store right next to the elevators just in case you need something that bad. Plenty of places to eat (buffets, creperies, boulangeries, bistros)...like the real Paris you won't miss out on good food. For me, the best place to eat is Mon Ami Gabi. I solely eat the Filet Mignon medium rare and I pair it with the house Merlot. Also try the crab cakes appetizers. Last, you must try the dessert menu. Looks like I'm going to do a review for that place too.

As for the casino...it's Vegas. So plenty of games. The sportsbook is huge and hardly ever busy except for special events. A great aspect of Paris is that it is adjacent to Bally's...so if you're want to eat a Sbarro or want to try playing at Bally's...it's just a quick walk away. 

Paris is a lot less expensive than the bigger hotels like Caesars, Bellagio, etc....but it is just as well taken care of, just as pretty and just as comfortable. Definitely worth the price. But I'm comped...so I don't pay anything...well except at the tables and slots.",0,1,0

My mom, step dad and I were going out here for my uncles birthday. I was only staying for 2 day while my parents, 7 days, so my mom didnt want to have to pay for me. So she requested a dble bed room when she made her reservations. When we got there they checked in and we went to the room. I walked in and was like, uh?? There is only one bed. So we marched back downstairs and my mom told the woman that there was only one bed. The woman said, 'Oh I thought that was your husband"" (referring to my step dad), my mom just gave her a look. The lady was like, oh well, we dont have any dble bed room available but I can send up a roll a way bed and change your room tomorrow. She said that was fine. So I got to sleep on a roll away bed. So the woman must have thought my parents were fighting and wouldnt share a bed or that my mom likes to vacation with her brother? I dont know, it was kinda amusing. 

So anyways, I got a lovely pull away bed... The room was kinda small so with that set up there wasnt much room, but it didnt matter cause the view was great! We faced the Bellagio and the Eiffel Tower. The room was awesomely decorated, very classy. My cousin and her fam got a dlbe bed room and we went to see it and it was on the opposite side of the hotel with a view of the parking garage so we were quite happy with our room after that.

This hotel has changed a lot. They have horrible service. I requested a roller bed and was told that it will be sent up shortly. For over 3 hours, it did not come. We called multiple times and were put on hold. Then we were told that there is a hold on our room and we cannot get the bed because we had 2 queen beds; even though we were offered the option of a roller bed at check in (thus we did not get the suite). I was so tired and ended up falling asleep on the chair. The reason I needed the bed in the first place was because I spilled water all over my bed and it was too wet to sleep on.

The room was small, but generally clean and neat. The beds suck. The tv was not a flat screen, but who cares ""this is free!"".

This was also my first Las Vegas trip so I didn't know what to expect with the hotels. By far I am glad we decided to stay here for my first trip since the hotels is located in the middle of the Strip. The location alone of the hotel makes it 3 stars, easy to see the sights and sounds of Las Vegas from just within a short walk of this hotel. The staff seemed pretty unhelpful when we needed their assistance. During our checkin process the front desk agent was not very friendly or helpful. We both work in hospitality and we can easily tell when someone doesn't show the skill set required for the job and unfortunately the agent either needed retraining or to find another job. Our keys also stopped working during our stay and loss prevention let us into the room but we had to come downstairs and get our keys remade. We were just coming in from a day spent on the Strip at various casinos, it was our time to relax and get reenergized for the night. They should have sent some new keys up since we had to wait 15 minutes for the loss prevention to come up and let us in. The rooms were quite big but quite old in decor. We stayed in a standard king room which Paris Las Vegas advertises as a Deluxe room. We had a very nice view of The Cosmopolitan and Planet Hollywood. Even though we didn't come to Las Vegas to watch tv, the tv was a very old tube tv that had the old curved glass screen. I think they may need to do a remodel of all their deluxe rooms soon. The bathroom was our favorite part of the room with dual sinks, huge vanity space, separate shower and soaker tub, and all marble flooring. The casino area although small was pretty active and fun when we gambled. We were a big fan of the sportsbook to catch some of the NFL playoff games and the UFC event that took place. The outside of the hotel is absolutely spectacular to look at. We took several photos of the outside area both during the day and at night. Overall the Paris Las Vegas was a good hotel to stay at for my first trip to Las Vegas. Excellent location with a pretty nice casino area and average rooms. Staff service could be improved.",0,0,0

The wifi worked maybe 1\/4th of the time which is frustrating since you have to pay for the wifi in your resort fee. They closed the pool early for a private event. No big deal but a little bit of a bummer when you shut it down 2 hours early. If location is your biggest priority and you don't care about your room then this is your place.

The Paris is an upscale hotel\/casino with some beautiful architecture, a scale version of the Eifel Tower and a casino floor that is designed to look like, well..... Paris. I love walking through this casino and just checking out all the sights. 

My only complaint is everything is insanely expensive. We paid $18 for a glass of wine and a domestic beer. I went for a cigar and ended up paying $17 for an average cigar. So if you come here, be prepared to drop some serious cash.

Like another review said, it was due to airport proximity.  I went there for a convention.  This is definitely a hotel to consider or weddings-that's for sure!  Very breathtaking! You will get beautiful photos & it's not all hokey fake looking.  It does look like the real deal!

I'm not a gambler, so I can't really comment on the slots & other gambling.  Their floor was always busy, though, & attended to. 

Within 30 seconds of being there, a woman was trying to sell me an eye cream for $700.  Welcome to Vegas!  It's the same one I can get at home for $100, and with a sale $50.  So, let that set the benchmark for you on what to expect as far as the economy goes.  I can't exactly say I blame them.  The cost of living in Vegas for the locals is quite high!

 We had a beautiful view of the mountains.  I was there on business and wanted quiet, so we were put on the back side of the hotel per our request for quiet.  The Bellagio fountains view is a bit more costly, but the lights will keep you awake.  

The restaurant buffet was pretty good, with foods & stations from all over France.  A tip on the buffet, though, the counter girl, Martha, tried to get me to pay the tip up front, and this grandma has been around long enough to know that means terrible service.  I did have a problem with Martha shouting out in front of a line full (~20) of people, ""WHAT, NO TIP?""  I quietly responded, ""I had planned to leave it on the table in cash.""  My problem is that Martha VERY quietly muttered under her breath, ""Oh.""  So, she tried to bully me into leaving a tip for service which I had not even received yet.  On the other hand, the waitress was plenty attentive.  She might like to know that I tipped her 20% instead of 25% due to Martha's behavior and figuring Martha wouldn't have been so territorial and pushy if she didn't receive a portion of the tip.  All in all, the buffet that is toted as the best in Vegas was really nice despite Martha's inappropriate behavior.   While I realize they get plenty of free loaders and cheapskates in Vegas, this does not excuse her behavior.

The rooms were quite nice, clean, and tidy.  Very impressive!  Bring a good amount of $5 and $10 bills on your stay.  Leave them each day for the maids.  It's just good manners!  I cleaned houses in college, and the  maids, too, depend on their tips.  $5 for a single person & $10 for 2 or more.  Don't leave them all at the last day b\/c people and schedules & shifts change.  Leaving a large tip at the end may ensure that your maids never  receive a dime, and someone else that turns over the room gets it all.  When you leave something every day, you get better service, and the right person who preformed the job gets the money.  

The little breakfast\/ muffin shop is a great place to grab breakfast if you have to go to meetings.  

The check in was pretty smooth, easy, and people friendly.  I received  a small discount from going to their on line  website, although I did call and book in person.  The website offers much better deals than the random travel sites.  I would suggest trying to book airfare and then try to go through their website if you are planning on staying there.

It's a nice hotel & the beds are comfortable. I was surprised the work out room was a la carte, but you get so much walking in Vegas, what's the point of that? 

The concierge held our luggage for us as we walked the strip the last day.  I made the mistake of leaving $40 in my backpack, and it was not there when we returned.  I thought I should have taken it, and that is my bad.  As much as I have traveled, and that is extensively, you would think I would know better, but I will have to take responsibility for my forgetting.  Just know that if it is not attached to your body there, that it is gone.  No funny business, or trying to trick us, just plain old taken.

The elevators are pretty secure with cameras everywhere!  That's a big +.  All in all I will stay here again, because the people whom I did come in contact with were (mostly) sincere and willing to help. It is a big, BIG hotel and there are going to be some great employees, and some not so great ones.  Don't bring anything expensive, and if you do consider what it will be like to lose it. 

It's still a pretty great place to stay, and I will bring minimal to nothing that I want to lose.  Their beds are ultra comfortable!!!",0,0,0

For you Cliffs Notes folks (pros - great location and nice casino, cons - poor customer service, had to call every day to get maid service).

Here are more details on the pros and cons:

PROS
1.  As others have mentioned, great location
2.  Burgundy rooms are nice (ours was well appointed and clean)
3.  Casino is nice and clean and not too smoky compared to others
4.  Express check out process with the machines was quick and painless (checked out in under 3 minutes).  Just enter your room number, select whether you want your receipt e-mailed to you or printed out, drop off your keys, and you are done.

CONS
1.  Staff do not seem to care very much about customer service.  

1a.  Check-in desk staff.   Went to the check-in desk and mentioned that it was our anniversary and that we were hoping for a room overlooking the strip.  No response.  No ""congratulations"" or ""thank you for spending your anniversary with us.""  Figured we were there during an off period and in the middle of the week staying from a Sunday to Wednesday so our chances would be good, but we were told none of those rooms were available.

1b.  Wait staff at the buffet.  Went to the Paris buffet only one time.  We were seated in one of the side rooms with only one waitress for 6 tables of about 30 people.  We got one drink and then the waitress never came back to our table.  I asked the two tables next to us and none of them received any drinks or service after drink #1 either.  I went to ask the hostess for help.  To her credit, the hostess did get us drinks, but there was no report to management about the other tables with the same issues and no apology.  No one came over to check on the tables next to us.

1c.  JJ Boulangerie cafe.  Rude staff again.  Wife and I each wanted the $10 special of 2 pizza slices and one drink.  We told the woman that we wanted 2 of those specials for 4 pieces total.  My wife started her order, but never got to finish.  The woman looked down and grabbed various slices, started walking over to the carrryout counter and told us to order at the register.  We waited in line to reach the register to order and then the first woman came back with 4 pieces of pizza and insisted that we had ordered those slices.  We told her that we had not ordered because she had told us to go to the register to order, but she insisted we were wrong.  The first woman eventually walked away and everyone in line asked us what was happening so it definitely seemed odd.  Again, the woman at the register did not apologize or act like this outburst was weird.  We did not get into a big argument or anything, but it was definitely bizarre and seemed to keep in line with our poor customer service experience with every other part of the Paris hotel.

2.  Maid service was very slow.  We were there for 3 nights and had to call every single day to have maid service come to our room.  We were gone from about 10:00 - 10:30 a.m. to 4:00 - 4:30 p.m. every day so they definitely had enough time.

3.  No option for a late checkout.  Normal checkout time is 11:00 a.m.  We asked for one extra hour to check out at noon on a Wednesday and were told that option was not available.  Really?  On a Wednesday in November?",0,0,0

Restaurants are very good but get reservations wherever possible. Shops are fun and interesting. The Casino is fairly minimal but to a casual gambler it's fine, or just go to any of the nearby casinos. On arrival check to see if upgrades are available, ended up in a suite Le Mans for $159.00 per night. 

The rooms were very clean and very aesthetic. My girlfriend and I actually ended up just hanging out in the room at times because it was that nice. Very spacious and the bathroom was big enough to have an echo (exaggeration but you get the idea). 

The personnel we encountered were all friendly and helpful. 

Self Parking is waaaaay at the back of their property but its free so if you are budget-minded you can do that but it's a long walk with your luggage. In retrospect, it's probably worth it to most people to get valet parking unless you are on a very tight budget.",1,0,1

Checked into the hotel- The front desk was beyond rude. Took a look at the room- Horrible  (see pictures). Don't forget this is not a cheep place to stay. Stains on the floor, wallpaper falling off, just nasty. We had 3 rooms and all are just as bad. 
Then the fire alarm goes off and from what we were told this happens often. Let's stop for a moment and think about this. What if there was a true emergency? It goes off so often people just kept on doing their thing. Electricity goes off only on some floors and parts of the hotel.  Time to get out before we can't.   Here we are at 2:30 am and still no power in our room. My husband has a CPAP machine he must use. I call down and ask the front desk if we can be moved to a room with power so we can get some sleep. They tell us no rooms are available.  I call reservations , I can book a room with them. Hmmm. 
The next day construction starts. We get a note under our door that says ""if construction bothers you, please ask for another room"". We are told there are no more rooms.. 
Check out time and ask for a manager.  He could care less about our bad experience. 
The only positive thing about our stay, our amazing time with friends..

After careful consideration of all the options, we chose Paris as our destination for a day and night in Vegas. The price was moderate (not too high, but still reasonable)

Right off the bat, parking is free and the hotel is close to the middle of the strip. A very solid location. The Paris experience is fairly authentic. Not perfect, but a nice touch. From French-speaking clerks, to the food options, magazines in the rooms and, of course, the Eiffel Tower.

We stayed in a Red Room suite and it was beautiful. Not the highest end option, but based off of the reviews, much better than the basic rooms. I recommend paying a few extra bucks to get a room with a view of the tower. The back view isn't bad, but is a bit on the boring side. 

The pool area was huge and very clean. It took a while to find the hot tubs, as they were nestled in the back. It was nice, they were very quiet and situated directly under the Eiffel Tower. 

Overall, it was a great experience here. The only real downside was the walk from the parking garage to the hotel itself. It was a rather long and somewhat confusing maze to actually get back into the hotel. 

I would come back here and recommend this place for sure.",4,0,1

Compared to the Arias and Cosmopolitans, it's a bit outdated, but the location was ripe for venturing along the strip.  

Lodging - classier than staying in the Hooter hotel, but the room we were lodged in clearly missed the rounds of the recent renovations (not sure if that was because we booked on HotelTonight, because the photos they had of rooms on that app made the rooms look much more updated).

Atmosphere - I liked the Parisian theme.  Beware to the casual visitor, the place was teeming with wedding parties.  May have been a convention or something, but it was like the bride parade come Saturday.

In the summer of 1998 this was the sign that stood in a barren desert lot between the Old Aladdin and Bally's. Since this sign went up before Paris Hotel opened on September 1, 1999; I have been a fan. The thread that ties together the great attractions, restaurants, hotel, and public areas is the commendable job with the Paris theme. When I want to escape Bright Light City, I just step into our City of Lights. The Concorde does not bring me to this Paris; imagination does. As a tourist prior to September 2004 and local up to now, I have pages worth of memories in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. This includes two week long vacations here including in June when we stayed in room 1757.

   Without stepping foot inside the hotel, I feel like I am in the shadow of Paris. The hotel facade is an architectural marvel that conveys the feel of being in Paris. Towering over the hotel is a half scale Eiffel Tower. My favorite spot to view it is from the Bellagio dancing water fountains. Near the Eiffel Tower, Paris towers above Las Vegas soil with Montgolfier balloon Paris sign, Fontaine des Mers, Arc de Triophe, and a facade that resembles a Paris opera house and the Louvre. Inside, there is a world that will exceed the character limit I am permitted to write. With a limit in characters, this review focuses on why I am a fan of Paris.

   Just like the facade, every inch of the property from the chandeliers above hotel registration to the cobble stone casino walkways pays tribute to Paris creating an environment unlike any other. Unlike the typical dingy smoky casino, there is a painted sky above the floor. This creates an upbeat atmosphere. In this upbeat atmosphere I have drank, dined out, slept, and had the best of times.

  Paris offers nice eateries. Le Cafe has served me nice dinners in a faux Paris street cafe at competitive prices, Nearby JJ's Boulangerie serves the best raspberry napoleons I ever ate. Plus their coffee is good. Le Pizza has served me quick to eat pizza when pressed for time. The Buffet offers dishes that are hard to find outside of France.

  The nightlife is Vegas nightlife. Since 2009 I have been a regular at Napoleons to see Billy Krauss duel it out in Dueling Pianos. Prior to the live DJ, I used to enjoy the covers band that played in La Cabaret.

  I've seen top notch shows in Le Theatre. They include We Will Rock You, Jersey Boys, & Olivia Newton John.

   The hotel is a nice place to stay. Rates fluctuate. The rooms are comfortable and include a bathroom including shower & tub. The best part of staying here is Soliel pool. This is the resort rooftop pool under the Eiffel Tower. The pool around a Parisian garden is spacious with views of the Strip. 

  As a local, the FREE parking garage is nicely laid out. It is a straight drive up a ramp leading to different levels. As a local I appreciate that it is unnecessary to reach it from the Strip.

  Paris is proof that well done themed properties don't get old. They just age gracefully.",20,11,15

When we arrived to check in I asked if we might have adjoining rooms as I usually like to order coffee and continental breakfast that we can share before heading out for the day. No adjoining rooms were available but we were given two rooms near each other.  Thankfully, the check in person,Amber, suggested we NOT take the rooms with the Strip view as they tend to be ""noisier"". I noted in other reviews here that other Paris visitors were not so informed. When we arrived at our respective rooms, they each had 2 queen beds rather than the 1 king bed which I had requested. No big deal but it did make the room seem smaller. The furnishings are looking a bit worn from my last stay here 5 years ago and could use some ""freshening"". The overall appearance of the rooms was OK but the carpets did not appear to be vacuumed and I found small plastic tags and other ""evidence"" of previous occupants(thankfully,nothing gross). Although I did order ""Express Breakfast""(coffee and croissants) and Express coffee the next morning(both guaranteed delivery in 20 minutes), what were supposed to be $18 and $12 charges were actually $28.50 and $21.00 respectively, after taxes and additional fees. I guess it pays to read the fine print on EVERYTHING. My biggest gripe with ALL of Las Vegas is that I'm a non-smoker and there are very few casinos\/hotels that have sufficient air circulation to avoid the smoke. Some have awful ""fragrances"" which are added to the air systems which only masks the smoke and in many cases was actually worse than the smoke. Thankfully, Paris was NOT one of these. I would stay in Paris again although I found the $28.50 ""resort fee"" on top of the room charge to be a bit high considering it only allowed me to use Wi-fi on 2 devices, my phone and iPad. Any additional devices results in additional charges. The $85.50 resort fee I paid for my sister's room went entirely unused.",0,0,0

The Paris is a Disney version of Paris, after all it is Vegas. The Paris Masquerades as a fancier hotel than what it really is. I was given a room with a great view of Bellagio, the fountains and the Eiffel tower; which isn't bad for a comped room, I am hardly a ""High Roller"".  View aside the room is what you would find in a nicer but worn Holiday inn, or older Hilton. I have not seen the upgraded Red rooms so I cant speak to what they are like.  We had eaten at the buffet the first night out of convenience and after waiting in line for about 45 minutes we were seated. Later that evening I saw my food again, if you know what I mean!  That same night, after my stomach had recovered we went to the casino. We played slots for about an hour and no one came for cocktail service, which is unusual for a Caesar's property. I informed the food and beverage manager who was really nice and polite and she bought us a round in the bar to make up for the incident, they had been short servers. The Paris is connected to Bally's next door. The two have two totally different atmospheres; at Paris we saw a lot of Gray haired polo shirt wearing yuppy types whereas Bally's was a little more low-market with dancers in short shorts on some of the gaming tables.  I guess they are both so different to appeal to a greater number of customers, the Tequila bar at Bally's we found to be exceptional in service and had great drinks and a third of the price of the bar at Paris. 
       Some finer points of the two casinos are
           - its on the Monorail with a station at Bally's
           -they are Mid-strip and convenient
           - staff is very friendly
           -there is a small shopping mall at Bally's  with an Ichiban, 
             a Nathans and a 24 hour Sbarro in case you get hungry late

       Some not so nice points for us;
         - A lot of older business types
        - More strollers than you normally see in Vegas, infant clothing 
           shop in the Paris!
        -No nightclub or live music, there is a dueling piano bar which
           is nice but not really the same.

Also, Paris is located in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip, which is a GREAT location for tourists. Basically, you're right smack dab in the middle of the city and can choose to go either left or right from when you wake up to explore Las Vegas. No need to walk too far to get anywhere since we're in one of the best spots. 

But what's not so great about Paris? Their service. I don't know what reason, but every time we left the hotel, we'd come back to our un-made bedsheets, used towels, and empty shampoo\/conditioner bottles. It's like housekeeping didn't even do their job! We actually had to do their job for them and CALL the front desk every single day to request extra towels and shampoo\/conditioners. Then they'd take about 20-30 minutes to bring up our supplies, which really puts a damper on our vacation as we have to take vacation time out of our day to do the work they were supposed to do in the first place.

But it's okay, we left them a present. A giant heap of 15-20 used shower towels on the floor of the bathroom because somebody didn't clean them up when they were supposed to.

Otherwise, I'd still recommend this place to stay. Great location, great appearance, great atmosphere. Maybe we just weren't so lucky, but hopefully others will be.",1,2,1

Since we didn't get the room cleaned the second day, we called room service and asked for a couple of towels and shampoos; 5 minutes later someone knocked on the door with 4 towels and a HUGE bag of soap, shampoos and conditioners. Definitely what I like experiencing in hotels. 

Things to check out:

1)The Eiffel Towel replica is the best thing to look at at night.
2) Check out the crepes place in the hotel; their crepes are one of the best!
3) Buy on of those tour eiffel drinks or the big paris ball as a souvenir!

There is a rooftop nightclub under the Eiffel Tower, where it is built out of the roof. The music was so loud that things in our room were vibrating. We were on the 11th floor but the noise was incredible. No way to sleep.

I called the desk at 2:30am. The woman who answered was very nice until I complained about the noise. Then she stated..""Well, it's a nightclub!!"" Okay, and I am not trying to sleep in the nightclub, I am trying to sleep in my room.
She said it would be going until 4:00am. They must have received many complaints because they toned down the music about 30 minutes later.

I'm giving 2 stars instead of 3 stars, because the restaurants, slots, and availability of late night food at the Paris was great. Mona Ami Gabi is one of my favorite Vegas restaurants, the section of the hotel that connects the Paris to Bally's has late night pizza, and that was amazing. 

Chateau the club at the Paris, is worth stopping in since you can dance listen to music, and view the fountains at the Bellagio directly across the street.

The weather was mild, the days sunny, but we had to nix sitting out by the pool. I wouldn't recommend Paris if your looking for pool action. By no fault of there own, the Pool becomes completely shaded and chilly before the middle of the day because of newer buildings recently built around it. 

I stayed in a Luxury 2 Bed Queen room with a group for a couple days, and then a Premium Red Luxury room on the 29th floor directly facing the 'Eiffel Tower' the last couple of days. Views from both rooms were good. However the rooms simply were not as nice as they looked online. The Luxury Red was only a smidgen nicer then the regular Luxury room.

I was looking forward to staying at this hotel on a recent business trip with my wife.  I have always admired the outside structure and its natural ambiance that accompanied it.

Needless to say I was very let down.

This hotel is getting one star for the following reasons:
1.  The inside of the hotel felt very claustrophobic, low ceilings and narrow walking spaces were very confining.
2.  for the 5 days I was there the same room service tray was left in the hallway next to our room.  It started developing an odor which my wife and I called about, but they did nothing until the last day when they offered to give us credits\/new room upgrade.  So perturbed that we declined any of their concessions and asked just that the please just pick up the ""damn"" tray and we will be fine.
3.  The rooms were uncomfortable, tired looking, and very similar to a cheap room you would find at a motel 6.
4.  The location though great on the strip is not as conveniently located next to the Las Vegas Monorail as described.  You have to walk through the hotel, through the corridor that connects it to Bally's then through Ballys... its casino... restaurants....sports book... over the hill and through the woods and your there.  Though proximity is not their fault, advertising is.
5.  Staff was extremely rude, from front desk to room service attendants.

The casino and restaurant areas were nice but once we got up to our floor, the carpets and walls and door frames could have used some work. The room was fairly nice but once again not quite as nice and up to date as I would have liked. The bed was comfortable and the temperature was nice. The service was good too but I just would have liked to see a little more attention to detail. I really liked that the Paris is in a convenient location. It is located on a major road that got us where we need to go quickly, without having to drive on the strip. It is also right across from the bellagio so it is easy to go over and see the fountains or get anywhere else on the strip fairly quickly.",0,0,0

My group of friends stayed at Bally's regularly for several years, and when you're staying at Bally's to save money on rooms, you may as well walk next door to Paris to spend your time.  It's prettier and more professional.  The only tradeoff is that perhaps sometimes the table minimums are too high for your blood.  Also, the dining options are too conservative, and of course Paris doesn't really look like this, but all in all, it's a pleasant place to spend your time compared to many of the other area casinos.

This recent trip was my first time staying in the Paris hotel.  A friend negotiated a group rate for another friend's bachelor party.  The quality of the room is an expected upgrade over Bally's.  

The beds are very, very comfortable, and the curtains very effectively light-blocking, both of which are quite important when sleep is at such a premium on your average weekend in Vegas.  Other details include:

+ Large mini-fridge
+ Two phones (seems unnecessary)
+ A refrigerator-style light inside each of the chiffarobes

- Poor towels
- Poor water pressure
- Separate shower stall and bathtub (puzzling)
- Old-school tube TV
- No exhaust fan in the bathroom
- Too much noise from adjoining room through the connecting door",5,2,2

I didn't have the best interactions with the front desk however. I wanted to check in 20 minutes early and was told I'd get charged early check-in (I asked, thankfully). Then, even though I had our reservation that said check-in was at 3, the woman insisted it's at 4.

Thankfully, the manager was standing right there and let me in early. I was willing to wait however long it took. I wasn't going to give them any more money especially with the ridiculous resort fee tacked on.

Anyway, the room was pretty spacious, although I opened the center cabinet thinking that the TV would be there but nope, just a big mini-fridge. The channels were weird because the first five were Chinese-language channels, then Spanish-language channels.

The bathroom was quite spacious -- the best part. Big sink that allowed my roommate and I to each take a side of the counterspace. Separate shower and giant bathtub. Full-length mirror.

The housekeeping staff were extremely friendly. Every time I passed them in the hall, they would greet me hello.

1) room keys did not work two nights in a row

3) not a lot of late night eat options
4) my room could use serious upgrades!! Instead of a Paris feel it was feeling more like medieval times!!
5) the second night when the room key did not work we call front desk to help us unlock the door bc we had too many bags in our hands to go back down stairs they sent Rick the security guard to open the doors ! After room verification he receive some type of call on his walkie talking and out of no where he turn into an CSI agent telling us we had to go down stairs to the front desk their was an note on our acct. don't take anything out the room - that bother me because he stood in our room instead of waiting outside until I use the bathroom - he made us feel like we were criminals which was very distributing!

The waiting time was okay. I would have been happy to directly get my room card, but i guess that's just a must at the Paris. At least they had several counters opened.

After politely asking for it, we even got ourselfs a little ""upgrade"": A room on the 21st. floor with a great view of the pool, the eiffel tower and the strip, including the Bellaggio Fountains, that looked incredible from up there. In general the view was amazing, day and night.
The room was the cheapest they offered, called ""luxury""and i really can't complain: Everything was tidy, clean, smelled good. The style is kind of ""old french"", but completely what i expected and what suits the style of a paris-themed hotel. The Bathroom had a walk in shower and a bathtub, which was a bit too small to take a relaxing bath.

We didn't really try the food, except from that little bakery. One morning we had coffee and muffins and it was good and the price was vegas\/hotel like, but still ok.
A beer at the bar was about 6$ i think, which is pretty standard for a vegas hotel at the strip. Waiters were friendly and competent.

The style of the interieur of the hotel is pretty cool. It has a sky with clouds painted on the ceiling, street lights and old french houses that host the shops and restaurants.
the casino follows up that style and is nice too.
The only thing to criticize about the casino is the staff. While the waitresses are cool and offer you free drinks while playing, the roulette dealers (we tried our luck on 2 different roulette tables) were pretty annoying. Because we're not millionaires, we always bought chips for the minimum price of about 20$. Also, it was our first time playing roulette at a casino. Instead of being friendly or even explayning some of the special rules to us, the staff looked boring, checked their watches every few minutes and was not in the mood for talking or even smiling. That kind of ruined the gambling for us.

PROs:
+ Part of Harrah's, so its connected to Bally's and offers free shuttle rides to Caesars, Rio, and the other three casinos they own in Vegas but escape me at the moment.
+ Decent room
+ Themed, like an adult Disneyland - no detail overlooked
+ Affordable, fair price for what you get
+ Convenient to rest of strip.

CONs:
- No fridge in room. If you even touch anything in the minibar, it registers as a purchase, and good luck debating that with the front desk.  Trust me.
- The whole time we stayed there (several days), we never had hot water in our shower.  DISAPPOINTING!
- Whoever designed the floor in the main floor is on crack.  If you have an attractive woman with you (or if you are a woman) who happens to be wearing heels, they are going to need your help walking across it because it is like traversing rocks.  It is uneven.  Sure, their intent was to mimic a brick paved road of Europe or old west, but the result was a nightmare for the women in my entourage who were wearing heels. 

Overall I can't complain too much about the Paris.

The poker room is very small and near the sports desk, but the staff there is friendly and helpful.  They have Texas Hold'Em tournaments ($65 buy in usually) several times a day, which are good clean fun.  There are plenty of big screens to watch, but note that there are absolutely no cell phones allowed (you'll be escorted out for even texting).  The drink ladies stroll through fairly regularly.

Mixed results on the slots.

The Cafe was good, although busy, for breakfast.  We didn't eat there any other time of the day.

They have a decent pool.  It was easy to sneak into ;]  It's very sedate.  I wouldn't call it sceney at all.  Lots of Europeans.  The ""service"" from waitresses at the pool is great.  I ordered a mojito and water, and it was $25 though. And the mojito was not even average.  The pool itself is about 3' deep the entire way through and is nice and big.

Everyone raves about Mon Ami Gabi.  Since it's a restaurant that's from Chicago, I didn't have much desire to go.. but I'm sure it's good in Vegas too (and arguably better scenery if you sit outside).

Gambling is pretty typical here...  I didn't play this time around because the roulette tables were way beyond packed.  The whole place was just a little too crowded actually (relative to other comparable casinos).

I suspect there are a few French persons who are rude and they sort of gave the country that reputation. 


Paris Hotel - Gold medalist winner of the 2015\/ 2016 fine print award with a special award for perpetuating the message ""the French are rude. The Paris Hotel in Vegas conveys the message that  If you want to meet rude French people, now you no longer need to travel to France, you merely need to go to the Paris hotel in Las Vegas. 

First the Pros because to be fair something deserves a compliment. That goes to the restaurant on the Eiffel Tower. Awesome food, and the waiters are polite, helpful knowledgeable, all good. Even the guy who brings rolls, water and coffee refills was awesome, Eat there but do not stay there.

and now the Cons:  I hope we have enough space.
Rude Check-in. I genuinely thought the rude front desk person was joking around, with the rudeness, the insults and the like, I thought it was just part of the show. But I was wrong, she was rude, and she was not playing around. For a fee I was allowed to upgrade sounds nice right? but in the upgrade the hotel removed  1 of the beds. So two beds for the normal room become 1 bed in the ""upgrade""  Well that is not really an upgrade is it? Try and imagine sharing a bed with your grown children and spouse. Got the idea? I love my family but not to the point I want all 4 of us in a single bed.  Well the rude front desk person was clueless to the idea maybe I booked two beds in the first place for a reason.  She just could not get it through her head that maybe I did not want the upgrade if we had to jam all of us into 1 bed.

Ok enough about me.  Here is why YOU should not stay here.  the fine print.  The rate you think you are paying based upon their website is NOT what your credit card gets charged.  Let's expose these crooks shall we?

1) There is a resort fee.  What does resort fee mean?  it means use of that closed pool, closed because it is 35 degrees outside, Resort fee is for the use of the health club, you know the one, closed for upkeep during your stay, yeah that one, Resort fees by the way work out to about 18% to 22% of your bill,  

2) parking fee-  even if you do not use parking there mere fact that THEY have a garage means YOU get charged a parking fee. 

3) Early arrival fee- Check in before 2pm and you get charged $22 for the early check in. But guess which days the early check in applies?  come on, think, hint, it is not the obvious..... the fee is applied to ALL YOUR DAYS of your stay, so check in at 1:35 PM on day 1 and $22 a day is added to your bill. 

------========--------

The room itself was not too bad but I will give it 3 stars not the 4 stars the hotel websites claim,  the carpet is old, dark and gross, the furniture is chipped in places,  The wall paper is scratched.  These are not show stoppers but lets face it, the 4 stars is not valid, more like 3.

The bathroom though was okay,  very pretty marble, nice to have the shower apart from the tub, water pressure is weak but hey we are in a drought and they are doing their part.  the hottest level of hot water was warm but not hot, not bad, but if you want that soothing feel, not this shower, 

The hotel, like many hotels, under-stocks the soap, shampoo and towels so you end up calling down for more, and then you feel obligated to tip the poor SOB who at 6pm has to hike it up to our room with bathroom supplies.  

The mini fridge was a nice surprise though.

The shopping and the mall area is not bad, good crepe place, and a pretty walk about.  Like I said, okay to eat there just do not stay there.

======--------========
In conclusion:
Given the prices quoted will be understated from reality, I would suggest if considering the Paris hotel in Las Vegas, take the price you are quoted online, mark it up 35% or so, then take that newly calculated value, and compare it to 3 star hotel options in Vegas during your trip,  Then you are on equal par. 

And if you do stay there, and you see it is your turn to check in, avoid the woman who is about 50 years old, dark hair, about 5 foot 3 tall, and just looks ""French"" she will ruin your stay, unless of course you get off being treated rudely.

Paris was on our initial list of places we wanted to stay and we both regret that we didnt.

We had stayed at the Cosmopolitan for our first night, but moved over to the Paris for the Fri-Mon part of our stay since they offered a much better rate for Fri and Sat nights and comped our Sun night.  Despite this much better deal, I really wish we would've just paid the cash and stayed put at the Cosmo.

To be sure, Paris is one of the most identifiable places on the Strip with its half-scale replica of the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe.  I've never been to Paris, but I have to admit the faux Eiffel Tower still looks impressive.  The interior of the casino attempts to imitate the look of Paris in a Disney kind of way.  The casino floor has the requisite number and variety of table games, slots and video poker machines of all denominations.   Cocktail waitresses are decked out like Parisian gendarmerie.  There are multiple bars and restaurants scattered about the facility although none of the restaurants appealed to me compared to the other offerings available at other properties along the Strip or around Vegas.

The biggest fault I found with Paris was their rooms.  The bed in our room was stiff and unforgiving....easily one of the worst I've encountered in any of my stays in Vegas.  It certainly couldn't compare to some of the much better beds I've slept in at the Palms, Hard Rock, and most recently, the Cosmopolitan.  Unlike many Vegas properties, the Paris doesn't offer a HD flat-panel TV in their rooms.  While we didn't watch any TV in our room, it would've been more impressive if the Paris was more current in their furnishings and amenities.  Also, unlike the Cosmopolitan which offered free wi-fi, the Paris charged $15 per day for wi-fi.  At least the room was clean and quiet and the maid service did a good job.

Bottom line...while the Paris has only been open since 1999, it really hasn't made the jump successfully into the 21st Century.  However, if you're looking for a low-cost, no-frills place to crash in Vegas, the Paris will scratch that itch.  If you want something more, like a comfortable bed, then most definitely go somewhere else.",6,1,1

Paris and Bally's share the buffet; therefore, it is always a two hour wait.

It's not as smokey as other casinos, but it's not that easy to navigate around either. My boyfriend and I were constantly asking for directions and didn't receive the friendliest faces from the staff.

I honestly only came here because this is the closest I'll ever be to the real Eiffel Tower in Paris for a long time and was dying to get a view of Vegas from the top. We were lucky enough to have 2 for 1 coupon and only had to pay $11 for the two of us to get an elevator ride up the tower. Right before the elevator ride, we had our photo taken from two different angles. Both of the photos came out beautifully; we decided to buy one with the decorative border at the entrance (about $26). 

I can't emphasize enough how if you want the best view of Vegas, seeing it from the top of the Eiffel Tower is a MUST. I HIGHLY recommend going around sunset and watching the water show at the Bellagio while you're up there! It is truly a sightsee-er's dream watching the sunset, taking photos of the Bellagio's water show, and admiring the gorgeous Vegas night from above.

I've been to Vegas several times and stayed at different locations throughout the strip so I think I have a good idea about the quality of other hotel rooms. First off I give this place 5 stars just on location, right in the center of everything. I wasn't expecting much from the room since it was their ""least"" expensive option. I walked in and was pleasantly surprised. The room was cute and the bathroom had a large bathtub and separate shower. It also had a mini fridge which I always find convenient. 
However, whomever cleans this room must be a group of blind workers. The bathroom mirror had disgusting toothpaste splatter that could easily be taken off just by wiping! The sink faucet had the same marks...use a sponge! Then I was looking forward to a nap when I decided to fluff my pillows there was a giant makeup stain on one!

Great location, right in the middle of the action.
Lovely pool.
The pool deck staff and business center staff were enormously helpful.

Neutral:
The common areas are a Disneyworld version of a French village, all faux shopfronts, halls lined with fake trees and street lamps.  None of the glitz and elegance of the other Strip hotels.  Not by bag, but certainly .... not generic.

Cons:
-The people, excepting the pool staff and business center.  I went to the concierge three times, once for a dinner reservation, once for an airport shuttle, and once for tickets.  Each time I was given a phone number and told that they couldn't do anything else to help but provide the phone number.
-The bell desk lost my bag.
- There were at least 20 people in line for registration.  Three staff were checking in guests, but two more were just standing around watching the crowd.  Eventually one rolled her eyes dramatically and started helping as well.

Good on ya kitchen & staff. La Village was decent, albeit really busy (30+min wait). I stayed in a Red Room...which I prefer to their suites, which tend to be dated and tacky.  The Red Room was as expected: very comfortable king mattress,  soft linens, 42""-46"" flatscreen, and functional love seat and coffee table. The Red Rooms are on the top floors, so it is pretty quiet, minus the housekeeping carts and chatter. I wish I could comment on the gambling, but I took my action elsewhere because they kept screwing the pooch at every opportunity...please see below.

Now with the other 95% of my stay...the staff don't listen nor care. ""Do Not Disturb"" signs are meaningless to the housekeeping staff, as they'll bang on your door at various hours of the day and night even if you have a DND sign hung. If they can't reach you after banging on your door they call you room. I asked if they saw the DND sign, and they said yes... but it is company policy to call. I had a migraine the size of China, and they weren't helping.

A little while later I called down to the front desk and asked the manager (Eric) to please put a note on my account that I do not want to be disturbed, for any reason. He said he would ""take care of it,"" but housekeeping banged on my door and then called me again the next day. Today I decided to be proactive so I called to schedule housekeeping and make sure there was a note on my account saying ""DND"". They said yes...we will not call. Guess who got a phone call about 3 hours later, while dead asleep....?  I explained again that I did not want to be disturbed as I had a migraine and I just needed some peace and quiet.  That has to be the end, right? Less than 5 minutes later there is a BANGING on my door. I stumble out of bed and it is a guy cleaning my door. I point to the sign and he said, ""yes sir, yes sir. I am just cleaning your door."" BANG BANG BANG the door rebounds off of the door jam. I stopped him and asked him to leave. ""I am just cleaning your door."" BANG BANG BANG. I wish I was making this up. He just kept going, mumbling something I couldn't understand.

There was no hope of getting back to sleep, so migraine and all I walk down to the front desk to speak with the manager (Eric), again.  I waited 15 minutes for him to get there, and I swear it seems to get brighter and louder as each minute ticks by. He finally appears with a, ""What can I do for you sir?"" fake smile. He remembered me from the prior day, and he said that he made a note on the account, so he didn't know why I kept getting bothered. He said he would ""get this fixed."" again. He reassured me that he left a note, so if they didn't do it, he did not know why. He channeled his best Don Quixote and said he would ""get to the bottom of this"", and he asked for my phone # so he could triumphantly tell me how he would save the day. I left my cell phone # and he said he'd call me back after talking to the head of housekeeping.

Fifteen minutes later I get a call, but Don Quixote was not triumphant and the windmill still stood; color me shocked. Even he couldn't claim victory, so he started listing reasons why he couldn't slay the housekeeping dragon. The list included: ""I tried to reach the Head of Housekeeping, but (s)he is at the other property, so I don't know what happened.""  ""It is a different cleaning group, so they didn't know."" ""It is company policy to call the room if the guest cannot be reached about house cleaning.""  And on and on and on and on. 

I don't want excuses. I want you to fix it. I want you to be sincere. I want to try and enjoy what time I have left here. I do not want to hear what you would have done if the Head of Housekeeping was here. He finally said he was sorry about the hassle (carefully not accepting any blame himself, even though he failed to fix the problem the first time or the second time). As his grand gesture he offered a $100 dining credit.   Ruin my weekend for a $100 credit. I cannot leave here fast enough.

Wish I can give it 0 stars!!!
 
Checked in on a Friday 1\/30. Was given an extremely tired looking room #688. Was told the hotel was completely booked for Superbowl weekend and this room would have noise from the club. Didn't spend much time in the room but I wasn't alone. Awoke Sunday with small raised bumps on my chest. Didn't think much of it until I seen BEDBUGS everywhere! I took pictures and went straight down to the front desk to show them. I was greeted with a skeptical manager who told me he has heard it all before and that the room would have to be tested by a 3rd party. Basically he called me a liar and didn't care to see my pictures. He stated 90% of the time the rooms test negative for a situation like this. Was given an equally crappy room next door but was told they would try to give me a suite or something nice after the superbowl crowd left. I asked what to do with my clothes etc that surely were now harboring the bedbugs. Was told they cannot do anything for me until the test results came back. At this point Paris went radio silence and I was ostracized for the remainder of my trip. I finally had to go down to the front desk on Monday since nobody called me (like they said they would). The horror on the ladies face was all I needed to see. POSITIVE FOR BEDBUGS. At this point they handed me over to some crooked 3rd party insurance place called CCMSI who opened a claim. The hotel at this point did basically nothing. I asked about the nicer room they promised and was told that the ""RISK"" team would not allow me to change rooms basically because I was now crawling with bedbugs and they didn't want me spread to any other rooms. So not only did this ruin my trip but now I have to haggle with some 3rd party insurance who won't return phone calls or emails. I can understand that issues like this happen. The hotel could have owned it and handled it completely different where it didn't ruin my trip. Stay elsewhere!

My second stay here, but downhill from a stay 2 years ago.  Rooms are still ok, but starting to ware.

My biggest complaint this trip is that I signed up on the business package, which advertised, stay 2 days and get free admission to the spa.  I only wanted to use the treadmill in the exercise room, which you have to pay for here at the rate of $25 per day.  So I figured that they would give me 2 admissions for a 4-night stay.  Wrong.  At check-in they said I could argue my case with the spa manager.  And even though two people were staying in the room, only one could be admitted under that package.  The spa manager let us both in since we only wanted to use the exercise facility in the spa, but would not accommodate the second day since they are separate from the hotel.   She said I would need to go back and argue with the hotel.  Half of the treadmills and exercise bikes were out of order.

Back to the front desk where I pointed out that I could have booked 2 two day stays, checked out and checked in and gotten the two passes.  The clerk thought this was a good point.  I was kept standing at the desk for 15 minutes while the kibitzed and messed around and then decided that they would need to check with management and call my room with the results later.  The message on the phone when I returned was NO.  I was stunned given the current economy at the lack of caring for return customers.

The smoke in this hotel is much greater than what I have observed at others. Also, on this trip some very, very loud band with mega-base started to play on the strip outside the hotel at 1AM and it went on until 3AM on a Thursday night, though did not occur on the other 3 nights.

We were compted rooms, but always take the up grade for $55.00 to a strip view room.  This also includes entrance into the Concierge lounge on the 31st. floor for breakfast and afternoon appetizers.
I almost hate to give this away, but this lounge is a great thing.  The room is lovely and the atmosphere relaxing. The food is always fresh and plentiful,and you have a choice of many beverages, both alcoholic or not.But by far the best part is the concierge staff who work the lounge.  They are always friendly and so very helpful should you have any questions or requests.  They were able to print our boarding passes even before my first cup of morning coffee.

I checked in at noon (before their 4pm check-in time) and they were able to offer me a room. The luxury room is nice, neat, and normal. Not extravagant, but not old looking like tropicana\/excalibur. I really love the small lobby, you can't get lost, the elevators are close to everywhere, and there are two bars. I mean...if you need a larger casino, you can always just walk over to planet hollywood, which we did! It is also connected to bally's. All in all, a great moderately priced hotel with accommodating customer service. 

Mon Ami Gabi - I had a reservation and was seated no problem. Our waiter was not only good, but amazing. Very attentive, described everything on the menu without being pretentious, and left us alone when we were chatting. Food is so tasty, and has a unique selection. The portions are average to large. I left full after sharing two appetizers and a steak entrée. Unfortunately no room for dessert. 

Le cafe - We decided to go here for a midnight snack. Food was good. Service was NOT. We didn't see our waiter for 15 minutes...but on top of that, all the other waiters completely ignored us when we motioned to them. We finally order, took another 30 minutes to get food. So..for a quick midnight snack, took over 45 mins to get food. Our server disappeared somewhere, never refilled drinks (while tables sat next to us, came and left!) Cobb salad is huge and french onion soup is good. 

Valet - Quick for the most part, and better service than Mirage or Caesar's. 

Pool - We saw it, but in the over 100 degree weather, we did not venture to go in. Looked large and enjoyable since it was in the shade. Not decorated or secluded tanning areas, but it will do.  

I enjoyed this hotel BECAUSE it wasn't filled with the younger crowd and the atmosphere\/ceiling is bright. It's quaint. I'm in my 20s, but I'm one to avoid the crazy loud music in dark casinos tons of dancers. I highly recommend if you're like me and on a budget.

I was definitely right in thinking that the Paris is a pretty kid-friendly hotel. It's central location made it easy for us to explore the strip, and we were around some other nice hotels that had a good amount of activities to keep us entertained.

The pool ambiance was also a great balance between family friendly, while also fun for the adults. No complaints at all.

But my favorite thing about the Paris was our room. It was recently remodeled, which is always a huge plus. Beautifully decorated, too. The beds and pillows were so very comfy, I slept like a baby! And the bathroom was so clean that we even used the tub...We all enjoyed our room so much that we almost had to force ourselves to get out and enjoy the pool or have a meal at a nice restaurant!!

I'm giving the Paris 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons: 1) the casino area had a strong smoke smell and I've been to other Vegas hotels where people smoke in the casino but it doesn't smell bad and 2) because it's not a hotel that I would pick if I were going to Vegas for an adult getaway. It's excellent for families and was certainly ideal for our trip's purposes. But most people don't usually go to Vegas looking for quality family time and the Paris didn't strike me as the place where you can go wild. However, it's definitely a great place to stay and it's well worth the money spent.",3,0,1

Inside the place the reception desk is not in immediate proximity to front doors. Casino floor was regular nothing that differs from the 100 other casinos. 

I will give props to the shops and restaurant floor. Cobble stone with the blue sky ceilings and patio shops make it feel like like you're in Paris.

Unfortunately for us, we arrived late due to a delayed flight. Checking in took quite a while and we ended up having to stay in a smoking room the first night since they ran out of non-smoking rooms. However, the staff offered to send someone up to spray some air freshener around our room, which was quite entertaining. The air freshener didn't do a great job in covering up the smell however. 

When we got back to our hotel later at night, we asked the front desk to send up some ""o-zone"" machine that they had offered. Though the machine was loud, it definitely helped us breath a little better that night. Unfortunately, our clothes still had a lingering smell thanks to the cigarette smoke from the past hotel guests.

Then, around 7AM the next day, our sleep was disturbed as a hotel staff member knocked on our door then called us to get the machine back. No bueno!

We ended up getting a room change around 10AM, which was also offered at check-in. We got a room on the 10th floor with a beautiful view of the Eiffel tower and our stay became much more pleasant since it was a non-smoking floor.

Location was fantastic since we were at the center of the strip. Catching a taxi to go down the strip in either direction only cost about $10-$15 each way.

The pool was a great relaxing experience. After you flash your room key to the staff at the pool entrance, they give you a towel so you don't need to worry about bringing your own. There was music playing while we lazied around. We were at the pool at around 4PM and most of the pool was covered in shade from the Eiffel tower, so the water was slightly cold. Otherwise, great spot to lounge around!

On day of check out, we utilized their luggage assistance while we had to check-out early in the morning but weren't leaving until later in the night. Everything went well.

The gentleman courteous and efficient but no mention of add on costs of the resort fees.
The room clean, and comfortable but lousy view but since here on business, no problem. 
Within a few minutes of entering the room, a knock and before I could answer the help entered the room to ask if I had everything I needed. A bit odd practice but ok, that's why the notes to secure the door! Noted!!
Plenty of restaurant choices, but check the menus and reviews, it may not be as it appears. 
Gift shops, the usual chotske things, cheap. 
Looong walk to the monorail, but the monorail was a great way to get from the hotel to the convention center, just know it's a bit of a hike and a comfortable air conditioned way to get some exercise in.
The biggest disappointment, was the added on resort fees, should have been asked at the beginning of my stay not tacked on at the end. The lady who told me this charged my card while I was checking to see if this had been added as part of the reservation, before I could say yes, she handed me my receipt. When I told her that she didn't even wait, she went right into ""Have a great rest of your day"" This attitude and condescending attitude in itself will result in our staying elsewhere on our next visit and my overall 3 star review.  
My first visit to LV in many years, it's expensive, do your homework, read the reviews, then you won't be disappointed.",1,1,1

The halls in the hotel were just scary.  I felt like I was in the movie The Shining.

I got a free suite, the suite le mans, with views of the strip and the eiffel tower.  The room is huge, but the decor left a bad taste in my mouth.  The couches, curtains, and bed sheets were all colorful and flowery, the wallpaper was striped, it made me dizzy.  Not to mention the dirty stains you'd see here and there.  I was almost scared to find something super nasty crawling in my bed.

It had a sitting area where you could work on business-related things and a closet directly behind.  The bathroom was huge.  Obviously made for two people, with side-by-side sinks.  It had a huge tub which I unfortunately never used, and a shower.  The sinks were looking alittle dated.  Whenever I turned on the hot and\/or cold water, the faucets would start leaking water. The drain in the sink needed to be unclogged because the water in the sink would just start filling up.  ICK!!

I've never bothered walking around this place to actually peruse and shop. I'll just go straight to their bar to buy the gynormous plastic eiffel tower and fill it with strawberry daiquiri and scoot my butt on out to go to the better hotels down the ways.

It's a good thing I didn't have to pay to stay here.  I don't think I'd ever shell out money to stay at this hotel.  Totally not worth it no matter how cheap their prices are!",2,1,1

I have stayed at a LOT of hotels in Vegas...and so far, I think I like it better than all of them - The Luxor, New York, New York, The Mirage, TI...the list goes on. 

First off, the hotel is beautiful! I was truly surprised because I thought that the quality wasn't going to be that great since we got such a good deal on the room at only $150 a night. The hotel reminds me of the Venetian - but with a French theme. We got a room with 2 queen beds on the 10th floor and the room was perfect for our needs. It wasn't overwhelmingly big but had a wonderful bathroom with a shower and a separate tub, a great view, cute decor, and very clean. 

The restaurant strip mimicked the streets of Paris with lots of cafes and restaurants scattered all over. My favorite is Mon Ami Gabi...but they've got some other great places like the Crepe stand and Le Provencal. 

My favorite thing about this hotel was the pool. Because it was 110+ degrees outside, we ended up renting a villa by the pool. They are these fabulous air conditioned houses with an outdoor patio, a flat screen TV, a stereo system, a table and couch, and they are packed with snacks, water, juice, soda, water rafts, etc. My friends and I alternated between tanning on the patio and hopping in the pool which was the perfect temperature. Incredibly attentive service by the pool and decent food - the salads are great and refreshing.

I had such a wonderful experience here - my only criticism is how crowded the place was which made it difficult to eat here but eat early or late, make reservations and you will be fine.

I would highly recommend this hotel as a good place to stay if you want a great, central location and a clean, fun hotel.",0,0,0

One of the worst hotels on the strip - and I mean that because I have stayed at many (from the Tropicana to the Venetian baby). Every time I come to Vegas, which is fairly often, I like to try some place new. I've been wanting to stay at Paris for awhile, but every other time I have come, the rooms have been too bloody expensive. Surely for the price they were charging I was going to have an extra-ordinary experience? WRONG! This time I'm on the company bill, so now the room fits into the per diem. And its not even the room that's the problem, although I'm sure as hell glad that I didn't stay here when it was $200+ a night. I would have felt TOTALLY ripped off. Its everything else about the hotel that blows. NOOOO breakfast options. As another Yelper said, when you're looking for that hangover cure, you sure as hell better look somewhere else other than Paris because there is nothing here other than a Boulangerie with a bunch of crappy pastries. I paid $18.75 for a fruit salad, croissant and coffee. That says something right there. The casino is minuscule and very uninspiring.The slot selection is ridiculous. And lastly, I ordered room service and the pizza I was served had to have been one of the worst I'd ever eaten in my life. The only reason why I continued to eat it is because it cost $17 and who could let that go to waste? I give Paris 2 stars because 1, the rooms aren't terrible and 2, its connected to the monorail which makes it convenient to the Convention Center. Other than that, I'm sure you'd have a better time at Circus Circus rather than here",1,0,0

We've stayed here at least four times and this last visit has me a little concerned.  After checking in we made our way to the room.  I took note that there was a tray of room service on the hall floor several rooms down from us.  Guess what?  Still there at 11:00am the following day.  Gross.

We intended to spend a lot of time at the pool to, hopefully, stay away from the urge to gamble.  Not impressed with the pool.  Half of the lounge chairs were broken.  Lukcily we got there early and were able to search around for those that weren't.  Even the chairs that were operational we filthy...literarally moving them around left us with blackened hands and clothing.

I was fortunately enough to stay in one of their lovely suites here at the Paris recently.  In terms of the overall experience, it was fantastic from beginning to end.  The room was very large for a suite - with a large living room\/dining area, small bar area with a sink, two bathrooms (one for the shower and sink, another for the hot tub and dual sinks and bidet), and a huge bedroom with a kind sized bed.  The view was also lovely - it was directly facing the faux-Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio fountains.  We were able to get a terrific view of the water show which was a real treat at night.

In terms of the room comfort - the bed was absolutely the best part of the experience.  The sheets were soft, the mattress was perfectly comfy (yet firm), and the pillows were just right.  I slept so incredibly well on this trip, which really helped me get some much needed rest before all the nighttime drinking festivities.  

The shower was good and the hot tub worked fine.  The living area was well appointed with faux-period furniture.  The room was nice and cool and we were very glad the air conditioning worked well (with minimal noise) in the middle of the Vegas summer.  I can't stress how important it is to keep the room cool when it was 110 degrees outside.

Speaking of heat - it was a perfect time to take a dip in the pool.  The area was quiet, which was excellent compared to some of the noisier pools in other hotels.  It was also huge, but not too deep - which is good for families.  Given the angle of the hotel, it was difficult to find any shade after 12pm noon in the summer, so it got extremely hot by midday, but if you go early in the morning (like we did) you can easily score a good spot by the pool with minimal risk of overexposure to the sun.

The casino itself is fine - though the minimums here are higher than many of the other Harrah's\/Caesars themed hotels in the area.  If you're looking to gamble, expect to spend the same as what you would with Caesars versus other related properties like Harrah's, Flamingo and the Quad (soon to be renamed the LINQ).

As for food - MonAmiGabi is a nice choice if you're looking to score a decent meal with great outdoor seating facing the Bellagio fountains.  The food there was good, and I enjoyed dining there for breakfast.  The other restaurants and cafes were generally very crowded, aside from the new Gordon Ramsay steakhouse.  In terms of the buffet - Le Village Buffet is a decent choice and one of the better ones among mid-tier buffets in the area.  Obviously you won't get something as good as the Bucchanal buffet at Caesars, The Buffet at Wynn or Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan - but for what you pay for it's an ok choice for any meal of the day.

I've stayed at the suites at the Wynn and Caesars as well - and I didn't find the experience at Paris to be inferior to the hotels listed above.  Our room was always tended to quickly and the complimentary truffles and wine (of decent quality, I might add) was a nice bonus.  

If you're looking to go all out - this isn't a bad choice to consider.",18,7,8

After sitting on the floor and waiting for 45mins (after 4 hours of travel we were exhausted), the security finally came. He asked me to show my ID and I did but he said the room is not under my name so whoever booked the room has to show his ID. I called my dad but he wasn't feeling well and was taking a nap. I told the security that but he didn't seem to care. So I asked my mom to come and bring my dad's ID. But the security refused to open the door unless my dad himself came.

Right when you drive up, you're greeted by the Arc de Triumphe and the Eiffel Tower. After you enter, you see the casino floor and check in is to the right. The check in lobby is amazing! Large oil paintings, big chandeliers, brightly lit and marble floors. It certainly gives off the style of French royal opulence. The casino floor is pretty small but enough to satisfy all your gambling needs. BlackJack tables go from $10-$25 minimums. I love the interior decor. The painted blue ceiling tricks you to thinking it's outdoors during the day. The decor and style are all based on the French culture. They have a Cafe right beside the elevators that has the most amazing smoked salmon sandwich and great coffee! Their other restaurants aren't bad. But the buffet line is always super long. I think it's pretty cheap, $15\/meal.

Their pool is huge. Poolside happy hour includes half price drinks! Like $5 frozen mojitos and other delicious cocktails. Look up and see the vast span of the hotel building and look behind you to see the Eiffel Tower towering over you.

There was no patch or outside area for dogs to go to the bathroom on our floor. They have a designated area for dogs but it's small and hidden by construction. It was really hot so sometimes my dogs didn't want do their business because their paws would burn on the artificial grass. The area was on the bottom floor so we had to walk through the casino a bunch of times and it's hard to carry them across the entire casino sometimes. I'm allergic to the smell of cigar and cigarette smokes, so that was not fun to walk through every time. I have never been to Vegas and was afraid to go because of all the smoking. But my friends reassured me it has gotten better. But when I went it was still pretty bad. It was worse when we went because it was so hot and humid that the smell rises and makes it 100 times more unbearable.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed Paris Las Vegas.  From the time it opened, I have been impressed with its faux Parisian décor.  Being a Francophile, this was a place that made me smile and think of the real thing!

As for a casino, it's OK.  What I like more is walking the cobblestone walkway from the parking garage entrance.  Looking at the restaurants, Napoleon's Lounge, and the long lines at the buffet are people watching at its best.

The main bar on the casino floor has been redone.  The Eiffel Tower ride is something to do once or twice--night and day-- and there is a special price for Nevada residents.

My husband and I stayed in the Red Room (Room 2623 on the 26th floor). The room was beautiful with a very romantic feel, king size bed, tub and walk-in shower, with a spectacular view overlooking the Eiffel Tower, pool, Las Vegas strip, and Bellagio fountains. We stayed 5 days\/4 nights. Didn't spend a lot of time in the room, but having a fridge and coffee maker helped! Also, we walked to the CVS and bought drinks, snacks, etc. The hotel and casino floor has an awesome Paris feel with unique french décor, shops, and restaurants! The casino isn't huge, but it has a nice vibe! We really enjoyed playing slots! And of course they have all the other casino tables if you enjoy poker, roulette, etc. There's a walkway connecting Paris to Bally's with shops, restaurants, etc. We ate at Burger Brasserie (sports bar) ... delicious burgers and salads! And I loved that they offered gluten-free buns! Also, if you're looking for new sunglasses or glass cleaner, go see Chris at Optica! (Actually, all 3 associates we spoke to were very friendly and helpful! Just can't remember all their names.)

Thank you Paris Hotel & Casino for an exceptional experience!!! 

Additional info: *We arrived at the airport late (11p.m.) and took the Bell Trans Shuttle ($8 per person) to Paris. No wait for shuttle, however, the shuttle made many stops for drop-offs, so if you're in a rush you'll need to take a cab. 

*We checked-in online so all we had to do was show id's and pick-up room keys upon arriving at the hotel! Self check-out was great upon leaving too! No wait, no hassle!

*BEWARE!!! If your first visit to Vegas be prepared to walk a lot! Make sure you have very comfortable shoes! We walked 32.18 miles in the 5 days we were there! This was even after using many Ubers for longer distance trips, Double Decker Hop-on Hop-off Tour Bus, and Grand Canyon Tour Bus. (After 1 day I had blisters on both feet and on our last day, both of my feet swelled up like a balloon and it took about a full day for them to go down after we arrived home.)

The tv in the room was from 1964. What hotel holds big box tvs anymore. Even the holiday inn have flat screens. There was loud music at night coming from the casino that we could hear from the 20th floor. When I called the front desk the receptionist advised the noise was coming from across the street and there was nothing they could do about it. Even though I would stand by the Window and could tell the sounds were coming from below. The receptionist even advised that she was getting calls from the 32nd floor in regards to the music noise. The receptionist did not seem to care that the music was being a disturbance. There was no security to check our room keys in the lobby area so basically anyone could access the elevators to the rooms in the hotel at night which is very dangerous. I've stayed at many hotels on the strip and usually there is security to check your room keys. This hotel was a huge disappointment. Major renovations are needed.

-I got the $75-ish room, and the thing I had to keep in mind is it's just that: $75 room. I think it's helpful to keep that in mind because it's easy to get caught up and expect\/want more. It's a really good French themed room (especially for that price), just not the out of this world AMAZING you might want to hope for. So keeping that in mind helped me appreciate it a lot more since I don't think you can get a better room for that much money, least of all on the strip at one of the themed\/big name hotels like Paris. The only complaint I could find about my room is the drain in the bath tub had some rust around it, but that's it.

-Overall it seemed like Chucky Cheese's for adults, which was pretty fun I thought and it was fun to walk around and play along with that imagining you're in Paris, and even thinking about France and their culture, funny as that sounds.

-Food-wise, watch out. I don't drink or gamble or have any other vices to blow my money on, so I thought it would be somewhat safe to indulge in being a ""glutton"" and just trying that aspect of things and seeing what all they had to offer since it's based on France and France is known for having great cuisine so I wanted to see how good it was and if that would be the case with this hotel\/casino. Anyway, I still ended up blowing a ton of money by just doing that and I didn't even try that much and really it was only at the little café shops they had where the food was kinda mediocre (but still pretty spendy, especially if you have every meal\/snack there). 

-Going to the top of the Eiffel Tower was pretty neat. I'd recommend that. 

-The view from my room on the 5th floor was pretty nice. It was of the Eiffel tower and the pool below and it was nice to look at and see.

-The pool looked pretty nice and not too crowded from looking out the window in my room, but I didn't really get a chance to try it since I only stayed over night and it just didn't work out that way unfortunately.

-The shops, meh, nothing to write home about. I still got suckered into buying a Madeleine book for my niece though.

-I liked that I could park my own car and could access it whenever I wanted since I needed to do that and come and go whenever I pleased.

The hotel is undergoing a $400MM renovation project to compete with the other newer and upgraded casinos and hotels.  Personally, I would wait until the renovation is completed before you stay at the hotel.   

During the weekdays (certainly not to lose money on their weekend travellers), construction is ongoing as early as 7AM with the drilling and the pounding.   I hope you are not light sleepers!!   Water can be turned off from 10:30A-3:30P as part of the construction project.  Hope you are early risers!   You see an increase in the number of employees all use the casino bathrooms during these hours which I never ever saw under normal circumstances.  They do have a lot of water issues as I see water damage in the hallway near the baseboard where the bathrooms are located.  The carpeting in my room was also loose and no longer tight.  

The employees do the best they can to accommodate and\/or overlook the issues.  You really don't know about them until you've checked-in and you read all the notices in your room.  Most of the construction, as I understand, take place above the 22nd floor.

I enjoyed my stay very much, ate breakfast every morning at Cafe Belle. Best coffee, quiche,  cheese plate and cheesecake. Close to The Flamingo where we walked to for one of the shows.

When you've never gone to vegas... somehow, you have this gut feeling it's not gonna go all according to plan as it originally should. I'm finally free of my Vegas virginity (no I did not have a shotgun eloping wedding hungover with a Asian Stripper chick from Sapphire). But I did end up staying here with some good friends of mine for a birthday celebration and some other ""Vegas"" oriented type of activities.

We rented out two rooms (at least to my knowledge) in terms of the pricing the break down was Six to a room (with $60 for 2 nights making it a grand total for $720.00 for both rooms not including tip). The rooms were clean and well kept. See through shower, clean mirrors, and a gangload of Asian TV channels to keep all the guests happy (but no Korean ones surprisingly as Jayne L. mentioned).

Amenities were close to what I expected as standard for most hotels. The pool is spacious but limited in depth (only 3 and half ft. deep). I guess its to prevent the drunks from drowning more effectively, considering you can bring drinks to the pool area or drink them as you wade in the pool. Purchasing a drink w\/ the Paris Water Bottle as a souvenir $22.00 with tax (ordered the Jack Daniel's Lemonade).

Since I did a few rounds of Gambling getting a taste of nearly everything (Poker, Wheel of Fortune, Roulette, Blackjack) at least to my recollection. Didn't win anything and loss a few bucks but nothing great to lose a mortgage payment for a house over.

Overall, it's nice to finally to have visited and tasted sin city. Even though I didn't commit enough sins to consider myself qualified for a confessional. I even have a photo souvenir (my current profile picture) Cheers!",6,5,7

So when we were asked if we like help with our bags we said YES well needless to say we got no help with them at all. Then we got all checked in. Well We had no hot water at all... i mean none... So the first night i was thinking ok maybe it will be fixed well the  night 2 still no hot water at all again when we called the front desk some one was sent up.  he could not do anything about it. well he told them we needed a room change. So later on around 945 we got a call saying if we really wanted to be moved to call but they really didnt have anything tell the next day. So come the next day we got the run around. telling us we needed to get out bag and bring them down to changes room but we would not have a room tell 1 and if we are not back by 6 we mite not have a room.... WTF dose that mean? Then the bell boy asked what happened and was like i don think they told u that!!! WTF i could not make that up if i want to. Needless to say ho one was nice no one was helpful the one nice people where the 3 young men working the bar closer to the lobby and the guy who came to try to fix our water issue. but other then that every one was rude!

We had reserved a room with a King bed.  We have a queen at home, so always like getting a bigger bed when we are away.  No line to check in, which was good.  Now the bad

we get to the room, the mattress has clearly seen better days, sagging in the middle, I sit on it and you can hear the springs, and they are shot.  that mattress should have been replaced quite awhile ago.  Go into the bathroom, the hot water is barely lukewarm.

Downstairs we schlepp and explain the situation.  Front desk staff was very nice, but unfortunately no more king beds available will be take 2 queens and an upgraded view?  What are we supposed to say, we weren't given any other options.

We get to the room, mattress is better and I check the hot water, bingo, much better. 

Throughout the weekend I just kept noticing small things.  Torn wallpaper in the bathroom, lots of chipped paint on the vanity.  Window was filthy, so was the TV remote.  Bathroom mirror coming away from the wall.  Control panels in the elevator need to be tended to, faded print on the buttons. Also several splatters on the wallpaper up high, that looked like they could have been scrubbed off.

Comes time to go to sleep, wow, you can hear the music from the nightclub!  Wow!  Not an upgrade, I consider this a downgrade.

Trying to get coffee and pastries in the morning was unpleasant, huge line out the door, that needs to be better organized.  Second morning, I notice an Express coffee place by the restaurant Ilse St. Louis.  Turns out after we check out receipts, the croissants are a dollar more and the coffee was more too!  Same coffee, same croissants, I guess u pay extra for their disorganization.

I'd consider staying here again if it were no more than $100 a night.",1,0,0

As with other hotels on the strip, everything there is expensive.  Went to one of the small bakeries, got a few pastures, some coffee, and juice, and the bill was over $40.

To be honest, I don't have a huge problem with the prices... It's on the Vegas strip, it's a huge touristy hotel, and there is a lot to look at there.

The reason for the 1 star rating is service and safety... Safety being the bigger issue, but will start with service.  We checked in online to ""save time"".  The process is supposed to help you skip the long check in lines and just pick up your hotel key at the ""Key Pickup"" desk.  We waited in line at the Hotel Key desk for over 20 minutes while we people go all the way through the long check in line and leave.  Finally we left the key-pickup line and jumped into the regular check-in line.  We waited about 10 more minutes in the check in line and still got out key while the ""Key Pickup"" desk was still helping the same guest.  At the VERY least, the person at the key-pick up desk could have acknowledged us and apologized for the wait.  Very frustrating.

Our bigger gripe was safety.  At about 12:15am, our elderly parents in the next room got a knock at their door saying it was room service.   Mom said ""we didn't not order room service."" and peeked through the peep hole to notice it was two plain clothed men.  The men shouted at mom to open up the door demanding that she let them in.  Mom called hotel security who said they would look into it.  The men eventually left, but no phone call or follow up from the hotel.  The next morning, we went to the front desk to ask them if they caught the people trying to break into the room and why they never called back to check on our parents.  The hotel manager said they just chalked it up to someone mistakenly going to the wrong room and weren't concerned about it.  We explained again that the men were posing as room service and demanding to enter the room, and arguing with our mom.  This was very deliberate and no mistaken room number.  The manager was still very nonchalant  about it and said it's not their policy to inspect those things, as long as no one physically entered the room.  I explained that my mom had the presence of mind to not open the door and look trough the peephole, but what if these men robbed another guest or worse?  Weren't they concerned about it!?!?  .... Not at all.  The manager expressed zero concern and basically laughed us off.

This last comment may be just me being nit picky, but the manager who came (eventually after a long wait) to talk to us had large ear gauges in both ears... Not really a professional look for a manager of such a large prestigious hotel.",10,2,4

We arrived at the Paris and on check-in was told there were no rooms with King beds, which we had requested months in advance. ""Paris does not guarantee rooms, but you can pay extra to guarantee a room"". No big deal, but when we asked if they could check again to make sure there were no King beds, we were told ""Umm, I wouldn't lie to you"" with attitude. Ok, again, no big deal (but I thought this was the service industry and Vegas isn't exactly in the best of times right now, so don't they want my future business?). 

When we got to our room, it was clean but not in the best shape - the carpet had stains, dirty\/ratty wallpaper and dated furniture. Outside, there were holes in the hallway walls as well as the elevator. Definitely below what we expected for the price (compared to the other hotels we had stayed at).

Went to take a shower, no hot water (we let the water run for a good 15 minutes). Called the front desk and was told they would send engineering up, but again, very rude front desk. Never had the problem fixed, so switched rooms.

Second room had hot water, but the TV was broken. No way to access the movie\/music menu. No big deal since I only watch ESPN. 

On check out I saw I was charged $10 for movie or music I had ordered. I called to explain that this was impossible since I couldn't even get to the movie\/music menu since the TV was broken. This is the conversation I had:

""Sir, you must have ordered it, the TV doesn't just do this by itself.""
""But I just told you the TV was...""
""Sir, don't cut me off.""
""OK.""
""If the TV was broken you should have called somebody, this is YOUR fault.""
""I just told you, I only watch ESPN so it wasn't a really a problem for me so I didn't call.""
""So it's YOUR fault. Next time you should call.""
""OK. Next time the movie button doesn't work on my TV I will call. Are you going to credit me the $10?""
""No. I just told you it's your fault.""
""Can I talk to someone else.""
""No you can't. This is what I do, you can't talk to anyone else.""
""Can I have your name?""
""No you cannot.""

Then she gave me her name as ""Barbara"" and then put me on hold and never picked up. 

I called back and they put me in touch with an assistant manager who said there was no ""Barbara"" who worked there - So Paris has front desk employees who aren't helpful, are rude and they lie. (On a side note, the assistant manager and operator were nice and helpful).

So bottom line, I will never be staying here or gambling here again. It's just a poor value, there are much better values to be had elsewhere on the Strip. And if the management can't get their front desk and staff to be polite to people (by the way, politeness and honesty are FREE) they don't deserve to be in the service industry.",2,1,1

Check-in lines were shorter than most of the other hotels we've stayed at in the past. We had to visit the check-in counter twice. The first employee had the personality of a potato sack and was not helpful, but the second was friendly and helpful. Paris also has self-serve kiosks for check-in and check-out. We used the kiosk for check-out and found it to be very simple. 

The room as mentioned, was clean and had plenty of space. It appeared that the room had been renovated recently. The bed was comfortable and we didn't have a lot of noise from rooms around us. The room included a basic coffee maker and an empty refrigerator versus a minibar. I'm always a happy camper when I can make my coffee first thing in the morning without wandering the entire property. 

There are a couple of lesser known shows on property. We saw Anthony Cools during our stay and thought it was a pretty funny show. There are several restaurants on property, Mon Ami Gabi is a great casual restaurant for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. We weren't wowed with Le Café Ile St. Louis. A huge assortment of desserts can be found at Café Belle Madeleine. Le Central is a nice spot to grab a drink in the middle of the action. 

The Paris has a pretty central location on The Strip and would be a nice spot to be for exploring in both directions. The self-parking garage is a hike from the check-in desk, but most this is the case for most Strip hotels. My only real gripe about Paris is the resort fee, coming in at around $37. This is more than we paid at places like Bellagio and Venetian (notably more impressive). The Paris needs to know their place with this one and decrease that to a fee that matches their property.",9,0,0

Positives: The location, it's walking distance to all the main hotels on the strip, The lobby is really pretty- you really feel like you might be in a nice area of Paris. Their buffet is great. Large selection of food and everything is delicious.

Negatives: The rooms, both times I went were broken down. The lamp shades were broken, the room felt kind dirty and stuffy. Even though the lobby is very pretty there is VERY little to do at the hotel. Not very many shops or restaurants in the lobby to keep you entertained.

She said I looked like I would love France and that I was probably an elitist.  I'm no elitist, nor am I a francophile, but the fact that I use those words might point to the fact that I a bit of a culture snob.

In spite of that, I have a special place in my heart for the tackiest place on earth, Las Vegas.  And when I go to Las Vegas, I absolutely must go to Paris.  Now I don't gamble.  I hate smoke.  I like drinking in groups, not from the tray of a waitress while I'm trying to roll a seven at the crap table.  And yet I love Paris because of the things that don't involve the casino.

On a sunny day, there's nothing more fun than sitting out at Mon Ami Gabi, the restaurant that is street level on the strip side.  You get the best view of the Bellagio water fountain show that isn't from a Bellagio hotel room.

Le Village Buffet is one of my favorite buffets in town.  It's not the biggest or the best, but the price is mid-range, the food is good, and it's clean.

JJ's Boulangerie is the place where my diet dies.  They have somehing called a caramel choux, which is pastry made of the same bread that they use for cream puffs, filled with vanilla custard, and a hard, clear caramel top.  I once bought that with a banana tart, which is a regular tart shell filled with a thick chocolate filling and topped with caramelized banana chunks.  I got them to go early one morning, returned to my room in the hotel, and my Dad watched me sit down to two desserts for breakfast.  My dad looked worried and said, ""I don't want you to get offended, but diabetes runs in my family.""  I almost cried because I knew that was my Dad's way of saying I love you.  ""I get it Dad.  Thanks, I'll be more careful.""  Then I finished off my desserts because hey, it's Las Vegas.  You're supposed to indulge.

Finally, I loved visiting the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  I went during the day, before they were open. The maitre d' saw me and before I could flee (I hate making people go out of their way) he called me in.  He then took me on a tour of the restaurant, told me the best time to come to watch the for sunset, and said he'd save me the table with the best view of the Bellagio fountains.  He was unbelievably nice.  I went later that year and they started giving tours to tourists, showing us the dining room, the kitchen and letting us check out the view.  My family seemed really impressed that they'd go out of their way.

As for the casino, I like the outdoorsy theme, which is rare for a casino.  Definitely one of my faves.",0,0,0

The only bad thing is that this is one of the casinos with the toughest entrance if you are driving or taking a cab during weekend evenings.

We have been to Vegas multiple times together and have always loved the Paris' beautiful casino and accompanying shopping areas, which boast cobblestone streets and charming Parisian store front restaurants and cafes.  This is an awesome hotel, but deserves only three stars for a couple of reasons. 

1) The hotel pool is disappointing for a center-strip Las Vegas hotel.  It has all the excess and ornate appeal of a Holiday Inn.  Beyond that, the hotel bar goes light on the liquor in mixed drinks but heavy on the prices ($7 for a 12-oz can of Bud Light; 13.50 for a Miami Vice with a 1 oz. shot of rum)

2) We requested on two separate occasions a strip view room before checking in.  The first request was two months in advance, and the second time was a full month in advance.  Both times we were told that they ""would see what they could do.""  It was only upon check-in that we were given the opportunity to upgrade - for an extra $55\/night.  I understand.  It's Vegas.  Nothing's free. However, perhaps someone could have told us of the upcharge beforehand?  If only to temper our hopes...

Actually this is how we felt about all the staff, with the exception of the security staff. They were the most helpful and friendliest of any staff interaction we encountered. 

The room we stayed in was not very clean and it looked shabby. The entire hotel looked shabby. They are in serious need of an over hall.

  The Paris Casino is just like all the others- except the bathrooms are cuter.  The shows here at this hotel are......hehhhhh.  

Speaking of the Bellagio-  Our favorite restaurant this trip was the one at the Paris, Mon Ami Gabi (see my other reviews) 

. Nestled right on the balcony...you can watch the huge beautiful water show at night.  It's breathtaking and quite romantic.  This is the place to be if you want to pop the question on your lady. Right Here.
I was not asked here, I was actually asked in a more romantic way- but you get the picture.  We came to the restaurant here right after he asked me, so...

Think of how many relationships blossom here from the beautiful view.
Our favorite song was ""Time To Say Goodbye"" by Andrea Bocelli  and to this day- I cant hear it without thinking of the night I was there, with Bear, watching the water sway.  Here, listen to the video I recently found on an old phone. I was so excited to see that I still has this inside the phone.  

https:\/\/vimeo.com\/49415946

It's the most romantic water show there is, and from the point of view from the French restaurant, on the balcony....  Oh--  I get all mushy and get goose bumps when I think back and remember this special memory.  

You would not think of Vegas as a romantic place, but If your with the right person..who has a wonderful imagination.... it definitely can be.",2,0,2

I have stayed at the Bellagio a few times, Aria a few times, Wynn, Encore, Planet Hollywood, Venetian and Palazzo among other places. This past weekend we decided to go to Vegas on a whim and because we had friends already staying at the Paris Hotel we decided to also get a room there. 

We got to Vegas at 5AM and went to the front desk to see if there was a room we can check into because we had just driven 4 hours. The lady at the front desk was the rudest person I have ever come into contact with. In a town where customer service is known to be the #1 priority and at other hotels they do everything to accommodate their guests this was not the case here. she didn't even check their records and immediately said we are sold out, come back at 11 AM and MAYBE we will have a room for you. we asked her why she was being rude and all we wanted was for her to check maybe there was a room. She refused and we asked if we can see a supervisor and instead of call her supervisor she called security! We were not rude to her, we did not raise our voices and we were utterly shocked at her initial rudeness and her behavior. We had to wait for the security to get there and the security was the one who called the supervisor over. the supervisor just said oh we don't have a room we can hold your bags come back at 11 and once again MAYBE they will have a room. How does a hotel that size not knowif they will or will not have a room? Did they expect us to wait until 11AM so that they can say oh we don't have a room? 

Only thing is, when we left the hotel and called their 800 number the operator was able to give us a room right away and asked us to come back! 

Safe to say we left Paris and checked into ARIA. 

Would not recommend going to the hotel to anyone. Their Staff is rude and will call security on a whim for no reason. Even our friends who stayed in their room the night before said that the sheets were dirty, the room smelled and that they also were greeted with rude staff members throughout their stay.

I've been to actual Paris, and I'd have to say that this hotel captures all my misty-eyed nostalgia about it.  I'm completely ambivalent about that actually, but I have to admit that the incredible attention to detail both inside and out did charm and relax me.

The rooms were fantastic.  Unlike CP, they were uniform and also much more comfortable, despite actually being smaller.  There were more places to sit and all of the amenities you expect (mirror in room and bathroom, closet in room NOT bathroom, soundproof, desk, TV, hairdryer, iron and ironing board, etc).  The mattresses were divine.

Service was very courteous and prompt.  The restaurants ranged from extravagant to affordable.  We ate at the Asian place (affordable) and the food was great.  Nothing amazing, but reliable.

This year we decided to go across the street to Paris which in retrospect turned out to be our first bad decision. Now the hotel in itself is nice; lower scale models of actual french architecture and statues, beautifully decorated ceiling and delicious restaurants. It was all enjoyable to gaze up at. That is until you begin to interact with the hotel and staff. For starters, as we checked in, the front desk staff informed me that my card wouldn't be charged until check-out which turned out to be a complete and blatant lie. ""Trusting the staff"", second big mistake. Fortunately this grossly misleading piece of info didn't affect my weekend but others with a tighter budget may not be so lucky (fair warning to others with future plans). 
Moving forward, as it turns out our room was built for 1 shower a day... I say that because it seemed that the water got hotter by the minute with no way of cooling it down no matter which way you turn the crank. When brought to their attention all they did was attempt to give me a shower-taking crash course and according to the staff I was incapable of understanding the dynamics of shower taking because this problem is ""highly uncommon"" as it was so delicately explained to me. In the end, we got nowhere.
Now, normally, when we stay at a hotel we like to gamble there to enjoy part of the experience. ""Giving money to the place that is so far kicking my weekend around"", third big mistake. Aside from a prize 2 or 3 dealers the floor staff was inattentive, unresponsive and just plain rude. Its no fun to gamble or give away hard earned cash while your trying to order drinks and all the meanwhile getting nothing but scowls and sneers through some judging eyes. It makes for an uncomfortable playing environment. Needless to say the last half of our weekend was spent elsewhere.

The location of Paris on the strip is great.  Right across from Bellagio, right next to Bally's and Planet Hollywood, makes it a great place to stay for people who would rather walk up and down the strip, rather than take the bus or drive.

The hotel room in Paris that we stayed in was rather dated, but that's what you would expect in an authentic Paris hotel room, right?  The room wasn't really clean when we came in, but we didn't want to switch rooms because the check-in lines were soooo long! We got the hotel room for free, so no complaints.

Personally, I would have rather stayed at Harrah's because it was so close to that food court that had McDonald's and Chipotle where we can eat for cheap.  I mean, buffets are great, but too much of it gets old. 

The shops and restaurants at Paris are cute.  There are always a lot of people here cause it's a must see at Vegas and a major tourist destination Vegas is, there are always chances where you're walking in front of a photograph.

I like how the whole hotel is gay friendly. They should have a gay friendly bar\/club.

Recommendations: Le Creperie, Strawberry Daquiri with the tall souveneir cup (14.99).

Service: 6\/10, Variety: 7\/10, Parking: 3\/10 (it was sooo far)

However, the rooms have been recently remodeled and are beautiful now. Many of the rooms have all new furniture and beds. I try to get a strip view when I stay here, although sometimes they are sold out and not available. 

The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. I recommend getting a P room which is much larger, and often set in a corner with corner windows so you get more of the view. The only problem is that they are at the end of the hall so you have to be willing to walk further. 

The rooms come with a coffee maker, refrigerator and a safe. Some rooms also provide nice robes, so they are nice to use at the pool. The pool is huge and has plenty of chairs for sunbathing if you are into that. The gym is good size and has plenty of treadmills for exercise. I walk so much when in Las Vegas that I usually do not use the gym.

The decor of the casino is very nice. Although I feel the casino could be more generous. The machines the last few years have been very tight. But, then again if you feel lucky you never know!

The checkin process was easy - went to the kiosk and printed keys. Had a little trouble with the machine reading my id, but there was someone nearby to help. Note - they will ask you if you want to upgrade your room for a fee instead of talking to someone live. And you don't get your Total Rewards coupons from the kiosk (FYI - I usually find one I will use. Not this time.)

The room itself was fine - a little dated and the carpet and wallpaper have seen better days. There is a little fridge - which was nice since most casinos don't have one these days. We faced Bally's, so no noise issues, etc. (This is on the 50-73 wing I believe)

The elevators were great! Coming from some older hotels, they take forever and are always packed. Always had an elevator quickly as they are based on your floor. 

Went to the gym - it is ok. No tvs in each tradmill. They have 6-8 treadmills, 3 or so ellipticals and free weights. You must bring your key and ID to use it. Not bad.

Pool - is ok. It's a huge pool. Kids are allowed. Drinks are not. Be prepared to be taken advantage of by how high the food and drink costs are. $14 sangria, $9 beer. Really a nothing exciting about the pool. It's big. That's about it. Music is ok. Just some soundtrack. But I guess that is to be expected here.

There are several annoying things about Paris:
1) Fees: $10\/day to park. Even if you are staying there
2) Fees: The $34\/day dreaded resort fee. Casinos should have to abide by airline rules and include fees in their room rates because between the taxes and fees it can more than double the room rate
3) To get from the parking garage to the front desk is quite a walk - and the ""cobblestone"" street is a real headache to drag luggage on.

Parking - you use your key to get out. So don't worry about your ticket if you are staying there.

The place is smaller than a lot of the hotels which makes getting around it easier and I love that. It's also less crowded than a lot of the other hotels on the strip...and is smack dab in the middle so that it makes walking to other hotels very easy.

 Have to admit that I was surprised at the decent food options in this place...seemingly better than most hotels. Check out Lenotre and Mon Ami Gabi if you visit.

And super cute boutiques that aren't regular ole brand names you see every day, in the cobblestone shopping area. We had a very uneventful stay here for a short sales-conference and it was a perfect choice. If we go back for 'pleasure' , I would def consider Paris as an option. 

One serious negative for me is that their gym was $25 a day. Seriously, it's not that big, and $25 for what they offer is a rip. The other much larger hotels charge $25 and you get a lot more. Drop that down a bit to more realistic proportions, would'ya Paris?!",9,6,9

The pros: Nice central location on the Strip. Great view, if you face the Bellagio (you'll probably see and hear the fountain shows from your room). Convenient to lots of other hotels. Nice casino. Good coffee shop. Reasonable rooms. No resort fees (or there weren't). Efficient check-in. Not a bad lounge right off the casino, featuring some unintentional entertainment many nights. Decent cocktail service, nothing special.

The cons: Buffet is over-rated and over-priced (walk to Bellagio and eat at the best one instead). Pepsi property (no Coke products sold at all). If you face the Strip, you'd better like the Bellagio fountain show, because you'll probably hear every one that happens while you're in your room. All the usual Strip gaming complaints: high table minimums, tighter slots, short-pay video poker machines, and even, IIRC, some 6:5 payouts on blackjack. Valet was abysmal.

Gambling wise, it is pretty much the same as the rest of the strip.  In my book that means expensive.  I  know I'm not a big spender, but I take about $3-400 for my bankroll for a trip, and I like a $5 craps table or a $5 black jack table so I can make the fun last.

The first night the room we'd requested wasn't available (King deluxe or something, the important part was a King bed) so they had us in a double Queen.  They had some fancy King room available but it was $150 upcharge.  Seems to me if a reservation is messed up and the better room is available they should just give it to the inconvenienced couple instead of putting them in a lesser room, but hey, what do I know.  So we stayed in the room with 2 smaller beds the first night and actually had decided that we'd probably just keep that one.  Until hubs took a shower and found it didn't drain.  OK,  new room 3 floors up we went. 

Like our first room, the bed was very comfortable but we could hear every noise outside the room.  Oddly enough other guests were really considerate and not making much noise at all - it was the staff and their carts (housekeeping and room service) that were loud!  I don't think they were intentionally loud, or any louder than any other hotel, just that the doors and walls were that thin.  Oh!  And our newer king bed room?  Right next to the ice machine!  So each time the ice machine filled with water we heard it.  That was obnoxious. 

The best upside - comfy bed.  Followed by shades that actually kept the room dark. Oh, and it's a pretty centralized location.   

Downsides - awful water pressure.
Teeny, tiny shower. 
Stained carpet.  It kind of freaked me out.  Hubs and I joked that a hooker probably had been killed in our room.

I spent $300 after a corporate discount for 2 nights in a ""luxury"" room with my girlfriend and there was absolutely nothing luxurious about it. The room smelled nice and the furniture looked french, but that's about as good as it got.  There was no closet in the room at all.  The worst part was the bed, which was a nasty old spring mattress older than I am (pushing 30); seriously, their rooms have hands down the oldest, most uncomfortable hotel bed I've ever seen.  I would expect to find a bed like that in a mom and pop motel in the middle of nowhere, not a ""luxury"" room in a 4 star resort. I had to pay an extra $45\/night to upgrade to a room with an upgraded bed but if I wanted to sleep on a king size bed with my girlfriend I had to get a smoking room (and of course I'm not a smoker).

The staff was not helpful at all; nobody offered to help us move our luggage or apologize for the laughably bad bed they tried to give me.  The music they play in the elevator is all from the 50's because they can't afford to license music anyone wants to hear.  All the French accents in their 80's informational videos and hold messages are horribly fake, their super-slow Internet access is $15\/day, most areas of the hotel need a fresh coat of paint but they're so broke that their mini-fridge isn't even stocked with anything and the only 24 hour food place is a candy store called the Sugar Factory.

Also, If I'm paying hundreds of dollars a day at a resort in Vegas, I'd expect to be able to drink at the pool.  If you're thinking that too, expect to be told by the crew at the Paris that there's no alcohol allowed.

All in all, I was disgusted by my experience there and I'll never EVER stay there, gamble in their casino or recommend them to anyone.  For less money, you can stay at the Luxor in a suite with a hot tub.  Paris was the worst time I've ever had in Vegas.",5,0,0

The (phone center) reservation attendant was obviously disappointed w my wanting to cancel and offered to upgrade me to a Red room (excellent choice. Do NOT get a luxury \/{luxury=standard}room) and a discounted rate. $50 off. So I'm saying win...already. I then pushed my luck and asked for a room w a strip\/bellagio fountain view.

The frown was growing worse by the minute. She then informed me I had 1king...not 2 queens. Major problem. Also that this was not a strip view. So i politely informed her of the conversation w the phone check in staff and was summarily dismissed. No record of strip view or 2 queens.  Period. Politely but firmly said this is what was promised and is what was expected. Going on 30 min now. Was informed a meeting w the mgr was now needed. She disappeared for 10 min. And came back saying no deal. By now i was less polite and asked to speak to the mgr or the agreement i was given over the phone to he honored. Mrs . Gargoyle then played her trump card...""well we can just listen to the call...they are recorded"". And of course knowing what was promised I was all too happy. Going on an hour waiting and the family was not happy. She had to wait until the 50+ calls were gone through until they reached mine. She occasionally thanked me for my patience and i nodded. Finally she made one more trip to the mgr and returned w a look like I had just kicked her dog. Typing furiously she gritted her teeth and got us the room we were promised. I asked ...politely...""did you hear him promise me the things I said? "" she REFUSED to answer.  Instead she gave me the ...""I'm trying to help you sir"". I asked again...did he or did he not promise exactly what I said?  Refused to say ...I was right. ....instead deflected again and .stated ""he didn't know what he was talking about and she was doing her best to help me"". Got my room keys and off we went.

I can't comment on the casino, since I don't gamble.  This review is primarily about the rooms and amenities of the hotel itself. 

The rooms are nice sized and are ok to lay your head down.  The beds and linens aren't very luxurious, but they could do worse.  The bathroom is very large with separate shower and tub and an abundance of marble.  The surfaces, unfortunately, get a bit slippery, so you need to tread with caution.

I was terribly disappointed that there was an early check in fee even though our room was ready and it was 1:30pm. When we learned that Paris was adding resort fees we were happy to know that since we booked prior to the fees being initiated they would be waived; however perks associated with the resort fees were also waived. No wifi!

Our room was on the 22nd floor overlooking the parking lots :(
The walls were banged up and we only had 2 large towels.

This was everything I could have imagined Paris could be, complete with wide-eyed Americans taking pictures of walls and signs, contorting themselves with selfie sticks to get the perfect picture in front of the Eiffel Tower, USA.

The ceiling upon entering is painted like the sky, and I imagine it is a very Parisian sky.  When I looked up and saw it, I asked myself, ""Is this an actual replicate of of the sky in Paris, or is this an artist's rendering of an American sky, playing a Parisian sky in this this French-themed casino?""  In truth, we will never know.

Everyone that worked here was really nice and helpful, especially the receiving team.  I was helped by a gentleman with the task of bringing materials to the conference center via a silly little motorized cart around the back.  There was a fee for this, but for anyone that might find yourself presenting at a convention here and faced with the task of setting up an exhibit table, ask the bellman for shipping to come help you load in and for a fee, they will save you the shame of lugging boxes and tables through a busy casino.

I left the Paris feeling as though as much as I dislike casinos and the like, the place was worth seeing, the people worth meeting, and I no longer feel the burning desire to see Paris or be romantic.

Food?  I had a pain du chocolate from the cafe downstairs.  It was good.  I had a reuben from the St. Louis cafe.  It was acceptable (had to ask for the dressing, corned beef was a little tough), but the fries were great.  No special points for food from me.

Room?  I slept in it.  I could shower.  Good enough.

The thing I liked about Paris was its walking proximity to places I wanted to go to hang out and do things (Caesars, Aladdin, Harrahs, etc.) and the fact that Paris isn't very popular.  Why is that great?  Because when you're heading back to the hotel at midnight or 1am on a Friday or Saturday night and you want to catch a nightcap or two in the hotel lounge, you can actually get a seat.  In the past when trying something like that at the Bellagio or other popular places, you just can't, the places are packed and you have to stand.  Nothing kills a buzz more than sore feet.

Beware the taxi-fetcher guys, though.  Now, I understand it's a full service kind of thing, but I have a hard time tipping a guy that asks me where I'm going and tells that to the cab driver.  If he's loading my bags, fine, but only saying something to a cab driver?  Piss off.   Apparently this Paris taxi-fetcher felt he should say something about the lack of tip because after getting in the cab he held the door and said, ""I hope you appreciated the service,"" and slammed the door.

Staying at Paris was like the cursed, gradual decline of a bad relationship. Everything is platinum when you walk in, but then disappointment takes hold when you see your girlfriend without makeup for the first time (i.e. when you finally get a look at the coupon booklet you paid extra for that, turns out, is NOT worth the additional money). 

Then you find out she's a sloppy drunk (or when you are told no, there are no king-sized beds left, even though that is what you specifically booked. Are you happy with the two queens, ma'am?). 

And finally, you realize you've both gained fifteen pounds, she lost her job, and you've picked up smoking ( the room is dingy, the shower water reeks of rotten eggs -thanks, sulfur- and the tiny shampoo and conditioner are Not. Even. Worth. Stealing).

Darn you, Paris!

But....we were hardly in the room, so if you can get a deal, I'd recommend it. For the lobby. And for April. Use the coupon booklet for the buy one, get one and go see Jubilee at Bally's, and take your picture in front of the Eiffel Tower.

We stayed in a basic room and it was nothing special. We had a view of a rooftop and a few other buildings. That's okay, we didn't come to Vegas to hang out in our room anyways! Our bathroom was huge, there was a nice flat screen TV, and I was happy to have an empty mini-fridge that we could actually use! Our only complaint was the college dorm sized mini ironing board and crappy iron. It was impossible to use. 

The pool was a nice size and not too crowded. Chairs would fill up by about 1pm, but the staff were pretty good about going around and removing towels from chairs that were no longer being used. Most of the pool area is in the shade until about noon and then it gets sunnier. My only complaint was I don't really remember seeing any umbrellas so we were stuck in the hot sun.

We had breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi two mornings in a row and it was fantastic! If you go before 9am, there is no wait and you can easily get a table outside or on the patio.

THIS PLACE IS A DUMP
I've been to Paris, France many times.  In case it wasn't clear, Paris Las Vegas is nothing like Paris, France.  Paris Las Vegas looks more like a ""ROSS Dress for Less"".  You got crap spread all over the floor of a warehouse-like facility with absolutely no rhyme or reason.  I know the psychology of casinos pretty well & this is the one place I can't for the life of me figure out what the hell they were trying to do.  Shows exit out into casino tables that are perpetually closed?  The restaurant elevator drops you off into an area so poorly lit you could get molested & mugged before anyone noticed?  What next?  The buffet exit leads you straight into the handicapped stall in the men's bathroom?

Maybe they're trying to simulate the annoying need in Paris to constantly ask natives-who-could-care-less, for directions.  Frankly, it's as if they took some 5 yr old's kindergarten fingerpainting and made it the floor plan of a casino.

And what mouthbreather still finds the 24\/7 ""simu-sky"" painted ceilings even remotely deluding these days?  I think I got tired of this place's fake sky ceiling...  back when it was called the CAESAR'S FORUM SHOPS.  Meanwhile, the carpeting looks atrocious and lacks any sort of character except of course where people have spilled food.  

And damn, if this place is swarming with kids.  It's so unauthentic, I fully expected ""Le Taco Bell"" & ""Le Chuck E. Cheese"" to be among the shops on ""Le Boulevard.""  Dude. Epic fake.

But hey - here's one similarity:  Just like the REAL Paris, there's cigarette butts strewn all over the floor.  Good job, a$$holes!  Even Hooters at least has a crew of the Mexican mafia picking up after the degenerates that stay there.  But you get the impression that the poor Paris janitorial staff just ""gave up"":  They probably helplessly observed the 440-pound wooly mammoth sitting at ""Gems Wild Tiles"" spilling half an ice cream sundae on the floor while chain smoking Marlboros & knocking over a 40 ounce all over the machine... and said, ""Ah f-ck it, amigo.  We'll never have basura bags big enough to pick up everything that that monstrosity has dropped.  I'd rather go on unemployment than pick up after these neanderthals."" 

SO 3-STARS... WTF?
Look.  On any other day, this little slice of heaven would get the ""1-Star of Doom""(TM).  But not today... why?  Well, it would seem that this hotel has a couple surprising benefits:

1)  BLACKJACK
No, not the tables filled with the guys wearing Hawaiian print\/Aloha shirts at them.  Those tables are the unholy pits of ""$5\/$500 single deck 6-5"" filled with the sheep that ""heard single deck is better"".  This is the part of Paris that makes Jesus cry.
... I'm talking about the ""$50\/$5000 6-deck 3-2 DAS Late Surr"" tables & the lonely ""$25\/$2000 Double Deck 3-2"" pit.  The $50 game has one of the smallest edges on the strip outside of the high limit areas and the great thing about the double deck pit is that it's reaaaaally easy to get a 1-on-1 game going with despite marginal rules.  (No double after split)

2)  EIFFEL TOWER RESTAURANT
Good restaurant.  This'd be a GREAT restaurant if they would just 1) ban all children and 2) ban any dork that thinks corduroy is formalwear.  See my review.

3)  LE PROVENCAL
Good buttery French food.  They even have fake French waiters who are every bit as annoying as actual French waiters.  Love the phony accent, Jacque Cousteau...  now go get my steak, you frog.

4)  LE VILLAGE BUFFET
This buffet is reasonably priced while being a notch under Wynn & Bellagio but the desserts here are spectacular as most people already know.  In fact, half the people at the dessert bar eat so much here that it looks like they're only a 'parfait' way from growing a snout.

CONCLUSION
Come for the blackjack, stay for the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  Or maybe you can get a buffet comp & while you're there, annoy everyone eating by being as loud & annoying as they (and their kids) are but do it by perpetually talking like Pepe Le Pew during your visit.  Then again, you probably don't want to stay too long...
...lest you grow a snout.

So when the third person came around asking for ID I showed it. I was asked three more times. By then I felt harassed and my mother was noticeably upset. When the 7th came this time a security guard my mother sternly asked him to leave me alone. I told him to tell his people to stop carding me it was getting annoying. He did more than that he called his supervisor. The supervisor said you are being asked to vacant the premises for the following reasons ""Failure to show ID, mistreatment of staff"" I didn't hear the third reason I was so mad. When he asked what hotel I was residing in I refused to answer. He went on to say ""You will be arrested if you are near this casino and cesar's palace."" We were then escorted out.

I recommend Yong Kang Street and Gordon Ramsey Steak. The views are also nice as well, facing the strip.

The room was large and included a separate walk-in closet, small make-up table\/area and a big jacuzzi tub in the spacious bathroom. The suite was clean and the amenities were very nice. 

Housekeeping did a nice job cleaning the room (and I'm insane about clean rooms...borderline OCD, in fact). One issue with the room: the quality of towels was not great; I expected more luxurious, large bath towels and maybe a robe or two? I also tend to shower more than once daily...and there just weren't enough towels (I still re-use and hang them up). Had to call housekeeping one day to bring a few extra. Another small complaint was around the shampoo and shower gel situations; they didn't leave enough of those 2 little items and that was inconsistent. 

Other than that, the size of the room was great and the extra space was terrific.

Check-in was a breeze - thankfully had a pass to the Diamond (separate-behind-closed-doors) area. The line was incredibly long at the main check-in. Check-out was easy as well - did the express check-out and dropped my information and keys in a box (located just outside of the elevator area). I didn't receive my folio the same day and had to follow up several days later...but I eventually did get the email.

I really like the layout of the casino, shops, elevators and restaurants on this property. It does get crowded and busy...but parts of it really feel like you're strolling along the streets of Paris. There is a dim sum place right across from the elevator bank that's actually quite good. A small sweets shop with pastries and gelato is open late for those hankerings. There's a high-end (expensive) Gordon Ramsay steak restaurant on the premises as well as a French inspired restaurant (Mon Ami Gabi). There's a great little crepe place for sweet or savory deliciousness. There are several shops to purchase souvenirs, clothing, cigars...etc. 

The buffet line is always ridiculously long (I'm not big into buffets but it's supposedly very good) and the casino area is large without being too overwhelming.

I hate smoke...but I had to suck it up (no pun intended) during this trip. Most casinos are not smoke free and I could start smelling the smoke the moment I walked out of my room. Some times of the day are worse than others...but if you're not a smoker and are sensitive to smoke - you're SOL.

Lastly - the location is great. It's very close to Planet Hollywood, Bally's, Caesar's and Aria. Uber and Lyft are solid options for traveling to the opposite end of the strip. Note: if using rideshare services...most of the hotels have designated areas for Uber and Lyft; they are not usually near a main entrance. So, check on that pickup\/drop-off location.

Overall, I really enjoyed my stay here. I haven't been to Vegas in over 20 years so I don't have much to compare it to (in Vegas). Pretty sure I'd stay here again if I return.",5,0,2

SERVICE: The registration is located near the front door where the Eiffel Tower is, it's decorated with large chandeliers along with white and gold framing.  When we walked over to check-in, the lines were easy to find and it was quick. There weren't a lot of people so it wasn't very time consuming, we were probably only at the front desk for about 5-10 minutes at most. The concierge and the management people were friendly and very cooperative with us. :)

HOTEL: The hotel is themed and of course based off of Paris with the cobbled stone walkways (FYI ladies, these floors are not for heels! Makes it all wobbly and hard to walk on) with quaint little houses and street cafes. Plenty in Rococo styled architecture http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/ii8sAGBexBOJoYRFafF9XQ?select=dOjV0L-1GE-Y1KktRyvPfw.

(A lot of places just have cold water, bleh in this season!) :D And plenty of late night bars and stores if you ever get the midnight munchies (La Pizza, Le Cafe, Creperie, and a 24 hour Snack Bar by the elevator)

ROOM: The room was average sized, but it was comfortable with a nice view http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/ii8sAGBexBOJoYRFafF9XQ?select=Qle1Mxpm_1YKoFF3Iw13Uw from the window, two queen sized beds http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/ii8sAGBexBOJoYRFafF9XQ?select=kMw3fPNRZm3MlMo5gRxodg, VERY soft pillows (I suggest you bring your own if you're a hard pillow kind of person), and an empty mini fridge.

There were many things I liked about the hotel, such as the number of great food options that are inside of it (Mon Ami Gabi is outstanding as well as the creperie), but unfortunately a lot disappointed me.

When I made my reservation weeks in advance I booked a King bed. Upon arrival after a very long drive from Los Angeles, I was informed that I'd be getting 2 Queen beds instead (completely unnecessary) and that my booking merely expressed a preference with no guarantee. Bit of a bummer. Thankfully I was still given a non-smoking room on the 18th floor. 

When getting to my room, I noticed that it had been a while since the doors had been cleaned as there were dirty marks around the handle and card slot. Then inside the room itself on the carpet I saw that the TV stand\/armoire that previously was in there was replaced with another - but there were still strange marks and stains around it. Where you'd think the TV would be in the armoire is actually where the fridge is as the TV was on the side to the right making its location on the wall only visible to one of the beds. 

When I went into the bathroom I saw that whoever was in there previously cleaning missed a rather large tuft of hair on the floor, and I know it definitely wasn't mine as I have fine, blonde hair and this was thick and dark. Kind of grossed me out as I began to doubt what else hadn't been cleaned. 

There was a paper on the desk in the room that is supposed to have on there who the cleaning person was, but no name was written and I could tell it had been there for a while since whoever was previously staying in the room wrote some numbers on the back of it. That paper was never touched the entirety of my stay as Saturday after the cleaning crew came in I checked it again and, sure enough, the numbers were found on the back of it. 

When I took my shower Saturday morning I deliberately left some hair on the shower wall to test the cleaning crew, but upon coming back from walking the Strip all afternoon it was still there and they left the shower door open. The trash was also untouched. 

The room was really cold, and the blankets\/comforters on the bed itself wasn't really sufficient so I found myself having to up the temperature a few times. 

One of the people next to us got room service Sunday morning at a rather early time, so that woke me up as the walls were a little thin and whoever delivered the room service itself knocked loudly on their door. 

When making a final check in the room to make sure my boyfriend and I didn't miss anything when packing we discovered that there was a random cashew on the floor under the extra bed, and on the one we slept on the box spring covering looked dirty with black smudges on it. 

I had been looking forward to using the tub in the room, as I don't have a tub back at home, but it was really shallow (pictures made it look deeper) and even though I'm only 5'4"" I knew there was no way I'd fit comfortably - plus I doubted how clean it was after everything else.

The casino itself is so smoky, so if you have asthma or are sensitive to cigarette smoke like I am I suggest walking fast through those areas because it's quite gross. 

Beware using the ATM on the casino floor as well. It'll give you a prompt that there's the fee of $5.99 or whatever (to be expected), however on my bank statement I saw an ADDITIONAL charge of $2.50 which I wasn't informed of and thought that was pretty shitty. 

If you drive there and park your car in valet, there is NO option to call earlier the day you're leaving to say something like ""please have my car (number on valet ticket) ready at 10:00."" You just have to get down there and wait, which can take forever. I waited about 30 minutes for my car. Same goes for needing a cab. You have to wait in a long line outside off to the left instead. 

I did like how I could check in\/check out electronically and skipping the potential lines, so that was nice at least. 

Would I stay there again? Maybe. The location is convenient in the middle of the Strip and across from the Bellagio fountain. I'm just not particularly keen on spending close to $600 on a room for 2 nights that wasn't properly cleaned.",4,0,0

My biggest issue with this hotel is the check-in. I stood in line for over 45 minutes just to pick up a key (the hubby was already there). We walked by the entrance many times during our short time there -- there was ALWAYS a crazy, long line.

Got a $25 daily dining credit which seemed generous, but the restaurants were borderline awful - and prices were inflated at least 2x vs any comparative quality you could find elsewhere to compensate for any generosity.

The crowd there is an older crowd so you don't have all the young, drunk 21 year olds going crazy all over the place.

The parking structure is shared with Bally's and the walk is pretty far compared to others.  The shops there are kind of pricey but its fun to just walk around and window shop.

SEVERELY UNDERSTAFFED. at first they had 3 or 4 checking people in but it dropped to 2 & 1 one was switching between us & the people who needed new room keys. I stood in that line for 2 HOURS. There were two men & I think one was a manager who didn't help check in until people were nearly screaming.

What's not so great about the Paris is the many hidden charges. READ THE FINE PRINT! 5.00 additional to everything you order for room service, just because they bring it to your room.

If you get a Pool view.. wow!! Blew my mind away. The pool is next to the Eiffel Towel. It made it even more spectacular view. 

The pool is a good size. Enough space to swimming and just relax by the pool. They have at least 4 life guild on duty.

Tried an Asian restaurant here, the Beer Garden above, Eiffel Tower as well as the Cafe that serves the most amazing Pizza when you want a greasy snack at all hours of the night. There is an all you can eat buffet that had a long line so I assume that was good as well.

I was lucky to be staying for free since my brother's company paid for the room!  Vegas is quite the popular place for trade-shows!

I ate at the crepe place in the hotel each morning since it was right downstairs, tasty, and reasonably priced.  They had lots of different varieties to choose from too.  

The hotel room had lots of space and the bathrooms were spacious as well.  It was also clean and the decorations and furniture were pretty new and cute.  I spent a few afternoons at the pool and really enjoyed my time lounging there.  DO NOT get a drink from the bar though!  It was a total rip off since I was basically drinking syrup.

Like others, I concur that the rooms are getting pretty worn, and need an update.  Prifes are sky hifg, bit they are pretty much everywhere else too, so its not unusual.

Will review them separately, but Mon Ami Gabi is an awesome place for breakfast, amd Gordon Ramsay Steak had excellent food and service, but was loud and $255, for 2 people (total of 3 cocktails, 1 app, 2 entrees, 1 sauce, 2 sides and 2 desserts.  Obscene.)

The upgraded Red rooms are a joke, they are the exact same rooms as the others, with a red headboard and bedspread, for a premium price.  Don't waste your money.

The worst part of the hotel is the Chateau Nightclub, which is an open air nightclub under the Eiffel tower.  If you have the misfortune of being able to see the tower, you are SCREWED.   The club plays DEAFENINGLY LOUD hiphop til 4 AM and the bass can not be drowned out with earplugs.  

It is a terrible location for a club, even people at Bally's have to suffer.  It needs to be indoors and in a soundproof room, or else the hotel needs triple paned soundproof glass on all their windows.  You will get no sleep!  I'm writing this at 1:33AM, have barely slept all weekend, and know better than to even try til it's almost light outside.  

Any hotel that would torture its paying guests like this won't get another penny of my money until its changed.

They say a lot of things about Paris ... it's a place to find inspiration ... a place to discover something new about life ... a place to find love. I say it's a place to discover your fate. Sadly for me, fate seems to be the Paris casino tables liberating my money in ridiculous fashion. Fate should be when people meet on a train or in a Paris cafe and not in line at the ATM machine.

Most people go to Paris, France to fall in love ... while at Paris Vegas, people go for the prime center-Strip location\/views plus the good fortune of not having to actually talk to French people. 

The beautiful exterior with iconic Eiffel Tower, Montgolfier Balloon, and Arc de Triomphe are photo op spots un deux trois. Inside, the Casino is like a small French village under a sunny blue sky.

I thought the Paris themed architecture and layout was quite quaint, and the Le Village Buffet was hot and delicious. I would have given 5 stars on this review were it not for two reasons: 

1) We arrived at 11:45 am and were told at check-in our room wasn't ready, therefore we  were going to be given another room with only one king size bed instead of the two queen size beds requested and confirmed on my reservation. THEN we were told an early check-in fee of $20.00 would be changed. Immediately I protested and said, ""no, we don't mind waiting for our room with two queen beds to be ready."" I didn't want to share a bed with my adult daughter. Magically, our room with two queen beds were in fact ready, and we were told we would STILL be charged early check-in fee. This did not sound right to me, but I'd been driving a little over four hours; being tired, I did not argue the point any further.  I've never been charged by any other hotel a fee to check-in early if the room was ready. Why should I be penalized? It's not like I asked for a different room altogether. I guess they forgot for a moment they are in the  H-O-S-P-I-T-A-L-I-T-Y business.

2) Room issues: We found an empty Aquafina water bottle on the floor by one of the beds which was clearly left by a previous guest. Housekeeping would have noticed this had they vacuumed the floor? Cigarette smoke was wafting into our room which was odd since our room was on the 24th floor. I suspect poor\/cheap ventilation or duct work because the casino is on the first floor.

We were placed at the 21st floor and had a view of the back of buildings.

I do not suggest this hotel if you are going to ever put on your make up, the yellow lighting was awful, and all over the room. I figured out that the mirror on the door was better than the bathroom mirror due to the yellow lighting being lessened at that area.

Also, several machines in the casino were down and the guy running the roulette table wasn't very friendly at all. We ended up spending more time in Ceasars than our own hotel. 

The ""Le"" everything actually became the joke of the weekend. Its ridiculously cheesy, never mind the romance, which our room wasn't very sexy at all. I actually think they gave us a handicap suite. 

Over all, the Stratosphere beat them when I stayed there last. In room, staff and price.

I guess we didn't have a fridge but we didn't really need one either. The hotel itself is very busy especially the restaurant row. I had a good time here and enjoyed their restaurant Mon Ami Gabi. 

Best thing about this hotel is the location on the strip...again I ended up at Ceasar's palace. There's so much fun to be had there! I didn't know about the free shuttle that another reviewer mentioned...it would have been nice since it was 100+ degrees when I was there.",0,0,0

Stumbled in here drunk off my mind. Hotel is cozy even with 8 people in ONE room. We got the room for free, so can't complain much. The white tea shampoos and conditioners rock! Love the smell and how hydrated it leaves my hair.

The centr location is an absolute benefit and the rooms aren't bad, but it lacks some if the amazing things that make a Vegas Hotel desirable. The casino is fine, but it's small and not very lovely. The shopping is quite limited. The pool was calm and family-oriented (not what I was looking for). Lastly, there isn't any huge draw to a cool bar or night club. The price is economical, but the sacrifice is real.

When we asked for an additional card she lectured us about not putting our cards near our cell phones, when we just needed a card for the second guest.

While the Paris Hotel is perfectly located on the strip across the Bellagio, our rooms certainly had seen better times. The furniture were old-fashioned, worn and cheap. One light bulb was out in both of our rooms. Both rooms had several pencil top eraser-size holes in the walls that were patched up with silicone and push pins. And while one room had a very comfortable king-size mattress, the other room's mattress (also a king) was not only close to the floor, it was uneven and very bouncy resulting in one person being awoken whenever the other person turned around.  Upon complaining, a mattress topper was added that made it only a bit more comfortable. It would have been nice to have a view of the strip but since we didn't plan to spend much time in the room we were ok with the 12th floor back view.  But at a total of $360\/room for 2 nights (Sunday & Monday) I expect somewhat better.

Both bathrooms had non-matching lighting. The lights over the toilet were harsh fluorescent the ones over the vanity mismatched yellow and fluorescent. One of the 4 bulbs was out in one bathroom.  In the other room the entry light was out. The shower doors had caked on hard water built up at the bottom, indicating that they hadn't been thoroughly cleaned in a long time.
The casino itself was uninviting, resembling a railroad station (Gare du Nord?), very noisy, kind of grayish and crammed. And though I did not necessarily expect cheap or good food, I do expect to get a decent cappuccino and croissant from the ""French"" bakery for $12. Neither was.

The only ray of light was the new restaurant Hexx which was stylishly decorated, had reasonable prices, friendly service and decent food. Sitting on the outside terrace allowed for great people watching as well as seeing Bellagio's fountain show. Best of all, the noise level was well controlled, allowing for conversation without having to scream at one another.",1,0,0

There were things that I would have overlooked and not complained about but now that I am motivated to write a review, I will mention them. I paid over $200 for a basic, not redone hotel room in mid January. There were no basics in the room, no coffee pot, no shower cap, no cotton balls, no q-tips, none of the little things. The check in process seemed like it would be smooth and easy but it ended up being long and confusing. This was not something I was going to complain about but just something to remember for the next time. What I did complain about was the half filled glass of liquid in the bathroom that had a little white cap on it indicating that it was clean & the large band-aid on the floor. I sent a message via Facebook to the hotel at 8 am with accompanying photos and was told that the Front Desk Management team was notified and someone would be in contact soon. I never received a cell message, email or Facebook message. What I did recieve was a message timestamped for 2pm on my hotel room phone saying that the housekeeper came by and that I had a do not disturb sign on my door. Because I was in a conference all day, I did not receive this message until I returned to my room after dinner, at this point I was tired and ready for bed and did not want to wait up for a housekeeper to come by. I sent them another Facebook message and told them that I did not feel that I should be paying full price for a room that was not what I had paid for. It made me question as to whether the sheets were actually changed and my overall discomfort of being in a room where obviously dirty things and biohazards were so overlooked made for an uncomfortable stay. They said that they would forward the request to Management. I never heard from them so I sent a follow up message and was told then told that I needed to email them and was provided an email address. I emailed, reexplained the situation, provided photos as before and received an auto-confirmation saying they would respond in 3 days. They did not respond. I sent another email again, letting them know that I was trying to be fair and to have them make it right before I put up a review and still have not heard back. I am now posting my review and hope that the Management at the Paris hotel has the decency to read this review and do something about it.

As of Labor Day weekend 2015, my parents and I were staying here for two nights at Paris Casino and Hotel. As we entered, the atmosphere is remarkably mesmerizing! The interior and the concept inside the lobby is very Paris, France feel filled with parts of the Eiffel Tower, daylight painting backgrounds, live music, strippers at the middle side of the bar, and many more! Of course, this place is the home of this Broadway's classic hit, the ""Jersey Boys.""

Every slot machines work very well, so you can play it all day long if you're in luck to win. There's also more gambling games like blackjack, Pai Gow, roulette, Keno, and much more!

The wi-fi, it's a mixed bag. The smartphone connectivity works well to use, but for laptop users, it's a hassle. As I logged on through my laptop, there's a choice to use hourly limit useage costing around $13.99 to pay. Otherwise, if you have the access code to connect their wi-fi, you can access it for free. Update; so far as of 9\/7\/2015, it did managed it successfully, so I have no issues for the connectivity problems.

The hotel staying. Few months ago, we did paid a hotel room reservations with Paris for 3 days (2 nights) this Labor Day weekend costing around $160 before we booked and heading it as of today. The view of their hotel room that we reserved looked very good. We can see some of the Las Vegas strip easier to view. The bathroom functions work alright as I took a bath. Not a bad stay!

Once relieved of my car the front desk staff is slow and unresponsive upon check in. There was a long line and only two agents servicing customers. A terrible slap in the face to all those awaiting service after a long flights\/drives. 

Having booked a total of five different rooms for my staff and I, the check in clerk forced a $30 early check-in fee for myself and co-worker, even though rooms were clearly available. Also, they pushed a $40\/room\/night upgrade fee to get a ""remodeled room.""

Opting out of the outrageous upgrade fee, I did pay the early check-in fee for myself and co-worker. We felt hostage as we had to get ready for meetings and had no more time to waste.

I was assigned a room on the 6th floor (Stay away) which was an old room with nasty mattress and a matching view of Bally's loading dock. All night long construction outside my window and a terrible mattress made for a sleepless first night.

I did call the front desk the next morning and they agreed to put me into a remodeled room on the 17th floor, which was admittedly better. Same view and same construction noise, but the mattress was indeed nicer.

A few other tidbits about this hotel:
1) Cleanliness- poor. Previous guest's hair all over bathroom.
2) The cafe ""Sugar"" charges $2.50 for a glass of tap water with your meal.
3) ""Le Cafe"" service is terribly slow food matches service quality. The second time I visited the restaurant, I left after waiting more than 10 minutes for the cup of coffee I ordered.
4) The quick serve coffee house is anything but. Wait in line to place an order, then wait in another line to pick up your order.

Pros:
1) Tons of elevators. I never had to wait for an elevator.
 
Frankly, this property is a run down, long-in-the-tooth facility with a front staff that couldn't care less about their guests. Instead of reminding me of Paris, it seems more like a silly cartoon of what Paris might have been like BEFORE the revolution!

This is by far the worse room I've even seen! We asked if the could give us an upgrade and we would pay whatever, they moved us to a smoking room which is an upgrade to the one we were in but you can imagine the smell there too! We slept because by this time it was already 1am. The next day we asked again of there was a chance to upgrade to a non-smoking as I have asthma and this was a bad idea but believe me if you smelled the first room you would take a smoking one for one night! When we spoke to the front desk they said there was nothing, so we decided we would check out an go elsewhere. However the lady we had Abby saved the day! She could obviously see my displeasure and was willing to help! As we left she called us back and told us she had a non smoking room which was an upgrade and let me tell you! The room was amazing!! It smelled fresh and it was new! The cheap room have most likely never been touched or remodelar EVER!!! But the new rooms are fabulous!

The atmosphere is cute, kind of European and authentically a little worn around the edges.  I like it.  The rooms are smallish but clean.  King size bed is comfortable. Nice food choices downstairs with cafes, a great buffet and a couple new restaurants since our last visit, Asian and Italian. 

The BAD: we didn't find out when we booked on line, and they didn't tell us when we checked in at the front desk, that they are doing renovations and are SHUTTING OFF THE WATER at 10:30 am for several hours every day while we're here.  AFTER we were unpacked we saw a letter on the bathroom counter.  So instead of staying out late and sleeping as late as we want to, we set our alarms to wake up and shower before the water is turned off. Alarms. On vacation people want to sleep until whatever time they feel like getting up - especially in Vegas.  

Then, next to the phone we see surprise letter #2 saying that we might hear ""noise work"" from the construction during the day and they can ""try"" to move us to another location that will be ""less affected"" by the construction if we call the front desk.

Since we got in at almost midnight and were unpacked we didn't have the energy to move, so we took our chances.  I made the mistake of thinking it wouldn't be that bad, that they wouldn't subject guests to really horribly loud noise.  Boy was I wrong.  It is so loud and it sounds like it's right next door to our room or right above us.  We came back to our room this afternoon and I thought we might take a quick nap, watch a movie, get room service for dinner and then go out to a show.  Can't fall asleep, can't hear the movie, and I'm too mad to eat dinner in this room.

I completely understand that hotels need to do renovations and maintenance.  But they did two things very wrong in my opinion.  First, they didn't tell us ahead of time, second, they shouldn't be selling rooms that close to the construction work.  Just keep a wide perimeter of empty rooms around where they are making the godawful noise.  Or when we checked it, ask us if we want a discount for a noisy room (no!!!)

Ugh I might come back with an update about other things when I'm not so mad about this construction debacle.  But as of this minute it's all I can think about because it's taking a lot of the fun out of our once a year trip.",0,0,0

The hotel was super crowded because we were told they had three conventions going on that weekend, but when we came back later in the week to see Jersey Boys (which is amazing), it was still pretty crowded.

Before going to our room, we decided to get dinner at one of the places inside the hotel.  There really wasn't too much the hotel offered as far as restaurants.  We decided to go to this ""french bakery"" that served pizza by the slice, sandwiches, and pastries.  I don't know about you, but last time I checked, pizza is Italian not French.  We got some sandwiches that were more of Italian origin than French, and they ok, not my fave.  The service took forever and we barely found a place to sit.  That kind of was a foreshadowing of what the rest of our stay was going to be like.

Our room wasn't great, but what I expected from the pictures.  We had an awesome view of the Eiffel tower out front, which was cool.  The fridge from the mini bar was empty, which surprised me, but is gave us opportunity to put our own drinks in there, even if they fit oddly.  It made me wonder why a hotel wouldn't try to get more money out of you by providing a mini bar?  But it wasn't like I would have used it, so I can't complain.  

The bed was really hard.  I'm glad we only spent one night there.  I would expect a bed like that in a Motel 6, not a place in Vegas you pay over $200 a night.

The room service itself was good, but the quality of items they brought to us were not.

My husband needed a humidifier so that his throat won't get too dry at night.  They brought one promptly, but it was more like a swamp cooler than humidifier.  We had to put it on full blast for it to really make any difference, and it was loud.  My husband had a hard time sleeping over it.  (The Palazzo gave us a humidifier which used three times more water at full blast and was really quiet.)

For breakfast we decided to get room service since I had never had room service breakfast before.  Both things that we ordered were really simple.  I had salmon, cream cheese and bagels, and my husband had fruit with yogurt and granola.  They came to us pretty fast because we ordered things you can basically just throw on a plate.  When I got my plate, it had a variety of things you might want to put on your locks and bagels that were listed in the menu under what I ordered.  They were missing capers, which  was sad but I wasn't going to bug room service over a minor side.  Then I tasted the salmon which was grey around the edges.  It tasted fishy, which is bad because in all the smoked salmon I've ever eaten, I've never once had it taste fishy.  I called room service to order something else, which was eggs benedict.  That was much better, but they put the hollandaise sauce on the side, which got a little messy.  My husbands breakfast was good, but its pretty hard to F up fruit and yogurt. 

Had it not been for the view and polite service, I would have given this place a one star.  I expect this kind of stuff at Motel 6, not at an nicer hotel in Las Vegas.",1,1,0

My first recollection of Paris was on my 21st birthday.  As is customary, I sat my butt on the blackjack table.  The dealer was nice, gave me a few places to check out that offered birthday freebies and then proceeded to tell the cocktail waitress it was my 21st birthday. Her reply? A very large grin followed by, ""what can I get you that'll get you trashed?"" Hmmm...okay, considering that this was my first time at a table and first time ordering a drink in Vegas, I was scared. I asked her what she would recommend and she described to me a shot called a ""Washington Apple."" Okay, a shot? No problem.  I tell her to go for it and bring another shot of tequila too. 

I continue to play blackjack and within five minutes, she returns with a shot and a glass. ...what? Apparently, one was my tequila and the other was my triple shot of Washington Apple.  Well, here went nothing...

Upon checking in, i noticed the vaulted ceilings were painted a sky blue as if we were outside at 3pm in the afternoon.  The lobby is to the right filled with probably a dozen of these huge crystal chandeliers.  Very pretty. 

As we walked towards the hotel room elevators, I noticed everywhere that the signs all started with ""le"" such as le cafe, le toilettes, le spa, le village buffet, you get my drift.

We stayed on the 5th floor facing somewhat towards the strip but not really.  I can barely see the bellagio watershow but I can surely hear it on the dot for those three days at 10am (not sure what time they stop at nights).  Room 598 is not something I would prefer because right below there happens to be a break area for the Paris staff who happens to take smoke breaks = très mauvais.  Other than that the room was good. Quiet floor and can hardly hear our neighbors.  One huge plus is the bathroom.  Huge tub and shower stall.  Lots of towels and toiletries. TV is meh.  They could do some upgrading there with a flat screen.  The sheets I found to be just okay.  I wish they increased the threadcount!  The walls are very french with wallpaper everywhere.  It's tasteful, nothing tacky.  

Service overall was good here.  It's a very chill hotel.  The casino is not as big as I had anticipated.  One good thing is that Paris is adjacent to Bally's so there's no need to walk outside.

Wasn't really impressed with the rooms whatsoever. This hotel definitely needs rooms to be updated and upgraded. It looks like a standard hotel room that has gotten a bit warn down over the years. 

Unfortunately was too tired and hungover to make it to the pool which I hear is nice. They front desk was kinda of shady about giving us rooms with a nice view. We had to change rooms in the middle of our stay to get connecting rooms which was kinda a pain.

It was cool we were centrally located on the strip and located near the Planet Hollywood Mall. 

Buffet here sucks.....other than the crem brule. 24 cafe is just okay, kinda pricey, but right in front of the hotel lobby. Other better food options in the lobby, the crepe place and the dessert place.

Still like that it feels like paris when roaming the casino or halls around the lobby.

I last stayed at Paris in 2001 with family, and I decided to stay here this time on a business trip.

I had one of the Red Rooms, which were very posh, and I liked the decor. I'm more of a bath person then a shower person, too, so I really enjoyed that it had a separate bath in the bathroom. My view was of Planet Hollywood and the Cosmopolitan; when I checked in and I asked if they had any Bellagio view rooms left, the only Red Room option available was on a smoking floor, so I declined it.

Checkout today went smoothly also, the line was long so I did self-checkout which only took a few minutes. 

Here's what lowered this rating to 3 stars instead of 4:
-I checked in on a Monday night around 8:30 PM. Whenever I've stayed at Bally's next door, I'm always greeted heartily and welcomed to the hotel. The front desk attendant was not rude by any means, but she basically just gave me my key and sent me on my way.
-The room was very nice but is definitely showing signs of its age, a few things were peeling here and there although really not anything super noticeable.
-and the main thing: I found a huge hairball by the door last night and the hairs in it were black and gray. I have brown hair so it definitely was not mine. (Gross!)

Reason: This recent stay at Paris was a VERY special one.

The surprise from my loving husband,
""I am taking you to Paris for our 2oth Anniversay!!"" 
I will tell our friends that I'm taking you to Paris for our 20th. I was able to fool a few friends per Facebook post. 
Although not the real deal, as in Paris France. I had an amazing 2Oth celebration @ Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino. 

Thank you to my hubby for taking care of the reservations. From booking the rooms, checking in, checking out, & footing the bill. I don't know how about payment part since he handle everything but I do know they charge a resort fee. 

Our room wasn't spectacular, the room we had was just simple. ( I had better but I wonder if my hubby mentioned celebrating our anniversary we would get the Red Room or something better ) 
I didn't like the hallway leading to our rooms, it was a little scary to me. There was no complimentary coffee in room. (I need a booster before I get to a Starbucks) We stayed for 3 nights, but despite a few minor complaints, I enjoyed our stay. 

Paris Las Vegas hotel & casino is located on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. The property is owned and operated by Caesars Entertainment Corp. As its theme is Paris, France, it includes a half scale 541- foot tall replica of the Eiffel Tower, a sign in the shape of Montgolfier balloon, a two-thirds size Arc de Triomphe, a replica of La Fontaine Des Mers, and a 1,200 seat theatre called Le Theatre des Arts. 

Paris hotel & casino is linked via a promenade to its sister property, Bally's and it is linked to the Las Vegas Monorail at Bally's \/ Paris Las Vegas station. 

Paris hotel & casino has 2,916 rooms & is home to the Jersey Boys. 

Make time to explore Paris Hotel & Casino, either dining, gambling, clubbing, shopping, there are lots to do & see!! 

Although we are here to celebrate our special day, I was a good wifey & let the hubby go & play. ( gamble) be sure to check what offers is available. We had $30.00 in game play for slot machines. 

Last advice, check out the pool, here you will be able to take a photo of the Eiffel Tower's background. 
Oh & don't forget, What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas!! 

Happy 20th & Happy 300th!!

I recently took a trip to Las Vegas to get my mind off of the hectic fall semester I endured at CSUN (Go Matadors!) and unsurprisingly was able to pass all of my classes and maintain a lovely GPA at a respectable level. So indeed I had many choices to decide upon but in the end, it was good ol' Las Vegas aka Sin City aka The City that Never Sleeps aka The Big Easy! Alas, I packed by bags, travelled 300+ miles without the unexpected wonderment of 'Fear and Loathing' episodes and spent a few nights at the heartland of Nevada.

Of course while there, one of the few casinos I wanted to immediately visit was none other than Paris itself! Once I self-parked, I ventured over to where the boys are separated from the men. Where one wrong move can emphasize your entire trip and where the clouds do not move at all!

Since this was my first time, I wanted to put it all on the table and go high! I had my lovely girlfriend by side and my favorite anti-dousche  jacket on. I was feelin' lucky. 

I began to feed the machine a barrage of US currency, betting MAX all the way because that's the way I 'roll.'I looked to my left. I looked to my right. Everything was moving along quite nicely until I noticed that all of my $15 were gone and that my girlfriend had actually won $4. Soon after, I retired from the world of amateur gambling and travelled on home, a road long divided...

There was nothing in the room about wifi or how to get to the pool, and calls still cost money (although everyone has a cell phone so I guess they still think this is a decade ago).

Pars has a relatively small public space compared to the monstorous hotels on the strip.  This doesn't mean it's dinky, it's actually quite quaint.  Fake cobblestones that don't tend to agree with the stiletto heel'd clad ladies, patisseries and eateries and water fountains.

I was enamored more so with the outside.  The Eiffel Towe, the Arc, The fountain, at night it was beautiful.

The rooms.  This is where I disagree on some choices the hotel made.  I canna speak for any other rooms as I think the D\/D and the Queen rooms are probably different, my single King was a good size, large and roomy.  The carpet, a garish houndstooth, was jarring to look at.  The red leather headboard was boardering bordello and the dinky loveseat was sad and small.

We were on our honeymoon, and had chosen Paris as our hotel.  Plenty of friends who honeymooned in Vegas has highly recommended Paris because of it's ""romantic"" vibe, location on strip and the perks they offered for newlyweds.

Well, it was a whole different story for us.  We arrived late for check-in, it was almost 9pm by the time the airport shuttle dropped us off.  We had indicated in our online reservations that it will be a late check-in, on our honeymoon, and requested a King bed.  When we got there, we mentioned that we were on our honeymoon.  We got a generic ""congratulations"" but nothing more than the usual check-in shenanigans.  We were assigned to the 32nd floor so we were super excited.  But the excitment soon faded as we entered our hotel room.  It was a small, 2-queen bed room which was a ""connecting room"" to a suite next door.  The only saving grace was the view from the room.  I was instantly disappointed due to the small room and 2 beds.  We later asked the front desk about switching, and they told us it would be the same size room but maybe an even lower floor so we decided just to keep this room.


The pool area was decent.  There were limited menus the few days we were there, and nothing on that interested us, so we didn't even order anything to eat or drink.

The one thing I do like about Paris is that location.  It was right in the center of the strip and it was very convenient to get to either South or North of the Strip.  Casars Palace, the Bellagio, Bally's, Flamingo, Planet Hollywood, The Quad, Cosmopolitan etc are all within reach.  The Miracle Mile Shops at PH was my favorite place to spend some time to get away from the outside.

Paris in general was a pretty small hotel.  The casino area is tiny, not a lot of choices on dining.  We did do a dinner at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant (more on that in a separate review) but nothing too impressive.  I probably won't stay at Paris again next time I am in Vegas.  Would I recommend it to other honeymooners?  Perhaps.  If they were expecting contemporary, probably not.  Paris needs to rennovate their rooms and decor... it's not 1999 anymore.",3,1,1

We called to confirm a late check-in and our reservation for a king with an upgraded strip view room since we knew our flight landed late and was assured our room would be held.  When we arrived we were told our reservation was only a request and they can't actually hold a room.  We were then given a downgraded queen room and a view of an alley, but still charged for the upgraded room.  The room was dark, dirty, dingy, carpet pealing up around the walls.  I immediately called the front desk fully expecting some understanding and a room change.  Brittany the manager clearly didn't care.  We immediately checked out when they refused to change our room, but they also refused to refund our money.  Brittany said we checked in late so she couldn't refund our money.  I pointed out that they couldn't hold our room for a late check-in but they can conveniently refuse a refund for a late check-in.  We notified them that we were immediately changing hotels.  We called Travelocity and explained the situation.  They called Paris to get our refund and had an equally bad experience with Brittany so they gave us a $25 gift card and said the refund would take a week to process.  A week later NO refund.  Paris Hotel told Travelocity we checked out 5 hours later when we were literally there 30 minutes (most of which was time arguing at the front desk about our room). And they charged us for two nights!  Travelocity got them to remove the 2nd night charge since according to Paris we ""checked out 5 hours later.""  The worst part was the sheer rudeness of the front desk manager. Unbelievable.  Taking your credit card, explaining they didn't hold your room,  downgrading, refusing a refund, then after you tell a manager that you refuse to stay there and requested to be checkout and leave, that manager intentionally charges you for a 2nd night after they know left in 30 minutes is not bad customer service IT'S SCAMMING YOU!

I've always liked visiting, mainly because of their Champagne Brunch on Sunday and also due to their cafe and crepe selections.  I am giving Paris a sad 3-star rating after actually staying here for 1 week.

The best features of this hotel are the restaurants and welcoming atmosphere.  The cobblestone floors give it a nice touch, although a bit tricky to walk on when wearing 5-inch Louboutins.

The Eiffel Tower is a beautiful landmark in the midst of high-rise buildings but their room accommodations are simply not up to par.  It isn't the most expensive hotel but for comparable rates I'd rather stay elsewhere.

Room = 2 stars
* a standard room during CES week (or any Convention week) is overpriced at all strip hotels but even if it wasn't CES week, they really need to update these horrible rooms.  At LEAST add a flatscreen TV.  I know these are available in their suites but it comes standard to new hotels so they need to stay competitive.  My biggest gripe was the bed. OMG!! After day 1, I thought I needed a chiropractor.  I suppose it doesn't help that my bed at home is a Tempur-Cloud Supreme.  My neck and back had kinks all week long!

Room Service = 3 stars
* I ordered room service 2x for lunch during my 6-night stay.  The 1st order arrived w\/in 20 mins and I was very pleased with their Spinach Salad and Rotisserie Chicken Noodle soup.  My 2nd order took over 1 hour to arrive.  I almost called to complain because over the phone they told me 30 to 40 mins.  My 2nd order was a tuna salad sandwich which is usually served in a Croissant but I opted for Rye bread instead.  It was delicious!  The clam chowder had a nice flavor although the clams weren't very big.  Both meals were reasonably priced around $30 including tip.

Housekeeping = 4 stars

WiFi = $14.95\/day

The only reason to go to Vegas in the middle of the summer is the cheap hotel rates. When the husband and I planned our trip, we got the Red Room for $110\/night. While we didn't really mind the room we had before, we wanted an upgrade. BTW, we're those rare people that go to Vegas and actually spend time in the room. Anyway.

We were offered an upgrade to a Strip view room, but we declined. The clerk also explained to us how their deposit\/debit card policy worked, which we appreciated. She sidestepped the deposit and just charged us for the room and tax. We had no plans to put anything else on the bill, which is why she did that. 

Onto the room. It's very red indeed. We had a nice mountain view where we watched the planes descend into McCarran. The king-sized bed was super comfy.

When we showed up for check-in, the express kiosks told us we still needed to visit the front desk. In total, our check-in experience took about 50 minutes. They said they were ""understaffed"" that day, but the next day at noon, they still only had a handful of agents with a massive line. So...I take it it's a chronic problem.

Not only that, but they didn't have the red room that we booked over a month in advance and thus downgraded us to the Classic room. They requested we return to the front desk area the next day to claim keys for the room we ACTUALLY ""reserved"". Oh, and make sure you come after 1pm, but no later than 6pm! Not that you have plans on vacation or anything. To ""compensate"", they waived resort fees for that night. They claimed there was ""nothing else they could do"" since rooms were booked through a third party.

When we did show up to the front desk the next day to claim new keys, we waited in yet another line and were given different story by another employee. The room type was ""not guaranteed"" and we didn't get a Red Room because it ""wasn't available"", but they definitely ""hadn't overbooked it"". What horseshit.

The room itself is just as bad as reviews say. The decor is tacky and cheap, the tv has randomly been mounted on the wall and the fridge moved inside of a wardrobe where the old tv used to be, there's not even a coffeepot, and the sheets are some of the worst I've ever had - very scratchy and cheap. Frankly, I've had better guest experiences at the Holiday Inn. I'm not even sure I'd tell my ex to stay here. 

We were able to sort it out with the third party to cancel the remaining two nights of our stay, thank god. I will never be staying with Paris again, and will likely never stay in any Caesar's resorts. Extremely greedy company that doesn't give a rat's ass about the guest experience once you pay.

We upgraded to a room with a view of the strip, opened the window, and there was the Eiffel Tower. Pow! The pool is lovely, although a bit chilly this time of year. The street walk (inside) really does remind me of Paris, although the prices are too high. I was looking for quality croissants or French rolls, and didn't find them, sadly. 

With the upgrade we got continental breakfast and drinks and ""appetizers"" at night. We felt that was a great bargain because the night food became our dinner. And two drinks apiece per night was plenty. The breakfast was plenty, too, with yogurt, fruit and cheese, bagels and lox, and so on. Much more than ""continental"" suggests.

The worst thing about the Paris is the Frankie Valli music in the elevators--yuck! After listening to that ad nauseum, I would never see ""Jersey Boys.""

The second worst is the loud, pounding music that hit our room until 4:30 am (!), and we were on the 21st floor (!!!).

But this place needs a major update in attitude and energy. Workers move slowly like they don't care. The spa, for which they automatically add a resort fee, had a broken sauna and jacuzzi in the men's and broken sauna in the women's. Considering that they only have 3 amenities in there, not cool. Also completely apologetic. When I asked the staff to light the sauna, the response was ""It's broken, remember I told you this morning??""

We got pretty fed up with the overall experience and left. Headed next door to Planet Hollywood for dinner and our experience was 100x better.

Our luck at Paris Las Vegas changed all that and made me love Las Vegas against my will.

We got there to check in pretty late (9pm) and we surmise that they ran out of whatever room I reserved on hotels.com for $85. They said they were upgrading us, and did actually mention it was to a room that is normally $1700 a night just so next time we might want to ""splurge for an upgrade"" (instead of really saying, ""Well, you already paid and we don't have any cheap rooms left and you're only staying for one night, and we probably can't sell this room to anyone tonight, so I guess you get it"") but nothing prepared us for what we found.

First off we had to go up to something like the 18th floor, nearly the top floor. Then the rooms on that floor all had names (ours was Nice, like the place in France). Then we opened the door and it was ridiculous. The entry was a fancy sitting room and formal dining table. There was also the entrance to a small bathroom in the entry. As you turned the corner, then there was a bar. Then the separate bedroom, with a TV that mechanically rose up out of a cabinet when you pressed the remote's power button. And the bathroom - huge shower that could probably fit 5 or 6 people in it, a 2 person tub, a separate bidet and toilet.... it was ridiculous.

And it made us want to live it up a little. We promptly went out and had a nicer meal that I was anticipating springing for, so their little trick worked in some small way. I'm never going to splurge for a fancy hotel room like they suggested, but they did get some $$ out of us at Mon Ami Gabi. ;)

I did like the way they had designed the casino and the shops, it borders on cheesy, but it has a lot more personality than some of the other places we checked out when wandering around. 

The only thing that was a bummer was that they charged us $15 for 24 hrs of internet access. No other hotel we stayed at charged us for that. I felt that was a huge ripoff. Bad business decision. Maybe they figure only business people want to access the internet in Vegas? I dunno.",1,0,1

1) super friendly and accommodating staff
2) hotel is a little dated
3) great location on the strip

I stayed at the Paris hotel for a week for business. I booked a king standard room but when I arrived they were out of that room style so they gave me a room with two double beds and an Eiffel Tower view. I also had to leave about 15 items at the bell desk for co-workers and the staff was really accommodating. The view was great! The room wasn't anything super special and a little dated but nice overall with a pretty big bathroom. 

There are a few good restaurants and bars in the hotel including Mon Ami Gabi and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. There is also a piano bar, Napoleans, that had some really talented pianists in the week I was there. There is also a club, Chateau here. The club is probably not a top club in Vegas but the view from the ""rooftop"" deck is great and the DJs were great the few times I went.

The location of the hotel is great, it is in the middle of the strip so you can walk almost anywhere. The hotel is connected to Ballys so you can get to monorail station without having to walk outside.

Parking here is a cinch and upon entering Paris you're in between Paris and Bally's. Check-in was easy with a separate private office area for Diamond members. The room itself has a modern and clean look very sophisticated and nice with plenty of closet space with a fridge below the TV and a separate bath tub and shower.

Really an overpriced typical tacky LV experience. I think Parisians everywhere are crying at the comparison. I did think it was a riot that the informational video on how to exit the hotel in case of a fire is done by a french guy (or someone pretending to have a bad french accent.) It has a VERY smoky casino-if you're a non-smoker, you will reek by the time you get to and from your hotel room as you try to exit the hotel. The concierges were probably the least helpful of any I've used. And it is the slowest place ever. Every restaurant in the building has a line outside and empty tables inside. My guess is they're trying to create an impression of a desirable place with people waiting outside. We ate at the cafe--they are all generic so I can't say which one. I ordered a bagel--think dunkin donuts bagel. I waited probably 10 or 15 minutes to order it and then another 5-10 to get it. There are three registers--when I was there each one had about 8-12 people in line and one--yes one-person preparing the ""to go"" food. We had two bagels, a banana and a small juice and it was about $15. The room itself was not bad and I do like that they have a spoke-and-wheel sort of set up for the hotel rooms so no room is really next to the elevators where you would have to listen to people coming and going all night. But in their attempt to replicate a European experience, they have the shower with just a raised marble divider from the shower and the main bath area. The drain grate for the shower is at the high point of the slanted, angled floor, which is problematic since water doesn't typically drain upwardly. Consequently, the floor in the bathroom gets very wet and extremely slippery. (water on marble.) Also, there is a massive armoire in the room and because it takes up the bulk of one side, the flat screen TV is way off to the side, which makes it difficult to view from one of the beds.",0,1,0

We checked into the Paris hotel with 4 girls on a ladies weekend. We had hopes of many things! 
1. A room facing the fountain at the Bellagio! 
2. A glorious deep bath tub in which to relax in!
3. Friendly staff!
4. Crepes at the fabulous brunch buffet!
5. A fun casino to play in!
6. Some night time dancin!
So guess how many of those hopes came true?
Z E R O
1. The fountain room would be an extra $50 a night. No thank you.
2. The tub was dirty, shallow and was nothing compared to Palazzo or Mandalay tubs.
3. Every single staff member we encountered was rude and condescending.
4. The buffet line was out to the parking garage, so we peaced out and went to Hash House a go go (some serious nommers, you should check it out http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-2#hrid:PpsyEgiZV6pOR9d866UdjA
5. The casino was always empty, not fun atmosphere and a huge minimum to play. We weren't down to gamble in a place with this much bad juju, so we took our business elsewhere. 
6. We saw the pattern of suckiness from Paris, so we went to another hotel to get our groove on.

The hotel itself is very nice inside and definately errs on the side of tasteful and classy - if anything in Vegas can be called either of those things! I'm a bit of a sucker for the kitsch so I liked the interior designed to look like a French street. I have to say, having been to Paris it's a fair representation. Upon check in, I had read that you have to give the receptionist a credit card which they will charge $25 per day, per person. This is NOT the case. The receptionist asked me if I wanted to give her a credit card for incidentals but in no way was it a ""requirement"". Our room, was OK. Quite large but seems a little run down. Since I am a smoker I opted for a smoking room and in retorspect I shouldn't have because it really did smell very musty. Considering you can smoke almost anywhere in Vegas there was no need to have a smoking room. We tried to coax the receptionist into giving us an upgrade to a room with a view of the strip and were told that we could do that for an additional $59 a night - errrr no. So we had no view at all which was dissappointing but not the end of the world. The pool is beautiful, huge and pretty empty considering the 3000 rooms in the hotel. The little cafe \/ bar by the side of the pool has drinks and food at reasonable prices and a happy hour from 4-6 each day. I'll Yelp the inidividual resturants etc inside the hotel in a seperate post but all were good in quality and not too badly prices although I realize gone are the days of the $5 buffett. Half price martini's at the casino bar from noon til 7pm was a nice break from the pool bar prices.

At the very beginning when I went to check in, you initially told me that instead of the 5 nights that had been reserved, there was only 1 night reserved. I had to get out of line, ask my boss for the confirmation email, then wait in line for 45 minutes. When I got to the front, you shut down several of the check-in desks so there was only one open to the general public. When I explained that I had a 5 night reservation, your check-in agent gave me attitude. Finally, she went and got a manager, who explained that while there was a 5 night reservation, only 1 night was paid for. That was fine, and should have been explained before I had to go wait in line and listen to the agent tell me that I didn't know what I was talking about. 

When the time came for me to utilize the cashier, he told me that I needed ID, which I'd left in my purse in one of the ballrooms. This was in spite of the fact that the machines were quite willing to take my bills, but for some reason breaking them down into 10's by the cashier required ID.

On my second-to-last night at Paris, I went to take a shower. I grabbed the top wash rag that had been nicely folded and supplied by housekeeping earlier that day. When I got under the shower head and opened the wash rag to add shower gel, I found someone's fake eyelash stuck to the wash rag. So gross.

The following evening, I came back to my room after a long day at a conference only to find that housekeeping had apparently been snacking in my room since they dropped some type of nut on the floor next to the bed. 

I tweeted a photo of the nuts on the floor to Paris, but all they did was offer to send housekeeping up the next morning. I'd cleaned up the nuts the evening I found them, and I find it appalling that they didn't do anything to try to actually make the situation right for me.

I am HUGE lover of the city of Paris and anything related to it. My apartment is Paris-themed with Eiffel Towers, macarons, bonjour signs, etc. everywhere. I was disappointed that my boyfriend couldn't get us hotel reservations at the Paris Hotel, but after visiting it this past weekend, I was actually kinda glad that we didn't end up staying there.

This hotel looks beautiful on the outside. The huge Eiffel Tower, of course, is a smaller, fit-to-scale version of the real thing in Paris. The building with all of the rooms in it actually looks like many of the buildings in Paris. They also have the Arc de Triomphe which is quite a spectacle as well.

My bf and I came here to dine at Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant. Because of where we parked in the garage, we had to walk through a bit of the shops and restaurants to get to where Steak was located on the main casino floor. It feels as if you are roaming the streets of Europe, but nothing inside the whole shopping\/restaurant area really screamed PARIS to me. It was just like European-esque, but not really Paris. Also, I felt kind of claustrophobic in there because although the Venetian and Caesars Palace have the same thing where you feel like you're walking in Europe and there's a fake sky ceiling above, I feel like the ones in Paris are much lower and it just felt...busy and stuffy. 

The smell from the restaurants was slightly nauseating. It gave me gross flashbacks of bad quality, overpriced Italian from Disneyland near Pirates of the Caribbean. That is super specific but it was not bringing back good memories for me. Kinda like the smell when you first start riding on Pirates and you pass by the Blue Bayou restaurant...hahaha.

We were excited to be staying there for the first time, especially since it had been given four stars.

When we walked into the hotel I was pretty impressed with what I saw. It seemed very nice and I liked how everything was designed to be like you're walking outside in Paris. When we walked into our room though, I was somewhat disappointed. For the price we were paying it wasn't as nice as what I was expecting, or what I'm used to. Everything seemed old and a little dingy. The bathroom was the nicest part of the room. Now, I know that most people think, ""Well, the room doesn't matter that much because I'm only going to be in it a few hours to sleep."" I agree with this to a point. When I'm in Vegas I'm away from my kids so I stay out later than normal, so I usually catch a little nap in the afternoon before going out again at night. So I do spend a little more time in my hotel room than most people maybe. 

Another turn off, our room smelled like sewer! It was disgusting! I mean, how am I supposed to rest up for another wild night when I'm trying not to gag?! It was gross.

After being out and about during the day, we would always come back to a clean room. However, one morning while getting out of the shower I reached for towel only to open it and find that it was DIRTY! Also, we left our room on Sunday morning and the hall was littered with room service trays, glasses and beer bottles. No big deal as long as it gets cleaned up, right? No one cleaned it up until Monday afternoon!

Overall, we were disappointed. Not very clean, and it stunk! We won't be staying there again.The valet service, however, was good",7,0,0

I stayed at the Paris with two friends during a Hen Party weekend and I do love the location. They also have the most fabulous public bathrooms on the Strip. Trust me, ladies, photo ops abound in the Paris bathrooms. Just don't be shy. 

The room was large enough for three girlies to fit comfortably and we loved the location since it was central to everything. Also, splitting it three ways made it super reasonable. We hung out by the pool one day and I enjoyed it, though I wouldn't suggest the overpriced cabanas. The chaises are just as fun and you can still have alcohol and section yourself off.

I would stay in the Paris again. If I got the chance to stay in the Venetian instead, I would, but the Paris is a great second choice.",1,0,0

Got the Picardy room which is more than enough space for a family of 5 but got moved to an even bigger and better room The Marsielle 5 toilets, 3 bathrooms, 2 oversize jacuzzi 2 bedrooms and a huge living and dining area . Amaze-balls!! I don't know if it was just pure luck that weekend cause i did good to on the slots ..heehee.. I just hope I get the same treatment for UFC fight week this July ..but doubt it cause it'll be a forth of July weekend but who knows ..

My husband and I were guests (or should I say victims) of the Paris hotel from 11\/4-11\/6, and there were multiple issues with not only the room, but service, spa, and professionalism as well. 

Upon arrival at the hotel (and waiting for an hour while 1 clerk managed a line of 100 guests), we were told our reservation was not ready, and while scrambling to find a room for us, we were placed in a room that was heavily filled with smoke, had a dirty bathroom (dried vomit on the toilet) that my husband had to clean personally so that I could use it, and the TV was on.   After cleaning the bathroom personally, we called down to the front desk to request housekeeping service and left the room to allow for the cleaning to take place.   This was our first visit to the Paris, and it took some MAJOR convincing, as we are very faithful to ENCORE.  So here we were, wondering within the first few minutes if we had made a huge mistake booking this hotel.   Upon returning to our room, we inspected everything and it appeared to be cleaned, however the room was still filled with the stench of old, filthy cigarette smoke.  We remained in the room for the evening, however woke up with breathing issues and allergies due to the poor ventilation and immense smoke residue(this was a non-smoking floor, by the way).  

Our second ZERO STAR experience was attempting a relaxing treatment at the MANDARA spa.  We booked a service for 11\/5 and it was a train wreck of incompetence, unprofessionalism, and possible fraudulent charge swapping l from start to finish.   After waiting for 15 minutes at an unmanned front desk, my husband was finally ushered into the men's spa for treatment.  The massage was brief and very poor quality; he communicated certain muscle groups that he wanted attention given to, and the masseuse disregarded his requests and just did her own thing.   The lack of enthusiasm and willingness to provide a service to a client is unacceptable when paying this much money.  Following the shitty massage, my husband retreated to the jacuzzi, and alas, it was out of order.   This was not disclosed during the booking, and I was completely irate.  A full selection of amenities are not only necessary but required in my opinion.   My husband was asked to walk from the Paris spa (after his treatment) to the planet Hollywood spa to use their facility and they offered to take 10% off of his service as an apology.  What they did NOT tell him is that the 10% they removed from his bill was from the tip line meant for the masseuse.  Is this even legal???  This is beyond shady in my book, and truly represents a brand that does not put forth the time and effort to ensure customer OR employee satisfaction.  My husband got dressed and walked to PH to use the jacuzzi, but by this time he was frustrated and disgusted by the lack of professionalism,  shady accounting, and overall bad service. 

We spoke to the front desk immediately to address these concerns and were told that the spa charge would be removed from our bill, and that they would place us into a non-smoking room on another floor with better ventilation.  We did keep in mind that this is Las Vegas, and we would be exposed to smoking in the casino, however we have high expectations for non-smoking rooms to the extent that there will not be a heavy smoke scent in the bed\/pillows\/towels\/carpet.  

Naturally, I got my folio this morning and none of the charges were adjusted, and it appears I was charged resort fees for 3 days (even after confirming these would not be charged).  

The level of incompetence that resides within the hotel industry is truly mind boggling.  I hope to have this issue resolved in the near future, but if Vegas has taught me anything, I will not be betting on it.",10,3,2

On our 5th night we were dismayed that the guests in the room next to us were smoking an ""illegal substance"" and the aroma\/smoke was coming into our room.  I've never had this problem in any other hotel stay and had to complain.  We explanined that we are drug tested by our employer and it was a problem.  It was 11 pm and the only solution they had was to move us!!  We had to pack up all of our belongings and relocate.  They wouldn't ask our neighbors to cease their behavior.

We checked in around 9pm on a Thursday, 3 people working and if we had walked in a minute later, would have been in line for more than half an hour. Glad we beat the rush! Make sure to check your email before checking out as that was a nightmare, and they do offer an online checkout option. 

Pros: 
- Spacious room, quiet, air conditioning worked great, bed was pretty comfortable too. 
- I love that there are designated elevators for a smaller number of floors - this definitely helped with not having to pick up half the hotel every time on the way down from floor 29! 
- The lobby\/casino is very cute and adds a great ambience
- Location, location, location! Right next to the Miracle Mile Shops, across from the Bellagio, right in the middle of the strip. CVS is a short 5 minute walk as well, would recommend stocking up on waters and drinks there as the hotel charges about $8 for a bottle. 
- Large pool with plenty of lounge chairs and sun all day. (no hot tub though) 

Cons: 
- Plan to use Uber? They'll make you walk around the hotel to the north (back) entrance, down the side of the hotel (walking towards Caesar's Palace, turn right after the Mon Ami Gabi restaurant). The taxi concierge recommended we use a private car when we wanted to go to Fremont Street and there were 6 of us - would have been $55 one way! One uber was $15 for comparison. 
- Pool was extremely dirty from hairs floating in the pool and the murky sunscreen-and cigarette ash-filled water (seriously, does it even have a filter?) I understand that some people come to Vegas for a smoking holiday, but sitting on the steps chain smoking and flicking ash into the pool should at the very least, be discouraged. I asked a poolside waitress if that was allowed and she literally shrugged and walked off. Dirty, cast-off towels were strewn all about the entire pool area as well, no staff were there to clean them up so it only adds to the general run-down aesthetic.
- Poolside drinks were definitely price-gouged. $16 for a watered-down frozen margarita out of a machine? The food was terrible as well, with very little to choose from. 

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the Paris and was impressed with its incredibly central location. I loved being across from the Bellagio and if you are offered an upgrade, I would take it so you can see the fountain show from your room! 

Being right next to the Miracle Mile shops and Cabo Wabo was great as well. Would definitely recommend unless you're going to Vegas to strictly hang by the pool!",4,0,0

Staff is great, lots of high end shops and resturants, and a perfect location on the strip. As for my room, I had an upper floor facing Bellagio and Eiffel tower. Room was clean, but it is showing quite a bit of wear and tear, and I feel that a nice refurbishment is needed. Carpets are starting to get the worn feeling. The room had a flat panel LCD TV with a decent amount of channels. As for the food....I highly recommend the buffet for dinner, but not breakfast (Planet Hollywood for breakfast buffet is better). There is a small crepe shop on the main shopping aisle that is EXCELLENT!!!! Overall, I really liked the Paris hotel, but for my next trip, I may try another hotel, just out of curiosity. One downside is a fairly hefty resort fee of $22 per night, but it does include wi-fi for one device. Additional devices are $15, so it's a bit pricy on that end.",0,0,0

We requested early check in (1 pm instead of 4 pm, since we had a wedding to go to at 5:30 pm), and they do not confirm or ensure you really have early check in... until you are there! For the price, it's ridiculous. Then the room... old, noisy (we could hear every second of the room next door running water, for 3 days), no coffee\/tea in the room (are you kidding? There is a mini Keurig in every single hotel room I've stayed!), no min bar, 3 medium size towels in total, for 2 people!, 1 tiny shower gel and one tiny shampoo - for two people! Then the coffee, again. There is an ""express coffee"" service, presumably because there isn't any coffee in the room!, they say in big bold letters in the room service booklet ""12$, in 20 minutes or less or it's free!"". We order coffee, after 30 minutes nothing comes up. We are now late. My boyfriend calls down again and they say ""oh, he is on his way"". ""But it's going to be free, since it's been way longer than 20 minutes"". ""No, WE DON'T HONOUR THAT ANYMORE"". Really. We tell you we do, but we don't, just you spent 23 $ on one coffee (12*+8$ delivery+tip) and it took 43 minutes. This is a pretty bad place to stay.",1,0,0

When I first got there, I went to check in and the line was fairly massive. I finally get to the front around 2pm, and am told I need to wait 1 hour for a room, but that I can check my bags. I go to the concierge and ask, and they point me outside, where there is no clear place to go. And it's 100 degrees. So I keep my bag and find a place to sit down and work.

No internet. Unless you pay $15\/night for a wired connection in your room. We were there for a business convention, so this is completely unacceptable. One conference room had internet. ONE.

I call in an hour, and they tell me my room isn't ready yet. I have a presentation in an hour, so I ask if there's anything they can do to get me in sooner, and they do it without a problem. OK, so if there is a room ready, why didn't you give it to me when I asked the first time? My boss wasn't able to check in until 5pm (he got there at 8am).

The room was decent, but pretty old. The toilet barely flushed the first day, and actually got clogged up the second. The TV remote barely worked. Also, the lights in the room were strangely located- on the outside of the beds, rather than in the middle. And the bathroom had a nice mirror with extra magnification, except I'm 5'6"" and could barely reach it. The shower had no light over it, and lost hot water during one of my showers.

Overall, not recommended. There are much better places to stay on the strip, for the same (or lower) price.",2,1,0

Turned out to be not my cup of tea for so many different reasons.

First of all it is very difficult making a right turn into the hotel because cars pulling into the hotel share the same light as pedestrians - and there are throngs of them at all times!  Be prepared to sit in traffic and wait.  Better yet make a left turn into the hotel from the opposite side of the Strip.

I like to feel that wow factor from the moment I check in to a hotel to when I check out.  I certainly did not feel that vibe in the hotel registration area.  There was nothing grand about it and I certainly could not feel it with the clientele there (think fried 80's style perms).  

Then there's the rooms.  We reserved one of the updated Red Rooms but my hotel room at the Hampton Inn for a work trip was even nicer.  The hotel, even with the renovation, just screamed old, and the rooms were small.  Bathroom towels were thin and rough and many of them were dirty.  In addition the only mirrors were in the bathroom - not female friendly :p

Worst of all: cobblestone on the casino floor leading up to the guest elevators.  Talk about not being female friendly!  Hard enough to walk on that kind of floor in flats so imagine high heels!  

The good thing about the hotel is its location (if you are walking).  Was easy to get to Planet Hollywood, Cosmopolitan, and Bellagio where we did a lot of our eating and shopping.  Also, Sugar Factory is right there and they have good food and good celebrity spotting at times.  (Heard good things about Gordon Ramsay Steak but didn't eat there on that trip.)

What I did like was the restaurants which were great, the ambiance was lovely, and they really made me feel like I was walking around in Paris.  I love how the ceiling is painted like a sunny summer sky, where the clouds seemed to move as you walked around.  Very cool.  I loved the location and it was awesome to see a mini Eiffel tower all the time.  

I have 4 complaints.  I really hate the elevators.  I was in town for my brother's wedding and unfortunately my family were all on different floors.  The set-up has 3 different elevators.  One for floors 2-15, the next 16-26 and the third 26-33.  I hated how in order to go to different rooms, I had to ride the elevator back down to the 3rd or 1st floor, cross the hall and go over to another elevator.  That was beyond irritating.  My 2nd complaint is the rooms with a view.  Our first room, we had a BEAUTIFUL view of the Eiffel Tower and the pool at the base.  Lovely, unless it's on a Wednesday, Friday or Saturday night.  The club on the Eiffel Tower has music blaring until 4am. It was so loud, I felt like the music was in our actual room.  I suppose that's okay if the visitor plans on staying up all night, and I never go to bed early, but 4am is a little TOO late.  We switched rooms the next day, with no view, but we were able to sleep earlier than 4am.   I asked customer service about the amount of complaints they get about the club, and they said they got several, but with that club bringing in a supposed $1 million a week, they have no plans to close it.  My third complaint was the keys.  No one told us your cell phone can demagnetize our cards.  Unfortunately, my sister in law decided to go back to her room while my brother, my boyfriend and I checked out another hotel.  My sister in law realized her key didn't work until it was too late.  When she went down to the front desk they expected that she was trying to break into the hotel, gave her hell and even threw the key out in front of her.  Her phone had died, so she couldn't get ahold of any of us who were out.  She finally took to twitter to blast Paris, and someone from customer service quickly contacted her and fixed the solution.  My 4th complaint was the staff.  As I stated before, they were not very friendly to my sister in law.  Most employees didn't seem too happy which made me think bad management.  We had a few helpful people, but too many unhelpful ones.

Inside, there are cute little shops, cafes, bakeries, etc that curve around and resemble streets in Paris (not that I've been there, so I guess I wouldn't know...).  They have these delicious souvenir drinks that come in huge plastic eiffel towers or in this porcelain china whatever handmade balloon. It's only $13 and they fill it with alcohol that hits you like a bat an hour later and you get to keep it as a souvenir w00t.

I have no idea what the hotel rooms look like but I'm sure they're adorable as well.  Concierge is super nice.. we pretended to be guests so he gave us a bunch of passes to clubs we wanted to hit up that night (much easier than dealing with those shady people on the street who make you tip them for passes).  I've been to the top of the Eiffel Tower before and it's gorgeous! You get a really nice view of the strip and there is a restaurant up there as well which is ridiculously expensive.  It does cost some money to go up but if you've never been, it's worth the one trip while touristing around in Vegas - I recommend going up at night though.

Sure, it's not as classy and suave as the Wynn or Palazzo but I just love that this place COULD be tacky but isn't.  It's not TOO expensive for college students.. or maybe 6 of them.. to a room, but I think it's worth it.  Maybe when I achieve baller status some day I can stay in the Venezia Towers or something extravagant but for now, I'll dream small and try to stay here next time.


EDIT: Stayed here over the weekend with the boyfriend in a suite and it was SWEET - 2 bathrooms, one of which had a HUGE bathtub with jets, nice sitting area, huge bed, I didn't want to leave. Service was great and super prompt. Okay, next time I'm staying at the Wynn.

Also went to the Le Village Buffet - I haven't been able to eat anything substantial for the last 24 hours.",7,7,7

We received a free upgraded room upon check in because it was my wife's 30th birthday (actually when they upgraded us, they listed as a honeymoon instead because they said the system wouldn't let them upgrade for birthday, pretty funny). The casino wasn't overly crowded so you could play your choice of machines or table games for the most part. The casino did feel smaller than most on the strip and has a bit of an odd layout. The Eiffel Tower ride is definitely worth checking out, especially with a 2 for 1 coupon. 

The room felt old and in need of renovation. The bed was about as hard as if I had slept on the casino floor! There were strange black marks on the sheets which I assume were marker, but this is Vegas so who knows.  The TV was a vintage 1995 model with speakers that made an annoying buzzing sound but then again aside from a quick weather channel check if you are spending your time in Vegas watching TV you are doing something wrong! No free printing your boarding passes here- $5.00 for 5 mins of computer access on a slow and buggy computer by the elevators in the casino. 

Overall - Meh. It wasn't great or horrible I would consider staying here again if the rates were great due to the mid-strip location and don't regret staying here, but it wasn't spectacular. My wife said she felt like our (free upgrade) room was something out of a  Holiday Inn.",2,0,0

Nothing luxurious as the other hotels I've stayed in on the strip, but I guess I was expecting a bit more since Paris is fairly new (not really, but compared to Flamingo, yes it is fairly new).  We stayed here for the Thanksgiving holiday weekend for around $250 total for 2 nights (Friday-Sunday).

Our bathroom sink was totally clogged.  At first it was just slow to drain, but by our second day, the sink was just clogged.  Had to use the bathtub to brush my teeth and wash my face in the morning!

Housekeeping was satisfactory as they responded to our request for more bath towels within an hour.  We didn't use housekeeping services to clean our room so I don't have any say on that.

If you're planning to have anybody sleep on the floor, bring some extra blankets.  Most hotel beds usually have 2 blankets (one blanket and one cover blanket), but Paris' beds only had one blanket and used a flat sheet as a cover.  

There are no resort fees, but that means you have to pay extra fees if you want the extra amenities.  Wifi costs $15 per day.  Gym use is $25, I think.  My sister-in-law paid $28 for admission to the hotel's spa and enjoyed their amenities.  

Otherwise, a convenient location to stay at.  So convenient to go downstairs in the early morning for a breakfast buffet at Le Village (my favorite buffet for breakfast) and avoid the long lines that will form around 10am.",1,0,0

Cons:
-Main room: wooden details and knobs ripped off the large entertainment stand, hideous loveseat and couch (I really wish I would have taken pictures).
-Bathroom: crack in the door, stains on the ceiling, the heaviest blow-dryer I have used in ten years, bad wallpaper, shower curtain held on with plastic clips (hard to move and tacky).
-They are charging a resort fee for Internet Access and Fitness Center use for $22.80\/night. I understand if it's summer and you're paying for the pool and towels, but it's winter and I think the resort fee should be waved. 

Pro: Great bed

Luckily when in Vegas, your room doesn't matter very much! So on to the good stuff. The Paris Hotel has a lot of great restaurants in it and my favorite is Mon Ami Gabi - I go every time I'm in Vegas (you should sit outside to people watch and see the Bellagio water show). Also attached to the hotel is Sugar Factory: American Brassier, which is 24\/7 and has a cheesecake factory menu (choices), fairly priced, and they have super fun drinks and desserts!

Our room was clean EXCEPT for the comforter that had something like sh*t on it which I really don't know how housekeeping could have missed such a blatant sight and stank! but they changed it. Other than this the hotel's grounds are pleasant and the Paris theme is nice. We were in a king bed Burgundy room and the room was on the small side but had a safe, fridge, desk, chair, tub and shower  and I think I saw robes in the closet. They have a nice selection of restaurants but be prepared to spend BIG$$$. Even the cafe's prices went up... our lunch almost $80.00 but that's nothing compared to what we spent on dinner.  I see everyone complains about the prices but the only way it will change is to complain and STOP patronaging these places. What happened to Vegas? boy I sure do miss the way it used to be.  I do like that you can walk from Paris to Ballys without going outside but this walkway is always super crowded because they have  restaurants and shops there but it's charming.  Paris is in a good location.  The casino, as with all of  Caesars casinos has changed dramatically throughout recent years making it impossible to win anything anymore. Nothing comes out of their machines and it has become quite boring. Your gambling money disappears in a third of the time now. It used to be so much fun in the casinos but no more.  The strippers, oh I mean dancers (lol! ) on the tables was quite obnoxious and in your face. It changes Paris from upscale to crapscale. Don't you go to strip clubs for this trash. They've replaced most of the video poker machines with those ridiculous penny machines. They are alienating a very loyal customer base which will eventually catch up to them.

If it weren't for the way my night ended, this might not get so many stars. I am petrified of heights and convinced that I'm going to die in an elevator. Isn't this the perfect thing for me? 

My boyfriend wanted to go up so we and a friend from our group decided to go up. We had a coupon for 2-for-1 tickets (in the fun book from signing up for the IP player's club) but the guy gave us all 3 tickets for $4.50 each. There was a decent line to wait in (about 20 minutes) before getting on the elevator. I questioned the number of people they crammed in to go up, but that could be due to my paranoia. 

Once at the top, the view was breathtaking. All the lights and the warm breeze at 10pm made it a fabulous setting for viewing the water show at Bellagio. We (I because I'm so short) didn't have a very good view since people were already lined up along that side of the observation deck. As soon as it ended people cleared out.

So why would I give a place 5 stars that just seems like a touristy thing to waste money on? Well, after the Bellagio water show, my boyfriend told me there was another reason he wanted to go up the Tower. Before I knew it, he was on one knee proposing! Needless to say, this place will always have a special place in my heart. Now he needs to take me to Paris, France!",0,0,1

1) Pillows were small and hard--- sore neck. Bed was old and bulged in center.
2) Could not get water hot enough to enjoy shower 3\/3 days. 
3) Internet was slow and intermittent. I called the desk--- was put on hold for over 10 min. Called back and a maintenance person came to the room and explained the wireless system was quite old and wireless routers only on every other floor.

Of course at check out he had never made a note of it and they had no record of him coming to the room (they claim all service calls are noted).

Of course, I'd rather stay at the Bellagio across the street for the amenities\/restaurants\/ambiance than Paris.  But this hotel certainly garners 3 stars for its central location alone. There's also a free shuttle that takes you to Rio and it runs every half hour from 10am to 1am

Check-in and check-out were speedy, although the woman who took care of us could be more welcoming.  The concierge staff was extremely helpful and the housekeeping did a great job in cleaning our room which was spacious enough to hold 2 queen beds, a big armoire, a business table and 2 chairs.

Overall, I can't say I was impressed, but it was a decent experience.

When we checked in, we requested a non smoking room, but got put into a smoking room, so we had to go back to the lobby to get our rooms switched.  Also, the next morning, after having been out until 6am, we were woken up by the sounds of construction at 9am down at the fountain \/ pool area on a Saturday.  We could hear the hammering loud and clear in our room, even on the 14th floor, and there were about 20 construction workers renovating the foundtain next to the eiffel tower.

When we went down to complain about the construction, we were greeted with a rather cold lady at the check in desk who gave us a ""well that's when the start of business is so there's nothing we can do.""  She later offered to switch our rooms, but would have put us towards the back of the hotel without a view, so we declined, especially since she seemed incredibly unfriendly at that point and would probably have put us in the basement if she could.  No apology or offers of any kind, just a flat out, sorry, deal with it kind of attitude.  That was the major turn off for me, because most hotels try to give guests the best experience possible, and at the very least, would apologize for the construction, especially at NINE IN THE MORNING.  Saturday?  Seriously?  

The one nice perk is that you can be put on the guest list for Chateau if you stay at the hotel, which saves on cover if you want to check out the club.  It's got a great outdoor section right under the eiffel tower, so overall a very nice atmosphere and venue.  

The room itself with pretty standard, although I was a bit disappointed by the bed, which was not very comfortable.  It definitely loses to Cosmo, Palms, and even Treasure Island in terms of comfort.  It also has one of those fridges with the stocked mini bar so you can't keep any of your own stuff cold.

The tables are fun, because it usually isn't as crowded as the other casinos on the strip.  Also, the dealers at the tables are incredibly friendly, unlike their counterparts at the front desk.

While Paris may be starting to show it's age a bit, particularly in comparison with some of the newer mega-resorts on the strip, it is still a pretty good option if you're looking for an affordable place to stay right in the heart of the strip.  We had a standard room and declined the ""special offer"" of upgrading to a newly renovated room for $20 per night (special in quotes as I understand that EVERYONE in a standard room is given this offer).  The standard room was a bit worn down, with some spots of peeling wallpaper, carpeting that had seen better days, and some pretty banged up (but still perfectly functional) furniture.  For me, this room was simply a place to sleep and clean up, not somewhere I planned to hang out.  It's Las Vegas, who is just sitting around in their room?  Despite that, it was certainly clean enough, quiet, and even the view was nice.  The staff were all friendly & helpful.  The bellmen in particular were excellent, taking good care of our things despite arriving hours before check-in, and then again for a number of hours after we checked out before catching the red-eye back home.  Also, despite having a check-in time listed as either 3 or 4 PM depending on where you look, the front desk will actually start checking you in at 2 PM without penalty, and even sooner than that if the rooms are available and you're willing to pay an early booking fee.  I would suggest getting there early if possible, because once 3 PM or so rolled around, check-in looked to be a bit of a goat rodeo every time we'd walk by.  Gaming in the casino was fairly typical of strip casinos - payouts seemed tight, and there were little to no low-stakes tables available, but all the dealers and floor personnel were friendly and competent.

Pissed off to no end about getting woken up so damn early while on vacation. They moved us from the 4th floor to the 27th, where at least our view of the parking lot was improved thanks to fact that we were 23 floors higher and could now see the lights on the strip.

The hotel's location is tough to beat - center strip with a great view of the Fountains of Bellagio. The casino is pretty cool because they haven't dethemed the hell out of the place like MGM has done with Luxor, Treasure Island, NYNY. The reason Paris gets 2 stars from me is because the rooms and common areas are terribly dated. You can keep the old french charm while updating the interior to make the place more modern and appealing. The room, while clean, is lacking any modern day technological touches - you could step into this room in 2001 and it would probably still look the same. I'd like to see some usb ports, motorized curtains, etc. The hotel is definitely geared towards an older crowd (baby boomers +). Overall, I really can't see myself returning here on a regular basis - for the price, I'd go with Planet Hollywood, the Mirage, Monte Carlo, MGM Grand, or Mandalay Bay over Paris any day. 

**Tip - if you self park, enter off of Audre Street, which is accessible off of Harmon Avenue - the driveway setup at Paris is terrible because people never obey the walk signs for the crosswalk - be prepared to drive aggressively if you ever want to make it into the driveway.",4,1,0

But family members coming from the mid-west saw the remodeled rooms on line and had already booked their reservations. It would be nice to stay at the same property.

Right from the start I regretted staying here. We booked our reservations a month in advance and arrived two hours early prior to the time we were told the room would be ready.  Instead of a King Red Room, Non Smoking they attempted to book us into a SMOKING, Double Queen at a lower level room.

I argued with the front desk and then someone that claimed to be the manager.  I would have left but the wife wanted to stay with family. The front desk also refused to help making additional reservations at partner property Caesars or allow an upgrade.

Remarkably during the remainder of the booking \/tirade a room became available. I don't know how you would feel about it. But I'm used to staying at Caesars or the Bellagio they have a remarkable customer service and that's were I do most of my Gaming. I can do without the drama and I hate the attitude of ""Here it is take it or leave it"". 

The room: Okay nothing special, I would rather pay a little more and get a nicer room at a better property.

It's centrally located on the strip as well so it's always bustling inside and out!

The rooms are nice and obviously get nicer as you upgrade. Ours was sufficient for sleeping in because we didn't have much downtime. WiFi was available for free for the first two devices so long as you pay the resort fee...and it also sucked. Oh well. Their pool was pretty nice - it gets crowded but not daytime-pool-party crowded.

Their staff was great. My husband lost his iPhone the first night of our Vegas weekend. What are the odds that we'd find it? Well, after retracing our steps and checking other casinos, Paris's security office had it! Thank goodness someone was kind enough to return it!

I think we had an okay experience overall as parking is free, then check in and check out were very easy as well. The other things we were looking forward to though like the room, the pool, and so on, were a disappointment.

The location is very close to lots of awesome shopping, no more than a 15 minute walk to places like The Forum Shops and the Bellagio. There are plenty of dining options within the hotel and I regret not taking very much advantage of that.

This supposed resort fee often seems alright for what it is intended to cover, but it such a joke at the Paris (32.48 a night) as it covers wifi for up to two devices. Any more and there is a $13.99\/day charge, per device. If you do not opt for that, then good luck getting service anywhere in the hotel. It was frustrating!

Also, I expected the pool area to be a nice place to lay out and relax a bit. Don't get me wrong, the area is beautiful with a huge pool and amazing views of the Strip, Eiffel Tower included. What I wasn't expecting is EDM blasting poolside. It was borderline aggravating, it just didn't seem appropriate for the crowd that stays at the Paris. Did you take a look around yet? Paris is not the Encore. I understand I could have made the best of it, but it wasn't pleasant.

The room was clean, but the beds were uncomfortable. Central air worked just fine, but walls were paper thin. I always enjoy Las Vegas and this is a pretty hotel outside and in, but the rooms fell short with it's dated armoir, shelving, and bathroom accents. It made me really wonder how this is a four star property on most hotel sites.

We checked in and didn't get the king room we reserved, so had to switch after the first night. Second room had leaky shower (i.e., water leaked out all over the floor) and drippy tub (not to mention an alarm clock that went off by itself twice). We won (i.e., lost so much on Total Rewards play) two buffets and, despite our practice of never going to buffers, we succumbed. Le Village Buffet was le disgusting...not to mention the ""famous"" French macarons were all purposely made upside down so they'd supposedly sit better on a dish...so said a chef in the buffet bakery area. I mean, really, macarons ARE Paris; why not make them gorgeously perfect? Popped into the cute little pastry shop for a croissant and it was stale. Fine, we decide today is a beautiful day, so let's go sit by the pool...which is apparently closed for repairs from now until the end of the month.

On day two, I cut my foot with a piece of broken glass on the bathroom floor.   Apparently, a previous guest broke a glass in the bathroom.  Upon inspection, there was shards littered around the bathroom still.  I picked up what I could locate and left a note for room service.

The rooms are not overly lavish like some of the newer super hotels, but not bad either. The beds are comfortable (although they're stingy with the amount of pillows!) and the bathrooms are fine.

The pool is cool in the summer, especially with the magnificent view of the Eiffel Tower replica right there!

There's also a good amount of choices when you need some food to soak up the booze and\/or cure a hangover.

I'm typing this review at 3am by force and not by choice. As much as I would have loved to get a good night's sleep, for the past two nights I've been subjected to booming music from the outdoor night club. I just went down to the front desk to complain and the front desk woman acted like she could care less about my issue. She offered to move me to a different room but with four hours left in my stay there was no point. She offered one day resort fee comp. Are you serious? I know for a fact they've gotten calls about the music to which she agreed and shrugged her shoulders. I asked for a refund on one night's stay and she flat out told me no.

The thing that really upset me was when she said guests are told about the noise when they check in at front desk. So the only way to know you'll have sleepless nights is if you wait an hour in the front desk line? On top of that she couldn't even feign interest when she said, ""I'll mention it to the manager"". 

I will never spend a penny in this place again. There are plenty of other hotels that value their guests stay.",13,1,3

The casino itself is beautiful in my opinion and a great site to checkout on the inside and out. I recommend getting a picture of the Eiffel Tower at night. The restaurants inside are very nice and the food is good, however, some are very overpriced; especially the 'le burger' located near Bally's. You'll pay $15 for a burger alone and about $9 for a draught beer. I would avoid that place unless you truly want to pay a lot for burgers. They do have a good place to get bagels and other breakfast quick eats near their pizza place. The casino floor is very clean and waitresses seemed quick. They also have some neat gift shops.

A few years ago, I really enjoyed coming and playing cards at the Paris. As of last week, I was thoroughly shocked at what I experienced at their hotel and casino. On the casino floor, every single dealer looked utterly miserable and unapproachable. They all stared and gave evil, dirty looks to players who were scoping out the tables as if to say, ""Please don't sit down at my table!"". I understand, there's a lot of interesting characters in Las Vegas and the dealers have to encounter and entertain a lot of people. However, that's no excuse for poor customer service because of that fact. Mind you, I'm 24 years old, so I know there's a stigma around young people that are going to Las Vegas, that we are all drunk party kids who come to Vegas to go crazy and get into trouble-- but that's not me. I'm dressed in designer clothes, I'm very professional & courteous to everyone. I'm not a trashed frat bro looking to play at a table and make a scene. This was middle of the day on a Sunday, too, not in the middle of the night. After dealing with Total Rewards and a cashier who didn't accept my initial signature to receive my freeplay, I walked up to a blackjack table to play the coupons I had. I found a mostly empty blackjack table and sat down. The angry dealer rolled her eyes at me and demanded my ID. She screamed for the pit boss to come and verify it before starting the game. I was polite and I understand the protocol they have in place. The floor woman was rude as well, even after handing her my Diamond card, which should at least tell them that I am a serious player. She was looking at my freeplay coupons as if I forged them at home and spent a good three minutes investigating it and researching my ID. When I placed the couple freeplay coupons on the betting circle, the dealer stared at me and said, ""That's all you're going to bet?"" in regard to my $25\/hand bet, tapped her hand on the table aggressively and slammed the cards down onto the table. The almost retired cocktail waitress then came by the table and requested our ID's, even though we weren't even ordering a drink. I was already sitting at a table with two friends. Why are we being carded again? OK, fine. But there's a polite way to do that. There has to be a better system so loyal younger guests don't feel harassed by bitter staff. Eventually, I lost the freeplay and I still smiled and thanked the miserable dealer. As I walked away, she told the other player loudly, ""GOOD THING HE LOST!"" What kind of comment is that in a casino? They judged me for being a young guest. However, I'm a very big tipper, so they are missing out. I have tipped dealers hundreds of dollars on a good run over the course of play. Maybe if she, or perhaps most dealers there, weren't so bitter & were nice to their players, maybe they would make tips and be a little more cheerful & happy as they made money playing with their guests. Then, the woman checking guests into the Diamond Lounge was rude to my friend and she left crying. I honestly thought this whole experience was a joke on me. Was the service at the Paris really this poor all around? I felt as if I was at some local card room, not a Las Vegas Caesars resort. Is this the type of customer service that Caesars Entertainment strives for? I would patronize their other properties, but Paris seems like the black sheep for their brand.",1,3,0

I will add that we used Expedia and paid for a red room with a view.  When we arrived, we overlooked a parking lot and could see Ballys next door.  The room was dingy.  Stains in tub, felt dirty, and the desk looked like a dog chewed it.  The mini fridge was also inoperable and the leather headboard was ripped.  Not exactly what I would call a ""view"" and certainly not as pictures online.  Called the hotel and they said I didn't have a reservation for a room with a view.  Spent almost 2 hours talking with Expedia who said all we needed to do was visit the front desk for a room key exchange because they worked everything out with the manager.  When my husband and I stopped at the desk to pick up keys, there was an arrogance to the employee who assisted us and after spending another 30 minutes in line\/explaining ourselves we got new keys but had to take a smoking rooms to get the Eiffel view we booked.  We told the desk worked that we still needed into the old room to get our bags, but when we got to the original room the keys were deactivated - we went straight there!  Used the hallway phone to call back to the desk because it's a long walk and was told nobody could help me and that I would have to walk back to the lobby, wait in line, and then talk to somebody again.  Needless to say, that wasn't an acceptable answer, especially when I was treated like I was in the wrong.  Finally got a security gaurd to let us into the room and a food\/beverage credit for the inconvenience.  Check into room 2 and it was unsurprisingly much the same as the first.  It reminds me of decor you would find in a house in the 90s.  The clock and phone are outdated, curtains dirty, etc.  Also, the pillows in room 2 were lumpy and the bed linens didn't feel fresh.  I used the towel in the bathroom to wipe up some water on the sink and the towel turned black when I did.  I don't suggest staying here.

First of all, the parking garage is HORRIBLE.  Whoever designed it should be shot.  The garage is also shared by Bally's next door, which is hugely inconvenient if you are going to that property.

Perfect too because we had such an excellent time in their casino. Well I think we did, I was pretty wasted. Actually we had such a good time we missed our flight. I do not remember much.. It is sort of a blur of flashing lights, a steady stream of alcohol, cigars being smoked, money being won and almost immediately lost, hardcore laughs and finally a waitress named Tina and a bartender named Kyle. I remember we started with roulette. My cousin was up $250. We celebrated at the bar with Kyle the Mix-ologist. I think He wowed us with his amazing handcrafted drinks & amused us with his interesting conversation. I think we talked about UFO'S and cigars. After that we wanted cigars so he pointed us to the nearest Davidoff where we picked out whatever since we know nothing of cigars. After that we started parading through the casino like drunkards in search of a good slot machine. I remember I kept bursting out "" I wanna 777 machine"" so that's what we looked for.  Once we found the perfect slot machine we nestled in for the long haul and that's where we encountered Tina. Oh Tina... If you only knew the chain of events that were sparked by your liquor generosity you would surely laugh at us. Tina came by while we were playing slots and told us the drinks were complimentary. It felt like Christmas morning. We started with Heineken. It took a little long the 1st time but once she came back we gave her a $20. She never went to far after that. We ended up drinking, Heineken, Fireball shots, Gin and tonic & vodka cranberry until we finally settled on patron shots. We had about 4 patron shots after all that and then our limo arrived...

This was THE WORST RESORT EXPERIENCE we have ever dealt with.

We flew in on a Friday night for a 5 night stay for our anniversary. They do not offer transportation to and from the airport, so you have to find a shuttle. The shuttles go to EVERY hotel on the strip and on a Friday night this takes lots of time. It took us nearly two hours to get to the Paris. 

We were dropped off at a side alley way next to their Casino entrance. If you are a nonsmoker, be prepared. The stench in the Casino truly makes it smell like Paris, in a bad way. We're already exhausted from having taken a cross country flight and now we have to be subjected to the casino while trying to find our way to check in. I'm sure the purpose of this is to get you to start playing the slots upon your arrival. 

In any case, it took us 15 minutes to find the check-in area as their signage is poor at best. 

I let the person checking us in know that we are there for our anniversary and wanted to see if they had a way to upgrade us, if not, no big deal. Then, the clerk goes into this long-winded explanation about a room for $80 per night - or so I thought at first. It was $80 additional per night I later figured out. I signed and headed up to the room. 

It's about 1am when we get to the room (4am from our time zone). The room itself was good. It was on the 29th floor overlooking the strip and their Eiffel Tower Restaurant. Then, it hit us. The thumping of music from their club, 26 floors below us. There was nothing they could do about it since it was a normal Friday night. They offered us earplugs - really? Ever sleep with earplugs? Kind of uncomfortable. 

It took about 90 minutes for us to finally fall asleep. 

Next morning, I went to take a shower and found hairs on the drain and along the side of the shower. It seems the shower wasn't cleaned correctly. Housekeeping could have cared less. We didn't have time to argue as we had shows and other things to do.  

During our time in their shopping and restaurant area, you could still smell the smoke from the nearby casino. It killed any romance we would like to have had walking through their indoor courtyard.

Things came to a head on Sunday morning when my wife wanted to work out in their fitness center. They told her it would cost $25 per day! We were pissed and wanted out. 

At first, the management wanted to charge us an early checkout fee. After an argument, they relented and we called the Palazzo down the street.

I have visited the casino in the past, so I already knew it's basic layout.  This was my first time staying in one of their rooms. I got a room with two queen beds and was pleased with the room size and cleanliness. The bathroom really impressed me with it's size and decor. I loved the separate tub and shower. The vanity had ample counter space for the standard array of ladies toiletries. I just wish hotels would equip their bathrooms with ventilation fans to help clear out the humidity and, um, other bathroom odors.

The TV is mounted to the wall, but it's way off center to accomodate the large armoire on the same wall. The armoire has two closet doors and three drawers to place clothing in. There is also a mini fridge in one of the cabinets in the armoire. I then realized the bathroom was so spacious because there was no built in closet, the armoire is your closet. It actually works because the armoire is French, and being the Paris hotel, it makes sense decor wise.

The beds were comfortable and the headboard was padded faux leather. It was nice because I often sit up in bed with my head resting against the headboard. The decorative pillows on the bed were too much though. Two very large brown velour covered pillows and one bolster pillow. So actually there were only two small pillows that had pillowcases on them to lay your head and sleep on. I wouldn't sleep on the velour ones as I doubt those get changed like the sheets do.

There is wi-fi included for two devices with the ""resort package"" which I think means the ""resort fee,"" and you can have more with an additonal fee. The TV channel selection was limited and kind of in an odd sequence. They have groups of six elevators each to service the different sections of floors, and they were quite speedy. 

The employees I encountered from valet, bell service, and front desk were all well-mannered and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.",1,0,0

I had made reservations online for myself and 7 of my colleagues. The person on the phone was nice enough, but they do charge a deposit when you book multiple rooms (I do not know if this is the process when booking a singular room).  When asked how my deposit would be returned, she said not to worry, just tell them at the front desk upon check-in. I reiterated this to my colleagues who did just that upon arrival. Unfortunately, one of my colleagues got Priscilla who was not having a good day and took her wrath out on us. Apparently, either she or her computer system cannot perform tasks like ""refund"" or ""cancel transaction"" because it took an act of Congress for her to refund my deposit. I'm still not certain that it was done properly. She chose to punish me by telling me I didn't get an upgrade whilst my colleague behind me did (for just an additional $20 extra). I guess she gets her kicks off wielding that kind of power. 
I tried to call the central reservation line, but I got the runaround there, too. So my advice to you if you are booking a large party here is - don't. Go somewhere else where they value their customers. This isn't the place. 
Also, the room I was given was dirty and I wouldn't dare step on the carpet with bare feet. The housekeeping staff was friendly enough, but I found some trash in the drawers of the desk (including a hospital bracelet - yikes!). The bathroom never was truly cleaned...but I figured complaining would get me nowhere. Next time I'm in Vegas, I will stay elsewhere. There's nothing at the Paris hotel that I can't live without.

 I've been up to the Eiffel Tower on my last visit with my boyfriend. Breathtaking view of Vegas! 

The only negative I'd say... the walls are a little thin.

The Paris security staff also discouraged us from reporting the matter to the police, wouldn't tell us when key cards had been used to access our room, wouldn't tell us if they found anything from reviewing their security tapes, and generally did little other than CYA.

We waited around at the hotel casino bar since they wouldn't let us check in earlier than 10 am.  i had no idea a tequila shot could cost over $13...what a buzz kill :).  my sister who watches way too much csi wanted a room close to the elevators (something about dr. grissom saying how crimes always happen in rooms far far away from easy access to elevators...it doesn't make sense logically!).  our room which was around the corner of the elevators was pretty quiet and clean, but bit on the smaller size.  the bathroom had a separate shower and tub, and i have to give a major credit for its hairdryer.  it wasn't one of those small white miniature size one.  it actually was a salon size one with full blowing power!!!  the water pressure was really weak so if you are one of those who does everything in shower, you might anger your friends (i don't get people who take shower longer than 15 minutes...do you not shower every day???  what do you do in there???).  i didn't like the bed at all (too hard for me), but i think every hotel in vegas uses uncomfortable beds so the guests go out and spend their money instead of staying in their rooms.

my sister, the bf and i decided to hit the pool while waiting for some friends.  the pool itself was pretty small, but there were many chaises to lounge around.  we ordered a mega size (32 oz) margarita along with some food to cool us down from the blasting heat wave.  those waitresses wearing a short mini skirt were definitely eye candies to some guys (you can see their eyes moving from one direction to another, and some obvious guys move their entire heads!!!).  i initially thought the food was overpriced, but there was a lot of food and tasted better than i had expected.

after hunger's gone, thirst hits, and my sister decided to get a bottle of water.  a few minutes later, she came back with tears in her eyes...almost.  she told us how rude the bartender was (for more details, you can read this - http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_details_review_search?userid=uVUCqySWrgIZdiJG1a6R_Q&q=paris).  i got up and went directly to the same guy, not because i wanted to revenge but i seriously needed some water (sorry, sis :)).  he didn't ask for my i.d. to talk to him nor to buy a $6 bottle of water, but he definitely wasn't a friendly guy.  honestly, it was all a blur after that 32oz margarita, and i couldn't get really angery at the guy who threw some sh*t at my sister because i am a happy drinker.  i am sure we called for the manager on duty and the sis and bf resolved the issue somehow...

right in the middle of the strip, paris hotel has a prime location.  the miracle mile shopping center (old aladdin, now planet hollywood) is right next door and caesar's palace's forum is just across the street.  i didn't get to enjoy any amenities the hotel had offered except the hairdryer and pool.  although i had a great time in vegas, that memory really isn't associated with my stay at paris hotel.  our experience at the pool rather left me a sour taste and i probably won't come back to this hotel where an employee isn't property trained in customer service.  sure, it's cheaper and less luxurious than others, but if it means i have to pay more to get better services, then i will!!!",5,5,6

I can't say I took advantage of any of those things other than flopping into bed that night, but the friendliness of staff, cleanliness of the room, and decent price definitely work in favor of me booking here again.

The table games at the casino seemed to average at $15 minimums, with some rare $10 tables thrown in during the day. They had most of the ""hot new"" slot machines. (I say ""most"" because I could not find the Lobstermania2 penny slot in Paris OR Bally's.)

I adore la Paris. As far as themed hotels go, the placing of the Eiffel, Arche de Triompe, the musems et al are done scalefully (no such word) and skillfully. Pipe in some Edith Piaf and it's a thrill. What an adult DisneyWorld.

I don't find the beds hard at all. Sure, they are not plushy and all down-feathered, but it is not shabby. I got a good night's sleep out of it. As far as fridge goes, there's one but NO ROOM for stuff. Try moving anything to make room, it registers as a purchase, so I'm told. So don't touch anything. 

The concierge is helpful, and looked up various show times and restaurant reservations for us.

The casino area is not huge, but for a non-big-time gambler like me, I'm OK. If you want to gamble within the premises, the Paris is joined underground to the Bally's. They, along with Rio, Flamingo, Caesar's Palace, are owned by the same corporation. You can get a free bus ride to those properties. 

Although there are other elegant choices along the Strip, the Paris definitely ranks as one of the better ones to put one's feet up for its central location, it being right across from the Bellagio.

I must say, stayed at the Paris a few times already and this place never really seems to disappoint. The staffs at pretty much any place in this hotel are nice. The rooms are nice and you can find the rooms at pretty cheap rates from time to time.

As for dining, that'll be reviewed at a later time.

CONS: 

1.) The Paris caters to an older crowd. 

2.)No young dance clubs except for a live band bar in the casino floor playing Tayo Cruz (blah), Usher and Top 40s hip hop.

3.)  Late night casino tables has 2-$10 black jack tables. For a cheapo like me (sorry), I'll start off with $10 and feel the dealer up a bit first before I up it to $25 a hand when I'm rollin.

But that's about it. I am a fan of Paris and the Harrah's card program. But I'd wish they'd have more nightly entertainment bars, venues, clubs in the hotel. I guess I have to walk next door to PH for that.

When I arrived and tried to use the automated kiosk, it claimed the room was unavailable and I would need to wait. This is at 10pm with a tired 2 year old. Checkin only had 1 employee working with a huge line. Avoid this hotel if you value your sanity. The hotel employee claimed that management fired most of the check-in staff and tried to replace them with automated kiosks (which don't work, apparently).

Edit: Apparently, that was just the beginning. There were many other minor things that made this seem more like a 2 star hotel than a major Las Vegas brand.

1) The fridge in the room barely worked (slightly cooler than room temperature). Maybe it was operator error, but I don't think so. I'm pretty sure I can manage to adjust the temperature on a fridge correctly. 

2) I tried to make a reservation at the hotel's restaurant for breakfast. The official website linked to OpenTable, but it said it was ""unable to make a reservation at this time."" So I tried calling on the phone. My first question, of course, was ""how long is the wait without a reservation on average?"" Seems simple enough right? Well, apparently this hotel has outsourced their restaurant calls to a call center! So naturally, the person had no information whatsoever. The only thing they could do was make a reservation. Which, by the way, took about 10 minutes to accomplish once you include the ridiculous phone tree, reading off a gigantic rewards number several times, listening to the cancellation policy (for a RESTAURANT RESERVATION??) and etc etc.

3) When we finally got to the restaurant, we asked for hot water. Our waiter gave us a standard hot water pot, but when we poured it, it had clearly never been cleaned after serving coffee (water was coffee colored). Maybe it's a new fad, tea with coffee? I don't know. After complaining, we got a second new pot, in the same condition. Maybe someone in the kitchen is just not bothering to wash anything, idk. After that, our waiter disappeared and was never to be seen again. Unhappy customer? Just avoid them!

4) When checking in, the attendant said he added my parking ticket to the hotel door keycard. Guess what happened when driving out the next day? The gate said ""PLEASE WAIT"" for about 2 minutes (while cars are waiting behind me), and then just returned to the main screen. Naturally there are no human attendants, as this hotel seems to be cutting costs in all the wrong ways. I had to push a button on the kiosk that gave me an extremely garbled voice in another call center somewhere. I still have no idea what they said back to me, but the gate opened, so I drove out.

On top of all that frustration, it's irritating as a whole how much the whole hotel industry in Vegas has started nickel-and-diming everything. They're as bad as the airline industry! Let's see...
1) Advertise ridiculously low hotel price, tricking nobody.
2) Tack on a $39 resort fee (how is this not just part of the room price? you're not tricking anyone here)
3) Make sure none of the rooms have good cell coverage (ok maybe this wasn't intentional)
4) Charge way too much for parking (free at 2 star hotels)
5) Only allow 2 devices per room to use WIFI. Charge extra for more devices.
6) Don't provide any sort of breakfast credit.
7) Outsource and\/or automate everything, poorly (restaurant questions, restaurant reservations, parking attendants, hotel check-in).",4,1,0

Thankfully, when checking in, they told us we could request for someone to spray air freshener, and some o-zone machine could be brought up as well. The air freshener made the room smell fresh for maybe half an hour. The o-zone machine helped us get through the night, though it was really loud.

We were rudely awaken at 7 the next morning by the staff asking for the machine back. When we ignored the knock, they called instead! The night before, they told us we had until 6pm the next day if we would like a room change. When I called downstairs around 10am, they had a room on the 10th floor ready for us. The view was nice and the room smelled fresh. Woohoo!

The pool is gorgeous! You get a great view of the hotel's architecture as well as the Eiffel Tower. Towels are also provided. You'll need to flash your room key for entrance and for the towels.

Aside from that slight hiccup of being woken that first morning, our experience was quite pleasant! The concierges were also very helpful when we asked them for help. I would recommend staying here! Prices and rooms are decent enough, especially if you just need a place to crash!",2,0,1

One thing I do notice is having to take your luggage a pretty good distant from the parking garage and recently some casinos are charging daily for parking unlike back in the day when it was free until the Raiders ruined that. If you're a resident or know someone who has a Neveda ID they get free parking when their ID is scanned. I use to live there and my mother still does so I visit quite frequently. 

The room we got was one of the suites and it overlooked the Eiffel Tower and strip. I've stayed in over 10 different hotels out there and this room, the commendations, and food is great. The craps tables were pretty high that night like $15 per table which some places on Saturday night is more like $10 or you can go other places for five and three dollar craps. Also the decor omg I felt like a queen for two days. I can't stand red and one of their main colors was red.

Prices weren't shabby for 2 nights given that we were staying Mon & Tues. Average price was 70 per night so I booked it.

Checking in wasn't too bad. Our room had the Eiffel Tower view so that was a nice thing to look at. I wish we didn't have to pay the stupid resort fee since I didn't use the pool or gym.

The casino layout was surprisingly small. There's not a whole lot for me to do here slots wise. I did play here but it wasn't as enjoyable as it was with other casinos.

However my biggest gripe on which I'm rating this place low was the fact that there was a stupid private event at night held at the Château and I could hear the loud music from my room as I was trying to sleep around 10:30 since we were tired from the long drive. I called front desk and spoke to April who didn't seem to care about my complaint based off the tone in her voice. All she offered me was earplugs. Yea like that's really gonna help me. I shouldn't have to use something like that in the first place when I was trying to get some sleep. I know vegas is known for a city that doesn't sleep but come on. I don't think I was the only one that called and complained about the music on 8\/31.

My room interior wasn't anything impressive. I felt like I was staying at a cheap motel with a large ugly dresser in the center.

The interior of the hotel with the shopping places and restaurants look decent but that's about it. I wouldn't recommend sleeping here if you really value sleep since they love to keep you up at night.

The guy that helped me at the Total Rewards center was awesome. I got free tickets to a show with dinner on the first night so that was a nice thing.

As for April, she needs to work on her customer service skills better. 0 stars from her.

Definitely not sleeping here again.",3,4,1

We had booked two premier red rooms several months in advance and paid a deposit for them. We were bringing my mom and my aunt, as a gift, and wanted a real nice weekend for them. Upon arrival on a Friday morning, we were advised that they did not have any of those rooms available. From what we were told, members of their high rollers club can come in and get those rooms on demand. We have been coming here for four years but are not big gamblers so that option was out for us. Despite being there a little early, we are usually granted early check-in. This time, there were no rooms ready for us. We were advised that we had to call the front desk and check on the availability of our rooms. One room was eventually ready and, after calling the front desk several times, the second room was ready. Overall, we waited about five hours for both rooms and lost most of our day that Friday waiting for our rooms. Once the second room was ready, I went to the front desk to get the key. I was not allowed to pick up the key because my name wasn't anywhere in the reservation system. They had the names of everyone else in my party but not mine. My other-half made the reservation and I should have been listed because I clearly spelled my first and last name to be entered in the system when we checked in.

Check in line was long but it moved fairly quickly.  
Place was huge and a big confusing but once we got our bearings, all was ok!  (And after we returned from Bally's since they are connected.)

Our room was nice.  No in-room coffee maker was a surprise, but I guess that's more common for Vegas strip hotels than I realized.  :)  No problem.

Every morning of our stay, I enjoyed coffee\/pastries in the little cafe along the ""rue de la paix"" ....and my willing mind let me feel like I was in Paris.   The blue ""skies"" and cobblestone ""street"" was a nice illusion.  (Plus the wifi was strong in the cafe so I could read my local paper quite easily!)

Decent sized room, a nice bathroom ( I like bathrooms with separate showers) and nice counter space. 
Now the bad. Shower had a low flow head which sucked, plus it was unadjustable so you couldn't move the spray away from you. The blow dryer had so much lint in it that it barely blew any air. The shampoo at all Harrahs properties is watery just not good. The TV is an old crt with very limited number of channels to choose from.

I read many reviews of Paris on hotels.com and the comments about cleanliness and the smoke smell are SPOT ON. Really not a great place as far as clean\/updated. I was there with 2 other people for one night and we ALL got sick with respiratory illnesses which turned out to be BACTERIAL. Legionnaires comes to mind (!!!) One of our troupe actually got Rubella (german measles) from the bedding. Just a dirty hotel. Air vents are filthy. Room had old carpet with stains under furniture. Entire room had a musty\/mildew smell about it. Bathrooms sub-par, just not someplace I'd return to, recommend or encourage anyone else to stay at. The view of The Strip was not worth the pricy doctor visit to get through the bacterial lung infection we got while there. Contacted their 'customer care' and got nothing. They ignored us. I wish I had not given them the benefit of the doubt...... trust the bad reviews...stay elsewhere.",1,0,2

The casino floor -- not so happenin.  Generally an older group of people (nothing wrong with it, just not a party crowd).  One lady at a 21 table was smoking like a chimney.  Not that that's bad... just doesn't seem right while on an OXYGEN tank\/system!

They are going for a sexy, ""what happens in vegas..."" vibe.  Maybe it's just me, but it just didn't work.  Still, rooms were cheap, it's $10 tables, and the sportsbar at the back near the entrance to Bally's was pretty good.

It was once my wife's and I favorite place to stay in Vegas.  We still do come here even though we don't have a room.  The hotel is just that beautiful inside and out.  The way they make the inside look like a Paris village is cool with cobblestone looking streets and the sky blue ceiling that looks like the sky.
Even though we still go there.  The hotel isn't the same as in past visits.  First of all the gaming is super stingy.  The machines don't pay out and the blackjack tables are ridiculously hard to win.  Not very fun when you don't feel like you have a chance.
Another let down is the service is not as good as in past visits.  I know we have been in a recession but dang this is Vegas.  Act like you like your job.  Too many employees with long faces.  People come from all over to Vegas to spend money.  Be happy you got a job.
The buffet and the cafe are still the best in Vegas.  At the Le Cafe, I always get the french onion soup.  My favorite.  The prime rib dinner is also a winner.  Do expect to stand in a line and they do move slow.
Lately, we have been going to the adjoining casino to Paris, Bally's.  It seems to be more laid back even though it's owned by the same people.  The tables and machines seem to pay out more too.

I found a great package flight\/hotel Paris was the hotel of choice. I decided on it because they have a separate bathtub and shower. Maybe not a deal breaker for most, but for us we wanted a bath not just a shower.

When they say the check-in time is 4 pm--they mean it--unless you want to pay for something immediate. We did not. Neither of us have ever arrived anywhere early and had to wait until we went to Paris. Good thing we needed a marriage license...so we did that prior to check-in.

At all times the valets were excellent and very helpful. Hats off to you guys! We found out that since Paris is a Caesar's resort, we could use a shuttle between hotels. That saved a TON on cab fares--YAY. 

The room was nice. The bed VERY comfy. The dumpster view was not what I would call stellar but hey we were in Vegas and not planning on being in the room other than to sleep. I did try to use the TV ONCE and from what I could tell to see anything I needed to pay to do so. Downer. I played Candy Crush instead.

There are ample restaurants. We grabbed some pizza one day and I had a latte at their coffee stand. Both decent. We had drinks at a bar and yes they were pricey--7.75 for a Miller Lite but hey we were prepared so no big thing. We did find a super cheap place across the street--cheap beer and shots. Yahoo! 

The $5 mimosas and bloody marys were SMALL but they were only $5 so we had a few of those along the way. 

Paris connects to Ballys and we found a super breakfast buffet there. Very yummy and a lot of choices. I think it was $10 each and they had the $5 drink thing too. So yay for that! 

I will give you a warning that while you are sauntering between Paris and Ballys there is a little stand and folks accost you under the guise of a ""free show."" These folks are from Wyndham resorts. I can go on and on about that little deal. RUN should they come near you. Do not ask and do not engage. Put on your ""I am ignoring the homeless on Main Street in Houston"" and just keep walking. Hey I live in downtown Houston--and trust me there are so many ""stories"" I have heard over the years...I do not engage. My charity goes to shelter animals. Again another story. Main point is RUN FROM WYNDHAM.

Back to the Paris. The price was good and we felt worth it for the accommodations. I was hoping for at least a free drink since I rocked my wedding dress all over the casino--alas not so much. Would I go there again? You bet. The decor of the lobby\/casino is hands down the most beautiful. I felt like I was walking the Paris streets which was super cool.

Now at check out (mind you we paid for our trip WAY in advance) we were hit with ""resort fees"" to the tune of $22 a day. Apparently this is a total Vegas thing. I do not have an issue paying per se....what gets me is this is NOT UP FRONT. If you are going to charge this, then put it in the price up front and do not surprise your guests. The whole fee thing is something we experienced on several occasions. Very annoying. We could afford it but I have never had to pay some extra fee at any other hotel in my entire life. The employees just blink blankly when you question WTH are these fees? 

We had a great time and having a nice place to rest our heads made the entire trip more enjoyable...the fee thing took away some of that enjoyment. I just do not like hidden surprises. So there you have it. Paris is beautiful and comfortable.",1,0,0

The casino itself is a little dated and the hotel is kind of a tired gimmick.  The staff is all friendly and quite helpful as the place is pretty confusing to get around.  I tipped the check in agent $20 and was given a great suite on the 27th floor.  It was large, well appointed and had an awesome view of the Bellagio Fountains! 
The restaurant selection is Ok.  I ate at the Burger Brasserie and JJs and both were average.  I ended up going else where for a nicer dinner as Gordon Ramsey steakhouse didn't seem too appealing.
This is a great location is definitely a solid mid tier hotel.  Parking was easy for $10 a day and elevators usually were quick to get in.

Some pros:  the Paris is centrally located on the strip which makes it very nice and convenient to Caesars shops and Planet Hollywood's Mile Long Shops.  The pool was nice and seemed clean.  The drinks at the pool were expensive ($15.00 per drink)  but we found all the drinks in Las Vegas were expensive.
Our room was nice size but the carpet was dirty.  Nothing in the room seemed clean.  When the bed was made up, the sheets were not clean.  Oh gross! The bathroom had both a shower and a tub.  I was pleasantly surprised we had a mini refrigerator.  The room also had an in-room safe.

So I've stayed here about 5x.  Service is great, the people at the check in counter are really nice despite having to deal with irate travelers all the time.  Once I had to stay a full week (Sunday-Sunday) for a convention - the lady checking me in noticed and said ""aw no, we can't have you staying in this room all week!"" and she upgraded me free of charge to an awesome corner room overlooking the Bellagio fountains.

Inside the actual casino is really nice, it feels like it's early evening no matter what time you walk through because of the lighting and the way it's decorated, not to mention the oxygen they pump through :)

Rooms - I have zero complaints about the rooms - every room I've stayed in has been really nice.  They have AWESOME bathrooms, some bathrooms I've had are nicer than the ones in my apartment!  I'm not a big fan of their toiletries though, for such a nice hotel, it'd be nice if they could get a name brand for their toiletries.

Pool - great view up there, look up and you see the Eiffel Tower.  It's a really small pool though, a lot of the other hotels have much bigger pools.

Another complaint is that their gym costs $25 a day!!!  Like I said, I've mainly stayed at the Paris when I'm in town so I'm assuming other hotels are comparable, but $25 a day just so I can run on the treadmill for 30 minutes is unreasonable.  Why don't you just run outside, you ask?  Because it's 120 F-ing degrees outside, that's why.  

Food - It's Vegas - all the food is good.  Eiffel Tower is one expensive MoFoing restaurant, but it's really tasty.  Make sure to make reservations beforehand, or you won't get in.  Never a bad meal at Mon Ami Gabi, if it's nice out, sit outside for awesome people watching, or at one of the tables inside facing the fountains.  Great steaks here.  One of my favorites for a ""cheaper"" meal is Le Burger Brasserie that's in the shopping area right in between Paris and Bally's.  It's got a sports bar feel, but kind of classy at the same time.  My coworkers loved the girls in the skimpy outfits.  Awesome burgers and fries, and they serve the onion rings in a pyramid.",1,0,0

* Check-in staff very friendly and knowledgeable.

* Ramsay Steak is just downstairs. I love that place.

Cons:
* Taxi access can be awful due to the constant stream of people walking in front of the area where you drive in to get to the lobby.
* Rooms are just OK. Functional, bathrooms are nice, but overall they just seemed a little dated.
* I reserved a Non-Smoking High-Floor Eiffel-Tower View Red Room, I got a regular Classic Room. The small print says nothing is guaranteed, okay fine. But, I reserved this room MONTHS in advance and checked-in via email \/ online early to let them know I was coming. I don't really understand the logic behind this.

But I one of the staff was absolutely fantastic. The first night I checked in I was woken up by a Korean family at 1am in the morning. It was really frustrating, so I went down stairs to complain (nicely) and requested a room change. 

The cool thing, she upgraded me to a penthouse suite...all to myself! I was so mindblown. Went into the room on 33rd floor. There was a dining room table, 1.5 bathrooms. A living room to watch TV, a fridge, and a view of the strip where I could see Cosmpolitan, MGM and Planet Hollywood. 
Washroom was 1.5 times larger than the one i booked on the fifth floor.
And the best part, the bedroom was on it's own and I had such wonderful sleep. 

Went back down and tipped her $20 dollars for the best upgrade ever after I saw the room.

Everything was great, and Paris made my first trip there absolutely one of the best highlights of my life.

Inside decor: The decor outside is mind blowing and looks wonderful at night. It's such a great exhibit and to see the Arc De Triomphe just adds that little bit  more zing. 

The inside is charming and makes the first time walking through interesting. It's almost like walking through a village with cobblestones.  And the interior feels as if the sun is about set.

Its quite simple actually.  Simply fold a twenty dollar bill in between your credit card and ID and ask if there are any available upgrades.  Obviously a little small talk is in order.  Use your charm and personality, but more importantly don't forget the magic words, ""we'll take care of you!"" to help seal the deal. 

All you really have to do is ask for what you want and let the sandwich do the rest.  Ask for ridiculous upgrades like a indoor gym, a penthouse suite, or mirrored ceilings.  Anything to make them laugh and break up the monotony of checking in boring tourist after boring tourist.  

After some small talk, you'll see them banging away on their keyboard.  Continue to chat with them and let them know how excited you are about the weekend and that all you want to do is have a good time.  Heck, invite them up to have a drink and let them know that you think they're awesome. TRUST ME...It pays to be nice!

Before you know it they'll show you a picture of the red room and let you know that its typically a $40 upgrade per night but for you its on the house.  If you're really nice and he or she likes you, then they'll probably ask if you need a roll away bed ($30 upgrade) and late check-out too. I took advantage of both, with a total savings for a 2 night stay reaching a whopping $110.  Can I get an Amen!

The room itself is rather plain, but the beds are comfortable and everything is very clean and orderly. When all you want is a place to come back to after a long night out, that is all that really matters. I had a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower, the (beautiful, enormous) pool, the Cosmopolitan, and Bellagio. Totally gorgeous, and I kept that wonderful spacious window with the curtains open at all times.

However, what really impressed me about Paris was how invested they seem in genuinely making my experience comfortable. I was checked in and checked out by overwhelmingly friendly front desk staff. On my second morning, I didn't get out of the room until after housekeeping rounds so my shampoos were not replenished. I called housekeeping and asked if they could bring me new ones, and they came up with a whole BAG of shampoos, conditioners, and soaps. On my last morning, I was hoping to squeeze in another hour of sleep, so I called to request a noon checkout. The minute I mentioned ""late checkout,"" the concierge immediately replied, ""Sure! We'll be happy to extend your checkout to 1, free of charge."" YOU ARE A LIFESAVER, PARIS. AN ALTRUISTIC, BENEVOLENT LIFESAVER.

My only complaint was that I got ripped off pretty badly by room service. I am not someone who orders room service often (it was 5 am and I had just gotten back and was desperate for food), so this may be considered par for the course among the more experienced, but an order of a (already pricey) $14 burger somehow turned into a $25 bill thanks to ""hotel charges.""

We agreed and proceeded up to our room.  The moment we walked into the room, we were unhappy. We overlooked........wait for it.....a roof top.

Super crowded hotel, very congested.  Not my choice since it was a convention.

I was led to believe that i was paying extra for a room to get a view of the bellagio fountains but was given nothing. According to the front counter I was paying for a view of their swimming pool and eiffel tower. I was then told that I would have to pay another $44 per night for the view I wanted. I agreed to even that and so I walked all the way down with my bad knees and there was a different story.  

Edith, Francisco and Mike at the front desk ""knowing lied to me and made me go back and forth 3 times to different rooms promising me a better view each time. I came to the conclusion that they were just screwing around with me since the only other alternative was that they didn't know their property very well. Bad attitude and unprofessional customer service from Mike was the reason that I am putting down this bitter review. Had it not been for Mike I might have not taken the time to write down this account of my ""BAD"" experience with this Hotel.

Now Since they managed to get me angry, here is more on the experience that I would have not mentioned otherwise.

There was no coffee machine in my room and according to the housekeeping my premier room doesn't come with one...???  A first for me. So then I am left with 2 options either order a Liter of coffee for $12 plus extras, and have it delivered to my room, drink a cup and waste the rest  or walk all the way downstairs in my Pj's and get in line with other cranky people and  buy some. People need coffee when they wake up...... Unacceptable. I have never been to a hotel that doesn't have coffee in the room. A first for me. Maybe that is a Vegas thing. I don't know. I would have not mentioned this if it weren't for how I was treated by Mike.

There were unsafe dangling electrical wires and extension chords hanging loose in the room. I am pretty sure that its against the fire code to have that. I posted pictures and I hope somebody does take care of it before there is a fire. Toddlers can easily access these and wrap those around their necks and get entangled, electric shock or choke.  Please fix this management? Las Vegas Fire Dept? Whatever the code enforcement agency in Nevada is?

Totally Contradicting to the room description, the carpets in the room were ugly stained worn out and dirty. I have posted a picture to refer to.

Also another very funny thing was that all the soap provided was smelling very feminine like flowers. Hello....? Men have to shower too. 
Most men don't like to walk out of the shower smelling like a bouquet of feminine flowers lol.. 
Stupid people. Choose neutral fragrances that both men and women can use. 

Wifi is only free for 2 devices. the third device is about $15.00 \/ day. Thats crazy. Again that might just be a vegas thing I don't know. 

I had never been to a motel before this. 

Now the thing to see is if this review gets any attention and what they care a damn to do something about atleast the loose electrical chords and Mike's ugly attitude.

Fall for pleasant weather, winter for fewer people and shorter lines and summer for the hot heat which works best for lazy moments by the pool.

You really can't go wrong booking a stay here - hurry up - summer is ending soon!! Great neighboring properties, good buffet, a small rooftop pool, big good smelling casino, thoughtful tower design with central elevators, and super views of Bellagio fountains.

Great nighboring properties: Planet Holleywood, Flamingo\/Cromwell, Bellagio, and CP kittycorner. All these neighbors have something to offer and if you spend your whole visit just at these few mentioned mega resorts you will not have missed much. Bellagio has some of the best food and great stuff to look at. The fountains are obvious but also their large indoor garden that they change monthly. Flamingo also has a beautiful courtyard garden with koi fish and flamingos and many pools. Cromwell offers a great nightclub Drais, lounge and a rooftop pool with stunning views of the famous four corners. CP has one of the best night clubs around and upscale shopping. 

Paris has lots to offer too: A small rooftop pool that is generally peaceful and not so over filled which is shocking as there are so many rooms and presumably people with access. I think because it is small many people pass up on going there - perhaps the casino is that good and the guests never leave their slot machines.  Paris buffet is also great. Last time I checked they cut some corners but it is still very good. Crepes are outstanding with their berry syrups.

Casino has good HVAC system - not too much smoke. Rooms are nothing special in terms of square footage of a standard room and decor is dated. Views of Bellagio fountains are possible for an upgrade charge. I like the thoughful tower design with elevators neatly tucked in the middle to reduce unnecessarily long walks. As with any vegas hotel ask for something close to the elevators. In the case of Flamingo there are elevators scattered all over the whole casino floor. I usually ask for a room as close to the parking garage elevator as possible to make leaving that much quicker. Makes sense if you utilize your car and you came with one rather than on a plane. 

There are better options in Vegas but this possilbly one of the best choices if the price for a room is right. Its worth more per night than Flamingo and Harrahs but significantly less than Bellagio. See if you can get a good deal here or neighboring resorts and you will enjoy your stay.",2,0,0

Very average size compared to others, nothing really more than a Courtyard type view.  No view whatsoever even after upgrading online.   

Met my grandkids there and had breakfast in the Café first morning.  $155.00 for breakfast including three adults and four kids.  No kids menu and they ordered pancakes....AT $16.00 PER PLATE.  Donuts $4.00 a piece.  Coffee is outrageous. The charge was the same as a full breakfast of bacon and eggs.  Then there is the resort fee of $40.00 per night.  Use of the gym, pool and 'free internet'.  So I just had major surgery a while back, can't work out, it was too cool outside for the pool and I connected to the internet through my phone and never used it.  So I was charged for three things that either I could not use, that the weather precluded me from using or I always use when I travel and pay for via my phone bill.

The young lady working the coffee watched this happen and she was appalled.  She felt bad for me but also confided in me that it has happened often of late. I was scared and I was outraged by having someone inside a resort hotel on the strip able to get away with something like this.  There was no security around anywhere and I looked for them.  Very scary, especially at 7:30AM in the morning. 

When I complained at checkout this morning about all of this, the staff could not have been any ruder.  They could care less about any of this.  All they cared about was getting me finished up and out of the line. Especially the security incident.  One would think Vegas hotels would be a little more sympathetic and careful after the October incident.

And, I've stayed at over 80% of the hotels on and off the strip. I've been going to LV since 1964 and have seen all the changes. The good. The bad, and the ugly. The 1st time I stayed at the Paris Hotel & Casino and it's damn ugly! I was there for 2 nights and paid $161.28 plus the B.S. ""Resort Charge"" of $71.68. Got a room looking out at the street and the Paris Hotel hot air balloon sign. Wow!

Take a look at the photo's. This was supposed to be a nice room. Wallpaper peeling off the walls in the room, in the bathroom, and even down the hall (which I haven't posted). Baseboards and carpet nasty in the hallway. I saw a maintenance man in the hall one afternoon and asked him why they just let the place get so run down. He said they didn't want to spend the money but he thought they were going to repair it. Oh yeah. 

One evening I went downstairs to get a cup of coffee and purchase some gifts for the wife. Talked to a young gal at the restaurant entrance and somehow we got onto the subject that cameras with mic's were everywhere and watching everybody... inside the hotel and even outside on the sidewalk. She agreed and wasn't happy about it as the NSA, Homeland Security... every other alphabet agency are now watching us, scraping our phone calls and text messages and emails. I gave her a secure email she could use and a secure search engine other than Google she could use. She wrote it down.

The next day when I checked out I went to the wrong parking level to look for my vehicle. Standing right outside of the elevator a plain cloths security guy walked right up to me on my left and holding his finger right below his left eye gave a signal that ""this is the guy to be watched."" When he noted that I understood his signal, he kept his finger raised.. but raised his arm which made his finger point into his eye next to his nose and pretended he had something in his eye. Who did he think he was fooling? 

So why was he interested in me? Probably because I talked about the camera's and microphones who watched and listened to everything one says and does inside the hotel to the cashier at the restaurant. And, to show how they watch... about that time the parking lot cleaning guy (with an earpiece) yelled at me... ""Hey! Isn't that your [vehicle] over there?"" I answered, ""No, it looks like mine but mine's a little different."" That's when I realized I was on the wrong floor and went up to the next level and got the Hell out of there! But why would this guy know what type of vehicle I was driving? Its because the Security people upstairs record every vehicle and every person coming into the hotel and its parking lot. They were telling him to point me to my vehicle... but even they got it wrong as I guess they couldn't read the license plate of that vehicle parked at an angle. Oh well... they'll say its to make us feel secure. Yeah... that but its also so they can control you. They didn't have that kind of so-called security back in the 60's or 70's, etc. They still had crime back then... and with all their hi-tech boogie equipment there is STILL A LOT OF CRIME in Lost Wages.

And whatever else you may need, you're connected to the Ballys casino and hotel, and Planet Hollywood is a short walk next door, with their casino and Miracle Mile shops, plus across the street is the Bellagio, which is nice to watch the fountains. 
Our room was fantastic! We had a smoking room on the 27th floor, and it was so clean and smelled fresh, you would never know it was a smoking room at all. Their room service is 24 hours, and they serve breakfast all night too (my fave). The employees are friendly, efficient, and QUIET!! Those of you who have stayed in many hotels know what I mean....like when housekeeping lets the doors slam over and over as they clean throughout the day. Not here! We thought we were the only ones on the floor most of the time. 
Here's a tip: Pay attention to what elevator you are getting on, because they separate the elevators by floor levels. It was so nice to breeze by all the other floors straight to ours. You don't have to pass any lower levels. But we did laugh at the people that got on and stood there in a daze looking for their floor, LOL. Hysterical. 
There were plenty of restaurants nearby, or in the hotel itself. Do NOT miss out on a visit to Gordon Ramsay Steak, Ballys Sterling Brunch (Sundays only), Hexx bar and restaurant (24 hours), etc.
We stayed 5 nights which is plenty of time for a place to screw something up, but nope, it was perfect! I seriously would come back here on my next visit. They did no wrong in my opinion!",0,0,0

This hotel is in great need of a renovation. Not only is this hotel out of date, it is DIRTY! Our first room had urine in the toilet when we arrived. Another room had cracks and water stains on the ceiling and smelled like mold. There were stains all over the carpet and scuffs on the walls. We had friends coming in the following day (the only reason we didn't move) and their first of three rooms had bedbugs. The staff was extremely UNHELPFUL and RUDE... Their advice? ""Stay somewhere else if you are not satisfied."" TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. One night there was a man urinating in the corner of the hallway leading from the lobby to elevators. That same night, when we got back to our room and our room key didn't work so we used the hallway phone to call to the front desk... After 3 phone calls, security arrived almost an hour after our arrival to let us in. Another night we ordered room service and they got 2 of our 3 orders wrong.... We called to address the mistake and what did we get? Undercooked food. DISGUSTING!Room service was also a nightmare... Unless you are out of your room by 1PM, don't expect it to be cleaned even if you call and request it. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO MY WORST ENEMY.

When we arrived at 1 am on Friday night (or Saturday morning to be technical), there was a long check-in line that lasted about an hour. I was pretty tired and out of it from the 4 hour drive, so standing in line for another hour was not pleasant. I had made two reservations back to back on for the weekend and the lady at the check-in desk helped me check into both rooms so I didn't have to come a second time.

When I entered the room I didn't feel the Vegas glam that I normally get when entering a hotel on the strip. I'm talking about Bellagio, Venetian, Palazzo, and Wynn types of glam. The room was a little worn down from use over time. The wooden furniture was had visible damage and the leather headboard on the beds were deteriorating. We checked the linens to make sure they were clean, and to our surprise there was a fresh stain on the sheets. That grossed us out and we had to ask for a full service by housekeeping. 
The bathtub was stained and a bit disgusting as well. There was a cigar burn and also debris near the drain. I wouldn't recommend you use it to take a bath, maybe as a cooler if you're bringing a lot of drinks. 
The hotel rooms definitely need some renovations and I hope they do that soon.

There's a large casino for gamblers who play slots or tables. They have a nice selection of slots with some of the popular machines as well. The BlackJack table games on the other hand have some of the worst rules in Vegas. If you're a black jack player, the best place on the strip is Treasure Island. The double deck rules are a little better , but they still try very hard to gain an edge on the players.

Over all, the stay was pleasant and I would stay here again. Paris is nestled right in the middle of the strip, making it a very convenient stay for tourists and sightseers.",0,0,0

The front desk emplyee at registration was about as friendly and welcoming as a DMV employee on a Monday afternoon. No smile no personality and as stiff as a board. We told them up front that we had a dog, we paid extra because we had a dog, we were honest and responsible about every aspect of our reservation as one could, but she treated us as if our dog was going to destroy the room and proceeded to lecture us about what we would be responsible for should we cause any damage, even if they find something at any date even after we leave. Our dog is crate trained and we brought our crate, so as to make sure nothing happened while we were out of the room. 

We also booked a couple of hours for a relaxing visit at Paris Spa by Mandara. We booked a massage and facial package that included their three enzyme deep cleaning exfoliating treatment. My massage was good, but I have had much better. My wife specifically said that she wanted lite pressure and nothing that resembles deep tissue, but her masseuse had to be told several times to use less pressure. My wife said it was not relaxing at all.

The hotel was Very comfortable and roomy. The bathroom was large, but not overwhelming, and the staff was great. 

The only 'cons' I have with the hotel is that their valet is VERY slow. I completely understand that there may be issues with staff calling out, etc, but when it take 20-30 mins for your car to be pulled out a garage, it seems a bit excessive. I would recommend they at least schedule more people on Sundays when they know most people leave Vegas. Just checking out, getting our baggage picked up by the bell-hop, and getting out valet car it took about an hour.

Do I get complimentary rooms or something? If I do, will the owner please message me asap so I can hurry on back to Sin City! 

One thing I love about Paris is it makes you feel like your outside when your in the casino area! When you look up, you would have thought you were standing outside because the ceilings are sky blue and designed nicely. The replica Eiffel Tower is a thing of beauty at night. 

I still need to take the gf up the Eiffel Tower one of these days when I come back. It is pretty cheap to take the ride up the Eiffel Tower. Look for coupons and save yourself some gambling money! 

The rooms were simply everything one could ask for as they were very comfortable and spacious. Dont touch the fridge of goodies now, you dont want to pay $8 for a Gatorade do you!!?? 

Paris Las Vegas is also conveniently located right next to a shopping mall! The best Urban Outfitters is right next door and it is huge! (only because I found stuff I actually liked at this one)

I'd rather pay full price next time than to stay at Paris again.

I had booked a King sized bed, but they gave us two Queens. I called to ask if it was a mistake and if I could switch. It turned out all the Kings were booked, and the only way I could get another room was if I moved the next day.  Again, the person who answered my call sounded SO irritated with my request. As if it were my fault that they messed up my room. I figured it wasn't worth it, so I didn't end up switching.

Housekeeping was also lacking.. we found hairs on the pillows!! So gross. 

And lastly, I find the staff's behavior towards tipping super obnoxious. We arrived before check in so had to leave our luggage with the doorman. He wasn't particularly friendly with us either, but kept implying that we should tip him. (We didn't.)

Bally's also has a free shuttle over to the Rio hotel on the other side of the freeway.  

The restaurant in the Eiffel tower is very nice and the view of the Bellagio water show is fabulous.  Go up there and just get a drink in the lounge and get the view for free.  If you want to go up to the top you will have to pay.

We paid a bit extra for the Red Room- and I wouldn't do that again. It was pretty much the same as the rooms our friends were staying in, only ours was red in color and had a larger television. All of the rooms have refrigerators, and pretty much the same setup.

Of course, the location is central, making it easy to get everywhere on the strip, plus the Deuce picks up right in front of Paris.

When you are walking through the various food court and shops the ceiling is decorated like a sky and the walkway has cobblestone. They have done such a excellent job of recreating the Paris environment it is like be transported to Paris. 
As a guest the rooms are pretty nice with nice bedding and soft pillows and it is kept pretty clean and updated. The check in area is truly beautiful with high ceiling chandeliers and marble flooring. I love the fact that you stay at this hotel you are eligible for a discount to ride up the Eiffel Tower; which the view is truly amazing and it is a great opportunity to take some fantastic pictures. When you see the Eiffel tower it is very iconic and it is amazing that they had done such a marvelous job replicating it. 
The gambling here is very not bad the floor is of midsize and it has a more dimmer scenery and has very laid back vibe to the room. I myself love the fact that Gordon Ramsay's Steak house is located in this hotel. I highly recommend looking at my review for Ramsay's Steak house so you can see the menu and some wonderful pictures of the type of food that is available there in addition to their steak specialty. 
So back to walking around the shops, it is just stunning everytime I go there I can't help peeking into some of the shops and the bakery. I hope on my next visit to actually in eat some of the smaller shops that offer sandwiches in which you would find in Paris with the traditional baguette and cheeses.

A good-sized casino with carpet and cobblestone floors (neat, if you're wearing flats or athletic shoes, not so much if you're in heels or boots). It's a fair amount of walking from the garage to the heart of the casino. We saw lots of restaurants and little shops along the way. Busy crowd but not jam-packed when we visited sunday afternoon.

I had my husband sign up for the Total Rewards Card since entry to the Eiffel Tower on my birthday was free (sunday), so was our son (no strollers BTW), and after all the taxes & fees, paid $16.00. Not bad, since two of us were free (it does cost more during the evening). The tickets are in the gift shop. Take the escalator. Then, you take pictures which you can view later on. This was our 1st time there as a family. (The last time was on our 1st date, in 2004.) The elevator was a minute and 17 seconds, according the to the attendant. Nice views during the day, with little rectangular cutouts at certain vistas, so you don't get the fence railing. 

While my husband was in line (was a busy line), we went to the bathroom (there was no visible changing station and the only handicapped bathroom was occupied, so yes, I changed him standing up (but I'm starting to get used to that!)

We booked our room well in advance for one king size bed. When we checked in just after 4:00 PM on a Tuesday afternoon the ""Cranky Lady"" at the front desk almost made me turn away and go to my usual hangout. There were no rooms available at that time with a king bed, when I asked when one will be ready she told me 2 - 3 hours. I asked why and she said ""I don't work in housekeeping so I have no clue why"". At my business that would be an immediate escort to the front door with a loud ""YOU ARE FIRED"" She needs to learn how to smile and treat customers with respect. We took a room with two queens so we did not have to wait.

The room was ""Just OK"" 4 out of 10.  The room, however, smelled strongly of cleaning detergent, the toilet would not stop running and there was mold in the bathroom. This place needs a serious upgrade.

We reached there almost around midnight of the day of booking and found that our room was given away. The management then apologized and gave us the PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. I believe that's what it was called.it was luxurious. Had a master bed with king, a beautiful living space, a royal bathroom as big as the entire suite itself, a great view of the strip, statue of liberty and the bellagio fountains beyond it.

Now I know with all the reviews I've posted about the different restaurants and places I visited while in Vegas it was only a matter of time before I posted a review about where I laid my head while in Vegas. Well YC Paris Las Vegas was the winner for my first time trip.

Okay first I'm going to discuss the check-in process. Now the check-in process was quite smooth, as long as you have the card used to book the hotel and photo Identification. But the thing I didn't care was their $25 plus tax early check-in fee that is applied to the final room charges if you decide to check-in early, which my wife and I did, because we didn't want to be sitting around waiting since we got in earlier than expected. Sigh.

Just so you know they do allow smoking in the casino area. I personally don't have anything against smoking but I just don't like it when my clothes smell like smoke, I hope that Paris gets whatever MGM Grand has because whatever they have you can barely smell smoke in that casino.

Okay now I'm going to discuss the actual room. I was a bit disappointed when I entered our room because since I payed additional money to get the next upgraded room I assumed that our room would be that much better from there standard rooms. However, I mistaken, although the room was quite spacious it honestly didn't feel like much of an upgrade. Also I felt that I was a bit misguided by their website because this upgraded room was suppose to have an all red lips love seat but when I entered the room this thing was brown. Not what I was expecting at all. The decor of the room did match the theme of the hotel (Which by the way is pretty cool. People were taking pictures of the decor of the main casino area because of the Paris decor) but I felt it still needed some sort of mild makeover.

Some of the things I did like were that the rooms were cleaned everyday. Also the maids were quite patient with us being that we would always leave out of the room later than the maids expect so they would always ask us if we would like our room cleaned, and if so how long my wife and I needed to get ourselves together. No matter if it was 30 minutes or 1 hour they would return after that to clean our room. Also the our room itself was in an excellent location because not only was the view of Las Vegas Nevada breathtaking from our room but it is also right across the street from the Ballagio and if you are lucky enough like we were you could see portions of the Ballagio water show from the room. In addition to that I enjoyed that our hotel was connected to Bally's because, that hotel housed two restaurants that I enjoyed visiting and would absolutely visit again when I go back and they are Le Burger and the Tequila Bar.

I think Paris is a decent hotel and I would go back again but I will make an effort to try other hotels before making this the hotel of choice when visiting Vegas.",2,1,1

The room was huge, probably larger than we should have stayed in, but it was fun.

I actually enjoyed coming here with her, especially since I'm kind of tired of coming to Vegas and got to see it with someone who isn't tired of it. Paris is about the right size for one of these theme casinos -- not too large, not too small -- so it's easy to walk around and conveniently located across the street from the Bellagio and their water show for the turistas.

Some of the restaurant choices are kind of weird (outside of the Eiffel Tower restaurant, which really isn't French, there isn't a French restaurant here), but for the most part it's a fun place. 

The coolest part is some of the random music acts they have off the casino -- very classy and elegant for a place that doesn't always have a classy and elegant crowd.",0,0,0

Casino was dark, but the painted ceiling kind of helped make it seem more open. The shops walkway was narrow but interesting. I'm not a fan of people or crowds, and not having any room to navigate through people was very annoying. Wanted to try Le Village Buffet, but it had an hour long wait, even with a reservation.

Check-in was easy if you do it online. I walked right up and got my room keys, meanwhile, everyone else was waiting in the very long line. They looked pissed at me like I cut the line or something. But that's their loss for not researching a bit further to save time.

There is no cable television, the shampoo was latherless and the conditioner wasn't much better. The rooms are on the tiny\/cramped side and the soda machine only took singles.

These may not seem like big issues but when you're nursing a massive hangover and barely alive you need:

A comfy room- to nurse yourself back to ""functional"" 

A satisfying shower - because they always make you feel 90% better.

To stay hydrated- When you can barely make it to the bathroom, going down to Casino Level is not an option. The soda machine by the ice machine is your only hope. When you make the exhausting trek down the hall only to have your $5 bill rejected by said soda machine, well that's just a whole new level of pain.

Entertainment- this is where the TV comes in. You may not THINK you'll spend enough time in your room to care, but you will. When every fiber of your body (including your hair) aches and your bound to your sickbed until your ""second wind"" comes around, entertainment is indispensable.

Now on to my review of the Paris Hotel where we spent two horrid nights this last weekend... 

the down low: 

- dated tube TV with none of the following: Bravo, E, MTV, TLC, and of course no movie channels so no HBO, etc. I settled on CNN most of the weekend... :\/ 

- uncomfortable beds, THIN, scratchy sheets which forced me to wear my jeans to bed as I had only brought some cute little bed short shorts to sleep in.. also, the other reviews which mentioned hairy sheets were correct, I found multiple hairs that were neither mine nor my husbands. :( 

- rubber mat under the bed sheet. no further explanation necessary, this was just plain gross and uncomfortable. 

- thin stretchy bath towels. After I dried off from taking a shower (with super low water pressure I might add!), I had red splotches all over my skin which I still don't know whether was from the heavy duty bleach Paris uses or just because the towels were so rough. Either way, we longed for our own towels at home.. 

- stained carpet, sticky folded complimentary Las Vegas magazine to peruse on the night stand. yuck. and p.s. the Las Vegas mags are free, they can't supply fresh ones for new guests?? 

- horrible toiletries. they smelled gross and felt even worse. the only one I tried was the shower gel which smelled of a sickly baby powder scent and felt very gelatinous on my skin. I think the label red ""white tea""? not even close. 

Needless to say, our hotel experience left us trying to change our flights home one day early. Instead we hightailed it out of there early Sunday morning and got on the earliest flight home.. our original departure was scheduled for Sunday evening.

They still have box TVs as well as pillows that are super hard and pretty gross from years of built-up grime. Seriously, the pillows and beds were my biggest complaint. They were so uncomfortable!!

But the saving grace of this place is its location and price. If all you need is a cheap place that's in the center of it all, then stay here. I paid $75\/night mid-week.

I was in Las Vegas for work this week and my place of work had booked us to stay at Paris 4\/26-4\/29. I had never stayed at this hotel before, but had stopped in on prior trips to Vegas. I had had no issues with this place (or any other hotel in Vegas) before. I had been given a non-smoking room, and so I left my hotel room at 2am on 4\/28 to smoke a cigarette. I went outside by valet and was there only for the amount of time it took me to smoke, 10 minutes tops. I ran into a coworker who was on his way out and talked to him for less than a minute before he hit the strip. I did not converse with anyone else. I went back inside a minute later and headed straight back to my room. When I was making a turn for the elevator, I was stopped by three security guards. The first thing that was said to me was, ""We noticed you were outside for awhile."" I told them I couldn't have been outside for more than 10 minutes. They asked for my ID, which I happily gave to them. Then they asked me my name and if I was staying there. I complied. Then they radioed in, saying, ""We have a woman here. She claims to be staying here."" I am not paraphrasing. They got a response, I can only assume verifying that I was. They still asked which room I was staying in and for proof of my room key. If you're thinking they assumed I was a hooker, you are correct. Not that this SHOULD matter, but I was wearing a pair of converse with a simple skirt and had a completely zipped up hoodie on. Nothing even remotely suggestive about my clothing. I fully recognize that there are a lot of prostitutes working the casinos, but even if they suspected me of that, this could have been handled a lot better and I was upset. I approached the hotel manager, Eric, the next night when I was done with work. He called the head of security, Brian, into it since it was an issue with security. A coworker stood with me throughout this, outraged at how I had been treated. I gave a detailed account of what happened and Brian said he'd review the tapes based on my account. I got an apology from both of them, but not an offer for anything further without my coworker asking. Eric said he would see to it. They both noted my hotel room # and said that they would be in touch with me. Brian never got in touch with me. Eric did, however. I was not in my room when he did, but he left a message saying he thought that Brian had talked to me, and that he wanted to do something for me and if I could not call him back while he was still on shift, that he would leave a note on my room account. I checked out the following afternoon with a woman at the front desk named Arely. I mentioned that Eric had left a note, she went in the back to take care of it. When she returned, she handed me a new bill. I politely asked if she found out what the note was about. She explained that I had been given a $50 credit, but because I had only charged $35 in room service, I was being credited $35. I never raised my voice. I did tell her I knew this wasn't her fault, but I didn't think that was fair. I asked for Eric's business card so I could get in touch with him personally. She returned to the back, returned a minute later saying no, he didn't have a card. Seriously? The manager doesn't have a business card? BS. The head of security handed me a card the night prior. So I asked, ""The only way I can get in touch with him is by calling the front desk and hoping that he's working?"" And she said, ""Yes."" Sweep it under the rug. This place absolutely does not care about how they treat their guests and I will absolutely never be stepping foot into this place again.

We paid for a red room luxury booking, when we checked in they didn't have any available.  When we asked why it wasn't reserved, the concierge rolled her eyes and lectured us on how she's doing her best to accommodate us. Um, that doesn't explain the lack of reservation at all, but great deflection and attempt to make us out to be the problem. At the very least I would expect an apology for not having it, instead of acting like we're unreasonable for expecting our reservation to be reserved. They offered us a downgraded room. When I objected, she said she did have a red room luxury available, but only a smoking room and we booked a non-smoking. I didn't want to get less than what we booked and paid for so I took the smoking room. Her explanation, after trying to get us to take a lower room, was that the smoking vs. non aspect of the reservation isn't guaranteed, only the room type. She didn't even offer us our room type though until I said no to the downgrade and asked for something else.

She also said the room was ready according to the maid service, but when we went up to our room the cleaning staff were still working on it. We had to hang out awkwardly while they were still mopping the bathroom. There were no snacks or drinks stocked though the fridge was wired up for that, and no robes. I wonder if maybe these things were missing because the maid felt hussled out of there by our presence or if these things just aren't included anymore. These are standard niceties that I've had at all my other casino stays even in the lowest room types, so it just felt shabby booking a more expensive nicer-level room and not having any of these things.

I don't know why, but I thought Vegas hotels were more guest oriented .  Bottom line: service and staff SUCKED!  The hotel itself was lovely and I really enjoyed the decor.  The fact that it is done up inside with the cobblestone streets, wrought iron and blue skies were nice.
Location: right in the middle of the Strip across from the Bellagio fountains.  Great!  
The room: Nice.  I had a red room, so a little more modern than the older blue rooms.  The beds were comfy and the bathroom was pretty big with a stand up shower and separate tub.  The AC for some reason didn't make the room all that cool and it didn't have a fridge which would have been nice.  
The worst: my room was next to a house keeping closet, so every morning at 7:30 the banging would start.  The housekeepers would roll out their carts and the door would slam behind them every 2 freakin' minutes!!!!  The second morning I just couldn't take it and asked that something be done.  They gave us another room, but gave us a time limit to get out of our current one and didn't even apologize!  I was shocked. 
The food: not that great for the price.  Actually, it's all pretty much crappy hotel food even in the nicer restaurants.  The steakhouse was eh and the service was awful.  The asian place was also forgettable.  
Nightlife: the club, Risque, also not great, kinda lame.  Much better clubs elsewhere.  The cocktail waitress in the Cabaret was awful.  She did not come to our table once.  She preferred to chat with another staff member over by the bar, so don't even bother going there if you're thirsty.  The hypnotist show was pretty funny though, dirty humor.  
No luck with the gambing.  No wonder most of the machines are deserted.
Shopping: no good shops.  You're better off going to the Miracle Mile at PH next door.
Pool: The pool was kind of small for such a big resort and it was freezing even in August!  The first day, the cocktail service was awesome, but the second day it was non existent practically. Hit or miss.
Spa: AWESOME, but very expensive.
Tower: the wait to go up and get down is ridiculous because the elevators are tiny.  The staff running them has no idea what they are doing.  The view was good though.  Go at sunset or night. 
The Best: the spa therapists are wonderful.  Their hands are magic.  Our first pool cocktail waitress, Nicole, was AWESOME and so sweet.  That girl works hard! The best was the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  Definitely can't be missed.  The view, the food, the service, all was impressive.

However, I do have to give it only three stars simply because the hospitality staff was just not very interested in servicing us it seemed. It was our 20th wedding anniversary and we splurged a bit (for our price range).  We mentioned it to the check in staff  and they were so busy gossiping and talking about themselves to themselves, it was like we were interrupting THEIR conversation and they were on auto pilot ignoring us completely.  Not a great first impression. 

Then, when we signed up for the Total Rewards program, there was an error (which totally happens, we are all human) and when I went the next morning to redeem my promotional $10 because I had played there, the guy behind the counter could absolutely offer no solutions.  He was more interested in who screwed up then how to fix it and in the end, it left a very bad taste in my mouth.  

I point blank asked him, ""So there is no solution you can offer me here?""  Too be honest, I watch Hotel Impossible ALTO and I was mostly just curious on how he would respond because it is nice to give someone the opportunity to keep a customer, but he had no interest at all at finding an option and basically just walked away from us saying no, probably thinking we are not ""Big Fish"" and not worth the effort.  So after that, we just went to other casino's surrounding the hotel. Which, too be honest, were far superior and happy to see us lose our money there. lol  But at least we felt valued there enough to give it to them. Oh, and very FEW cocktail servers around the game machine.  So again, why bother.

All in all, I loved the rooms, the buffet (get the Buffet of Buffet special if you go) and loved the look of the casino area and I will stay there again, but very likely, will just stay and go next store to gamble again.",0,0,0

as far as the valet service goes - the drop off was as easy as any other hotel there. but as paris was a quick stop before the airport for my friend and i... when it came time to get our car it took 18 minutes of standing there waiting and watching everyone come and go but us. when i asked the valet attendant what the hold up was he said ""it's coming. just wait"" unacceptable by my standards. would have been much faster to park my own car.",2,0,0

We arrived around 11pm local time and they didn't have a room available that we paid for. They upgraded us to a suite for no extra charge and we would get our regular room the next day. The suite was amazing. It had a wonderful view of the strip and the fountains at the Bellagio. We were totally exhausted, so it was wonderful that they made that part hassle free.

The regular room was a standard hotel room. The view wasn't as nice, but it was a perfectly good room. 

The pool area was really nice. We went every day we were there. It was a bit surreal to be laying out under the Eiffel Tour, but enjoyable nonetheless. The location of the hotel was ideal for first time travelers. They're right in the middle of the strip. It was great to know that we were in the middle of all the action.

The spa was a different story. I called to make half day appointments for both of us and was told that it would cost $550 for each of us. I thought it was a little on the cheap side, but believed the person I spoke to. Big mistake. When we arrived at the spa, we were charged $550 each and expected to tip each of our technicians. The man at the desk wasn't very helpful either as he wouldn't let us cancel the parts of the day we didn't want. It was unclear if the spa was operated by the hotel or if it was a separate entity, but it definitely left a sour taste in our mouths.

I gave them a 3 overall because of the spa incident. In my opinion, something like that shouldn't happen at a hotel that claims to be so high end. If it does, then the staff should try and remedy the situation rather than being stubborn and unhelpful.",0,0,0

The location on the Strip is excellent - right in the middle of everything! The restaurants within the Paris are great too - Mon Ami Gabi, the Paris buffet, etc. Paris is also connected directly to Bally's which is very convenient. No need to go outside!

The pool area is pretty big and offers a great view of the strip. Waitresses are abundant, the pool is clean, there are sunny and shay area, and the towel service is very nice.

The gym\/spa at the Paris is pretty nice. The reviews for it on here are bad but when I checked it out for myself, I thought it was fine. See my separate review for that.

Other nice points where that they offer express check out (no need to wait in the long lines twice) and they give you the option of billing most things within the hotel to your room (gym, spa, etc). The only somewhat bad thing is that the WiFi is for a fee which is crappy.

Extremely crowded, their buffet is running some specials, so that makes the hallway always pack, it's poor design to have to travel through the main path between registration and guest elevator.  Should have taken a picture of their buffet line, it's worst then DMV.  

Room is old, although non-smoking, but i can still smell cigarettes everywhere.  Shower is weak, tub and sink looked very used, and some tiles have cracks.  

$29 bucks resort fee does not include coffee was the first in my experience, spotty wifi, and it's winter so the pool is useless.  I'll just chuck that $32 (with tax) into my room rate.  No wonder it was so cheap during Christmas week, total average about $100 a night.  Good thing I made some money from their tables.  

Only thing going for Paris is the location.  Then again, if it's not because it's across from Bellagio, I'd have stayed at the north end of the strip.

Our room was beautiful, clean, and comfortable and the bathroom was huge. The hotel's pool is an excellent way to stay cool during those dreadful hot days.

The entrance is always full of people crossing but so is Bellagio and Mirage, the valet area was taking forever to park my car but that was no biggie. Checking in took  20 minutes but the front desk woman was very friendly checking me in and told me the pool was open 24 \/ 7 but I should be cautious because of no lifeguards being on duty. That was a plus for the pool being open 24 \/ 7 but the weather was too cold to go night swimming. 

Casino wasn't as stuffy and was pretty clean to me. My room was very clean and updated with the flat screen TV and the mini fridge was a huge plus, so no need to bring coolers to Paris unless you have lots of food and drink to bring. It beats going back and forth for ice. The room was clean and has a French contemporary design and is not to shabby for a basic comp room and your hardly in your room unless you're here for work and no play.  :o

The view from the Eiffel Tower room is awesome. The hotel is centrally located on the strip. The amenities such as the restaurants in the hotel are quite good.  And finally, the room is semi-clean.

Now for the not so good things. When we arrived, the valet placed us in the center of traffic in the middle lane so my elderly mother could not exit from her car without risking her life.

we waited in line to check in for an hour. When we checked in they told us that they couldn't give us our rooms because we were in early by an hour. They said however, the rooms are ready and if we would like to check in early that would be a $25 up charge per room.we chose to have lunch and then return back. When we returned back, at the designated time that they told us, they then indicated only one room is ready (despite having told us that both rooms already previously). The wait to pick up the keys alone was 30 minutes.

We got to our room and the room was not fully clean. In the words of my wife, the room was not maintained well. We had other people's personal belongings and mango juices left in our room, the stains were on the carpet. PS the safe didn't work.

Customer service from the hotel staff was abysmal. It's as if they don't care that you are coming as a guest and they use the word guest as a mandatory requirement. Nothing about my stay with Paris made me feel like I was a guest.

By the way, they charge a large resort fee and that resort fee enables you access to Wi-Fi and the gym in the pool.   

I asked to see if I can have my boarding passes printed, and they indicated that they couldn't do that I could try in the business center and that that would be a cost for doing so.

The breakfast restaurant floor was very sticky and did not get cleaned even after we commented about it. It was as if syrup had been spilled on the floor and nobody decided to clean it up. When my father asked for it to be cleaned up, the staff was very rude about it.

My suspicion as to how they get away with it in Las Vegas is as follows: one it's center strip; 2. beds are clean; and three there's just so much volume that they just don't care.",9,1,0

The check-in process was not fun. Long lines, and they appeared to be testing a ""self-check in"" system, which was causing more confusion than helping.
Our room on the 24th floor had a good view of the strip and other hotels. Not a huge room, but large enough to be comfortable. I liked that our room had a separate tub and large shower. The bed was comfortable, and the room was very quiet (didn't hear the neighbors).
One advantage to being at Paris is the location. It is situated well in the middle of the major action, and also the tram station is right out the back door. When I say the back door, I mean it will still take you 10 minutes to get there. Remember the size of these hotels these days. . . But, the tram will take you all the way to the end of the strip North (Wynn, Encore, etc.).

THE FRONT DESK EXPERIENCE
--------------------------------------------
The beginning of the experience upon checking in was horrible to begin with. The front desk agent, Ms. Youngmi has inexistent customer service skills and should not be working in the hospitality industry. She was very condescending and never even bothered to make me feel welcomed in the hotel. 

I booked my room through Expedia, but through her own ineptitude she cannot locate my reservation. She gave me an attitude and insisted that the confirmation numbers that I have from Expedia doesn't mean anything on their computer system. She never made any effort to assist me at all even if I'm showing her the email confirmation from Expedia and the Expedia app on the phone. When I had requested if I can be helped by someone else, she said in a very rude tone -- ""If I cannot find your reservation, I'm sure they cannot. Go ahead go back in line and have someone else assist you!"" 

I've never been treated this way in a hotel before. I was so upset that I took her picture so that I can later complain about her. Note that I wouldn't take her picture at all if she wasn't rude to me in the first place. When she saw me do this, she insisted that I erase her picture on my phone and that she would call security if I didn't. I was standing back in line at this point and she was making a scene and everyone was looking at us. I don't like the attention especially if I have not done anything wrong. I didn't delete her picture and she went back inside and threatened to call security.

Eventually I was assisted by a more competent front desk agent who was able to pull up my reservation. Ms. Youngmi later came out with the Front Desk Manager On-Duty, Mr. Robert Leach who apologized for her agent's behavior.

However, check out this other Yelp review: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/paris-las-vegas-las-vegas-3#hrid:O_S76rqTGdsZpc20dPVkrQ Apparently it's for the same front desk agent, Ms. Youngmi. And this review was from last year. So maybe there is a pattern of behavior for this agent and it's not being addressed by the hotel.

--------------------------------------------
THE ROOM
--------------------------------------------
For the price, the room doesn't measure up to Aria, The Cosmopolitan, MGM, or Bellagio -- which are probably the same price range or only slightly more expensive. But the amenities those other hotels offer make up for the price difference. The Paris Las Vegas doesn't really offer anything special... except maybe for the view, which you could also get from The Cosmopolitan or Bellagio. 

Everything in the room looks dated and worn. The glasses in the bathroom even had a lipstick mark and a crack. This is considering that the room that I got was supposedly a high floor corner suite after I paid $40 to be upgraded to it (yeah I know after the horrible front desk experience I still had to pay for this). This non-smoking room also smelled of cigarette smoke all night. Good thing they took out the resort fee after I complained about this.

--------------------------------------------
BOTTOM LINE
--------------------------------------------
Avoid this hotel. You can get a better room from another hotel for a similar price (or maybe just slightly higher), but the higher price difference is certainly worth it. I'm just not nitpicking on the room because of my horrible front desk experience. But that experience certainly made me dislike this hotel with a passion.

I had the ""Luxury"" room, which is the lowest on their scale (it was a free comp stay). The room was much larger than I expected, especially the bathroom. Real nice bathroom with a separate tub and shower.  It might be a little dated, with the old school tube TVs, but for the price and location you won't get much better. If you need a very nice, newer room with all the little extras you won't enjoy this, but if you just want a room similar to a Holiday-Inn right in the middle of the strip, you won't regret this choice.  The check-in lines can be long. I arrived on a Monday at 2pm and it took around 30 minutes to get the keys in my hand. Room service is a plus, not terribly expensive and it was always quite prompt. The servers were always very pleasant and made sure we had everything we needed.  The restaurants are decent, but I found if you walked the Paris street on over to Bally's (attached to Paris) and take a right, past the Bally's casino bar, you will find a sweet mexican food joint called Tequila Bar & Grille. It's great for late night snacks for sure!",0,0,0

It was my first time here and I picked it solely on looks, call me vain, and because we planned on purchasing a buffet wrist band ( more info to follow in the Le Village Review). Although I booked the room, I can't in the slightest remember the price. We stayed mid seek (check in Wednesday - check out Friday) with a AAA discount; maybe $250-300? The room more than adequate and I loved its short walk to the garage, reception desk, and buffet line. When passing through the gambling floor there was relatively little to no smoke, a biggie for someone who wears contacts.
We selected the luxury two queens non smoking. It came with two queen beds, of course, flat screen TV, dresser\/closet and a large bathroom (a necessity with 3 women staying in the room). The beds were comfy and the sheets warm without being rough on your skin. The TV was placed on the left side of the room, next to the window, but it wasn't difficult to watch from the right side bed. The bathroom was something I wish I could have at home. It was warm, light amber marble through out with a his + hers sink, a separate jacuzzi tub and shower. The commode was placed behind a quarter wall so there was some privacy but not if someone showering. Heads up if you have bad balance, the marble becomes slick from the shower. I thought it was just me but everyone had this issue even when we turned the shower head to the far wall. Slip hazard!! We went through two bath mats each day while bathing. Paris needs to better seal the bottom of these shower doors. 
We made the mistake of ordering Wi Fi for $15 thinking everyone could use it. Wrong. The Wi Fi is only good for ONE DEVICE. Want to add another? That will be another $15, uh no thanks. Unless you are here for work you don't need it and even then I doubt you want to be working after hours in the city of sin.

Stayed here back in January 2006 during a vacation with my co-workers, courtesy of the VP at my office.  That was over five years ago, but I do recall that my hotel room (standard, two queens) was kind of disappointing.  I had expected more from a hotel with a French theme and a construction cost of $785 million.  It reminded me of  a typical room in Downtown LV, but with a much heftier price tag.  TBH, I'm glad I didn't have to use any of my own money to stay here - but I still felt bad for my boss.

Despite this, my roommate and I (both non-gamblers) enjoyed doing a walkabout of the property and its various decor.  We didn't eat any of our meals here but I did discover the tiramisu (with an edible chocolate bowl) at one of the cafes.  I enjoyed it so much that, during my last LV trip earlier this year, I visited (but not stayed at) Paris once again to eat it again.

I have visited the Paris casino several times, but have not stayed in the hotel yet!  Definitely planning on it for my next visit back to Vegas :)  I have enjoyed gambling in the casino, dining\/eating, and shopping here.  They have tons of Paris memorabilia, Eiffel Tower souvenirs, Tshirts, and more cute stuff in the gift shops.  I have been to Paris, France, but there is something so cool about Paris Vegas, probably because it's in the United States and everyone speaks English, plus it's so exciting and all kinds of tourists everywhere on the Strip day or night!  It's in a GREAT location, right across from the Bellagio Water Fountains.

My #1 FAVORITE place is Mon Ami Gabi, I am sure I could eat here everyday of my vacation and not get tired of it!  I loved my Breakfast experience at this restaurant which has an awesome outdoor patio.  I recommend going up to the Paris Eiffel Tower.  It's smaller than the real Eiffel in France, so why not check it out in the evening, but be prepared to stand in line for awhile.  I think there is a fee, don't remember how much it costs?  I went to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant several years ago and had a wonderful Romantic dinner experience, but back then I wasn't on Yelp :(  Definitely would return again and I recommend making reservations in advance at any fine dining restaurant in Vegas, since it is constantly busy everywhere on the Strip!  Recently I went to Hexx Chocolate & Confexxions, I tried my first ""chocolate tasting"", very cool experience and you can see the people making the chocolates right in front of you.  They sell desserts, drinks, gelato, Vegas stuff, it's a neat shop to visit!  Right next to it is Hexx Kitchen Bar, it's two separate places with separate entrances.

Can't wait to plan my next Vegas trip, stay at Paris, and have fun being a tourist!  I never get tired of the Vegas excitement, there's so much to do and see, always enjoy my vacations here :)  Just try not to gamble all your money in the casinos ha ha!

I wanted to find out if the hotel provided fee wifi in the room. Because I couldn't find any information online, I had to call up the hotel. They told me that the rate was $14.95 per day (24 hours). 
When I checked into the hotel, my husband used wifi on his PS Vita and I used wifi on my iPad. We were staying for one night. I was assuming that we would only be charged $14.95 for wifi because that was what I was told over the phone. When it was time for me to check-out, I found out that they charged me TWICE for wifi! I went to the front desk in person to dispute the charges. The receptionist told me that wifi was $14.95 PER day PER apparatus. I thought that it was very misleading. I told them that I was told over the phone that it was just $14.95 per day, and we only stayed one night. No one made any mention to me that it was $14.95 per day per apparatus. The receptionist kept insisting that their policy was $14.95 per day per apparatus. I made it clear that this type of information could not be found anywhere online and not even when I inquired over the phone. I even told her that the LAX Marriott only charged one flat fee per day regardless of how many apparatuses you use. The receptionist told me that Paris Hotel was part of a different company (which was Harrah's) which I thought was a lame excuse. It was clear that they treated their customers worse here than Marriott. Way to go. I concluded that this was their cheap way to make a quick buck off a customer which was very unfair. 
Word of advice to all hotel owners: NEVER punish your most loyal customers unless you NEVER want them to come back.
By then I was very upset of having to pay another $14.95. I was starving and was planning to eat at Paris Buffet. But because of what just happened, my husband and I decided to eat at Wicked Spoon instead. We will NOT bringing back our business to Paris Hotel ever again!

I will say that the conference staff is fantastic - very professional, eager to help, and obviously focused on giving you a great experience.  Our conference went very well - the banquet rooms are beautiful and while borderline gaudy, it is Vegas after all.

The food is quite good.  I'm a big fan of French food, and while of course this wasn't exactly authentic French, the catered food was great.  The crepe shop was always packed, but I managed to get one during my stay - packed with Nutella and powdered sugar - and it was spectacular.

The accomodations are very nice.  Rooms fan out in 4 hallways like a cross.  My room was a double (stayed in by myself - thank you company credit card) and it was a lovely room.  I got a good view of the mountains in the distance.  The bathrooms are beautiful - separate bath and shower, and all marble countertops.

Now it looks and feels like a really cheesy version of what a Midwesterner who never left home imagines France to look like. 

The crowd here is an older set, so if you are young you're SOL. However, I doubt a bunch of rowdy party going twenty somethings are really going to be interested in staying here. It's kind of a downer and it's not really much fun.

The rooms are really boring (read: everything is totally basic) and I've been to Holiday Inns that felt newer and fresher. Nothing here felt Parisian. In fact, it looked oddly similar to a room in an Embassy Suites I used to go to often. Same boring neutrals, basic layout of the room. No frills whatsoever. The carpet is visibly worn in some areas and both in room and in the halls the wallpaper was torn or peeling. 

The beds were borderline awful. The mattresses were obviously cheap and old. Not only were they thin, the bed itself squeaked whenever you turned over or moved. The pillows were lumpy. Underneath the beds there was trash from a few other customers--I counted 4 discarded water\/soda bottles and some wrappers (not condoms) and a few clothing tags. The staff obviously just don't clean that well, because these were not our items. The linens were cheap and the blanket was probably standard issue in a prison before it came to Las Vegas.

The internet here is way too expensive and they make sure you pay for it wherever you are--you pay depending on in room or all over their structure and either by day or hour. No thanks. 

The bathroom was a little nicer than a run of the mill hotel bathroom, but the amenities were chintzy. There was no fan in the bathroom which is a big NO-NO for me. 

The staff were average to friendly and service was quick when we did need something. 

The cafe downstairs is incredibly overpriced. For one person to eat a sandwich and a soda is $20 without tip. Sorry, that's ridiculous for Vegas. Sugar Factory is downstairs in the main gaming area, and it usually gets crowded, their store is fun, whimsical and colorful. 

I saw Jersey Boys here on my trip, which was a treat and it was enjoyable. The theater is pretty small considering, and cheap seats will still get you a good view. However, it doesn't sell out as they tell you. There was an entire row of seats completely empty in front of us and all around as well. The shop for Jersey Boys was pricey, and nothing was under $10 (as in $10 for a magnet).

The rooms are cheap, but in this instance, you're getting what you pay for. Consider spending a little more and stay somewhere with more oomph. I know I will next time I go to Vegas.

When I asked the concierge what to do, she quickly gave us a new and better room, with no apparent insects. Although both rooms were nice, they hotel needs some work. The furniture in both rooms was chipped, the carpet in the first room looked soiled. Since the public areas are so nice, this was a surprise.

I've stayed at Paris years ago and remember it being a much cleaner than it is now. I stayed recently over the weekend and the hotel room was pretty disgusting. There was hair on the floor, the sink was backed up, and the shower was dingy and dirty, one of the beds had very small dark spots\/stains on the sheets as well. Also, the beds were very uncomfortable and worn out!

Other items:

Food - The food is ok, nothing to write home about. Their buffet is probably their saving grace but it does not stack up against the newer places like Wicked Spoon and Caesar's. 
Casino - Didn't spend too much but they have at least all the basic tables and slots, but it is much smaller than other places
Entertainment - Did not watch anything this time so I can't comment
Pool - Didn't go into it but it's incredibly small compared to other places

Upon walking into Paris from the parking garage, the air is smokey and it was hard to breathe. If you have asthma, stay away from here!

The casino was nice and small. Lots of cute shops, pizzerias, bakeries. Cobble stone floors and the decor transforms you to Paris. One thing I did not like was the casino, it was small, full of smog and the slots robbed you. Didn't win a single dime here. If you want to win big, there's a long walkway from Paris, past the parking garage and into Ballys (:

Tried the $20 dollar sandwich after Christmas 2011 and it didn't work. Primarily because 1) it was the holidays and 2) we arrived at 6pm. Asked politely if we could have an upgrade from a Red Room Luxury to a Red Room Premier, but the receptionist said it would be a $40 upgrade. So we took whatever rooms were left.  We were given a Red Room Luxury in the 28th floor, Room 48 & 46. It was alll the way down the hall. Room 48 was tricky because you see two doors: 2848 & 2848P. Don't get your hopes up when you think your room is the Petite suite\/Corner room with two windows. I did. Had to double check which room was correct. Room 2848 was smaller, with two queen sized beds. Room 2846 was larger, still with two queen sized beds. Everything was red! Rooms had a large flat screen. The beds were sooo comfy, but the pillows were flat. The tub was not large enough to be a soaking tub, as advertised on the website. However, the separate shower was sufficient. Rooms comes with complementary coffee with the coffee maker of course. Refrigerator was hidden under the television. Glad it was not filled with beverages that you had to pay for if touched. Kept the Bouchon Bakery macaroons and drinks there. 

WiFi was not free in the rooms. WiFi was an additional $15\/day. It was only free in one of the bakeries downstairs.

Whoever designed this hotel did a great job in recreating a Parisian atmosphere. I loved the color scheme in my room so much that I am adopting it for my new apartment when I move later this year! I stayed for two nights last week while attending WWD Magic. The staff were very helpful and accommodating. I got room service for lunch and dessert the first night I was there and was pretty impressed with the quality of the food. And, I loved, loved, LOVED the Sugar Factory. Even if you don't stay in the hotel, you must make a stop there while you're walking down the strip. The casino area isn't as big as some of the other hotels I've visited (e.g.: MGM Grand, Bellagio, Caesar's...but I don't think anybody's is as big as they are!). Chateau is a pretty nice nightclub, I really liked the outdoor area (the beer garden). If it wasn't so hot when I was there, I would've hung out there a lot longer! The thing I appreciated the most was the price. Considering that it's across the street from The Cosmopolitan and The Bellagio, you'd think it would be expensive. That's totally not the case!

I maintain a higher level of casino play here, to where I get free rooms, free food, and other comps that some people may not get.

According to Caesars Entertainment, the people who own Paris,  the hotel Paris is considered more upscale than the other properties ( Flamingo, Ballys, Rio, Quad, Planet Hollywood, Harrahs) with the exception of Caesars Palace...  Yet, the past 2 times I've stayed at this property as a ""comp"" I get treated more shabby than the other properties.  Their front desk people who work the Platinum desk must be the punished ones... they don't get the Diamond \/ 7Stars desk, so they're demoted to help low rollers like me.

3 months ago, when I called to booked my room, I was transferred to a special VIP Marketing Department to take care of my free room.  WIth the 2 nights free room I also received free money to play on the slots.  The person booked me the ""Red Luxury"" room and told me that I'd be getting one of the nicer rooms in the HIGHER floors of the hotel.  He kept gushing how much fun I would be having.  

Fast forward to the arrival date.

When I arrived to check in,  this older lady who couldn't even smile asked me a string of questions like ""smoking?"" ""King or queen?"" which I replied Non Smoking, King, and a higher room with a view please.  She replied ""Of course"", and then promptly tried to give me the FIFTH floor, smoking.  WTF!?!   

5th floor is only 1 story higher than the ground level.  It wasn't a view of the pool, it was the pool!

I handed her back the key and said I'd like a higher room, please, non smoking, and with a view.  I also asked her if it was a Red Room and she replied ""No, its a request only, and  comp rooms are only by request.  So, you got a classic room"".  

Come on, you couldn't even LOOK to see if I could get a nicer room?  

Apparently anything I said, she gave me the opposite.  If I said blue, she'd say green.   I told her that I'd wait for a nicer room, and she said come back at 4.

The Classic room was ""Just OK"".  It was on the 12th floor (Room 1223) and it did face the Paris ball, overlooking the pool.  The room, however, smelled strongly of cleaning detergent, like they just shampooed it.  For a free room, it did the job.

I get it that I got the room for free, but I didn't like how the front desk treated me, like I don't deserve VIP treatment.  I dump a lot of money at their property (and it shows, since I'm bombarded by free offers every single week!) and yet Paris is the worse hotel when it comes to front desk courtesy.

In December I was in Flamingo, and they gave me a stunning 24th floor room with a magnificent view.  The rooms were actually nicer than the ""Classic"" Paris room I got, and location on the Strip was just as nice.  Even Ballys once gave me a corner suite, and I didn't even ask to be upgraded.

What gives, Paris?? Is recycling $20K not enough?  I guess not.",6,3,1

The room was stylish and clean, though a bit run down in places...but that's why there are currently renovations going on.  The bed was comfy and it was dead quiet every night, which is really important for someone (like me) who has trouble sleeping to begin with.  It is a standard room, so it is small, but still bigger than the standard room I had at Harrah's LV last year.  The shower was good: water pressure fairly strong and got hot right away.

The casino is very in keeping with the ""French"" theme, lots of nice details and plenty of photo opportunities.  Unfortunately, like most strip casinos anymore, the slots are very tight.  I played here every day during my visit and A LOT of $$$$ got sucked up much to easily.  My only other complaint about the casino is that is entirely too dark.  I know this is intentional to set a ""mood,"" but someone needs to up the wattage on the light bulbs a bit.

I ate at Le Village Buffet here for breakfast and lunch.  The breakfast buffet is adequate (can't do too much damage to eggs, bacon and sausage), but lunch was kinda meager and disappointing.  The Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood has a MUCH better selection and quality of food presentation for the same price range.

The biggest negative here is the Diamond Club.  Service is great here, but the selection of food...oh, forget it, there is no selection!  Hot dogs and tortilla chips??  Harrah's in Atlantic City always offers several dishes, pizza, cheeses, meats and a good selection of desserts.  And it's Atlantic City for goodness sake!

Anyway...I have to give the overall service here a solid ""A.""  From the moment my friend and I arrived, to check-in, to ordering drinks, dining, room service and housekeeping, we felt so welcome.  Not something I'm used to at a Caesar's-run property.

Went there last month and again this past weekend and that's enough.  First let me say that the staff is as friendly and welcoming as they can be and it's rather the disrepair of the facilities and poor managing of room inventory that are the issues.  For each visit, despite paying in advance we did not get the room we reserved either time.  Neither did any of the other individuals in our party.  And yes, we booked through their site, not a third party discount site.  In fact in chatting with other guests at the bars and tables, it's clear they have a problem managing inventory as the frustration is a common topic of conversation in the casino.  I understand they can't guarantee every room upon booking, that's common.  But when check in is at 3pm and one arrives at 4pm, to be told they have no rooms available that night matching the type we reserved, speaks to poor management, especially when it seems to be a common practice.  They invite you to attempt to move rooms the next day which is likely why they can't ever seem to be caught up on availability.  Even this they can't get right as we were told we would have to be available in a three our block to wait for a room to become available and move our things.  I've traveled all over the world and this is the first time I've encountered a refusal of bell staff to move your luggage when the room I reserved was not available on the first night.  One guest services person we spoke with told us you can call 72 hours in advance to guarantee your room type but when we checked in we were told that wasn't actually true so we were at a loss there.  The gentlemen who checked us in, when pressed on why online check-in didn't hold our room casually commented the system ""means nothing, I'm not sure why we have it.""  Well done reservations management!  This however isn't nearly as frustrating as the state of the rooms.  Last month our room had dirty sheets, thin\/worn towels that had been used far too many times, and a funny smell.  This however wasn't nearly as bad as the leaky shower, leaky sink, and leaky toilet which caused water to pool on the bathroom floor any time any of these were in use.  My wife made the rather terrifying point that the towels are probably so worn from people using them to mop up the leaky toilets.  They indicate on their reservation system that some rooms have been remodeled so we decided to give them one more try and book one of those rooms for our trip this month.  SEE THE ABOVE ISSUE.  Someone needs to tell their marketing team that by publicizing newly renovated rooms which can't be guaranteed, that they are emphasizing the disrepair of the old rooms when you can't get the new room you thought you had booked!  On this most recent trip the safe was broken, the mini bar had been emptied and appeared to have been cracked or broken open, the bed head boards were so warn down that the stuffing was coming out of the covering, and once again the towels were awful.  I suppose at least this time the toilet and shower didn't leak.  Also, and I appreciate this is nitpicking, but the coffee bar in the casino was ""out of large cups"" on both visits.  On two weekends, a month apart, they ran out of cups by Friday.  This tells me either this is once again poor management or that they eliminated the ""large"" size due to profit margin and don't want to update their menu boards.  They want me to stick around and gamble but can't make even the tiniest investments to appropriately serve their customers.

1 star for the location - proximity was close to everything\/everywhere that my friends and I wanted to go. 

1 star for the cleanliness - although the room itself was a bit out dated, the size of the room was more than enough for 4 people.

1 star for the restaurants\/shops inside of the hotel - extremely convenient for breakfast\/coffee.

Lastly, 1 star for the pool! If you don't want to spend money going to a day club, I would say that the pool here has a great ambiance\/music.

Checking-In was easy, and checking-out was a breeze. The view from our room was spectacular! Not only were we able to see the Eiffel tower, but also the water show in front of the Bellagio Hotel. I would recommend this place!",1,0,0

From the awful customer service to cleanliness to things being broken, it ruined my vacation and my best friends. The room was dirty upon arriving, our keys didn't work and the ice machines didn't work. Our water in the shower and sink was freezing and we called the front desk with no help, so We had to take cold showers for 2 days,  We received 6 wake up calls at 7am the first morning and 4 wake up calls the next day at 5am... none of which we asked for or ordered. This woke us up early and we weren't able to enjoy our stay and sleep in. The disrespect we received from each employee was unbelievable, they were so rude and didn't help with anything we were having problems with. The housekeeper saw us leave our room to go get ice... which was broken so we couldn't even get any ice .......and when we got back to our room our door wouldn't open and she said she wouldn't let us in even though she saw we had just came out of the room...
Security finally came 30 minutes later to say that our battery was dying to the key thing and we had to wait over an hour to get new keys. And no, we did not have our keys next to our cell phones where they might have been deactivated.
When we first checked in, the front desk associate automatically charged my card for the parking fee for 3 days without asking me and my friend was going to pay for that at the stand alone stations outside the parking garage, so thanks to him he charged my card without my consent when i wasnt even the one who was going to pay for the parking. The concierge was rude and smirkey when I asked about the Buffett, which we didn't end up going to because of the 100s of negative reviews towards it.
The beds were hard as a rock and cheese it crackers surrounded the beds which we noticed when we first got there.  We ended up leaving and staying at the flamingo for the rest of our vacation instead of extending another day at the paris hotel because of how rediculous the hotel and staff were. On our way out, my parking ticket wouldn't work and it was asking me to pay for the days again even though it clearly shows on my receipt that the front desk charged me (without my consent). After holding up the parking garage line, someone finally helped and opened the gate for us to leave. 
From the dirty room, to the cold water and broken key lock, the extremely rude workers, 5am wake up calls and everything else on top of that, I can say without a doubt this was the worst vacation I have ever had. Which is really unfortunate because my friend and I have been so excited to finally stay at the Paris hotel with high expectations. We have stayed at the mirage, the flamingo, Venetian, Excalibur, Mandalay bay, planet Hollywood, desert resort inn, circus circus, treasure island, new York, new York, and luxor, and this was by far the worst experience we have ever had. This is sad to say I would prefer going to circus circus or Excalibur over the Paris hotel, ever again. When we called the front for help with any of our issues we were constantly put on hold with no resolutions. The lines downstairs were so long to speak to someone to voice our concerns so I am doing it here. I would very much appreciate a manager to contact me, as I have also emailed the hotel to contact me, since they don't seem to have a complaint section. I have never made a negative review, nor thought it was necessary before. However this was the worst hotel i have ever stayed at. I have never felt more disrespected and the lack of service and kindness was not what we wanted for our summer vacation. 
Do not stay at the Paris hotel unless you want to ruin your vacation and waste your money.",4,1,2

I came here for work to attend the MINExpo at the Convention Center and was having trouble checking in because my name on my DL (my legal name) didn't match the name that the room was under (my nickname).

She was completely rude and condescending. She told me that her manager told her to call the lady organizing the MINExpo to verify that my name is indeed such and such.

I have no idea what the organizers of the MINExpo have anything to do with verifying my legal name. And I'm pretty sure it is not one ""lady"" organizing an event of this size -- 1,800 exhibitors and 45,000 attendees and you think one lady is going to have my name on a list?

She told me that she called the lady at the MINExpo and she was out to lunch. It's 2pm. Really? She's out to lunch? 

Had she been smart, she would have said I need to call the government to verify your name. Oh, I'm sorry the whole government is out to lunch.

I asked her, ""Why do you need to call the lady organizing the MINExpo to verify my name?"" and she says, ""You don't understand what I'm saying?"" NO I don't understand what you are saying because your excuse to not check me in makes absolutely no sense.

I asked her for the hotel number and this is the number she gave me 712-946-7000. She watched me write down the number and she looked at the paper when I asked her ""Is this the number"" and she nodded saying yes. Come on now this isn't a misunderstanding! Youngmi is giving me completely INCORRECT information for the hotel!!! The Paris Hotel wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for a shitty employee named YOUNGMI.
  
So Youngmi tells me because the lady at the MINExpo is out to lunch its going to take awhile to verify me name and she adds, ""I highly suggest you check in your baggage and come back in a couple of hours.""

Instead, I decided to stand there and make the situation awkward by lingering in front of her and made a mental note of her name YOUNGMI for writing reviews like this.  
 
Anyway the lady that helped me check-in once the name on the hotel reservation was changed, was completely polite and courteous. Until they decide to fire Youngmi I wouldn't recommend booking a room at the Paris Hotel.",3,0,0

If you are a fan of buffets I highly suggest the buffet at Paris hotel. It's a little pricey, but the food quality is great. It has a Euro\/ French theme. Here are a few items I liked: 
 1. Crepe bar. (made to your liking)
 2. Champagne served 
 3. Tons of shrimp and crab
 4. Ham, prime rib, roast lamb
 5. Good cheese selection
 6. excellent desserts

One older woman with the name of Jenny with horrible etiquette ""helped"" us but she had the WORST customer service. 
I only left this place one star because I have to but I definitely don't recommend this place .

My girlfriend and I unloaded everything off our backs and went down to play some games. We heard an alarm going off in the hall so we quickly went into our room. The alarm clock was going off for no reason so I turned it off. When we came back our suitcases were unpacked and we never opened them. The television was turned back on. My girlfriend was freaked out and did NOT want to stay in that room. The room felt eerie as if someone was watching us and it was cold. Our room was the color red as well, not sure if other were? When I went to call the front desk there was a note next to the phone and said, "" Enjoy your stay, God bless :)."" Okay, that freaked me out big time! ""God bless?"" Why would they say that not knowing the persons religion and a happy face? I'm religious but still...creepy. We went down and told the front desk about everything and they just laughed kind of knowing that it was haunted which I didn't like.

Checked in late on Friday night and the non-smoking room we requested was given away so we had to settle with a smoking room. They told us to come to the front desk between 12-3pm the following day to change rooms since they gave our room away so we agreed. 

Next day rolls around and after a great time at the pool and gym we called and they kept pushing back the time on when the room would be ready. We wasted 5 hours of our day not being able to leave and waiting for our non smoking room to be available. For someone who comes for the weekend and hours are limited it really sucks to waste time. Finally they gave us a non smoking room after complaining for 5 hours and sounding upset. It was a big disappointment. I'm giving three stars because that was an awful experience but the hotel itself wasn't too bad. The room we got upgraded and it was really nice.
